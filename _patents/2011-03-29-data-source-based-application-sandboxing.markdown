The communication device may communicate with other devices over a wireless communication system or enterprise system as illustrated in . The communication device  may be a mobile device with two-way communication and advanced data communication capabilities including the capability to communicate with other mobile devices or computer systems through a network of transceiver stations. The communication device  can also have voice communication capabilities.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","100","104","100","103"]},"The communication subsystem  receives messages from and sends messages to a wireless network . In this exemplary embodiment of the communication device , the communication subsystem  is configured in accordance with one or more of Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) standards, Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS). New standards are still being defined, but it is believed that they will have similarities to the network behavior described herein, and it will also be understood by persons skilled in the art that the embodiments described herein are intended to use any other suitable standards that are developed in the future. The wireless link connecting the communication subsystem  with the wireless network  represents one or more different Radio Frequency (RF) channels, operating according to defined protocols specified for GSM, GPRS, EDGE, or UMTS, and optionally other network communications. With newer network protocols, these channels are capable of supporting both circuit switched voice communications and packet switched data communications.","Other wireless networks can also be associated with the communication device  in variant implementations. The different types of wireless networks that can be employed include, for example, data-centric wireless networks, voice-centric wireless networks, and dual-mode networks that can support both voice and data communications over the same physical base stations. Combined dual-mode networks include, but are not limited to, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) or CDMA2000 networks, GSM\/GPRS networks, third-generation (3G) networks like EDGE, HSPA, HSPA+, EVDO and UMTS, or fourth-generation (4G) networks such as LTE and LTE Advanced. Some other examples of data-centric networks include WiFi 802.11\u2122, Mobitex\u2122 and DataTAC\u2122 network communication systems. Examples of other voice-centric data networks include Personal Communication Systems (PCS) networks like GSM and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems. The mobile device  may be provided with additional communication subsystems, such as the wireless LAN (WLAN) communication subsystem  also shown in . The WLAN communication subsystem may operate in accordance with a known network protocol such as one or more of the 802.11\u2122 family of standards developed by IEEE. The communication subsystem  may be separate from, or integrated with, the communication subsystem  or with the short-range communications module . The main processor  also interacts with additional subsystems such as a Random Access Memory (RAM) , a flash memory , a display , an auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystem , a data port , a keyboard , a speaker , a microphone , the short-range communications  and other device subsystems . The communication device may also be provided with an accelerometer , which may be used to detect gravity- or motion-induced forces and their direction. Detection of such forces applied to the device  may be processed to determine a response of the device , such as an orientation of a graphical user interface displayed on the display assembly  in response to a determination of the current orientation of which the device .","Some of the subsystems of the communication device  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems can provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions. By way of example, the display  and the keyboard  can be used for both communication-related functions, such as entering a text message for transmission over the network , and device-resident functions such as a calculator or task list.","A rendering circuit  is included in the device . When a user specifies that a data file is to be viewed on the display , the rendering circuit  analyzes and processes the data file for visualization on the display . Rendering data files originally optimized or prepared for visualization on large-screen displays on a portable electronic device display often requires additional processing prior to visualization on the small-screen portable electronic device displays. This additional processing may be accomplished by the rendering engine . As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, the rendering engine can be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof, and can comprise a dedicated image processor and associated circuitry, or can be implemented within main processor .","The communication device  can send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Network access is associated with a subscriber or user of the communication device . To identify a subscriber, the communication device  requires a SIM\/RUIM card  (i.e. Subscriber Identity Module or a Removable User Identity Module) or another suitable identity module to be inserted into a SIM\/RUIM interface  in order to communicate with a network. The SIM\/RUIM card  is one type of a conventional \u201csmart card\u201d that can be used to identify a subscriber of the communication device  and to personalize the communication device , among other things. Without the SIM\/RUIM card , the communication device  is not fully operational for communication with the wireless network . By inserting the SIM\/RUIM card  into the SIM\/RUIM interface , a subscriber can access all subscribed services. Services can include: web browsing and messaging such as e-mail, voice mail, Short Message Service (SMS), and Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS). More advanced services can include: point of sale, field service and sales force automation. The SIM\/RUIM card  includes a processor and memory for storing information. Once the SIM\/RUIM card  is inserted into the SIM\/RUIM interface , it is coupled to the main processor . In order to identify the subscriber, the SIM\/RUIM card  can include some user parameters such as an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). An advantage of using the SIM\/RUIM card  is that a subscriber is not necessarily bound by any single physical mobile device. The SIM\/RUIM card  can store additional subscriber information for a mobile device as well, including datebook (or calendar) information and recent call information. Alternatively, user identification information can also be programmed into the flash memory .","The communication device  may be a battery-powered device including a battery interface  for receiving one or more rechargeable batteries . In at least some embodiments, the battery  can be a smart battery with an embedded microprocessor. The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown), which assists the battery  in providing power V+ to the communication device . Although current technology makes use of a battery, future technologies such as micro fuel cells can provide the power to the communication device .","The communication device  also includes an operating system  and software components  to  which are described in more detail below. The operating system  and the software components  to  that are executed by the main processor  are typically stored in a persistent store such as the flash memory , which can alternatively be a read-only memory (ROM) or similar storage element (not shown). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that portions of the operating system  and the software components  to , such as specific device applications, or parts thereof, can be temporarily loaded into a volatile store such as the RAM . Other software components can also be included, as is well known to those skilled in the art.","The subset of software applications  that control basic device operations, including data and voice communication applications, will normally be installed on the communication device  during its manufacture. Other software applications include a message application  that can be any suitable software program that allows a user of the communication device  to send and receive electronic messages. Various alternatives exist for the message application  as is well known to those skilled in the art. Messages that have been sent or received by the user are typically stored in the flash memory  of the communication device  or some other suitable storage element in the communication device . In at least some embodiments, some of the sent and received messages can be stored remotely from the device  such as in a data store of an associated host system that the communication device  communicates with.","The software applications can further include a device state module , a Personal Information Manager (PIM) , and other suitable modules (not shown). The device state module  provides persistence, i.e. the device state module  ensures that important device data is stored in persistent memory, such as the flash memory , so that the data is not lost when the communication device  is turned off or loses power.","The PIM  includes functionality for organizing and managing data items of interest to the user, such as, but not limited to, e-mail, contacts, calendar events, voice mails, appointments, and task items. A PIM application has the ability to send and receive data items via the wireless network . PIM data items can be seamlessly integrated, synchronized, and updated via the wireless network  with the mobile device subscriber's corresponding data items stored and\/or associated with a host computer system. This functionality creates a mirrored host computer on the communication device  with respect to such items. This can be particularly advantageous when the host computer system is the mobile device subscriber's office computer system. Some or all of the data items stored at the communication device  may be indexed for searching on the device  either through a corresponding application, such as the PIM , or another suitable module. In addition, the items may be searchable using a unified search process implemented in the device operating system . For example, application data items can be encapsulated in a searchable entity class and registered with a unified search engine on the device  that executes searches against all registered data repositories on the device based on received queries. The search engine can also be configured to invoke a search process of external resources, such as Internet search engines or remote databases.","The communication device  also includes a connect module , and an information technology (IT) policy module . The connect module  implements the communication protocols that are required for the communication device  to communicate with the wireless infrastructure and any host system, such as an enterprise system, that the communication device  is authorized to interface with. Examples of a wireless infrastructure and an enterprise system are given in , which are described in more detail below.","The connect module  includes a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that can be integrated with the communication device  to allow the communication device  to use any number of services associated with the enterprise system or with other systems accessible over the network . The connect module  allows the communication device  to establish an end-to-end secure, authenticated communication pipe with the host system. A subset of applications for which access is provided by the connect module  can be used to pass IT policy commands from the host system to the communication device . This can be done in a wireless or wired manner. These instructions can then be passed to the IT policy module  to modify the configuration of the device . Alternatively, in some cases, the IT policy update can also be done over a wired connection.","Other types of software applications can also be installed on the communication device . These software applications can be third party applications, which are added after the manufacture of the communication device . Examples of third party applications include games, calculators, utilities, etc.","The additional applications can be loaded onto the communication device  through at least one of the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the data port , the short-range communications subsystem , or any other suitable device subsystem . This flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the communication device  and can provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications can enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the communication device .","The data port  enables a subscriber to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the communication device  by providing for information or software downloads to the communication device  other than through a wireless communication network. The alternate download path can, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the communication device  through a direct and thus reliable and trusted connection to provide secure device communication. The data port  can be any suitable port that enables data communication between the communication device  and another computing device. The data port  can be a serial or a parallel port. In some instances, the data port  can be a USB port that includes data lines for data transfer and a supply line that can provide a charging current to charge the battery  of the communication device .","The short-range communications subsystem  provides for communication between the communication device  and different systems or devices, without the use of the wireless network . For example, the subsystem  can include an infrared device and associated circuits and components for short-range communication. Examples of short-range communication standards include standards developed by the Infrared Data Association (IrDA), Bluetooth\u2122, and the 802.11\u2122 family of standards.","In use, a received signal such as a text message, an e-mail message, or web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the main processor . The main processor  will then process the received signal for output to the display  or alternatively to the auxiliary I\/O subsystem . A subscriber can also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, for example, using the keyboard  in conjunction with the display  and possibly the auxiliary I\/O subsystem . The auxiliary subsystem  can include devices such as: a touchscreen, mouse, track ball, infrared fingerprint detector, or a roller wheel with dynamic button pressing capability. The keyboard  may be an alphanumeric keyboard and\/or telephone-type keypad. However, other types of keyboards can also be used. A composed item can be transmitted over the wireless network  through the communication subsystem . It will be appreciated that if the display  comprises a touchscreen, then the auxiliary subsystem  may still comprise one or more of the devices identified above.","For voice communications, the overall operation of the communication device  is substantially similar, except that the received signals are output to the speaker , and signals for transmission are generated by the microphone . Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, can also be implemented on the communication device . Although voice or audio signal output is accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display  can also be used to provide additional information such as the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["104","104","150","152","154","156","158","160","104","200","100"]},"Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver , which can perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, and analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, by the DSP . These DSP-processed signals are input to the transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification and transmission over the wireless network  via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but also provides for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  can be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","The wireless link between the communication device  and the wireless network  can contain one or more different channels, typically different RF channels, and associated protocols used between the communication device  and the wireless network . An RF channel is a limited resource that should be conserved, typically due to limits in overall bandwidth and limited battery power of the communication device . When the communication device  is fully operational, the transmitter  is typically keyed or turned on only when it is transmitting to the wireless network  and is otherwise turned off to conserve resources. Similarly, the receiver  is periodically turned off to conserve power until it is needed to receive signals or information (if at all) during designated time periods. Other communication subsystems, such as the WLAN communication subsystem  shown in , may be provided with similar components as those described above configured for communication over the appropriate frequencies and using the appropriate protocols.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["202","200","200","202","144","100","202","200","202","202","204","206","208","210","212","214","216","218","220","202","200"]},"In a GSM network, the MSC  is coupled to the BSC  and to a landline network, such as a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)  to satisfy circuit switched requirements. The connection through the PCU , the SGSN  and the GGSN  to a public or private network (Internet)  (also referred to herein generally as a shared network infrastructure) represents the data path for GPRS capable mobile devices. In a GSM network extended with GPRS capabilities, the BSC  also contains the Packet Control Unit (PCU)  that connects to the SGSN  to control segmentation, radio channel allocation and to satisfy packet switched requirements. To track the location of the communication device  and availability for both circuit switched and packet switched management, the HLR  is shared between the MSC  and the SGSN . Access to the VLR  is controlled by the MSC .","The station  is a fixed transceiver station and together with the BSC  form fixed transceiver equipment. The fixed transceiver equipment provides wireless network coverage for a particular coverage area commonly referred to as a \u201ccell\u201d. The fixed transceiver equipment transmits communication signals to and receives communication signals from mobile devices within its cell via the station . The fixed transceiver equipment normally performs such functions as modulation and possibly encoding and\/or encryption of signals to be transmitted to the communication device  in accordance with particular, usually predetermined, communication protocols and parameters, under control of its controller. The fixed transceiver equipment similarly demodulates and possibly decodes and decrypts, if necessary, any communication signals received from the communication device  within its cell. Communication protocols and parameters can vary between different nodes. For example, one node can employ a different modulation scheme and operate at different frequencies than other nodes.","For all communication devices  registered with a specific network, permanent configuration data such as a user profile is stored in the HLR . The HLR  also contains location information for each registered mobile device and can be queried to determine the current location of a mobile device. The MSC  is responsible for a group of location areas and stores the data of the mobile devices currently in its area of responsibility in the VLR . Further, the VLR  also contains information on mobile devices that are visiting other networks. The information in the VLR  includes part of the permanent mobile device data transmitted from the HLR  to the VLR  for faster access. By moving additional information from a remote HLR  node to the VLR , the amount of traffic between these nodes can be reduced so that voice and data services can be provided with faster response times and at the same time requiring less use of computing resources.","The SGSN  and the GGSN  are elements added for GPRS support; namely packet switched data support, within GSM. The SGSN  and the MSC  have similar responsibilities within the wireless network  by keeping track of the location of each communication device . The SGSN  also performs security functions and access control for data traffic on the wireless network . The GGSN  provides internetworking connections with external packet switched networks and connects to one or more SGSNs  via an Internet Protocol (IP) backbone network operated within the network . During normal operations, a given communication device  must perform a \u201cGPRS Attach\u201d to acquire an IP address and to access data services. This requirement is not present in circuit switched voice channels as Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) addresses are used for routing incoming and outgoing calls. Currently, all GPRS capable networks use private, dynamically assigned IP addresses, thus requiring the DHCP server  connected to the GGSN . There are many mechanisms for dynamic IP assignment, including using a combination of a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server and a DHCP server. Once the GPRS Attach is complete, a logical connection is established from a communication device , through the PCU , and the SGSN  to an Access Point Node (APN) within the GGSN . The APN represents a logical end of an IP tunnel that can either access direct Internet compatible services or private network connections. The APN also represents a security mechanism for the network , insofar as each communication device  must be assigned to one or more APNs and communication devices  cannot exchange data without first performing a GPRS Attach to an APN that it has been authorized to use. The APN can be considered to be similar to an Internet domain name such as \u201cmyconnection.wireless.com\u201d.","Once the GPRS Attach operation is complete, a tunnel is created and all traffic is exchanged within standard IP packets using any protocol that can be supported in IP packets. This includes tunneling methods such as IP over IP as in the case with some IPSecurity (Ipsec) connections used with Virtual Private Networks (VPN). These tunnels are also referred to as Packet Data Protocol (PDP) Contexts and there are a limited number of these available in the network . To maximize use of the PDP Contexts, the network  will run an idle timer for each PDP Context to determine if there is a lack of activity. When a communication device  is not using its PDP Context, the PDP Context can be de-allocated and the IP address returned to the IP address pool managed by the DHCP server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4"],"b":["250","100","144","250","250","100","250","202","200"]},"The host system  comprises a number of network components connected to each other by a network . For instance, a user's desktop computer with an accompanying cradle  for the user's communication device  is situated on a LAN connection. The cradle  for the communication device  can be coupled to the computer by a serial or a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, for example. Other user computers -are also situated on the network , and each can be equipped with an accompanying cradle . The cradle  facilitates the loading of information (e.g. PIM data, private symmetric encryption keys to facilitate secure communications) from the user computer to the communication device , and can be particularly useful for bulk information updates often performed in initializing the communication device  for use. The information downloaded to the communication device  can include certificates used in the exchange of messages.","It will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the user computers -are typically also connected to other peripheral devices, such as printers, etc., which are not explicitly shown in . Furthermore, only a subset of network components of the host system  are shown in  for ease of exposition, and it will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the host system  will comprise additional components that are not explicitly shown in  for this exemplary configuration. More generally, the host system  can represent a smaller part of a larger network (not shown) of the organization, and can comprise different components and\/or be arranged in different topologies than that shown in the exemplary embodiment of .","To facilitate the operation of the communication device  and the wireless communication of messages and message-related data between the communication device  and components of the host system , a number of wireless communication support components  can be provided. In some implementations, the wireless communication support components  can include a message management server , a mobile data server , a web server, such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server , a contact server , and a device manager module . HTTP servers can also be located outside the enterprise system, as indicated by the HTTP server  attached to the network . The device manager module  includes an IT Policy editor  and an IT user property editor , as well as other software components for allowing an IT administrator to configure the communication devices . In an alternative embodiment, there can be one editor that provides the functionality of both the IT policy editor  and the IT user property editor . The support components  also include a data store , and an IT policy server . The IT policy server  includes a processor , a network interface  and a memory unit . The processor  controls the operation of the IT policy server  and executes functions related to the standardized IT policy as described below. The network interface  allows the IT policy server  to communicate with the various components of the host system  and the communication devices . The memory unit  can store functions used in implementing the IT policy as well as related data. Those skilled in the art know how to implement these various components. Other components can also be included as is well known to those skilled in the art. Further, in some implementations, the data store  can be part of any one of the servers.","In this exemplary embodiment, the communication device  communicates with the host system  through node  of the wireless network  and a shared network infrastructure  such as a service provider network or the public Internet. Access to the host system  can be provided through one or more routers (not shown), and computing devices of the host system  can operate from behind a firewall or proxy server . The proxy server  provides a secure node and a wireless internet gateway for the host system . The proxy server  intelligently routes data to the correct destination server within the host system .","In some implementations, the host system  can include a wireless VPN router (not shown) to facilitate data exchange between the host system  and the communication device . The wireless VPN router allows a VPN connection to be established directly through a specific wireless network to the communication device . The wireless VPN router can be used with the Internet Protocol (IP) Version 6 (IPV6) and IP-based wireless networks. This protocol can provide enough IP addresses so that each mobile device has a dedicated IP address, making it possible to push information to a mobile device at any time. An advantage of using a wireless VPN router is that it can be an off-the-shelf VPN component, and does not require a separate wireless gateway and separate wireless infrastructure. A VPN connection may be a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\/IP or User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\/IP connection for delivering the messages directly to the communication device  in this alternative implementation.","Messages intended for a user of the communication device  are initially received by a message server  of the host system . Such messages can originate from any number of sources. For instance, a message can have been sent by a sender from the computer within the host system , from a different mobile device (not shown) connected to the wireless network  or a different wireless network, or from a different computing device, or other device capable of sending messages, via the shared network infrastructure , possibly through an application service provider (ASP) or Internet service provider (ISP), for example.","The message server  typically acts as the primary interface for the exchange of messages, particularly e-mail messages, within the organization and over the shared network infrastructure . Each user in the organization that has been set up to send and receive messages is typically associated with a user account managed by the message server . Some exemplary implementations of the message server  include a Microsoft Exchange\u2122 server, a Lotus Domino\u2122 server, a Novell Groupwise\u2122 server, or another suitable mail server installed in a corporate environment. In some implementations, the host system  can comprise multiple message servers . The message server  can also be adapted to provide additional functions beyond message management, including the management of data associated with calendars and task lists, for example.","When messages are received by the message server , they are typically stored in a data store associated with the message server . In at least some embodiments, the data store can be a separate hardware unit, such as data store , with which the message server  communicates. Messages can be subsequently retrieved and delivered to users by accessing the message server . For instance, an e-mail client application operating on a user's computer can request the e-mail messages associated with that user's account stored on the data store associated with the message server . These messages are then retrieved from the data store and stored locally on the computer . The data store associated with the message server  can store copies of each message that is locally stored on the communication device . Alternatively, the data store associated with the message server  can store all of the messages for the user of the communication device  and only a smaller number of messages can be stored on the communication device  to conserve memory. For instance, the most recent messages (i.e. those received in the past two to three months for example) can be stored on the communication device .","When operating the communication device , the user may wish to have e-mail messages retrieved for delivery to the communication device . The message application  operating on the communication device  can also request messages associated with the user's account from the message server . The message application  can be configured (either by the user or by an administrator, possibly in accordance with an organization's IT policy) to make this request at the direction of the user, at some pre-defined time interval, or upon the occurrence of some pre-defined event. In some implementations, the communication device  is assigned its own e-mail address, and messages addressed specifically to the communication device  are automatically redirected to the communication device  as they are received by the message server .","The message management server  can be used to specifically provide support for the management of messages, such as e-mail messages, that are to be handled by mobile devices. Generally, while messages are still stored on the message server , the message management server  can be used to control when, if, and how messages are sent to the communication device . The message management server  also facilitates the handling of messages composed on the communication device , which are sent to the message server  for subsequent delivery.","For example, the message management server  can monitor the user's \u201cmailbox\u201d (e.g. the message store associated with the user's account on the message server ) for new e-mail messages, and apply user-definable filters to new messages to determine if and how the messages are relayed to the user's communication device . The message management server  can also, through an encoder (not shown) associated therewith, compress message data, using any suitable compression\/decompression technology (e.g. YK compression, JPEG, MPEG-x, H.26x, and other known techniques) and encrypt messages (e.g. using an encryption technique such as Data Encryption Standard (DES), Triple DES, or Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)), and push them to the communication device  via the shared network infrastructure  and the wireless network . The message management server  can also receive messages composed on the communication device  (e.g. encrypted using Triple DES), decrypt and decompress the composed messages, re-format the composed messages if desired so that they will appear to have originated from the user's computer , and re-route the composed messages to the message server  for delivery.","Certain properties or restrictions associated with messages that are to be sent from and\/or received by the communication device  can be defined (e.g. by an administrator in accordance with IT policy) and enforced by the message management server . These may include whether the communication device  can receive encrypted and\/or signed messages, minimum encryption key sizes, whether outgoing messages must be encrypted and\/or signed, and whether copies of all secure messages sent from the communication device  are to be sent to a pre-defined copy address, for example.","The message management server  can also be adapted to provide other control functions, such as only pushing certain message information or pre-defined portions (e.g. \u201cblocks\u201d) of a message stored on the message server  to the communication device . For example, in some cases, when a message is initially retrieved by the communication device  from the message server , the message management server  can push only the first part of a message to the communication device , with the part being of a pre-defined size (e.g. 2 KB). The user can then request that more of the message be delivered in similar-sized blocks by the message management server  to the communication device , possibly up to a maximum pre-defined message size. Accordingly, the message management server  facilitates better control over the type of data and the amount of data that is communicated to the communication device , and can help to minimize potential waste of bandwidth or other resources.","The mobile data server  encompasses any other server that stores information that is relevant to the corporation. The mobile data server  can include, but is not limited to, databases, online data document repositories, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, or enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications. The mobile data server  can also connect to the Internet or other public network, through HTTP server  or other suitable web server such as an File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server, to retrieve HTTP webpages and other data. Requests for webpages are typically routed through mobile data server  and then to HTTP server , through suitable firewalls and other protective mechanisms. The web server then retrieves the webpage over the Internet, and returns it to mobile data server . As described above in relation to message management server , mobile data server  is typically provided, or associated, with an encoder  that permits retrieved data, such as retrieved webpages, to be decompressed and compressed, using any suitable compression technology (e.g. YK compression, JPEG, MPEG-x, H.26x and other known techniques), and encrypted (e.g. using an encryption technique such as DES, Triple DES, or AES), and then pushed to the communication device  via the shared network infrastructure  and the wireless network . While encoder  is only shown for mobile data server , it will be appreciated that each of message server , message management server , and HTTP servers  and  can also have an encoder associated therewith.","The contact server  can provide information for a list of contacts for the user in a similar fashion as the address book on the communication device . Accordingly, for a given contact, the contact server  can include the name, phone number, work address and e-mail address of the contact, among other information. The contact server  can also provide a global address list that contains the contact information for all of the contacts associated with the host system .","It will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the message management server , the mobile data server , the HTTP server , the contact server , the device manager module , the data store  and the IT policy server  do not need to be implemented on separate physical servers within the host system . For example, some or all of the functions associated with the message management server  can be integrated with the message server , or some other server in the host system . Alternatively, the host system  can comprise multiple message management servers , particularly in variant implementations where a large number of mobile devices need to be supported.","The device manager module  provides an IT administrator with a graphical user interface with which the IT administrator interacts to configure various settings for the communication devices . As mentioned, the IT administrator can use IT policy rules to define behaviors of certain applications on the communication device  that are permitted such as phone, web browser or Instant Messenger use. The IT policy rules can also be used to set specific values for configuration settings that an organization requires on the communication devices  such as auto signature text, WLAN\/VoIP\/VPN configuration, security requirements (e.g. encryption algorithms, password rules, etc.), specifying themes or applications that are allowed to run on the communication device , and the like.","In an embodiment, a computing device  may be provided that is operative to categorise and assign data based upon a characteristic of the data into a security classification or data domain. In an aspect, the device  may be operative to control access to the stored data and limit access to requesting components assigned to an access domain that has permission to access the data domain assigned to the requested data. The data domains, access domains and permissions may be defined by a security policy.","In an embodiment, a system may be provided whereby an external server, such as a server in host system , may set the security policy to control access to data used on computing devices such as mobile device . In an aspect, a user of the computing device may set or modify the security policy.","In an aspect, the classification and access to data is controlled by one or more access components operative on the computing device. The access components may each be responsible for a specific class or type of data stored on the computing device and operative to access and modify that type of data.","Referring to , in an embodiment a host server , such as a server within host system , may comprise a host data store . The host server  may be connected through a public or private network , such as a corporate LAN or the Internet, to a wireless network  which may include one or more network nodes . A mobile computing device , such as mobile device , in communication with the wireless network  may receive the security policy through the wireless network  from the host server  and store the security policy, or security information from the security policy, in a device data store . The security policy, or security information from the security policy, may define data domains, access domains and corresponding permissions for the access domains. In an aspect, the security policy may further specify data domains in terms of data classifications to allow a comparison of data characteristics of a specific data item with the data classifications to assign a data domain to the specific data item. In an aspect, the data item may comprise a data object, and the data classifications may identify characteristics of content within the data object to define and assign a data domain to the data object.","The permissions may grant access rights and levels of access to requesting components assigned to each access domain. At least one access component having control over the stored data, may allow access to the stored data by evaluating the access domain of a requesting component, evaluating the data domain of the requested data based upon a security policy in force at the time of request to identify an assigned access domain and an assigned data domain. The access component may further determine whether the requesting component is authorized to access the requested data by comparing the assigned access domain and the assigned data domain with permissions specified or defined in the current security policy. The current security policy may further place conditions or rights of access to a requesting component of an assigned access domain requesting access to data of an assigned data domain.","In an embodiment, the security policy sent by the host server  may be updated and an updated security policy sent to the computing device . The access components of the computing device  may use the updated security policy in place of the security policy, allowing the host server  to specify changes to permissions of access domains to access data domains.","In an aspect, the computing device  may compare data characteristics of data stored in a data store of the computing device  with the updated security policy such that rights of access may change based upon both the current content of the data and the updated security policy.","In an embodiment, the computing device  may employ access components, such as applications running on the device that are operative to control access to data stored on the device . The access components may each classify data handled by that filing component according to data characteristics and assign the classified data to the data domains specified in the security policy. The access component may store the classified data in one or more data stores accessible to, and in some embodiments under the sole control of, the access component. In an aspect, the data stores may be resident on the computing device . In an aspect, the data stores may be accessible by the computing device over a network connection, such as a corporate data store maintained in host system .","The access components may, in an embodiment, be further operative to control access to the classified data by requiring requesting components operating on the device  that request data controlled by the access component to comply with the current security policy. In an aspect, the access components may require a requesting component to be authorized to access data by evaluating an access domain assigned to the requesting component by the current security policy.","For instance, trusted components may be assigned by the security policy to access domains that allow access and full control over sensitive information that has been assigned to a restricted data domain. Third party components, which may be untrusted, may be assigned to access domains that limit access to data domains of public or common data of low-sensitivity or a data domain for data created by or downloaded by the third party component. The security policy may provide further control by setting a level of access to an access domain-data domain combination that limits what actions a requesting component can take with respect to the requested data. For instance, in an aspect, a requesting component may be granted read access but not write access to a data domain.","Referring to , in an aspect, a data originating device  may send external data  to data storing device  such as device . The external data  may have a data domain assigned by the data originating device  that is communicated as domain data to the data storing device  along with the external data . In an embodiment, the domain data may comprise meta data of the external data .","Referring to , the external data , and domain data, are passed within device  to an access component . The access component  may comprise an application that is assigned control over, and is operative to access and process, a type of data stored in data store  on data storing device . Access component  receives the external data  and domain data, evaluates the domain data and stores the external data  in data storage , associated with the data domain. The access component  may further process the external data  before storing the processed data associated with the data domain in place of the external data .","An example of an access component  may include an address book application for storing contact information or, a mail program for receiving, generating, sending and storing mail messages, for instance. The applications maintain control over a specific data type, stored and organised by the applications. In this aspect, the processing may comprise, for instance, converting the external data  from a first data type into a second data type, adding data to an existing entry stored in application data store  or deleting amending data from an existing entry stored in application data store .","In embodiments where the data originating device  does not assign a data domain to the external data , access component  may associate a data domain based upon a security policy as applied to data characteristics of the external data . The data characteristics may include, for instance, such factors as: an identity of the data originating device , a source of the data, a data type of the data, a user classification, a content of the data or other data characteristics. In an aspect, the data storing device  may solicit input from a user of the device to assign a data domain to the external data . The choice of data domains presented to the user may be defined by a security policy, wherein characteristics of the external data  are evaluated by the access component , in consultation with the security policy to identify a selection of data domains to be presented to the user for selection. In an aspect, the access component may be operative to access the external data , and evaluate content of the external data  to classify the external data  to a data domain.","Referring to , an embodiment of the operation of the access component  for filing external data  may start when device  receives external data  and domain data assigning the external data  to a data domain from a data originating device  in step . The device  directs the external data  to access component  for storage in a data store  in step . Access component  may comprise a filing system, an API or application, for instance, that has control over access to data stored in data store . Access component  evaluates the external data  to determine a data domain of the external data  in step . In an aspect, the evaluation may comprise comparing a data domain identifier sent with the external data  with data classifications specified in the security policy to associate the external data  with the data domain. In an aspect, the access component  may be operative to associate a data domain to data that has not already been assigned to a data domain by comparing data characteristics of the external data  with data classifications specified in the security policy. Access component  stores the external data  in data storage , associated with the data domain in step . The access component  may associate the data domain by, for instance, storing the external data  within a portion of data storage  allocated to the domain; attaching a flag, pointer, meta data or identifier to the stored data; maintaining a table or database identifying data by domain, or other known means of preserving an association.","Data that has not been associated with a data domain by a data originating device , or a data generating component operating on the data storing device , may also be associated with a data domain by the access component. Referring to , an access component , such as an application generating or controlling data, may generate or receive data to be stored in data store . For instance, an address book application may generate or receive address book information to be stored in the address book maintained in data store . The access component  may evaluate data characteristics of the data, compare the data characteristics with data classifications specified in the security policy and associate the data with a data domain. In an aspect, the data classifications may specify a source of the data, a data type of the data, a user classification, or keywords as specified in a content of the data. The data may then be stored in data store  associated with the data domain.","Referring to , in an embodiment, the access component  may generate or receive data to be stored in step .

Referring to , computing device  may include a requesting component , access component  and a data store  controlled by the access component .","Requesting component  may comprise, for instance, an application operating on the device or a subsystem of the device that requires data to service a request. Access component  may comprise, for instance an application that is assigned control over, and is operative to access and evaluate, a data type stored in data store .","Referring to , in an embodiment, access component  may receive a request for data from data store  controlled by access component  from the requesting component  in step . The request may include an access domain assigned to the requesting component , or may include a component identifier that may be used by the access component  to assign an access domain as specified in the current security policy. In an embodiment, the access component  may maintain a record of components and their assigned domains, for instance as a look-up table or database. The record may be updated by the access component  based upon security information obtained from the security policy. In an embodiment, the record of components and their assigned domains may be specified in a current security policy accessible by the access component  at the time the request is serviced.","Access component  identifies the assigned access domain of the requesting component  and the assigned data domain of the requested data in step . In an embodiment, access component  may access data store  to determine the data domain associated with the requested data and then consult the current security policy to obtain the assigned data domain. In embodiments where access component  preserves an association of the data domain, access component  may determine the data domain based upon the association.","For instance, the access component  may consult a look-up table or database, read a data domain identifier associated with the requested data or identify a data domain associated with a portion of memory in data store  that contains the requested data to determine the associated data domain.","In an embodiment, the access component  may evaluate one or more data characteristics of the requested data and compare the one or more data characteristics with data classifications specified in the current security policy.

As indicated in , retrieval component  may further control access to a common data store  that may store data from various applications. Retrieval component  may control access to the common data store  in the conventional manner of computing devices, or may itself operate as an access component . Common data store  may comprise a shared portion of memory along with data store , or may comprise a separate memory such as flash memory on the computing device  or removable flash memory on the computing device .","In the embodiment of , requesting component  directs its request for data to retrieval component . Requesting component  may or may not include in its request a component identifier or an access domain identifier identifying the requesting component  or the access domain of the requesting component  respectively.","Retrieval component  may interface with more than access component , though in the embodiment of only a single access component  is illustrated, along with common data store .

Accordingly, the updated security policy forwarded by the host server  may be implemented by the access components    to control access to data based upon data-type characteristics or data content characteristics.","In an embodiment, an access component    may assign a data object to a data domain based upon content such as an author or recipient of the object. For instance, a mail application may assign mail sent to a corporate address as belonging within the corporate domain and mail sent to a personal address as belonging in the public or common domain. The mail application may assign the mail by accessing a mail object, evaluate content fields or metadata of the mail object to identify a sender or recipient of the mail object. The mail application may further classify mail objects sent or received to a specific corporate mail domain as being within a corporate domain. Accordingly, the mail application may restrict future access to the mail assigned to the corporate domain to applications of an assigned access domain that are authorized to view data that falls within the corporate domain.","In an embodiment, an access component    may assign a data object to a data domain based upon content such as a time of data generation\/capture, a location of the device or a combination of both factors.
