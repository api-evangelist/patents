{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present disclosure relates generally to medical implants, and more particularly, to transferring power from one part of the implant to another part of the implant.","2. Related Art","Medical implants require some form of power to operate and perform their intended functions. Sometimes this power is provided from an external power source (i.e., located outside the recipient of the medical implant). Alternatively or in combination with an external power source, the power is provided by an internal power source such as, for example, an implanted battery.","In some medical implants, it is necessary to transfer power to different parts of the implant and\/or to different modules of the implant. In medical implants, power storage and power used to drive operational circuits is usually in direct current (DC) form. When transfer or transmission of electrical power is performed within the body of a recipient of the medical implant, there is often utility in avoiding or at least minimizing any contact with tissue of the recipient.","In a medical implant, the DC power source is often converted to alternating current (AC) for transfer across any region that might potentially be exposed to tissue, and then back into DC power for use in powering the medical device or parts thereof.","Damage to a part of the implant (for example the connection path between the two or more parts of the implant), can expose electrically conductive elements to tissue. While the effects of damage to tissue from exposure to the electrical current can be minimised by the use of DC blocking capacitors on the connection paths, the exposed elements can still create a current path through tissue for AC current.","One particular medical device in which such power transfer can be used is a cochlear implant device. A cochlear implant allows for electrical stimulating signals to be applied directly to the auditory nerve fibres of the patient, allowing the brain to perceive a hearing sensation approximating the natural hearing sensation. These stimulating signals are applied by an array of electrodes implanted into the recipient's cochlea.","According to one aspect of the present invention, there is a medical implant comprising a first power storage device, a first switching circuit for receiving power and transferring the received power from an implant connector electrically connected to the medical implant to the first power storage device in a first power transfer stage, a second power storage device, and a second switching circuit for transferring power from the first power storage device to the second power storage device in a second power transfer stage.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is a medical implant system comprising a first medical implant, a second medical implant, and an electrical connection between the first and second medical implants, wherein the first medical implant comprises a first power storage device, a power storage interface configured to place the first power storage device into electrical communication with the electrical connection, wherein the second medical implant comprises, a second power storage device, a first switching circuit configured to receive and transfer power received from the electrical connection to the second power storage device in a first power transfer stage, a third power storage device, and a second switching circuit configured to receive and transfer power from the second power storage device to the third power storage device in a second power transfer stage.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is a method of transferring power between a first medical implant and a second medical implant connected by an electrical connection, the method comprising receiving power from the first medical implant via the electrical connection at the second medical implant, transferring at least a portion of the received power to a first power storage device of the second medical implant via a first switching circuit during a first power transfer stage and storing the received power in the first power storage device, and transferring at least a portion of the stored power stored on the first power storage device to a second power storage device of the second medical implant via a second switching circuit during a second power transfer stage.","An embodiment of the present invention includes a medical implant comprising two separate capacitors located in respective switching circuits. The medical implant receives power from a separate implanted component via an implant connector. The switching circuits are controlled so that a first of the capacitors is in electrical communication with the implant connector so that the first capacitor can be charged with power from the electrical connector during a first power transfer stage. During this first power transfer stage, a second of the capacitors is taken out of electrical communication with the first capacitor. This second capacitor is used to power an electrode of the medical implant to stimulate tissue of a recipient of the medical implant. The switching circuits are further controlled so that the first and second capacitors are in electrical communication with each other so that the second capacitor can be charged with power from the first capacitor during a second power transfer stage. During this second power transfer stage, neither the first capacitor nor the second capacitor is in electrical communication with the electrical connector. This ensures that in the event of a failure of the electrical connector that exposes tissue of the recipient to electricity from the electrical connector, an electrical circuit from the electrical connector, through the electrode, to the circuit containing the second capacitor is never closed, thereby limiting interference with the operation of the electrode.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","135","135","110","120","135"]},"First module  has a power source P which is used to provide power for components within first module  as well as to provide power to the second module  and\/or any further modules connected to first module . The power is transferred from the power source  of first module  to the other modules via a signal transmitted over the implant connector . In some embodiments, the power transfer can be bi-directional, that is, power can be transferred from the second module  (and\/or further modules) to the power source  of first module .","Second module  has its own power storage device P, which can be used to power circuits and\/or other loads associated with second module . Power can be transferred to power storage device  from the power source in the first module  via implant connector .","In one aspect, second module  provides for a medical implant which has a first power storage device P \u2032 and a second power storage device P . Also provided are a first switching circuit  for receiving and transferring power from the implant connector  to the first power storage device \u2032 during a first power transfer stage, and a second switching circuit  for transferring power from the first power storage device \u2032 to the second power storage device , during a second power transfer stage, as will be described in more detail below.","As previously discussed, transferring power from one module to another module, within a tissue environment, may result in leakage of the signal carrying the power into tissue of the recipient due to, for example, damage to the implant connector or wire insulation. Accordingly, it is generally the case (although not required), that the direct current (DC) power from the power source  in the first module  is converted into an alternating current (AC) signal prior to transmission over the implant connector .

During the first power transfer stage, power is transferred from the implant connector or an entry port of the second module, to the first power storage device \u2032.

In some embodiments, this provides utility in the event that the power source  needs to be replaced or otherwise removed. For example, the surgery required is less serious, invasive or extensive than if the entire stimulator  had to be removed (e.g., there is no need to remove the implanted electrode array ).","Any suitable connector can be used to connect power source module  to main stimulator module .

Accordingly, because there is a risk of exposing the power transferring between the first module and the second module to tissue (for example in the event of damage to insulation), in some embodiments of the present invention, power is transmitted as an alternating current (AC) signal.","Accordingly, the function of the two-wire interface  in the power source module is to enable the conversion of the DC power from the power source or battery  into an AC signal for transmission on the two wires  and . In the event that power is being transferred to the power source module  from the main stimulator module , two-wire interface  will act as a rectifying circuit to convert the incoming AC signal to DC to charge the power source .","Similarly, the two-wire interface or first switching circuit  of the main stimulator module , will act to enable the conversion of the input AC power on two wires  and  into a DC signal for use in powering circuitry in or associated with main stimulator module . In the event that power is being transferred from the main stimulator module  to power source module , two-wire interface or first switching circuit  will act to enable conversion of the DC power to AC power for transmission on two wires  and .","In the following section of the description, the examples given will be in relation to power source module  supplying power to main stimulator module . It will also be assumed that power source module  will act as the master module and the main stimulator module  will act as the slave module, although this need not necessarily always be the case. In some cases, main stimulator module  can act as the master and power source module  can act as the slave module, irrespective of the direction of flow of power. It will be understood that when it is said that the power module is acting as the master, it is meant that the function of some elements (in this particular example, the two-wire interface  generating the AC signal) of the power module act independently of external information, while the main stimulator module, acting as the slave module, will function in accordance with information produced by the master module (in this particular example, the two-wire interface  of the main stimulator module  will act in accordance with the input AC signal generated by the master module)","Turning now to , there is shown power source module (PSM)  and main stimulator module (MSM) , having respective two-wire interface  and  (acting as the first switching circuit). As shown, two-wire interfaces  and  include an arrangement of switches that can be selectively controlled to perform the inverter and rectification functions referred to above.","With reference to the PSM (assuming that it is the Master in this example), in this embodiment there are 4 switches, , ,  and . The switches ( and ) labelled \u03a61 are closed during a first phase of the AC signal (see ) and the switches ( and ) labelled  are open. This results in a positive voltage difference of about Vbatt between wire and wire. Similarly, during a second phase of the AC signal, the \u03a62 switches ( and ) are closed and the \u03a61 switches ( and ) are open, producing a negative voltage difference of about Vbatt (voltage of the power source or battery ) between the wire and wire. This arrangement accordingly performs an inversion of the DC battery voltage into an AC voltage between the wires, without any DC component.","With reference to the MSM (assuming that it is the Slave in this example), four switches , ,  and  are provided for the first switching circuit . The same timing of the \u03a61 and \u03a62 switches as in the PSM would rectify the AC voltage between the wires onto a first power storage device such as storage capacitor \u2032 (in this example), with minimal losses compared with a passive diode rectifier.","This arrangement results in current being drawn from the battery in the PSM to charge the storage capacitor or first power storage device \u2032 in the MSM during both phases.","In one embodiment, use of series capacitors  and  can be made in the MSM to block any DC current from flowing between either wire and the electrode array connected to the PSM, in the event of a breach of the insulation surrounding the wires. It will however be understood that blocking capacitors  and  are not necessarily required.","Also shown are the switches  switches, switches  and , forming the second switching circuit, connecting the second power storage device  to the first power storage device \u2032. In this case, second power storage device  can also be a capacitor.","It will be appreciated that if the timing of the switching from phase  to phase  and vice versa is not correct, there will be a time where the positive terminal of first power storage device \u2032 can be connected to the negative terminal of the battery  or that the negative terminal of first power storage device \u2032 will be connected to the positive terminal of battery . In this situation, capacitor \u2032 will actually discharge rather than charge, resulting in a reduction in the efficiency of the power transfer from PSM  to MSM .","According to one aspect hereindescribed therefore, the timing of the switching in the first power storage device  is controlled such that at no time is there provided an electrical path from one polarity of the first power storage device \u2032 or capacitor, to the opposite polarity of the power source or battery . This is accomplished in one form by controlling the switches , ,  and  in the MSM , such that a closed (or conducting) switch is caused to be open (non-conducting) prior to a change in polarity of the AC signal. In this way, at no time will there be a return or discharge path to allow the power storage device to discharge into the power source. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the opening of a switch is not instantaneous, and that a finite amount of time elapses between the beginning of the opening of the switch to the time that the switch is fully open and non-conducting. During this finite time, the switch is still conducting. Accordingly, beginning to open the switch upon reversal of polarity will result in the switch still conducting momentarily during the reversed polarity, resulting in discharge of the power storage device.","In one embodiment, this is avoided by causing the switches , ,  and  to begin opening (or becoming non-conductive) at some time prior to the AC signal which the switch is conducting, reversing polarity. In one form, this is accomplished by monitoring a current magnitude in the AC signal, and causing the switch to begin opening when this magnitude falls below a predetermined threshold.","In another embodiment, the control of the opening of the switches is caused to occur in accordance with a timing signal rather than with reference to the incoming AC signal.","Each of these embodiments incorporating the various aspects described herein will now be described in more detail with reference to , B, C, ,  and .","In , there is shown one example of a circuit which can be used in the MSM. The first switching circuit  includes the four switches , ,  and  described above with reference to . Low-current detectors , ,  and  detect when the current through the switches drops below the threshold, switch control block , and voltage comparators  and  for detecting the change in voltage or polarity of the signal on lines  and . In this example, switches , ,  and  are provided by MOSFETs. In this example, only switches  and  are monitored for current levels by current detectors , ,  and , however, in other embodiments, each switch can have its own respective current detector.","In the example shown in , the current detectors are shown as voltage comparators (with high gain) placed across each switch. Because the switches have non-zero resistance, a current through them results in a voltage drop across the switch, so a measurement of the voltage is equivalent to measuring the current. Once the current has dropped below a threshold (that can be predetermined and set into the comparator), the switches that were closed are opened. Note that four current detectors are shown in this example, however, this is not necessarily required, and can be determined on a case by case basis per design and required application. For uni-directional power flow (e.g. from left to right, or from PSM to MSM) only one current detector is needed for the \u03a61 phase and one for the \u03a62 phase. It is also possible to provide the current sensing directly in the two input lines  and  and to control the opening of the switches when it is sensed that the current falls below the threshold.","For example, a current threshold could be selected to be between about 5% and about 50% of the maximum signal value, including about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45% and about 50%. It will be appreciated that these threshold values can be varied to \u2018tune\u2019 the system, depending upon various system parameters such as the level of the signal, the switch resistance and the maximum sensed voltage, as will be understood by the person skilled in the art. In one example, the maximum signal level is about 100 mA, and the switch resistance is about 1 Ohm.","One advantage of the arrangement shown in  is that the timing of the switches (for example the frequency and\/or duty cycle) in the PSM  can change without the MSM  having to receive information relating to the state of the PSM .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0145","num":"0144"},"figref":"FIG. 13A","b":["20","1","2","12","13","14","15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0146","num":"0145"},"figref":"FIG. 13A","b":["123","21","22","9","9","9","9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0147","num":"0146"},"figref":"FIG. 13A","b":["120","50"]},"Also shown is switch control block , which in this example, contains control logic to control all the switches of all three phases.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0149","num":"0148"},"figref":["FIG. 13B","FIGS. 14A to 14R"],"b":"16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0150","num":"0149"},"figref":["FIGS. 14A to 14R","FIGS. 13A"],"b":["13","13"]},"As can be seen in the various Figures of , when the \u03a61 clock goes high, the voltage between Wire and Wire increases in a finite time, however, in this arrangement, there are no switches closed in the MSM , and so there is no negative current spike in the capacitor current. The voltage on the wires goes positive, and the Wire>Wire voltage comparator  output goes high, which causes the switch control block  to turn on the \u03a61 switches ,  in the MSM . When these switches turn on, the current through the \u03a61 switches ,  spikes up from zero, and gradually decays (note that the capacitor current is the same). Because the switches are resistive, the voltage waveform across the switches is the same as the current. When the current decays below the designated threshold, the voltage comparator  on the lower \u03a61 switch (\u03a61B) goes low (this went high when the current first started flowing, but that edge is not used by the switch control block in this particular application). On this edge, the switch control block  will turn off the \u03a61 switches  and . Note that the \u03a61 clock in the PSM  is still high. When that clock goes low, the \u03a61 switches in the PSM  are opened, and the voltage on the switches between the two wires is no longer driven by the power source, so it is free to return to zero if any load is present to do so.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0152","num":"0151"},"figref":"FIG. 14A","b":["130","140"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0153","num":"0152"},"figref":"FIGS. 14B and 14C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0154","num":"0153"},"figref":"FIG. 14D","b":["18","1","130","2","140","1","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0155","num":"0154"},"figref":"FIG. 14E","b":["20","2","140","1","130","2","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0156","num":"0155"},"figref":["FIG. 14F","FIG. 14D","FIG. 14Q","FIG. 14P","FIG. 14F","FIG. 14I"],"b":["5","16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0157","num":"0156"},"figref":["FIG. 14G","FIG. 14D","FIG. 14Q","FIG. 14P","FIG. 14G","FIG. 14I"],"b":["6","16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0158","num":"0157"},"figref":["FIG. 14H","FIGS. 14F and 14G"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0159","num":"0158"},"figref":"FIG. 14I","b":["13","16","12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0160","num":"0159"},"figref":["FIG. 14J","FIG. 14E","FIG. 14Q","FIG. 14P","FIG. 14J","FIG. 14M"],"b":["7","16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0161","num":"0160"},"figref":["FIG. 14K","FIG. 14E","FIG. 14Q","FIG. 14P","FIG. 14K","FIG. 14M"],"b":["8","16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0162","num":"0161"},"figref":["FIG. 14L","FIGS. 14J and 14K"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0163","num":"0162"},"figref":"FIG. 14M","b":["15","17","14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0164","num":"0163"},"figref":["FIG. 14N","FIGS. 14H and 14L"],"b":"9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0165","num":"0164"},"figref":"FIG. 14O","b":"9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0166","num":"0165"},"figref":["FIG. 14P","FIGS. 14D and 14E","FIGS. 14F","FIGS. 14F"],"b":["21","14","14","14","14","14","14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0167","num":"0166"},"figref":["FIG. 14Q","FIGS. 14D and 14E","FIGS. 14F","FIGS. 14F"],"b":["22","14","14","14","14","14","14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0168","num":"0167"},"figref":["FIG. 14R","FIG. 14R"],"b":["9","21","22","21","22","9"]},"As can be seen in the capacitor current waveform, ICAPACITOR in , the current is always positive, which means that the voltage across the capacitor \u2032 keeps building when the capacitor current is non-zero, up to a maximum constant voltage. The voltage reduces as current is transferred to the second power storage device or capacitor  during the second power transfer stage, but is constantly replenished by the charging function described above during the first power transfer stage. At no time does the capacitor \u2032 discharge back to the PSM as in prior art arrangements, thus providing a highly-efficient power charging circuit.","Returning now to , showing switch control block ,  shows an example of a suitable logic circuit to provide the functional control to control switches , , , ,  and  in accordance with the waveforms of  described above.","While , B and C show switch control block  as a single block, it will be appreciated that each of the phases \u03a61, \u03a62 and \u03a63 can have their own switch control blocks, or indeed, in any combination.","In another embodiment, the switching of the switches in the MSM  is controlled by a clock, synchronised with the switches in the PSM.  shows a circuit block diagram of a circuit according to this embodiment. Shown are switches , ,  and , voltage comparator  between lines  and , and first power storage device or capacitor \u2032, as previously described with reference to . It will be noted however that in this embodiment, no current detectors for the switches are required. Instead of using low-current detectors to determine when to open the switches, a timeout period is employed. For example, when the wire voltage changes from negative to positive, the \u03a61 switches will be closed in the MSM in response to this, as before. However, instead of using either the voltage, or a low-current detector, the switches automatically open after a predetermined time. This period should be shorter than the time taken for the voltage on the wires to change in polarity again, hence the efficiency is maximised.","The clocking of the switches in the PSM has not changed (still an independent clock), whilst the clocking of the switches in MSM is different from the previous method described with reference to , B, C and . In this arrangement, when the voltage difference between wire and wire goes positive, the \u03a61 clock in MSM is caused to go high (for an NMOS switch) (low for the PMOS switch). This stays high for a pre-determined timeout period and then goes low again (or high for the PMOS switch). The timeout period can be generated either by a one-shot circuit or a counter driven by a higher frequency clock. This can be provided as a separate circuit or can be provided as part of switch control . It will be noted that this period is designed to be shorter than the \u03a61 period in the PSM. This can be a fixed value that takes into account the error of the timeout period with respect to that in the PSM. For example, if the PSM \u03a61 period is 10 us and the relative error between this and the one-shot circuit in MSM is 10%, then a \u03a61 timeout of Bus in PSM could be chosen for correct operation.","The same occurs for \u03a62. The result is that there is no negative (discharging) current flowing in the capacitor \u2032, thereby avoiding the reduction in efficiency that would otherwise occur.","Also shown in  are switches  and  and second power storage device or capacitor , for providing power to load R.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0176","num":"0175"},"figref":["FIGS. 16A to 16N","FIG. 15","FIG. 14N","FIG. 16I"],"b":"9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0177","num":"0176"},"figref":"FIG. 16A","b":["130","140"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0178","num":"0177"},"figref":"FIGS. 16B and 16C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0179","num":"0178"},"figref":"FIG. 16D","b":["18","1","130","2","140","1","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0180","num":"0179"},"figref":"FIG. 16E","b":["20","2","140","1","130","2","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0181","num":"0180"},"figref":["FIGS. 16F and 17G","FIGS. 14F and 14G","FIG. 16D","FIG. 16M","FIG. 16L"],"b":["19","19"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0182","num":"0181"},"figref":["FIGS. 16H and 16I","FIGS. 14J and 14K","FIG. 16E","FIG. 16M","FIG. 16L"],"b":["19","19"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0183","num":"0182"},"figref":["FIG. 16J","FIG. 14N"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0184","num":"0183"},"figref":"FIG. 16K","b":"9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0185","num":"0184"},"figref":"FIGS. 16L and 16M","b":["21","22","9","9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0186","num":"0185"},"figref":"FIG. 16N","b":["9","9","21","22","9"]},"In a further alternative, the one-shot circuit can be made programmable and if a data link is available between the two modules , , then information about the switching frequency could be sent from PSM  to MSM  to improve the range of frequencies over which the system could operate.","If the pulse width or switching frequency of the switches in the PSM is variable, this can be addressed by the use of an algorithm in the \u03a61\/\u03a62 switch control block  in the MSM  to learn what the timeout period or a predetermined time, needs to be, by observing the voltage on the wires over a switching cycle, and adjusting the timeout accordingly.","For example, there could be provided a higher frequency clock in the MSM  (at least 10\u00d7 the switching frequency of the PSM ) which can be used to count the number of cycles used for the \u03a61 and \u03a62 pulse widths (via the two voltage comparators , ). For example, if the MSM  counts that the \u03a61 pulse width is 10 cycles, then in the next cycle it will only keep the \u03a61 switches in MSM  closed for  cycles and then open them. In this way, there is only an error of 10% and will still provide the advantages of the arrangements described even if the PSM  changes frequency (or even just duty cycle). The same applies to \u03a62.","The above has described various embodiments for providing transfer of power from one module to another, using a rectification circuit having high efficiency. It will be understood that many variations and modifications are possible. For example, as previously described, the various aspects will also work if power flows from the MSM to the PSM (this would imply that a source of power is present in the MSM). That is, power can flow bidirectionally in this arrangement. Secondly, it is not necessary that the PSM be the Master. That is, the MSM could be the Master with autonomous control over its own switches, whilst the PSM could be the Slave with the appropriate switch control circuitry as described previously. This distinction can be made regardless of the direction of power flow.","Furthermore, for the current detector method of determining when to open the switches in the slave module, the current detection does not need to be limited to detecting the current directly in one (or more) of the switches. It could detect the current flowing in a device in series with the switches.","Other current detection mechanisms could also be used, instead of the voltage comparators across resistive switches shown in .
