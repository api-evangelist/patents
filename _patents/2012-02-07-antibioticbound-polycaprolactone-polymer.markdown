title: Antibiotic-bound poly(caprolactone) polymer
abstract: This invention is the design and synthesis of a caprolactone monomer which bears a pendant protected carboxyl group. This monomer has been copolymerized with caprolactone in varying ratios. After polymerization, the protecting group can be removed and an antibiotic can be attached as a new pendant group. The bioactivity of the antibiotic-bound poly(caprolactone) polymer is described.

No. 11\/746,704 filed on May 10, 2007 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/747,061 filed on May 11, 2006, entitled \u201cAntibiotic-Bound Poly(Caprolactone) Polymer\u201d.","This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. RO1 A151351 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates to attaching one or more bioactive molecules to the same polymer, and also for attachment before or after polymerization","The delivery of water-insoluble drugs to targets within the human body is a challenge that presently places strict limitations on what drugs can be applied clinically. The need for methods which overcome this is of high priority in the development of new therapeutics for treatment of human disease.","The development of antibiotics for control of pathogenic bacteria has been of pressing need in this era of drug resistant infections. N-Methylthiolated b-lactams have been identified as a new family of antibacterial agents active against bacteria, including methicillin-resistant (MRSA).(See Turos, E.; Konaklieva, M. I.; Ren, R. X. F.; Shi, H.; Gonzalez, J.; Dickey, S.; Lim, D. 2000, 56, 5571; Bart Heldreth, Timothy E. Long, Seyoung Jang, Suresh K. R. Guntireddygari, Edward Turos, Sonja Dickey, Daniel V. Lim, \u201cN-Thiolated b-Lactam Antibacterials: Effects of the N-Organothio Substituent on anti-MRSA Activity,\u201d 14, 3775-3784 (2006); and Edward Turos, Jeung-Yeop Shim, Yang Wang, Kerriann Greenhalgh, G. Suresh Kumar Reddy, Sonja Dickey, Daniel V. Lim, \u201cAntibiotic-Conjugated Polyacrylate Nanoparticles: New Opportunities for Development of Anti-MRSA Agents,\u201d Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters 16, in press (2006); which are incorporated herein by reference).","The compounds have also displayed promising anticancer properties. These lactams exert their growth inhibitory effects on bacteria through a mode of action that is distinctively different to that of other b-lactam antibiotics, and possess structure\u2014activity patterns unlike those already mapped for other b-lactam antibacterials such as the penicillins. One of the major limitations in the potential application of these N-thiolated b-lactam compounds, however, is their exceedingly low water solubility.","Drug delivery vehicles such as liposomes and gold nanoparticles have been developed to improve bioavailability, efficacy, and specificity of pharmaceutical compounds, particularly for anticancer agents, but nanoparticles have received surprisingly little attention in the antibiotic and infectious disease area. Some of the few notable examples have included antibiotic-encapsulated polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes, biodegradable nanospheres and surface-coated gold and silver nanoparticles.","In one embodiment, the invention provides an effective drug delivery platform that would enhance the water solubility of the lactams, without sacrificing inherent bioactivity.","In another embodiment, the invention provides for the development of antibacterial polyacrylate nanoparticles based on well-precedented emulsion polymerization procedures.","This invention addresses this need, and demonstrates the use of antibiotic-bound poly (caprolactone) polymers as anti-infective materials for biomedical applications in the prevention of bacterial infections.","In a first embodiment, the invention includes a functionalized compound comprising at least one caprolactone ring with an appended functional group. A plurality of methylene groups act as a spacer between the lactone ring and the functional group. In a preferred embodiment, the functional group is an antibiotic, such as a N-thiolated \u03b2-lactam. The functional group is preferably covalently bonded.","In an alternate embodiment, a method is provided for producing the functionalized compound of the previous embodiment. The method includes providing a at least one caprolactone ring with a protecting group spaced apart from the caprolactone ring by a plurality of methylene groups. The protecting group is then cleaved from the caprolactone ring and replaced by bonding a functional group to the caprolactone ring. Illustrative reagents for cleaving the protecting group include 10% pd\/C as a catalyst in the presence of Hand ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The protecting group is selected from the group consisting of alcohol protecting groups, amine protecting groups, carbonyl protecting groups and carboxyl protecting groups. In a preferred embodiment, the protecting group is selected fro the group consisting of a benzel ester and a tert-butyl ester. As with the previous embodiment, the functional group is an antibiotic such as a N-thiolated \u03b2-lactam.","In another embodiment, the invention includes the compound represented by the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"34.88mm","wi":"14.39mm","file":"US08470958-20130625-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"In yet another embodiment, the invention includes the compound represented by the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"46.91mm","wi":"32.51mm","file":"US08470958-20130625-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof.","In another embodiment, the invention includes the compound represented by the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"29.97mm","wi":"13.55mm","file":"US08470958-20130625-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof.","In still another embodiment, the invention includes the compound represented by the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"29.89mm","wi":"14.05mm","file":"US08470958-20130625-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof.","In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and within which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments by which the invention may be practiced.

PCL is degraded by hydrolysis of its ester linkages in physiological conditions (such as in the human body) and is therefore useful as a biomaterial. PCL has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the human body as (for example) a suture (sold under the brand name Monocryl\u2122 or generically). In particular, PCL has been used in long term implantable devices, owing to its degradation which is relatively slow. (See V. R. Sinha, K. Bansal, R. Kaushik, R. Kumria and A. Trehan; Poly-\u03b5-caprolactone microspheres and nanospheres: an overview, , Volume 278, Issue 1, 18 Jun. 2004, Pages 1-23; which is incorporated herein by reference.)","The characteristics of PCL make it useful as a delivery mechanism for antibiotics. For example PCL is biodegradable (bulk hydrolysis of ester bonds), the byproducts of degradation are non-toxic (biocompatible), it is FDA approved and displays high permeability to many drugs. Therefore, the invention provides a functionalized caprolactone polymer can be used for covalent binding of drug molecules ().","The functionalized caprolactones of the prior art (Detrembleur et al Macromolecules, 2000, 33, 14-18 and Trollsas et at Macromolecules, 2000, 33, 4619-4627) are shown in .
