{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The following description was made in the performance of official duties by employees of the Department of the Navy, and, thus the claimed invention may be manufactured, used, licensed by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.","The following description relates generally to an apparatus for cleaning and disinfecting footwear. More particularly, a user controlled multi-functioning device that performs both cleaning and disinfecting of footwear upon contact.","Infectious diseases can be spread by shoe traffic and the handling of footwear. One study found that up to about 421,000 units of bacteria may reside on the outside of a shoe. Some of the bacteria found are known for causing intestinal and bloodstream infections, bacterial meningitis and pneumonia. The spread of infectious diseases is highlighted in situations where one moves from one location that houses these bacteria, to another location with organisms that are susceptible to these bacteria. For example, visitors to livestock and agricultural facilities can transmit diseases to the vulnerable livestock and agriculture. Similar risks exist because of shoe traffic to and from medical facilities, residential homes, day cares, schools, and vehicles, particularly vehicles that travel internationally, such as airplanes and cruise and cargo ships.","As a solution to this problem, the prior art teaches the use of mats, liquid cleaners and disinfectants, spray-on disinfectants, and the use of pressurized water. These devices all teach cleaning and\/or disinfecting of footwear by a single cleaning or disinfecting means. The prior art does not teach a multi-functioning device capable of thoroughly cleaning the footwear by using a combination of cleaning techniques.","In one aspect, the invention is a cleaner and disinfectant apparatus for footwear. In this aspect, the cleaner and disinfectant includes a support base having an upper surface having an upper surface window, a lower surface, one or more side surfaces, and a hollow interior within the upper surface, the lower surface, and the one or more side surfaces. The cleaner and disinfectant also includes a plurality of spaced-apart rotatable elongated brushes positioned within the hollow interior of the support base. According to the invention, at least a portion of the each of the plurality of the spaced-apart rotatable elongated brushes extends through the upper surface. The cleaner and disinfectant apparatus also includes a plurality of spaced-apart disinfectant sources projecting one of UV radiation, nano UV radiation, cold plasma, or non-thermal plasma through the upper surface window of the support base.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"As shown, the cleaning and disinfecting apparatus  includes a support base  having a front side , a back side , and lateral sides  and . As shown in , the apparatus also includes a plurality of spaced-apart cleaning rollers , which as outlined below, are rotatably mounted within the support base . Each roller  may include brushes or bristles, thereby forming an elongated brush, to enhance cleaning.  also includes a plurality of spaced-apart disinfectant sources , which may be a radiation source or a charged particle source. A radiation source may be a UV tube providing UV rays or nano UV rays for killing bacteria and other germs. A charged particle source may be a cold plasma gun or a non-thermal plasma gun which emit an ionized gas that kills harmful bacteria and germs. Whatever the type, the source  is preferably positioned to release the disinfectant medium so that it strikes the footwear at about 90 degrees in order to optimize the disinfecting process.","As shown in , the cleaning rollers  and the disinfectant sources are arranged in an alternating array. This alternating arrangement optimizes cleaning and disinfecting by allowing the charged particle disinfectant or the radiation disinfectant access to bacteria and other germs, as dirt, dust, bacteria, and other micro particles are being physically removed by the rotation of the cleaning rollers .  shows an alternating arrangement having two spaced-apart cleaning rollers  and three spaced-apart disinfectant sources . It should be noted that depending on the requirements, other alternating arrangements may be utilized. For example, the cleaning and disinfecting apparatus  may be an arrangement having only one cleaning roller  flanked by two disinfectant sources , or for example, the apparatus  may have three cleaning rollers  in an alternating arrangement with four disinfectant sources .","It should be noted that the disinfectant source  may be selected based on the application. Thus, in situations where cold plasma particles are most effective, a cold plasma source would be selected, as opposed to a UV source. Alternatively, there may be situations where it is desired to have different types of disinfectant used simultaneously. Thus for example, in such a situation, the illustration of , the middle disinfectant source  may be a UV source, and the outer sources  may be cold plasma sources. Alternatively, the middle source may be a cold plasma source and the two outer sources may be a UV source.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","115","117","120","130","120","118","117","117","119","130","119"]},"As shown the apparatus  also includes a debris collection tray  below the rollers  at the lower surface  for collecting debris removed from the footwear or foot. The collection tray  may be mounted for sliding into and out of the support base . Also shown are cleaner supply cartridges  which may be included, for supplying cleaner to the cleaning rollers. The cleaner supply may be a solid or a liquid cleaner, and the cleaner supply cartridges  may be movable into and out of contact with the rollers. This movement into and out of contact with the roller  may be facilitated by an actuator, outlined below. Arrows  show the displacement movement of the disinfectant cartridges  from an engaged position to a disengaged position. According to one embodiment, the cleaner supply cartridge  supplies liquid cleaner to the roller , so when the cartridge  is engaged with the roller , wet brush cleaning is activated. Dry brush cleaning may be performed when the cartridge  is retracted from the roller .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["140","120","145","120","140","140","120","140","120","140","120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["150","110","150","110","155","150","155","150","151","100","100","185","150","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["3","3","120","320","120","145","140","180","120","170"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["160","100","162","164","100","100","210","220","162","164","140","130","181","180","180","120","205"]},"The CPU controls the operation of the cleaning and disinfecting machine based on input commands from the user via the input device  and a simple operations program stored on the main memory . Thus in operation, when a user stands on the upper surface  of the support base , the user may control the speed, and direction of rotation of the respective cleaning rollers, via the control panel . Thus, rollers may be rotated in similar or opposite directions. A user may also control whether to engage the cleaning supply cartridge  with roller  when cleaning, allowing for wet or dry cleaning. Alternatively, a user may decide if to use the cleaning rollers  only or to use the disinfectant sources  only, or if to use both rollers and disinfectant sources simultaneously. Therefore for example, a user may, via the control panel, shut off the cleaning rollers  and activate the disinfectant sources  only.","What has been described and illustrated herein are preferred embodiments of the invention along with some variations. The terms, descriptions and figures used herein are set forth by way of illustration only and are not meant as limitations. For example, although the cleaning and disinfectant apparatus is outlined for working on footwear, the apparatus may also be used to clean and disinfect feet.
