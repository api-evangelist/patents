Screenings"],"p":["This application is a National Stage Entry of PCT Patent Application No. PCT\/US13\/42689, filed on May 24, 2013, which claims priority of U.S. provisional application Ser. 61\/651,757, filed May 25, 2012, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","This invention was made with government support under CA167291 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to novel salicylic acid derivative compound, compositions containing same and methods inhibiting STAT3 activity or for treating cancer where STAT3\/5 are involved, such as in brain, breast, colon, hematologic, lung, ovarian and prostate cancers using said compounds.","STAT3 is persistently activated in over a dozen types of human cancers, including all the major carcinomas, including breast, brain, colon, pancreas, ovarian, and squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck (SCCHN) cancers, and melanomas as well as some hematologic tumors (Bowman T, et al (2000) Oncogene 19, 2474-88, and Darnell, J. E. (2005) Nat. Med. 1 1, 595-596). As such, there is increasing interest in developing anticancer therapies through the inhibition of persistently active STAT3, especially as a strategy to deal with cancers where physicians are looking to improve the outcome and\/or where even establishing a satisfactory standard of care has been challenging in terms of patient care, quality of life and outcome.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is considered the most aggressive and lethal of brain cancers, with a median survival after treatment of approximately 15 months. Shockingly, these modest results can only be achieved in the relatively young (i.e., <age 70) and otherwise healthy patients. Older patients with GBM, of which there are many, and those with poor performance status at diagnosis have much shorter survivals following identical therapy. In addition, GBM is occurring with increasing frequency in an aging population. Moreover, unlike the more common cancers, such as those of the lung, breast and colon, GBM is neither preventable, nor detectable at a stage when early treatment might be expected to be substantially more effective. Furthermore, despite decades of intensive research, major improvements in overall survival have remained elusive. As such, the development of therapeutic approaches to meet this unmet need is critical.","Brain tumours have been demonstrated to contain rare subpopulations of brain tumour stem cells (BTSCs), which possess the cardinal stem cell properties of clonogenic self-renewal, multipotency and tumourigenicity. The extensive self-renewal and proliferative capacity of BTSCs coupled with their insensitivity to conventional radio- and chemotherapies suggest that they are integral to the growth and post-treatment recurrence of GBM. As such, BTSCs represent a \u201creservoir of disease\u201d that require novel therapeutic approaches to effectively eliminate in order to improve the outcome of GBM.","STAT proteins were originally discovered as latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that mediate cytokine and growth factor responses (Darnell, J. E., Jr. (1996) Recent Prog. Norm. Res. 51, 391-403; Darnell, J. E. (2005) Nat. Med. 1 1, 595-596). Seven members of the family, STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5a and STAT5b, and STATE, mediate several physiological effects including growth and differentiation, survival, development and inflammation. STATs are SH2 domain-containing proteins. Upon ligand binding to cytokine or growth factor receptors, STATs become phosphorylated on critical Tyr residue (Tyr705 for STAT3) by growth factor receptors, cytoplasmic Janus kinases (Jaks) or Src family kinases. Two phosphorylated and activated STAT monomers dimerize through reciprocal pTyr-SH2 domain interactions, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to specific DNA-response elements of target genes, thereby inducing gene transcription (Darnell, J. E., Jr. (1996) Recent Prog. Norm. Res. 51, 391-403; Darnell, J. E. (2005) Nat. Med. 1 1, 595-596). In contrast to normal STAT signaling, many human solid and hematological tumors harbor aberrant STAT3 activity (Turkson, J. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets 2004, 8, 409-422; Darnell, J. E., Jr. (1996) Recent Prog. Norm. Res. 51, 391-403; Darnell, J. E. (2005) Nat. Med. 11(6), 595-596; Bowman, T. et al. (2000) Oncogene 19(21), 2474-2488; Buettner, et al. (2002) Clin. Cancer Res. 8(4), 945-954; Yu, H. and Jove. R. (2004) Nat. Rev. Cancer 4(2), 97-105; Haura, E. B., et al. (2005) Nat. Clin. Pract. Oncol. 2(6), 315-324).","Of note, STAT3 protein is one of seven family members of the STAT family of transcription factor proteins. STAT3 is activated through phosphorylation of a tyrosine 705 (Y705) that initiates complexation of two phosphorylated STAT3 monomers (pSTAT3). pSTAT3 homodimers are mediated through reciprocal STAT3 Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain-pY705 STAT3 interactions. pSTAT3:pSTAT3 homodimers translocate to the nucleus and bind DNA, promoting STAT3 target gene transcription. Targeting STAT3 has been previously achieved with dominant negative constructs, oligonucleotides or, most commonly, phosphopeptidic agents that mimic the native pY705 containing binding sequence.","Unfortunately, these inhibitors are rapidly degraded in vivo, which limits their use in the clinic. To circumvent these problems, small molecule STAT3 inhibitors were designed for treatment of cancers harboring hyperactivated STAT3 protein. Acid-based inhibitors have been identified in WO2012\/018868 that potently and selectively block STAT3 dimerization and DNA-binding activity, namely, compound 45O, also referred to as BP-1-102 (sometimes referred to as compound 1 herein). Compound 45O in WO2012018868 potently suppresses multiple oncogenic properties in diverse cultured cancer cells (breast, lung, pancreatic, prostate, lung), including: cell proliferation, anchorage-independent cell growth, migration, invasion and motility. It is selective for STAT3, with over 10-fold less binding to 93% homologous STAT protein, STAT1. It showed little or no effect on phosphorylation of Shc, Src, Jak-1\/2, Erk1\/2 or Akt and had no effect on non-transformed cells (NIH 3T3 cells, STAT3 null mouse embryo fibroblasts, or mouse thymus stromal cells, nor does it affect transformed cells that do not harbor activated STAT3). Moreover, BP-1-102 exhibited striking anti-tumor effects in vivo in murine xenograft models of lung or breast cancer resulting in dramatic regression in tumor volumes. Western blots of residual tumors from treated mice showed repression in pSTAT3, cMyc, Cyclin D1, Bcl-xL, Survivin, and VEGF in a dose-dependent manner.","Moreover, genetic and other molecular evidence reveals persistent Tyr phosphorylation of STAT3 is mediated by aberrant upstream Tyr kinases and shows cancer cell requirement for constitutively-active and dimerized STAT3 for tumor maintenance and progression. Thus, in numerous proof-of-concept studies (Turkson, J., et al. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004, 3(3), 261-269; Turkson, J., et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2001, 276(48), 45443-45455; Siddiquee, K.; et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007, 104, 7391-7396; Turkson, J.; et al. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004, 3, 1533-1542; and Turkson, J.; et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2005, 280(38), 32979-32988), inhibition of STAT3 activation or disruption of dimerization induces cancer cell death and tumor regression. Small-molecule STAT3 inhibitors thus provide tools for probing the molecular dynamics of the cellular processing of STAT3 to understand STAT3's role as a signaling intermediate and a molecular mediator of the events leading to carcinogenesis and malignant progression. Moreover, since the STAT3 pathway is a key oncogenic driver in over a dozen types of human cancers, including all the major carcinomas, including breast, brain, colon, pancreas, ovarian, and squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck (SCCHN) cancers, and melanomas as well as some hematologic tumors (Bowman T, et al (2000) Oncogene 19, 2474-88, and Darnell, J. E. (2005) Nat. Med. 1 1, 595-596) the direct inhibition of STAT3 would provide a molecularly targeted route for effectively managing these cancers and especially aggressive forms such as GBM.","In a seminal paper, Carro et al. (463(7279): 318-325, 2010) demonstrated that the Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene abnormally active in GBM, is a critically important mediator of tumour growth and therapeutic resistance in GBM. Poorly treated brain cancers such as gliomas, astrocytomas and glioblastomas harbor constitutively activated STAT3. In addition, a growing body of recent evidence gathered using a variety of different small molecules that indirectly inhibit STAT3 by targeting upstream molecules such as the JAK family members, strongly suggest that STAT3 signaling is crucial for the survival and proliferation of BTSCs and GBM both in vitro and in vivo. However, due to their broad targeting nature existing drugs for treating GBM have limited translational potential due to numerous side effects. Hence, drugs with the ability to more specifically block STAT3 activity may provide effective treatment for GBM patients.","STAT5 signaling, like STAT3 signaling, is transiently activated in normal cells and is deactivated by a number of different cytosolic and nuclear regulators, including phosphatases, SOCS, PIAS, and proteasomal degradation. Like STAT3, STAT5 has gained notoriety for its aberrant role in human cancers and tumorigenesis, having been found to be constitutively activated in many cancers, including those of the breast, liver, prostate, blood, skin, head and neck. (Muller, J., et al. ChemBioChem 2008, 9, 723-727). In cancer cells, STAT5 is routinely constitutively phosphorylated which leads to the aberrant expression of STAT5 target genes resulting in malignant transformation. Cancer cells harbouring persistently activated STAT5 over express anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-xL, Myc and MCL-1, conferring significant resistance to natural apoptotic cues and administered chemotherapeutic agents. Of particular interest, STAT5 has been identified as a key regulator in the development and progression of acute myelogenic (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL; Gouilleux-Gruart, V., et al. Leukemia and Lymphoma 1997, 28, 83-88; Gouilleux-Gruart, V., et al. Blood 1996, 87, 1692-1697; Weber-Nordt, R. M., et al. Blood 1996, 88, 809-816). Moreover, inhibitors of upstream STAT5 activators (such as JA and FLT3) have been shown to exhibit promising anti-cancer properties (Pardanani, A., et al. Leukemia 2011, 25, 218-225; Quintas-Cardama, A., et al. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 2011, 10, 127-140).","It should be noted that, medical benefits through the inhibition of STAT3\/5 are not limited to the various forms of cancer described herein where these targets are constitutively activated, but would also be applicable to treating other conditions where these pathways are know to play a key role, such as, but not limited to autoimmune disorders (Harris, T. J.; et al Immunol. (2007) 179(7): 4313-4317), inflammation associated with arthritis (Miyamoto. T, et al, Arthritis Research & Therapy (2012), 14(Suppl 1):P43), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (World J Gastroenterol. (2008) 14(33): 5110-5114.), diabetes (Mashili, F.; et al (2013) Diabetes 62(2), 457-465), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); kidney disease (Weimbs, T., (2013) JAK-STAT, 2(2), 0-1) and organ transplant (Debonera, F.; et al (2001) J. Surg. Res. 96(2), 289-295).","Despite advances in drug discovery directed to identifying inhibitors of STAT protein activity, there is still a scarcity of compounds that are both potent, efficacious, and selective activators of STAT3 and STAT5 and also effective in the treatment of cancer and other diseases associated with dysfunction in STAT3, STAT5 or both proteins, and diseases in which one or both of STAT3 and STAT5 is involved. Moreover, there is still a need for optimization of potency and reduced pharmacokinetic liabilities of existing compounds.

Such methods are well known to those skilled in the art and include, but are not limited to, oral administration, transdermal administration, administration by inhalation, nasal administration, topical administration, intravaginal administration, ophthalmic administration, intraaural administration, intracerebral administration, rectal administration, sublingual administration, buccal administration, and parenteral administration, including injectable such as intravenous administration, intra-arterial administration, intramuscular administration, and subcutaneous administration. Administration can be continuous or intermittent. In various aspects, a preparation can be administered therapeutically; that is, administered to treat an existing disease or condition. In further various aspects, a preparation can be administered prophylactically; that is, administered for prevention of a disease or condition.","The term \u201ccontacting\u201d as used herein refers to bringing a disclosed compound and a cell, target STAT3 protein, or other biological entity together in such a manner that the compound can affect the activity of the target (e.g., spliceosome, cell, etc.), either directly; i.e., by interacting with the target itself, or indirectly; i.e., by interacting with another molecule, co-factor, factor, or protein on which the activity of the target is dependent.","As used herein, the terms \u201ceffective amount\u201d and \u201camount effective\u201d refer to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired result or to have an effect on an undesired condition. For example, a \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic result or to have an effect on undesired symptoms, but is generally insufficient to cause adverse side effects. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration; the route of administration; the rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of a compound at levels lower than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. If desired, the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration. Consequently, single dose compositions can contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. The dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any contraindications. Dosage can vary, and can be administered in one or more dose administrations daily, for one or several days. Guidance can be found in the literature for appropriate dosages for given classes of pharmaceutical products. In further various aspects, a preparation can be administered in a \u201cprophylactically effective amount\u201d; that is, an amount effective for prevention of a disease or condition.","As used herein, \u201cEC,\u201d is intended to refer to the concentration of a substance (e.g., a compound or a drug) that is required for 50% agonism or activation of a biological process, or component of a process, including a protein, subunit, organelle, ribonucleoprotein, etc. In one aspect, an ECcan refer to the concentration of a substance that is required for 50% agonism or activation in vivo, as further defined elsewhere herein.

In some contexts, an ICcan refer to the plasma concentration of a substance that is required for 50% inhibition of an in vivo activity or process as further defined elsewhere herein, e.g. tumor growth in an animal or human. In other contexts, STAT3 ICrefers the half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC) of a substance or compound required to inhibit a process or activity an in vitro context, e.g. a cell-free or cell-based assay. For example, the STAT3 ICcan be in the context of the half-maximal concentration required to inhibit cell growth. As discussed below, the response is measured in a cell-line with aberrant STAT3 activity. Alternatively, the response is measured in a cell-line with persistently active STAT3. The response can be determined using a cell-line derived from a human breast cancer, human pancreatic cancer, and human prostate cancer. For example, the response can be measured in a cell-line selected from MDA-MB-231, Pane-1, and DU-145. Cell-lines transfected with specific genes can also be used. For example, the response can be measured in a cell-line transfected with v-Src. Alternatively, the cell-line transfected with v-Src is a permanent cell-line. In some cases, the STAT3 ICis the half-maximal concentration required to inhibit STAT3 activity in a cell-free assay, e.g. an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (\u201cEMSA\u201d). Alternatively, the STAT3 ICis the half-maximal concentration required to inhibit cell-growth, cell viability or cell migration activity.","As used herein, the term \u201cSTAT3 K\u201d refers to the binding affinity of a compound or substance for the STAT3 determined in an in vitro assay.

Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants. These compositions can also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents such as paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid and the like. It can also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin, which delay absorption. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide, poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable media just prior to use. Suitable inert carriers can include sugars such as lactose. Desirably, at least 95% by weight of the particles of the active ingredient have an effective particle size in the range of 0.01 to 10 micrometers.","A residue of a chemical species, as used in the specification and concluding claims, refers to the moiety that is the resulting product of the chemical species in a particular reaction scheme or subsequent formulation or chemical product, regardless of whether the moiety is actually obtained from the chemical species.","As used herein, the term \u201csubstituted\u201d is contemplated to include all permissible substituents of organic compounds. In a broad aspect, the permissible substituents include acyclic and cyclic, branched and unbranched, carbocyclic and heterocyclic, and aromatic and nonaromatic substituents of organic compounds.

For purposes of this disclosure, the heteroatoms, such as nitrogen, can have hydrogen substituents and\/or any permissible substituents of organic compounds described herein which satisfy the valences of the heteroatoms. This disclosure is not intended to be limited in any manner by the permissible substituents of organic compounds. Also, the terms \u201csubstitution\u201d or \u201csubstituted with\u201d include the implicit proviso that such substitution is in accordance with permitted valence of the substituted atom and the substituent, and that the substitution results in a stable compound, e.g., a compound that does not spontaneously undergo transformation such as by rearrangement, cyclization, elimination, etc. It is also contemplated that, in certain aspects, unless expressly indicated to the contrary, individual substituents can be further optionally substituted (i.e., further substituted or unsubstituted).","In defining various terms, \u201cA\u201d, \u201cA\u201d, \u201cA\u201d, and \u201cA\u201d are used herein as generic symbols to represent various specific substituents.

When \u201calkyl\u201d is used in one instance and a specific term such as \u201calkylalcohol\u201d is used in another, it is not meant to imply that the term \u201calkyl\u201d does not also refer to specific terms such as \u201calkylalcohol\u201d and the like. [0086] This practice is also used for other groups described herein. That is, while a term such as \u201ccycloalkyl\u201d refers to both unsubstituted and substituted cycloalkyl moieties, the substituted moieties can, in addition, be specifically identified herein; for example, a particular substituted cycloalkyl can be referred to as, e.g., an \u201calkylcycloalkyl.\u201d Similarly, a substituted alkoxy can be specifically referred to as, e.g., a \u201chalogenated alkoxy,\u201d a particular substituted alkenyl can be, e.g., an \u201calkenylalcohol,\u201d and the like.

W. Greene, P. G. M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience, 1999).","The term \u201corganic residue\u201d defines a carbon containing residue, i.e., a residue comprising at least one carbon atom, and includes but is not limited to the carbon-containing groups, residues, or radicals defined hereinabove. Organic residues can contain various heteroatoms, or be bonded to another molecule through a heteroatom, including oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, or the like. Examples of organic residues include but are not limited alkyl or substituted alkyls, alkoxy or substituted alkoxy, mono or di-substituted amino, amide groups, etc. Organic residues can preferably comprise 1 to 18 carbon atoms, 1 to 15, carbon atoms, 1 to 12 carbon atoms, 1 to 8 carbon atoms, 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or 1 to 4 carbon atoms.

An organic radical can have, for example, 1-26 carbon atoms, 1-18 carbon atoms, 1-12 carbon atoms, 1-8 carbon atoms, 1-6 carbon atoms, or 1-4 carbon atoms. In a further aspect, an organic radical can have 2-26 carbon atoms, 2-18 carbon atoms, 2-12 carbon atoms, 2-8 carbon atoms, 2-6 carbon atoms, or 2-4 carbon atoms. Organic radicals often have hydrogen bound to at least some of the carbon atoms of the organic radical.

The inorganic radicals do not have bonded therein the metallic elements of the periodic table (such as the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, transition metals, lanthanide metals, or actinide metals), although such metal ions can sometimes serve as a pharmaceutically acceptable cation for anionic inorganic radicals such as a sulfate, phosphate, or like anionic inorganic radical. Inorganic radicals do not comprise metalloids elements such as boron, aluminum, gallium, germanium, arsenic, tin, lead, or tellurium, or the noble gas elements, unless otherwise specifically indicated elsewhere herein.","Compounds described herein can contain one or more double bonds and, thus, potentially give rise to cis\/trans (E\/Z) isomers, as well as other conformational isomers. Unless stated to the contrary, the invention includes all such possible isomers, as well as mixtures of such isomers.","Unless stated to the contrary, a formula with chemical bonds shown only as solid lines and not as wedges or dashed lines contemplates each possible isomer, e.g., each enantiomer and diastereomer, and a mixture of isomers, such as a racemic or scalemic mixture. Compounds described herein can contain one or more asymmetric centers and, thus, potentially give rise to diastereomers and optical isomers. Unless stated to the contrary, the present invention includes all such possible diastereomers as well as their racemic mixtures, their substantially pure resolved enantiomers, all possible geometric isomers, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Mixtures of stereoisomers, as well as isolated specific stereoisomers, are also included. During the course of the synthetic procedures used to prepare such compounds, or in using racemization or epimerization procedures known to those skilled in the art, the products of such procedures can be a mixture of stereoisomers.","Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms having the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and l or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or l meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these compounds, called stereoisomers, are identical except that they are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer can also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture. Many of the compounds described herein can have one or more chiral centers and therefore can exist in different enantiomeric forms. If desired, a chiral carbon can be designated with an asterisk (*). When bonds to the chiral carbon are depicted as straight lines in the disclosed formulas, it is understood that both the (R) and (S) configurations of the chiral carbon, and hence both enantiomers and mixtures thereof, are embraced within the formula. As is used in the art, when it is desired to specify the absolute configuration about a chiral carbon, one of the bonds to the chiral carbon can be depicted as a wedge (bonds to atoms above the plane) and the other can be depicted as a series or wedge of short parallel lines is (bonds to atoms below the plane). The Cahn-Inglod-Prelog system can be used to assign the (R) or (S) configuration to a chiral carbon.","Compounds described herein comprise atoms in both their natural isotopic abundance and in non-natural abundance. The disclosed compounds can be isotopically-labelled or isotopically-substituted compounds identical to those described, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as H, H, C, C, N, O, O, S, F, and Cl, respectively. Compounds further comprise prodrugs thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds or of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and\/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as H and C are incorporated, are useful in drug and\/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., H, and carbon-14, i.e., C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of the present invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labelled reagent for a non-isotopically labelled reagent.","The compounds described in the invention can be present as a solvate. In some cases, the solvent used to prepare the solvate is an aqueous solution, and the solvate is then often referred to as a hydrate. The compounds can be present as a hydrate, which can be obtained, for example, by crystallization from a solvent or from aqueous solution. In this connection, one, two, three or any arbitrary number of solvate or water molecules can combine with the compounds according to the invention to form solvates and hydrates. Unless stated to the contrary, the invention includes all such possible solvates.","The term \u201cco-crystal\u201d means a physical association of two or more molecules which owe their stability through non-covalent interaction. One or more components of this molecular complex provide a stable framework in the crystalline lattice. In certain instances, the guest molecules are incorporated in the crystalline lattice as anhydrates or solvates, see e.g. \u201cCrystal Engineering of the Composition of Pharmaceutical Phases.

These compounds are tested for their inhibitory activity of STAT5\/5. These two proteins have been shown to be involved in various cancers. In will be demonstrated herein that the compounds of the present invention, in comparison to other compounds that are known to be useful for treating various cancers are in fact more potent. With consideration for improving cell and BBB permeability, prodrugs designed herein were synthesized to conceal either one of, or both of, the anionic hydroxyl and carboxylic acid of the salicylic group. In this sub-family, alkyl (39-40), acetoxymethyl (AOM) (26), pivaloyloxymethyl (POM) (27), and the acetylated prodrug (22, 23) of the salicylic acid were prepared to enhance cell permeability (Table 1). In addition to salicylic acid, a phosphotyrosine-like phosphonate derivative of 1 was prepared, 21 and the prodrug analog, 20. For purposes of developing a structure activity relationship, the relative ring positions of the hydroxy- and carboxylate groups were inversed (38), the hydroxyl substituent replaced with a fluoride (33, 43) or removed entirely and replaced with a hydrogen atom (31, 42). The electronegative fluorinated analogs, 33, 43, were prepared to lower inhibitor polarity by reducing the charge on carboxylate and thus, for improving cell permeability. As an additional benefit, the hydroxyl group deletion or replacement with fluorine would preclude phase II glucoronidation. To further investigate the role of the salicylic acid in binding STAT3, an N-hydroxyl amino (32, 44), sulfonamide (12-15), sulfonamine (16), tetrazole (35, 41) and N-hydoxy-oxamic acid (28, 46) derivatives were prepared. Selected prodrug analogs of the bioisosteres were also prepared (17-18). Compounds 12-13 and 36, possessing bulky hydrophobic naphthyl group or benzene, respectively, lacking the key salicylic acid, and were synthesized as negative controls. Chemical synthetic routes toward all compounds shown are reported herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0168","num":"0166"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

activity against a set of three representative GBM BTSCs derived from GBM patients, including the very aggressive GBM BTSC lines, BTSC73M, BTSC30M, BTSC68EF. Dissociated BTSC spheres were seeded at 1500 cells\/96-well and treated with drug compound or vehicle (DMSO) one day after plating. Cell viability following drug treatment was assessed after 72 hrs using the ALAMARBLUE\u2122 assay (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All culture experiments were performed in triplicate with a minimum of three wells per condition.

Consistent with findings in other tumour cells harbouring activated STAT3, compound 1 exhibited low \u03bcM activity (). Most encouragingly, the library prepared exhibited a number of more potent inhibitors that exhibited low nanomolar (nM) ICcytotoxicity values against BTSCs, including unprecedented activity against 73M. Of note, the tolyl analogs (R=tolyl, 18, 23, 42-46) were poorly soluble and exhibited much reduced activity cf the pentafluorobenzene Rcounterparts which gave homogenous solutions. The top four ranked compounds, 22, 31, 32, and 33, which displayed ICvalues ranging from 100 nM to 3.8 \u03bcM were further investigated against BTSCs, 25M, 67EF, 73EF, 84EF and 127EF which represent the molecular heterogeneity of human GBMs (). Across, all 8 BTSCs evaluated, compounds 22 and 31-33 showed remarkable activity, with ECs ranging from 66-1145 nM. However, of the top four agents evaluated, compound 31, equipped with a benzoic acid substituent, exhibited significantly higher potency against a larger number of BTSCs. Most notably, against 127EF, 31, with an EC66\u00b133.9 nM, represents the most potent small molecule inhibitor of a BTSC, more potent even than Cucurbitacin (EC=630 nM and 700 nM v.s. 30M and 73M respectively).","Given the nM cytoxicity, these compounds were assayed for biological effects in healthy cells. A series of normal human fetal astrocytes (HF 2003, HF 2006, HF 2009, HF 2013), were subjected to top three inhibitors at concentrations up to 5 \u03bcM (10-20 fold higher than reported ICs against BTSCs). As shown in , compounds 22, 31 and 32 showed minimal toxicity at concentrations of up to 5 \u03bcM in normal human cells, identifying a clear therapeutic window for these agents in GBM.","Next, to confirm retention of STAT3 binding affinity, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding experiments were performed using a ProteOn XPR36 (Bio-rad). Briefly, full length His-tagged STAT3 protein (SignalChem) was immobilized onto THE sensor chip (bio-Rad, Ontario, Canada). To determine the kinetic association and dissociation rate constants (kand k), drug-protein binding was evaluated at varying concentrations. Most encouragingly, all four compounds exhibited potent nM binding potencies (). Compound 31 was shown to be the most potent binder, with a K(k\/k)=300\u00b127 nM. Thus, with the results reported above, when compared to what exists in the prior art, compound 31 represents the most potent, non-phosphorylated STAT3 inhibitor reported to-date, with low nM Kvalues against STAT3 protein. Studies reported on  were done at multiple concentrations, i.e. 5.000, 1.667, 0.556, and 0.185 \u03bcM.","Next, to examine disruption of phosphopeptide:STAT3 SH2 domain complexation events, compounds were subjected to a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay as previously reported by Schust, J., et al. (330, 114-118, 2004) and Wu, P. et al. (249, 29-36, 1997). Briefly, fluorescein labeled peptide probe (5-FAM-GpYLPQTV-NH(CanPeptide) was incubated with STAT3 protein (SignalChem) and inhibitor for 30 minutes and then analyzed on a Tecan M1000 fluorimeter (Tecan). Polarized fluorescence was plotted against concentration of inhibitor and ICvalues determined by fitting to a dose response curve. Relative to compound 1, many of the new derivatives showed improved binding activity. As expected, in an extracellular setting, prodrug analogs, 17-20, 22, 26-27 and 39-40 displayed no binding activity. In addition, negative control 36, lacking the salicylic acid binding group, showed no disruption of the STAT3:phosphopeptide interaction. Compounds possessing the neutral amidosulfonamide substituent exhibited lower inhibitory potency. Substitution with a hydroxyl-amine (32) showed marked improvements in inhibitory potency. Finally, and in good agreement with SPR data, compound 27 was the most potent inhibitor of STAT3. In addition, 31 displayed a >5 fold selectivity for STAT3 and STAT5 over STAT1 which has anti-tumor roles.","Cellular levels of activated STAT3 activity were determined using Western blot analyses for phosphorylated STAT3, including, Y705 as well as pSTAT3 5727 and downstream target genes, Bcl-xL and Cyclin Dl. Blockade of the STAT3 SH2 domain should not inhibit S727 phosphorylation, only Y705. For protein analysis following drug treatment, BTSC spheres were dissociated to single cells and 1\u00d710cells were treated with drug or vehicle (DMSO) at different concentrations and time points. 15 \u03bcg of protein were loaded on 7.5% or 10% SDS-PAGE gels and trans-blotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were stained with antibodies: phospho-Y705, phospho-S727, Bcl-xL, cyclin D1, PARP and Actin. Bands were visualized with the ECL PLUS\u2122 Western Blotting Detection System and HYPERFILM\u2122 (Amersham). Most encouragingly, at 1 \u03bcM, the top four compounds exhibited potent suppression of pSTAT3 (Y705) with no effect on the total STAT3 concentrations or on pSTAT3 S727 (levels). In addition, off-target effects were not observed against kinase targets including, MAPK or EGFR, as well as structural protein, \u03b2-tubulin. Notably, compounds 22, 31 and 32 showed the most suppression of pSTAT3 (Y705). To determine whether the observed biological responses were STAT3 concentration dependant, and further, to establish the exact pSTAT3 inhibition potency selected BTSCs were treated to varying concentrations of lead inhibitors (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 \u03bcM) and lysates subjected to Western Blot analysis. Most encouragingly, dose-dependent decreases in pSTAT3 levels were observed, as well as potent inhibition of downstream targets involved in cell growth and survival, Cyclin D1 and Bcl-xL. Most notably, compound 31, the most potent compound against BTSCs, exhibited concentration-dependant decreases in pSTAT3 levels that correlated well with observed cytotoxicity and downstream target suppression. Specifically, treatment with compound 31 at 500 nM completely silenced pSTAT3 signalling. Compounds 22 and 32, whilst slightly less potent, still exhibited nM inhibition of pSTAT3.","To further evaluate potential off-target effects, compounds 22, 31 and 32 were screened in vitro for activity against five cancer related kinases, c-Src, ERK1, AKT, JaK1 and JaK2 at 5 \u03bcM (10-15 fold higher than reported ICs against BTSCs). Briefly, this assay employs a radiometric detection system to measure kinase phosphoryl transfer activity. The top three inhibitors exhibited moderate to negligible activity against the bank of kinases. For example, all three compounds showed negligible inhibition of Akt1, Erk1 and JaK1, whilst only exhibiting modest inhibition of c-Src and JaK2 (\u02dc50% inhibition of kinase activity). Thus, since the concentration of inhibitor required to elicit effective kinase inhibition was 15-fold higher than the ICvalues in BTSCs, It thus shows that the biological activity was not a result of upstream JaK kinase inhibition.","To more comprehensively investigate potential off-target effects, 31 was subjected to a kinome screen (101 diverse kinases, DISCOVERX\u2122 KINOMEscan) as well as a protein and receptor screen (21 biologically important G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)). For kinome screening kinases labelled with DNA were treated with compound 31 (500 nM) and incubated with an immobilized ligand designed to capture the target kinase. Ultra-sensitive quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to measure levels of immobilized kinases after treatment with compound 31. The immobilized kinase levels were compared to control samples and hits were designated when the quantity of the seized kinase fell below a 35% threshold. The GPCR screening employed the widely applied PathHunter \u03b2-arrestin GPCR assay platform (DISCOVERX\u2122) to evaluate the activity of compound 31. The GPCRs are widely regarded as a most important family of membrane receptors, due to their master regulatory role in intracellular signal transduction. As a result, GPCRs are among the most heavily investigated drug targets in the pharmaceutical industry. Encouragingly, compound 32, showed no off-target activity against any of the 21 GPCRs tested (500 nM). Moreover, compound 31 at same concentration (500 nM), showed negligible effects against the representative family of kinases including a large number of both SH2 (JaK1 and JaK2) and SH3 (Fes, Fer, Fyn) domain-containing kinases. Lack of off-target kinase activity is illustrated in the TreeSpot dendrogram (). Since there exists an estimated 117 SH2 and 300 SH3 domains, it was important that compound 31 display relative selectivity for the target STAT3 SH2 domain, minimizing undesired off-target biological effects. Taken together, compound 31 exhibited unprecedented cytotoxicity across a range of human BTSCs, exhibited no toxicity in human fetal astrocytes at concentrations 15-20-fold higher than ICs, potently suppressed pSTAT3 at nM concentrations correlating well with in vitro nM Kvalues (SPR), inhibited STAT3's downstream targets and showed no discernible off-target effects at therapeutic doses as assessed by kinome and GPCR screens.","Finally, to establish inhibitors clinical relevance, compound 31's activity was compared against a leading JaK2 inhibitor, WP1066, in 73M, one of the most aggressive BTSC (). Comparative Western blot analyses demonstrated equipotent pSTAT3 suppression at 1 \u03bcM inhibitor concentrations. However, it should be noted that upstream JaK kinase inhibitors have suffered from lack of kinase selectivity and poor in vivo efficacy, including blood brain barrier permeability. As noted previously, the compounds reported herein do not inhibit the JaKs at therapeutic doses and appear to function through STAT3 direct inhibition.","In summary, the most potent, non-phosphorylated, direct-binding, STAT3 SH2 domain inhibitors has been synthesized and tested herein. Moreover, their application in GBM BTSCs, recently reported to harbor high levels of hyperactivated STAT3, which critically, has been shown to be the major driver in brain cancer tumourogenesis and BTSC drug resistance, has been validated. Compound 31 displayed the highest STAT3 binding affinity for a non-phosphorylated, drug-like, small molecule inhibitor (SPR, K=315 nM), and it was shown to effectively disrupt STAT3\/phosphopeptide interactions. Additionally in whole cell studies, the inhibitors presented herein effectively suppress STAT3 phosphorylation and its downstream protein targets (Cyclin D1 and Bcl-xL). The potential of STAT3 inhibitors have now been clearly demonstrated for the first time for the treatment of BTSCs and its clinical efficacy for GBM clinical application.","Having brought light herein on new potent STAT3 inhibitors, where mimetics of the salicylic acid were tested. However, the inventors have also tested other STAT3 inhibitors as reported in WO2012\/018868. These specific compounds are substituents on Rfrom formula 1 above. However, having already defined position R, Rand R, and showed that the compounds obtained were STAT3 inhibitors, the person skilled in the art will also appreciate, with the present invention that in addition to the modifications suggested on Rherein, the other substitutions as suggested in WO2012\/018868 would also produce a compound with STAT3 inhibiting activity. It will however be appreciated that the modifications suggested herein provide new compounds having much better inhibiting activity against STAT3.","It will be appreciated that the amount of a compound of the invention required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular compound selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition for which treatment is required and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician.

Briefly, BTSC cultures were initiated in serum-free defined culture medium (SFM) and gave rise to nonadherent spheres after 7 to 21 days in culture. Primary tumor spheres were expanded for several passages and then cryopreserved in 10% DMSO (Sigma Aldrich) in serum-free defined medium until use in experiments. Human fetal neural stem cells were also cultured as previously described and induced to differentiate into astrocytes by addition of 10% fetal bovine serum and removal of EGF, FGF-2 and heparan sulfate.","Fluorescence Polarization Assay","STAT3, STAT5 and STAT1: The fluorescence polarization studies were performed on an Infinite M1000 (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany) machine using black 384-round bottom well plates (Corning). The buffer used contained 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA and 2 mM dithiothreitol and a final concentration of 5% DMSO.","Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted using a dilution medium consisting of 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM dithiothreitol. Fluorescently-labelled pYLPQTV peptide (FAM-pYLPQTV) was kept at a final concentration of 10 nM in the buffered solution. Non-labelled pYLPQTV peptide was dissolved in DMSO and diluted using the dilution medium for use as a positive control. A calibration curve was performed using 10 nM Fam-pYLPQTV and dilutions of STAT3 and STAT1 protein (5.0 \u03bcL to 2.4 nM) at a final DMSO concentration of 10% ().","The midpoint of the saturation curve was used to determine the STAT3 concentration required for the competitive fluorescent polarization assay. 7.5 \u03bcL of FAM-pYLPQTV peptides was added to the already plated 15 \u03bcL of a 750 nM STAT3 protein solution in 384-flat well plates. 7.5 \u03bcL of inhibitory molecules (and positive control) solution were individually added to the plate.

Results for compounds 22, 31, 32, and 33 are illustrated in .","Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Studies","Interactions of His-tagged STAT3 with small molecules were investigated using SPR spectroscopy. The binding experiments were carried out on a ProteOn XPR36 (Bio-Rad) biosensor at 25\u00b0 C. using the HTE sensor chip (Bio-Rad, Ontario, Canada). The flow cells of the sensor chip were loaded with a nickel solution at 30 \u03bcL\/min for 120 s to saturate the Tris NTA surface with Ni(II) ions. Purified His-tagged STAT3 and STAT5 (SignalChem, British Columbia, Canada) in PBST buffer (PBS with 0.005% (v\/v) Tween-20 and 0.001% DMSO pH 7.4) was injected in the first and second channels of the chip respectively in the vertical direction at a flow rate of 25 \u03bcg\/\u03bcL for 300 s, which attained, on average, 8000 resonance unit (RU). After a wash with PBST buffer, inhibitors binding to the immobilized proteins were monitored by injecting a range of concentrations along with a blank at a flow rate of 100 \u03bcL\/min for 200 s for each of these small molecules. When the injection of the small molecule inhibitor was completed, running buffer was allowed to flow over the immobilized substrates for the non-specifically bound inhibitors to dissociate for 600 s. Following dissociation of the inhibitors, the chip surface was regenerated with an injection of 1 M NaCl at a flow rate of 100 \u03bcL\/ml for 18 s. Interspot channel reference was used for non-specific binding corrections and the blank channel used with each analyte injection served as a double reference to correct for possible baseline drift. Data were analyzed using ProteOn Manager Software version 3.1. The Langmuir 1:1 binding model was used to determine the Kvalues.","Control experiments were conducted to validate protocol.","STAT5 peptide sequence binding to His-Tagged-STAT5 using the protocol above:\n\n","STAT3 peptide sequence binding to His-Tagged-STAT3 using the protocol above:\n\n","Since these inhibitors are designed with the aim to target STAT3, they are most potent in cell lines which are highly reliant on the STAT3 protein. BTSCs are amongst the most deadly STAT3 dependent cancer cell lines identified to date and it is thus why these cell lines display such sensitivity to our STAT3 inhibitors. Nevertheless, as expected, these compounds could also be used to treat other cancers. The rationale is that since the compounds described herein can effectively kill the very resistant and highly deadly BTSCs which are almost irresponsive to most chemotherapy agents, they can be applied against a variety of other cancer cells as well.","In addition to brain cancer, in order to evaluate the potential of the compounds of the present invention for treating other forms of cancer, the ICfor compounds 22, 31, 32, 23, et 33 (also referred to in the table as SH-04-08, SH-04-54, SH-05-07, SH-05-19, AND SH-05-23, respectively) was determined against other STAT3 dependent cancers such as Breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-468), Prostate (PPC1 or DU145) and leukemia cancer cells (AML-2) in parallel with BTSC 30M.

Concentrations of compounds were determined using LC-MS.","As can be seen on , compound 31 was found to be present in the brain with different dosing (10 mg\/kg and 25 mg\/kg) as assessed by LCMS. Compound 31 accumulates up to 0.7 \u03bcM concentrations in the brain in mice models.","As can be seen from , compound 31 accumulates up to 300 nM concentrations in the brain in mice models at 10 mg\/kg dosing.","As can by seen from , compound 32 accumulates up to \u02dc1.2 \u03bcM concentrations in the brain in mice models at 10 mg\/kg dosing.","Plasma concentration of compound 31 increased dose dependently from 0.24 \u03bcM to 0.58 \u03bcM for 10 and 25 mg\/kg, respectively. However, no compound was detected after 5 hr at both doses indicating a fast clearance. Plasma concentration did not change significantly between 30 min. and 300 min for both compounds 31 and 32. For compound 31, about 0.3 \u03bcM compound was seen in the brain of 10 mg\/kg dosed mouse. The brain concentration of compound 32 was at \u02dc1.2 \u03bcM for 10 mg\/kg dosed mouse. The above is a clear indication that the compounds of the present invention can cross the blood brai barrier.","Breast Cancer","Inhibition of Cell Proliferation in ErbB2 Mammary Breast Tumour Cell Lines (NIC)","Compounds were assessed for inhibition of cell proliferation in ErbB2 mammary breast tumour cell lines (NIC) containing the activated form of ErbB2 using a CyQuant Assay. Compound 31 was directly compared to BP-1-102 over a range of concentrations.","Protocol of CyQuant Proliferation Assay","Three individual Mouse Mammary Tumour Virus ErbB2 mammary tumour cell lines (NIC) were resuspended in 10% FBS plus single quots DMEM media to a final concentration of 40,000 cells per 1 mL. Cells were plated at a concentration of 4,000 cells in 100 \u03bcL of media per well on 96 well NUNC plates and incubated for 24 h hours at 37\u00b0 C. plus 5% CO. After 24 hours the media was aspirated and replaced with either normal media, media+DMSO (1:1000) or media containing the appropriate concentration of drug (BP1-102 5 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM or 20 \u03bcM or compound 31, also referred to herein as SH-04-54 5 \u03bcM or 20 \u03bcM). Each condition was repeated in quadruplicate. At predetermined time points; at treatment, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h post treatment, the media was removed from the cells and the plates were stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. wrapped in tin foil. When needed, all the plates were thawed to room temperature.","Invitrogen's CyQuant Cell Proliferation Assay kit was used to measure DNA content. Following their directions, the cell lysis buffer was diluted 1:20 with water and then the CyQuant GR solution 1:400 in the lysis buffer. 200 \u03bcL of the Cyquant solution was added to each well and the plate protected from light. The plates were then incubated for 2-5 minutes protected from light, then read on a fluorescence microplate reader with filters for 480 nm excitation and 520 nm emission maxima. Quadruplicates were averaged and the error bars represent the S.E.M. In some cases the absorbance was normalized to the DMSO control.","In , cells were plated at 4,000 cells per well in a 96 well plate, incubated for 24 hours then treated with 31 at 5 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM and 20 \u03bcM for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Plates were stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. Plates were thawed and treated with Invitrogen's Cyquant Cell Proliferation Assay which measures DNA content. Fluorescence was measured using a fluorescence microplate reader with filters at 480 nm and 520 nm. Each data point was done in quadruplicate and error bars represent S.E.M.","In , cells were plated at 4,000 cells per well in a 96 well plate, incubated for 24 hours then treated with BP1-102 or compound 31 at 5 \u03bcM for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Plates were stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. Plates were thawed and treated with Invitrogen's Cyquant Cell Proliferation Assay which measures DNA content. Fluorescence was measured using a fluorescence microplate reader with filters at 480 nm and 520 nm. Each data point was done in quadruplicate and error bars represent S.E.M.","As can be appreciated, compound 31 is potent at 5 \u03bcM in MMTV ErbB2 mammary tumour cell lines (NIC), completely inhibiting cell proliferation in 2071 NIC cells. In comparison with BP1-102, compound 31 was shown to be more potent over three different breast cancer NIC cell lines, 2071, 8518 and 9822.","While the disclosure has been described in connection with specific embodiments thereof, it is understood that it is capable of further modifications and that this application is intended to cover any variation, use, or adaptation of the disclosure following, in general, the principles of the disclosure and including such departures from the present disclosure that come within known, or customary practice within the art to which the disclosure pertains and as may be applied to the essential features hereinbefore set forth, and as follows in the scope of the appended claims"],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"],"sub":"50 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 5","sub":"50 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 12","sub":"50"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 21"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
