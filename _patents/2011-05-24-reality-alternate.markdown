The owner of the copyright rights has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office publicly available files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","Just as fiction authors have described alternate worlds in novels, this introduces an Alternate Reality\u2014but provides it as technical innovation. This new Alternate Reality's \u201cworld\u201d is named the \u201cExpandaverse\u201d which is a conceptual alteration of the \u201cUniverse\u201d name and a conceptual alteration of our current reality. Where our physical \u201cUniverse\u201d is considered given and physically fixed, the Expandaverse provides a plurality of human created digital realities that includes a plurality of human created means that may be used simultaneously by individuals, groups, institutions and societies to expand the number and types of digital realities\u2014and may be used to provide continuous expansions of a plurality of Alternate Realities. To create the Expandaverse current known technologies are reorganized and combined with new innovations to repurpose what they accomplish and deliver, collectively turning the Earth and near-space into the equivalent of one large, connected room (herein one or a plurality of \u201cShared Planetary Life Spaces\u201d or SPLS) with a plurality of new possible human realities and living patterns that may be combined differently, directed differently and controlled differently than our current physical reality.","In some examples of this Alternate Reality, people are more connected remotely, and are less connected to where they are physically present\u2014and means are provided for multiple new types of devices, connections and \u201cdigital presence\u201d. In some examples of this Alternate Reality, information on how to succeed is automatically collected during a plurality of activities, optimized and delivered to a plurality of others while they are doing the same types of activities, leading to opportunities for higher rates of personal success and greater economic productivity by adopting the most effective new uses, technologies, devices and systems\u2014and means are provided for this. In some examples of this Alternate Reality individuals may establish multiple identities and profiles, associate groups of identities together, and utilize any of them for earning additional income, owning additional wealth or enjoying life in new ways\u2014and means are provided for this. In some examples of this Alternate Reality, means are enumerated for the evolution of multiple types of independent \u201cgovernances\u201d (which are separate from nation state governments) that may be trans-border and increasingly augment \u201cgovernments\u201d in that each \u201cgovernance\u201d provides means for various new types of collective human successes and living patterns that range from personal sovereignty (within a governance), to economic sovereignties (within a governance), to new types of central authorities (within a governance). In some examples of this Alternate Reality, means (herein including means such as an \u201cAlternate Reality Machine\u201d) are provided for each identity (as described elsewhere) to create and manage a plurality of separate human realities that each provides manageable boundaries that determine the \u201cpresence\u201d of that identity, wherein each separate reality may have boundaries such as prioritized interests (to include what is wanted), exclusion filters (to exclude what is not wanted), paywalls (to receive income such as for providing awareness and attention), digital and\/or physical protections (to provide security from what is excluded), etc. In some examples of this Alternate Reality, means are provided for one or a plurality of a new type of Utility(ies) that provides a flexible infrastructure such as for this Alternate Reality's remote presence in Shared Planetary Life Spaces, automated delivery of \u201chow to succeed\u201d interactions, multiple personal identities, creation and control of new types of \u201crealities broadcasting,\u201d independent \u201cgovernances\u201d, and numerous fundamental differences from our current reality. In some examples means are provided for new types of fixed and mobile devices such as \u201cTeleportals\u201d that provide always on \u201cdigital presence\u201d in Shared Life Spaces (which includes the Earth and near space), as well as remote control that treats some current networked electronic devices as \u201csubsidiary devices\u201d and provides means for their shared use, perhaps even evolving some toward becoming accessible and useful commodities. In some examples means are provided to control various networked electronic devices and turn them into commodity \u201csubsidiary devices,\u201d enabling more users at lower cost, including more uses of their applications and digital content. In some examples of this Alternate Reality reporting on the success of various choices settings is visible and widely accessible, and the various components and systems of the Expandaverse may have settings saved, reported on, accessed and distributed for copying; it therefore becomes possible for human economic and cultural evolution to gain a new scope and speed for learning, distributing and adopting what is most effective for simultaneously achieving multiple ranges of both individually and collectively chosen goals. In a brief summation of the Expandaverse it is an Alternate Reality and these are just some of the characteristics of its divergent \u201cdigital realities,\u201d and its scope or scale are not limited by this or by any description of it.","Unlike fiction, however, this is the engineering of an Alternate Reality in which the know-how for achieving human success and human goals is widely delivered and either provided free or sold commercially. It is as if a successful Alternate Reality can now exist in a world parallel to ours\u2014the Expandaverse as a parallel digital \u201cuniverse\u201d\u2014and this describes the devices, technology(ies), infrastructure and \u201cplatform(s)\u201d that comprise it, which is herein named the Alternate Reality Teleportal Machine (ARTPM). With an ARTPM modern technological civilization gains an engineered dynamic machine (that includes devices, utilities, systems, applications, identities, governances, presences, alternate realities, shared life spaces, machines, etc.) that provides means that range from bottom-up support of individuals; to top-down support of collective groups and their goals; with the results from a plurality of activities tracked, measured and reported visibly. In this Alternate Reality, a plurality of ways that people and groups choose to act are known and visible; along with dynamic guidance and reporting so that a plurality of individuals and groups may see what works and rapidly choose higher levels of personal and economic success, with faster rates of growth toward economic prosperity as well as means for disseminating it. In sum, this Alternate Reality differs from current atomized individual technologies in separate fields by presenting a metamorphosized divergent reality that re-interprets and re-integrates current and new technologies to provide means to build a different type of connected, success-focused, and evolving \u201cworld\u201d\u2014an Expandaverse with a range of differences and variations from our own reality.","Just as fiction authors present, the Expandaverse also proposes an alternate history and timeline from our own, which is the same history as ours until a \u201cdigital discontinuity\u201d causes a divergence from our history. Like our reality the Expandaverse had an ancient civilizations and the Middle Ages. It also shared the Age of Physical Discovery in which Columbus discovered the \u201cnew world\u201d and started the \u201cage of new physical property rights\u201d in which new lands were explored and claimed by the English, Spaniards, Dutch, French and others. Each sent settlers out into their new territories. The first settlers received \u201cland grants\u201d for their own farms and \u201chomesteads\u201d. By moving into these new territories the new settlers were granted new property and rights over their new physical properties. As the Earth became claimed as property everywhere, the physical Earth eventually had all of its physical property owned and controlled. Eventually there was no more \u201cfree land\u201d available for granting or taking. Now, when you \u201cmove\u201d someplace new its physical properties are already owned and you must buy your physical property from someone else.","In this alternate history, the advent of an Expandaverse provides new \u201cdigital realities\u201d that can be created, designed for specific purposes, with parts or all of them owned as new \u201cintellectual property(ies),\u201d then modified and improved with the means to create more digital realities\u2014so a plurality of new forms of digital properties may be created continuously, with some more valuable than others, and with new improvements that may be adopted rapidly from others continuously making some types of digital realities (and their digital properties) more valuable than others. Therefore, due to an ARTPM, new digital properties can be continuously created and owned, and multiple different types of digital realities can be created and owned by each person. In the Expandaverse, digital property (such as intellectual properties) may become acceptable new forms of recognized properties, with systems of digital property rights that may be improved and worked out in that alternate timeline. Because the Expandaverse's new \u201cdigital realities\u201d are continuous realities, that intellectual property does not expire (like current intellectual property expires in our Universe) so in the Expandaverse digital property rights are salable and inheritable assets, just as physical property is in the current reality. One of the new components of an Expandaverse is both that new \u201cdigital realities\u201d can be created by individuals, corporations, non-profits, governments, etc.; and these realities and their components can be owned, sold, inherited, etc. with the same differences in values and selling prices as physical properties\u2014but with some key differences: Unlike the physical Earth which ran out of new property after the entire planet was claimed and \u201chomesteaded,\u201d the ARTPM's Expandaverse provides continuous economic and lifestyle opportunities to create new \u201cdigital properties\u201d that can be created, enjoyed, broadcast, shared, improved and sold. The ability to imagine and to copy others' successes becomes new sources of rapidly expanding personal and group wealth when the ability to turn imagination into assets becomes easier, the ability to spread new digital realities becomes an automated part of the infrastructure, and the ability to monetize new digital properties becomes standardized.","In addition, in some examples one or a plurality of these are entertainment properties which include in some examples traditional entertainment properties that include concepts such as new ARTPM devices or ARTPM technologies (such as novels, movies, video games, television shows, songs, art works, theater, etc.); in some examples traditional entertainment properties to which are added ARTPM components such as a constructed digital reality that fits the world of a specific novel, the world of a specific movie, the world of a specific video game, etc.; and in some examples a new type of entertainment such as RealWorld Entertainment (herein RWE) which blends a fictional reality (such as in some examples the alternate history of the Expandaverse) with the real world. into a new type of entertainment that fits in some examples fictional situations, in some examples real situations, in some examples fictional characters' needs, and in some examples real people's needs.","CONCEPT: The literary genre of science fiction was created when authors such as Jules Verne and H. G. Wells reconceptualized the novel as a means for introducing entire worlds containing imagined devices, characters and living patterns that did not exist when they conceived them. Many \u201cnovel\u201d concepts conceived by \u201cnovelists\u201d have since been turned into numerous patented inventions stemming from their stories in numerous fields like submarines, video communications, geosynchronous satellites, virtual reality, the internet, etc. This takes a parallel but different step with technology itself. Rather than starting by writing a fictional novel, this reconceptualizes current and new technology into an Alternate Reality that includes new combinations, new machines, new devices, new utilities, new communications connections, new \u201cpresences\u201d, new information \u201cflows,\u201d new identities, new boundaries, new governances, new realities, etc. that provide an innovative reality-wide machine with technologies that focus on human success and economic abundance. In its largest sense it utilizes digital technologies to reconceptualize reality as under both collective and individual control, and provides multiple means that in combination may achieve that.","PARALLELS: An analogy is electricity that flows from standardized wall sockets in nearly every room and public place, so it is now \u201cstandard\u201d to plug in a wide range of \u201cstandardized\u201d electrical devices, turn them on and use them (as one part of this example, the electric plug that transfers power from a standardized electric power grid is itself numerous inventions with many patents; the simple electric plug did not begin with universal utility and connectivity). Herein, it is a startling idea that human success, remote digital presence (Shared Planetary Life Spaces or SPLS), multiple identities, individually controlled boundaries that define multiple personal realities, new types of governances, and\/or myriad opportunities to achieve wider economic prosperity might be \u201cuniversally delivered\u201d during everyday activities over the \u201cutility(ies)\u201d equivalent to an electric power grid, by standardized means that are equivalents to multiple types of electric plugs. In this Alternate Reality, personal and group success are not just sometimes possible for a few who acquire an education, earn a lot of money and piece together disparate complex products and services. Instead, this Alternate Reality may provide new means to turn the world and near-space into one shared, successful digital room. In that Alternate Reality \u201croom\u201d the prosperity and quality of life of individuals, groups, companies, organizations, societies and economies\u2014right through civilization itself\u2014might be reborn for those at the bottom, expanded for those part-way up the ladder, and opened to new heights for those at the top\u2014while being multiplied for everyone by being delivered in simultaneous multiple versions that are individually modifiable by commonly accessible networks and utility(ies). Given today's large and growing problems such as the intractability of poverty, economic stagnation of the middle-class, short lifetimes that cannot be meaningfully extended, incomes that do not support adequate retirement by the majority, some governments that contain human aspirations rather than achieve them, and other limitations of our current reality, a world that gains the means to become one large, shared and successful room, would unquestionably be an Alternate Reality to ours.","SAME TECHNOLOGIES PLUS INNOVATIONS: This Alternate Reality shares much with our current reality, including most of our history, along with our underlying principles of physics, chemistry, biology and other sciences\u2014and it also shares our current technologies, devices, networks, methods and systems that have been invented from those sciences. Those are employed herein and their teachings are not repeated. However, this Alternate Reality is based on a reconceptualization of those scientific and technological achievements plus more, so that their net result is a divergent reality whose processes focus more on means to expand humanity's success and satisfaction; with new abilities to transform a plurality of issues, problems and crises on both individual and group levels; along with new opportunities to achieve economic prosperity and abundance.","A DIFFERENCE FROM ONE PHYSICAL REALITY\u2014MULTIPLE DIGITAL REALITIES: The components of this Alternate Reality are numerous and substantially different from our reality. One of the major differences is with the way \u201creality\u201d is viewed today. The current reality is physical and local and it is well-known to everyone\u2014when you walk down a public city street you are present on the street and can see all the people, sidewalks, buildings, stores, cars, streetlights, security cameras\u2014literally everything that is present on the street with you. Similarly, all the people present on that street at that time can see you, and when you are physically close enough to someone else you can also hear each other. Today's digital technologies are implicitly different. Using a telephone, video conference, video call, etc. involves identifying a particular person or group and then contacting that person or group by means such as dialing a phone number, entering a web address, connecting two video conferencing systems at a particular meeting time, making a computer video phone call, etc. Though not explicitly expressed, digital contact implies a conscious and mechanical act of connecting two specific people (or connecting two specific groups in a video conference). Unlike being simultaneously present like in physical reality, making digital contact means reaching out and employing a particular device and communication means to make a contact and have that accepted. Until you attempt this contact and another party accepts it, you do not see and hear others digitally, and those people do not see you or hear you digitally. This is fundamentally different from the ARTPM, one of whose means is expressed herein as Shared Planetary Life Spaces (or SPLS's).","DEVICES\u2014Current devices (which include hardware, software, networks, services, data, entertainment, etc.): The current reality's means for these various types of digital contact, communications and entertainment superficially appear diverse and numerous. A partial list includes mobile phones, wearable digital devices, PCs, laptops, netbooks, tablets, pads, online games, television set-top boxes, \u201csmart\u201d networked televisions, digital video recorders, digital cameras, surveillance cameras, sensors (of many types), web browsers, the web, Web applications, websites, interactive Web content, etc. These numerous different digital devices have separate operating systems, interfaces and networks; different means of use for communications and other tasks; different content types that sometimes overlap with each other (with different interfaces and means for accessing the same types of content); etc. There are so many types and so many products and services in each type that it may appear to be an entire world of differences. When factored down, however, their similarities overwhelm their differences. Many of these different devices provide the same features with different interfaces, media, protocols, networks, operating systems, applications, etc.: They find, open, display, scroll, highlight, link, navigate, use, edit, save, record, play, stop, fast forward, fast reverse, look up, contact, connect, communicate, attach, transmit, disconnect, copy, combine, distribute, redistribute, broadcast, charge, bill, make payments, accept payments, etc. In a current reality that superficially appears to have too many different types of devices and interfaces to ever be made simple and productive, the functional similarities are revealing. This is fundamentally different from the ARTPM which simplifies devices into Teleportals plus networked electronic devices (including some applications and some digital content) that may be remotely controlled and used as \u201csubsidiary devices,\u201d to reduce some types of complexity while increasing productivity at lower costs, by means of a shared and common interface. Again, the Expandaverse's digital reality may turn some electronic devices and some of their uses into the digital equivalent of one simpler connected room.","REVERSALS, DIVERGENCES, TRANSFORMATIONS: At a high level this Alternate Reality includes numerous major reversals, divergences and transformations from the current physical reality and its devices, which are described herein: A partial list of current assumptions that are simultaneously reversed or transformed includes:","Realities: FROM one reality TO multiple realities (with multiple identities).","Control over Reality: FROM one reality controls people TO we each choose and control our own multiple identities and each identity's one or multiple digital realities.","Boundaries: FROM invisible and unconscious TO explicit, visible and managed.","Death: FROM one too short life without real life extension, TO horizontal life expansion through multiple identities.","Presence: FROM where you are in a physical location TO everywhere in one or a plurality of digital presences (as one individual or as multiple identities).","Connectedness: FROM separation between people TO always on connections.","Contacts: FROM trying to phone, conference or contact a remote recipient TO always present in a digital Shared Space(s) from your current Device(s) in Use.","Success: FROM you figure it out TO success is delivered by one or a plurality of networks and\/or utilities.","Privacy: FROM private TO tracked, aggregated and visible (especially \u201cbest choices\u201d so leaping ahead is obvious and normal)\u2014with some types of privacy strengthened because multiple identities also enable private identities and even secret identities.","Ownership of Your Attention: FROM you give it away free TO you can earn money from it (via Paywalls) if you want.","Ownership of Devices and Content: FROM each person buys these TO simplified access and sharing of commodity resources.","Trust: FROM needing protection TO most people are good when instantly identified and classified, with automated protection from others.","Networks: FROM transmission and communications TO identifying, tracking and surfacing behavior and identity(ies).","Network Communications: FROM electronic (web, e-store, email, mobile phone calls, e-shopping\/e-catalogs, tweets, social media postings, etc.) TO personal and face-to-face, even if non-local.","Knowledge: FROM static knowledge that must be found and figured out TO active knowledge that finds you and fits your needs to know.","Rapidly Advancing Devices: FROM you're on your own TO two-way assistance.","Buying: FROM selling by push (marketing and sales) and pull (demand) TO interactive during use, based on your current actions, needs and goals.","Culture: FROM one common culture with top-down messages TO we each choose our multiple cultures and set our boundaries (paywalls, priorities [what's in], filters [what's out], protection, etc.) for each of our self-directed realities.","Governances: FROM one set of broad and \u201cwe control you\u201d governments TO governments plus choosing your goals and then choosing one or multiple governances that help achieve the goals you want.","Acceptance of limits: FROM we are only what we are TO we each choose large goals and receive two-way support, with multiple new ways to try and have it all (both individually and collectively).","Thus, the current reality starts with physical reality predominant and one-by-one short digital contacts secondary, with numerous different types of devices for many of the same types of functions and content. The \u201cAlternate Reality Teleportal Machine\u201d (ARTPM) enables multiple realities, multiple digital identities, personal choice over boundaries (for multiple types of personal boundaries), with new devices, platforms and infrastructures\u2014and much more.","The ARTPM ultimately begs for fundamental questions: Can we be happier? Significantly better? Much more successful? Able to turn obstacles into achievements? If we can choose our own realities, if we can create realities, if we can redesign realities, if we can surface what succeeds best and distribute and deliver that rapidly worldwide via the everyday infrastructure\u2014in some examples to those who need it, at the time and place they need to succeed\u2014then who or what will we choose to be? What will we want to become next? How long will it be before we choose our dreams and attempt to reach them both individually and collectively?","The ARTPM helps make reality into a do-it-yourself opportunity. It does this by reversing a plurality of current assumptions and shows that in some examples these reversals are substantial. In some examples people are more present remotely than face-to-face, and focus on those remote individuals, groups, places, tools, resources, etc. that are most interesting to them, rather than have a primary focus on the people where they are physically present. In some examples the main purposes of networks and communications are to track and surface behavior and activities, so that networks and various types of remote applications constantly know a great deal about who does what, where, when and how\u2014right down to the level of each individual (though people may have private and secret identities that maintain confidentiality); this is a main part of transforming networks into a new type of utility that does more than provide communications and access to online content and services, and new online components serve individuals (in some examples helping them succeed) by knowing what they are doing, and helping them overcome difficulties. In some examples being tracked, recorded and broadcasted is a normal part of everyday life, and this offers new social and business opportunities; including both personal broadcast opportunities and new types of privacy options. In some examples active knowledge, information and entertainment is delivered where and when needed by individuals (in some examples by an Active Knowledge Machine [AKM], Active Knowledge Interactions [AKI], and contextually appropriate Active Knowledge [AK]), to raise individual success and satisfaction in a plurality of tasks with a plurality of devices (in some examples various everyday products and services) Combined, AKI\/AK are designed to raise productivity, outcomes and satisfaction, which raises personal success (both economic and in other ways), and produce a positive impact on broader economic growth such as through an ability to identify and spread the most productive tools and technologies. In addition, Active Knowledge offers new business models and opportunities\u2014in some examples the ability to sell complete lifestyles with packages of products and services that may deliver measurable and even assured levels of personal success and\/or satisfaction, or in some examples the ability to provide new types of \u201cgovernances\u201d whose goals include collective successes, etc. In some examples privacy is not as available for individuals, corporations and institutions; more of what each person does is tracked, recorded and\/or reported publicly; but because of these tracked data and interactions, dynamic continuous improvement may be built into a plurality of online capabilities that employ Active Knowledge of both behaviors and results. The devices, systems and abilities to improve continuously, and deliver those capabilities online as new services and\/or products, are owned and controlled by a plurality of individuals and independent \u201cgovernances,\u201d as well as by companies, organizations and governments.","In some examples, various types of Teleportal Devices automatically discover their appropriate connections and are configured automatically for their owner's account(s), identity(ies) and profile(s). Advance or separate knowledge of how to turn on, configure, login and\/or use devices, services and new capabilities successfully is reduced substantially by automation and\/or delivery of task-based knowledge during installation and use. In addition, an adaptable consistent user interface is provided across Teleportal Devices. In some examples a visible model of \u201csee the best and most successful choices\u201d then \u201ctry them and you'll succeed in using them\u201d then \u201cif you fail keep going and you'll be shown how\u201d is available like electricity, as a new type of utility\u2014to enable \u201cfast follower\u201d processes so more may reach the higher levels of success sooner. While the nation state and governments continue, in some examples multiple simultaneous types of \u201cgovernances\u201d provide options that a plurality of individuals may join, leave, or have different types of associations with multiple governances at one time. Three of a plurality of types of governances are illustrated herein including an IndividualISM in which each member has virtual personal sovereignty and self-control (including in some examples the right to establish a plurality of virtual identities, and own the work, properties, incomes and assets from their multiple identities); a CorporatISM in which one or a group of corporations may sell plans that include targeted levels of personal success (such as an \u201cupward mobility lifestyle\u201d) across a (potentially broad) package of products and services consumption levels (that can include in some examples housing, transportation, financial services, consumer goods, lifelong education, career success, wealth and lifestyle goals, etc.); a WorldISM in which a central governance supports and\/or requires a set of values (that may include in some examples environmental practices, beliefs, codes of conduct, etc.) that span national boundaries and are managed centrally; or different types of new and potentially useful types of governances (as may be exemplified by any field of focused interest and activity such as photography, fashion, travel, participating in a sport, a non-mainstream lifestyle such as nudism, a parent's group such as local PTA, a type of charity such as Ronald McDonald Houses, etc.). While life spans are limited by human genetics, in some examples individuals have the equivalent of life extension by being able to enjoy multiple identities (that is, multiple lives) at one time during their one life time. Multiple identities also provide greater freedom and economic independence by using multiple identities that may each own assets, businesses, etc. in addition to a single individual's normal job and salary, or have multiple identities that may be used to try and enjoy multiple lifestyles. Within one's limited life span, multiple identities provide each person the opportunity to experience multiple \u201clives\u201d (in some examples multiple lifestyles and multiple incomes) where each identity can be created, changed, or eliminated at any time, with the potential for an additional identity(ies) or group of identities to become wealthier, adventurous and\/or happier than one's everyday typical wage-earning \u201cself\u201d. In some examples human success is an engineered dynamic process that operates to help a plurality of those who are connected by means of an agnostic infrastructure whose automated and self-improving human success systems range from bottom-up support of individuals who operate independently, to top-down determination and \u201cselling\u201d of collective goals by new types of \u201cGovernances\u201d that seek to influence and control groups (in some examples by IndividualISMs, CorporatISMs, WorldISMs, or other types of Governances). In some examples individuals and groups may leap ahead with a visible \u201cfast follower\u201d process: Humanity's status and results in a plurality of areas are reported publicly and visibly so that a plurality of ways that people and groups choose and construct this Alternate Reality are known and visible, including a plurality of their \u201cbest\u201d and most successful activities, devices, actions, goals, rates of success, results and satisfaction (that is, more of what we choose, do and achieve is tracked, measured, reported visibly, etc.) so that people may know a plurality of the choices, products, services, etc. work best, and a plurality of individuals and groups may use this reporting. There are direct processes for accessing the same choices, settings, configurations, etc. that produce the \u201cbest\u201d successes so that others may copy them, try them and switch to those that work best for them, based on what they want to achieve for themselves, their families, those with whom they enjoy Shared Planetary Life Spaces, etc.","In sum, while today's current reality is the background (including especially physical reality and its networked electronic devices environment), there are substantial alterations in this Alternate Reality. A \u201chuman success\u201d Expandaverse parallels fiction by providing technologies from a different reality that operate by different assumptions and principles, yet it is contemporary to our reality in that it describes how to use current and new technology to build this Alternate Reality, contained herein and in various patent applications, including a range of devices and components\u2014together an Alternate Reality Teleportal Machine (ARTPM).","HISTORICAL BACKGROUND: In our current reality and timeline, by 1982 the output per hour worked in the USA had become 10 times the output per hour worked 100 years before (Romer 1990, Maddison 1982). For nearly 200 years economic, scientific and technological advances have produced falling costs, increasing production and scale that has exploded from local to global levels across a plurality of economic areas of creation, production and distribution and a plurality of economies worldwide. Scarcity has been made obsolete for raw materials like rubber and wood as they have been replaced by growing ranges of invented materials such as plastics, polymers and currently emerging nano-materials. Even limited commodities such as energy may yield to abundant sources such as solar, wind and other renewable sources as innovations in these fields may make energy more efficient and abundant. More telling, the knowledge resources and communication networks required to drive progress are advancing because the means to copy and re-use digital bits are transforming numerous industries whose products or operating knowledge may be stored and transmitted as digital bits.","Economic theory is catching up with humanity's historic rise of material, energy, knowledge, digital and other types of abundance. Two of the seminal advances are considered Robert Solow's \u201cA Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth\u201d (Solow, 1956) and Paul Romer's \u201cEndogenous Technological Change\u201d (Romer 1990). The former three factors of production (land, labor and capital with diminishing returns) have been replaced in economic theory by people (with education and skills), ideas (inventions and advances), and things (traditional inputs and capital). These new factors of production describe an economic growth model that includes accelerating technological change, intellectual property, monopoly rents and a dawning realization that widely advancing prosperity might become possible for most of humanity, not just for some.","The old proverb is being rewritten and it is no longer \u201cGive a man a fish and you feed him for today, but teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.\u201d Today we can say \u201creinvent fishing and you might feed the world\u201d and by that mean invent new means of large-scale ocean fishing, reduce by-catch from as much as 50% of total catches to reduce destruction of ocean ecosystems, invent new types of fish farming, reduce external damage from some types of fish farming, improve refrigeration throughout the fish distribution chain, use genetic engineering to create domesticated fish, control overfishing of the oceans, develop hatcheries that multiply fish populations, or invent other ways to improve fishing that have never been considered before\u2014and then deliver those advances to individuals, corporations and governments; and from small groups to societies throughout the global economy. Another way to say this is the more we invent, learn and implement successfully at scale, the more people can produce, contribute and consume abundantly. Comparing the past two decades to the past two centuries to civilization's history before that shows how increasing the returns from knowledge transforms the speed and scale of widespread transformations and economic growth opportunities available.","In spite of our progress, this historic shift from scarcity to abundance has been both unequal and inadequate in its scope and speed. There are inequalities between advanced economies, emerging economies and poor undeveloped countries. In every nation there are also huge income inequalities between those who create this expanding abundance as members of the global economy, and those who do local work at local wages and feel bypassed by this growth of global wealth. In addition, huge problems continue to multiply such as increasingly expensive and scarce energy and fuels, climate change, inadequate public education systems, healthcare for everyone, social security for aging populations, economic systems in turmoil, and other stresses that imply that the current rate of progress may need to be greater in scope and speed, and dynamically self-optimizing so it may become increasingly successful for everyone, including those currently left behind.","This \u201cAlternate Reality Teleportal Machine\u201d (ARTPM) \u201doffers the \u201cAlternate Reality\u201d suggestion that if our goal is widespread human success and economic prosperity, then the three new factors of production are incomplete. A fourth factor\u2014a Teleportal Machine (TPM) with components described herein in some examples, a Teleportal Utility (herein TPU), an Active Knowledge Machine (herein AKM), an Alternate Realities Machine (herein ARM), and much more that is exemplified herein\u2014conceptually remake the world into one successful room, with at least some automated flows of a plurality of knowledge to the \u201cpoint of need\u201d based on each person's, organization's and society's activities and goals; with tracking and visibility of a plurality of results for continuous improvements. If this new TPM were added to \u201cpeople, ideas and things\u201d then the new connections and opportunities might actually enable part or more of this Alternate Reality to provide these types of economic and quality of life benefits in our current reality\u2014our opportunities for personal success, personal economic prosperity and many specific advances might be accelerated to a new pace of growth, with new ways that might help replace scarcity with abundance and wider personal success.","CONNECTIONS: To achieve this examples of TPM components\u2014Teleportal Devices (herein TP Devices)\u2014reinvent the window and the \u201cworld\u201d which its observers see. Instead of only looking through a wall to the scene outside a room, the window is reinvented as a \u201cLocal Teleportal\u201d (LTP, which is a fixed Teleportal) or a \u201cMobile Teleportal\u201d (MTP, which is a portable Teleportal) that provide two-way connections for every user with the world, and with those who also have a Teleportal Device, along with connections to \u201cRemote Teleportals\u201d (RTP) that provide access to remote locations (herein \u201cPlaces\u201d) that deliver a plurality of types of real-time and recorded video content from a plurality of locations. This TPM also includes Virtual Teleportals (VTP) which can be on devices like cell phones, PDAs, PCs, laptops, Netbooks, tablets, pads, e-readers, television set-top boxes, \u201csmart\u201d televisions, and other types of devices whether in current use or yet to be developed and turns a plurality of Subsidiary Devices into Alternate Input Devices (herein AIDs)\/Alternate Output Devices (herein AODs; together AIDs\/AODs). The TPM also includes integrated networks for applications in some examples a Teleportal Shared Space Network (or TPSSN), the ability to run applications of a plurality of types in some examples such as social networking communications or access to multiple types of virtual realities (Teleportal Applications Network or TPAN), personal broadcasting for communicating to groups of various sizes (Teleportal Broadcast Network or TPBN), and connection to various types of devices. The TPM also includes a Teleportal Network (TPN) to integrate a plurality of components and services in some examples Shared Planetary Life Space(s) (herein SPLS), an Alternate Realities Machine (ARM) to manage various boundaries that create these separate realities, and a Teleportal Utility (herein TPU) that enables connections, membership, billing, device addition, configuration, etc. Together and with ARTPM components these enable new types of applications and in some examples is another component, the Active Knowledge Machine (AKM), which adds automated information flows that deliver to users of Teleportal Machines and devices (as defined herein) the knowledge, information and entertainment they need or want at the time and place they need it. Another of some combinatorial examples is the ARM which provides multiple types of filters, protections and paywalls so the prevailing \u201ccommon\u201d culture is under each person's control with both the ability to exclude what is not wanted, and an optional requirement that each person must be paid for their attention rather than required to provide it for free. Together, this TPM and its components turn each individual and what he or she is doing into a dynamic filter for the \u201cactive knowledge,\u201d entertainment and news they want in their lives, so that every person can take larger steps toward the leading edge of human achievement in a plurality of areas, even when they try something they have never done or known before. In this Alternate Reality, human knowledge, attention and achievement are made controlled, dynamic, deliverable and productive. Humanity's knowledge, especially, is no longer static and unuseful until it has been searched for, discovered, deciphered and applied\u2014but instead is turned into a dynamic resource that may increase personal success, prosperity and happiness.","ACCELERATIONS: Economic growth research may confirm the potential for this TPM alternative reality. Recent economic research has calculated that the cross-country variation in the rate of technology adoption appears to account for at least one-fourth of per capita income differences (Comin et al, 2007 and 2008). That is, when different countries have different rates of adopting new technologies their economic growth rates are different because new technologies raise the level of productivity, production and consumption to the level of the newer technologies. Thus, the TPM is explicitly designed to harness the potentials for making personal, national and worldwide economic growth actually speed up at a plurality of personal and group economic levels by improving the types of communications that produce higher rates of personal and group successes and thereby economic growth\u2014the production, transmission and use of the ideas and information that improves the outcomes and results that can be achieved from various types of activities and goals.","The history of technology also demonstrates that a new technology may radically transform societies. The development of agriculture was one of the earliest examples, with nomadic humans becoming settled farming cultures. New agricultural surpluses gave rise to the emergence of governments, specialized skills and much more. Similarly, the invention of money altered commerce and trade; and the combination of writing and mathematics altered inventories, architecture, construction, property boundaries and much more. Scientific revolutions like the Renaissance altered our view of the cosmos which in turn changed our understanding of who and what we are. These transformations continue today, with frequent developments in digital technologies like the Internet, communications, and their many new uses. In the Alternate Reality envisioned by the TPM, a plurality of current devices could be employed so individuals could automatically receive the know-how that helps them succeed in their current step, then succeed in their next step, and the step after that, until through a succession of successful steps they and their children may have new opportunities to achieve their lifes' goals. These can also focus some or much of their Active Knowledge Machine deliveries on today's crises such as energy, climate change, supporting aging populations, health care, basic and lifetime education so previously trained generations can adapt to new and faster changes, and more. In addition, the TPU (Teleportal Utility) and TPN (Teleportal Network) provide flexible infrastructure for adding new devices and capabilities as components that automatically deliver AKM know-how and entertainment, based on what each person does and does not want (through their AKM boundaries), across a range of devices and systems.","Some examples of this expanding future include e-paper on product packaging and various devices (such as but not exclusively Teleportal Packaging or TPP); teleportal devices in some examples mobile teleportal devices, wearable glasses, portable projectors, interactive projectors, etc. (such as but not exclusively Mobile Teleportals or MTPs); networking and specialized networks that may include areas like lifetime education or travel (such as but not exclusively Teleportal Networks or TPNs); alert systems for areas like business events, violent crimes or celebrity sightings (such as but not exclusively Teleportal Broadcast and Application Networks TPBANs); personal device awareness for personal knowledge deliveries to one's currently active and preferred devices (such as but not exclusively the Active Knowledge Machine or AKM); etc.","Together, these Alternate Reality Teleportal Machine (ARTPM), including the Active Knowledge Machine (AKM) (as well as the types of future networks and additions described herein) imply that new types of communications may lead to more delivery and use of the best information and ideas that produce individual successes, higher rates of economic growth, and various personal advances in the Quality of Life (QoL). In some examples during the use of devices that require energy, users can receive the best choices to save energy, as well as the know-how and instructions to use them so they actually use less energy\u2014as soon as someone switches to a new device or system that uses less energy, from their initial attempt to use it through their daily uses, they may automatically receive the instructions or know-how to make a plurality of difficult step easier, more successful, etc.","Historically, humanity has seen the most dramatic improvements in its living conditions and economic progress during the most recent two centuries. This centuries-long growth in prosperity flies in the face of economists' dogma about scarcity and diminishing returns that dominated economic theory while the opposite actually occurred. Abundance has grown so powerful that at times it almost seemed to rewrite \u201cUse it up or do without\u201d into \u201cThrow it out or do without.\u201d. With this proven record of wealth expansion, abundance is now the world's strongest compulsion and most individuals' desired economic outcome for themselves and their families. Now as the micro- and macro-concepts of the TPM become clear it prompts the larger question of whether an Alternate Reality with widespread growth toward personal success and prosperity might be explicitly designed and engineered. Can a plurality of factors that produce and deliver an Alternate Reality that identifies and drives advances be specified as an innovation that includes means for new devices, systems, processes, components, elements, etc.? Might an Alternate Reality that explicitly engineers an abundance of human success and prosperity be a new type of technology, devices, systems, utility(ies), presence, and infrastructure(s)?","Social and interpersonal activities create awareness of problems and deliver advances that come from \u201crubbing elbows.\u201d This is routinely done inside a company, on a university campus, throughout a city's business districts such as a garment district or finance center, in a creative center like Silicon Valley, at conferences in a field like pharmaceuticals or biotech, by clubs or groups in a hobby like fishing or gardening, in areas of daily life like entertainment or public education, etc. Can this now be done in the same ways worldwide because new knowledge is both an input to this process and an output from it? In some examples the TPM and AKM are designed to transform the world into one room by resizing our sphere of interpersonal contacts to the scale of a Shared Planetary Life Space(s) plus Active Knowledge, multiple native and alternate Teleportal devices, new types of networks, systems and infrastructures that together provide access to people, places, tools, resources, etc. Could these enable one shared room that might simultaneously be large enough and small enough for everyone to \u201crub elbows?\u201d","Economics of scale apply. Advances in know-how can be received and used by a plurality simultaneously without using them up\u2014in fact, more use multiplies the value of each advance because the fixed cost of creating a new advance is distributed over more users, so prices can be driven down faster while profits are increased\u2014the same returns to scale that have helped transform personal lives and create developed economies during the last two centuries. The bigger the market the more money is made: Sell one advance at a high price and go broke, sell a thousand that are each very expensive and break even, but sell millions at a low price and get rich while helping spread that advance to many customers. Abundance becomes a central engine of greater personal success, collective advances, and widely enjoyed welfare. The Alternate Reality described herein is designed to bring into existence a similar wealth of enjoyment from human knowledge, abundance and entertainment\u2014by introducing new means to expand this process to new fields and move increasing numbers of individuals and companies to humanity's leading edge at lower prices with larger profits as we \u201cgrow forward.\u201d","BUSINESS: This TPM also addresses the business issue of enabling (an optional) business evolution from today's dominant silo platforms (such as mobile phone networks, PCs, and cable\/satellite television) to a world of integrated and productive Teleportal connectivity. Some current communications and product platforms are supported by business models that lock in their customers. The \u201cnetwork industries\u201d that lock in customers include computers (Windows), telecommunications (cell phone contracts, landline phones, networks like the Internet), broadcasting\/television delivery (cable TV and satellite), etc. In contrast, the TPM provides the ability to support both current lock-in as Subsidiary Devices and new business models, permitting their evolution into more effective devices and systems that may produce business growth\u2014because both currently dominant companies and new companies can use these advances within existing business models to preserve customer relationships while entering new markets with either current or new business models\u2014that choice remains with each corporation and vendor.","Whether the business models stay the same or evolve, there are potentially large technology changes and outcome shifts in an Alternate Reality. We started with a culture built on printed books and newspapers, landline telephones, and television with only a few oligopolistic networks. Digital communications and media technologies developed in separate silos to become PCs with individual software applications, the Internet silo, cell phones, and televisions with a plurality of channels and (gradually) on-demand TV. This has produced a \u201cthree-screen\u201d marketplace whereby many now use the three screens of computers, televisions and cell phones\u2014even though they are fairly separate and only somewhat interconnected. The rise of the Internet has lead to widespread personal creation and distribution of personalized news (blogs, micro-blogging, citizen journalism, etc.), videos, entertainments, product reviews, comments, and other types of content that are based on individual tastes or personal experience, rather than institutional market power (such as from large entertainment or news companies, or major advertisers). Even without a TPM there is a growing emergence of new types of personal-based communications devices, uses, markets, interconnections and infrastructure that break from the past to create a more direct chain from where we each of us wants to go directly to the outcomes people want\u2014rather than a collective \u201cspectacle culture\u201d and brands to which people are guided and limited. With the TPM, however, goals and intentions are surfaced as implicit in activities, actual success is tracked, gaps are identified and active knowledge deliveries help a plurality cross the bridge from desires to achievements.","COGNITION: Also a focus in the TPM's Alternate Reality, different cognitive and communication styles are emphasized such as more visual screens use with less use of paper. At this time, there may be a change along these lines which is leading to the decline of paper-dependent and printing-dependent industries such as newspapers and book publishing, and the rise of more digital, visual and new media channels such as e-readers, electronic articles, blogging, twitter, video over the Internet and social media that allows personal choices, personal expertise and personal goals to replace institution-driven profit-focused world views, with skimming of numerous resources (by means such as search engines, portals, linking, navigation, etc.). This new cognitive style replaces expensive corporate marketing and news media \u201cspectacle\u201d reporting that compel product-focused lifestyles, information, services, belief systems content, and the creation or expansion of needs and wants in large numbers of consumers. In this Alternate Reality there are optional transitions in some examples from large sources toward individual and one's chosen group sources; from one \u201cself\u201d per person to each person having (optional) multiple identities; from mass culture to selective filtering of what's wanted (even into individually controlled Shared Planetary Life Spaces, whose boundaries are attached to one or a plurality of multiple identities); from reading and interpreting institutional messages to independent and individual creation and selection of personally relevant information; from fewer broadcasters to potentially voluminous resources for recording, reinterpreting and rebroadcasting; along with large and more sensory-based (headline, pictorial, video and aural) cognitive styles with \u201calways on\u201d digital connectivity that includes: More scanning and skimming of visual layouts and visual content. A plurality of available resources and connections from LTPs (Local Teleportals), RTPs (Remote Teleportals), TPBNs (Teleportal Broadcast Networks created and run by individuals), TPANs (Teleportal Application Networks), remote control of electronic sources and devices through RCTP (Remote Control Teleportaling) by direct control via a Teleportal Device or through Teleportals located in varied locations, personal connections via MTPs (Mobile Teleportals) and VTPs (Virtual Teleportals), and more. Increasing volume, variety, speed and density of visual information and visual media; including more frequent simultaneous use of multiple media with shorter attention spans; within separately focused and bounded Shared Planetary Life Spaces. Growing replacement of long-form printed media such as newspapers and books in a multi-generation transition that may turn long-form content printing (e.g., longer than 3-5 pages) into merely one type of specialized media (e.g., paper is just one format and only sometimes dominant). Growing replacement of \u201cpresence\u201d from a physical location to one's chosen connections, with most of those connections not physically present at most times, but instead communications-dependent through a variety of devices and media. The evolution of devices and technologies that reflect these cognitive and perceptual transformations, so they can be more fully realized. And more.","In sum, this Alternate Reality may provide options for the evolution of our cognitive reality with new utility(ies), new devices, new life spaces and more\u2014for a more interactive digital reality that may be more successful, to provide the means for achieving and benefiting from new types of economic growth, quality of life improvements, and human performance advantages that may help solve the growing crises of our timeline while replacing scarcity and poverty with an accelerated expansion of abundance, prosperity and the multiple types of happiness each person chooses.","In some examples the ARTPM provides an Alternate Reality that integrates advancing know-how, resources, devices, learning, entertainment and media so that a plurality of users might gain increasing capabilities and achievements with increased connections, speed and scope. From the viewpoint of an Alternate Reality Teleportal Machine (ARTPM) in some examples this is designed to provide new ways to advance economically by delivering human success to a plurality of individuals and groups. It also includes integration of a plurality of devices, siloed business\/product platforms, and existing business models so that (r) evolutionary transformations may potentially be achieved.","RAMIFICATIONS: In this \u201cAlternate Reality's\u201d timeline, humanity has embarked on a rare period of continuous improvements and transformations: What are devices (including products, equipment, services, applications, information, entertainment, networks, etc.)? Increasing ranges and types of \u201cdevices\u201d are gaining enough computing, communications and video capabilities to re-open the basic definitions of what \u201cdevices\u201d are and should become. A historic parallel is the transformation of engines into small electric motors, which then disappeared into numerous products (such as appliances), with the companion delivery of universal electric power by means of standardized plugs and wall sockets\u2014making the electric motor an embedded, invisible tool that is unseen while people do a wide ranges of tasks. The ARTPM's implication that human success may undertake a similar evolution and be delivered throughout our daily lives as routinely as electricity from a wall socket may seem startling, but it is just one part. Today's three main screens are the computer, cell phone and television. In the TPM Alternate Reality these three screens may remain the same and fit that environment, or they may disappear into integrated parts of a different digital environment whose Teleportal Devices may transform the range and scope of our personal perception and life spaces, along with our individual identities, capacities and achievements.","The TPM's Alternate Reality provides dynamic new connections between uses and needs with vendors and device designers\u2014a process herein named \u201cAnthroTectonics.\u201d New use-based designs are surfaced as a by-product from the AKM, ARM, TPU and TPM, and systems for this are enumerated. In some examples selling bundles of products and services with targeted levels of success or satisfaction may result, such as in some examples a governance's lifestyle plan for \u201cUpward Mobility to Lifetime Luxury\u201d that guides one's consumption of housing, transportation, financial services, products, services, and more\u2014along with integrated guidance in achieving many types of personal and career goals successfully. Together, these and other ARTPM advances may provide expanded goals, processes and visibly reported results; with quantified collective knowledge and desires resulting in new types of digitally connected relationships in some examples between people, vendors, governances, etc. The companies and organizations that capture market share by being able to use these new Alternate Reality systems and their resulting devices advances can also control intellectual property rights from many new usage-driven designs of numerous types of devices, systems, applications, etc. The combination of these competitive advantages (ARTPM systems-created first-mover intellectual properties, numerous advances in devices and processes, and the resulting deeper relationships between customers and vendor organizations) may afford strong new commercial opportunities. In some examples those customers may receive new successes as a new normal part of everyday life\u2014with vendors competing to create and deliver personal and\/or lifetime success paths that capture family-level customer relationships that last decades, perhaps throughout entire lives.","This potential \u201cmarriage\u201d between powerful corporations, new ways to \u201cown\u201d markets, and systems and processes that attach corporations with their customers' lifetime goals could lead to a growing realization that an Alternate Reality option may exist for our current reality, namely: \u201cIf you want a better reality, choose it.\u201d","Because our current reality repeatedly suffers serious crises, at some future crisis the combination of powerful corporations who are able to deliver a growing range of human successes and the demands of a larger crisis may connect. Could the fortunes of those global companies rise at that time by using their new capabilities to help drive and deliver new types of successes? Could the fortunes of humanity\u2014first in that crisis and then in its prosperity after that\u2014rise as well?","This innovation's multiple components were created as steps toward a new portfolio that might demonstrate that humanity is becoming able to create and control reality\u2014actually turning it into multiple realities, multiple identities, multiple Shared Planetary Life Spaces, and more\u2014with one of the steps into this future an attempt to deliver a more connected and success-focused stage of history\u2014one where the dreams and choices of individuals, groups, companies, countries and others may pursue self-realization. When the transformations are considered together, each person may gain the ability to specify multiple realities along with the ability to switch between them\u2014more than humanity gaining control of reality, this may be the start of each person's control over it.","Is it possible that a new era might emerge when one of the improvement options could be: \u201cIf you want a better reality, switch it.\u201d","In this document, we sometimes use certain phrases to refer to examples or broad concepts or both that relate to corresponding phrases that appear in current and future claims.

After that the realities diverged with the \u201chistory\u201d of the Expandaverse developing and using new technologies whose goal is to deliver a higher level(s) of human success and connections as a normal network process\u2014just as you can plug any electric appliance in a standard wall outlet and receive power, the Expandaverse's reality developed a new type of \u201cTeleportal Utility,\u201d \u201cTeleportal Devices\u201d and ARTPM components that provide success, presence and much more\u2014which in this Alternate Reality, alters the success and quality of life of individuals, groups, corporations and businesses, governments and nations, and human civilization.","As depicted in  four views of this Alternate Reality's history are illustrated simultaneously. The Alternate Reality's Cosmology  , Stages of History  , Wealth System   and Culture system   diverged from our current reality recently, starting with Digital Discontinuities  that occur during the recent digital era. This Alternate History posits a series of conceptual reversals  plus expansions beyond physical reality  that are described in more detail in  (which divides the discontinuities into three sub-stages: Technological discontinuities, Organizational discontinuities, and Cultural discontinuities) and elsewhere.","The reasons for the Digital Discontinuities  is that digital technology provides new means\u2014technologies that can be designed and combined at new levels such as in some examples meta-systems\u2014to define and control human reality, whether as one reality or as multiple simultaneous alternate realities.

For most of human history     the Earth was believed to be the center of a small universe  whose limits were immediate and physically experienced\u2014what the human eye could see in the night sky, and where a person could travel before possibly falling off the edge of the earth. Second is \u201cThe Universe\u201d . Starting with the rebirth of science during the Renaissance  and continuing thereafter , the Universe  was a scientifically proven physical entity whose boundaries have been repeatedly pushed back by new discoveries\u2014initially by making the Earth just one of the planets that revolve around the sun, then discovering that the sun is just one of the stars in a large number of galaxies, then \u201cmapping\u201d the distribution of galaxies and projecting it backwards to the Big Bang when the Universe came into existence. Today scientists are continuing to expand this knowledge by pursuing theories of multiple dimensions and strings, and by using new tools such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Third is the \u201cExpandaverse\u201d . The Alternate Reality's cosmology diverges from the current reality's cosmology starting with discontinuities  that occur during the recent digital era. This Alternate History Stage  posits a Cosmology transition from the Universe  to the Expandaverse  (as described elsewhere).","Stages of History  (center column of ): A second of this Alternate Reality's views of human history is the Stages of History  which are described as discontinuous stages because the magnitude of each change required new forms of consciousness and awareness to come into existence. Some examples of this are common throughout history starting with agricultural stability replacing nomadic hunting and gathering; with money and markets replacing bartering physical goods; with city states, rulers and laws replacing tribal leaders; right up to telephone calls replacing written letters. Each substantial change requires a change in consciousness of what we do, how we do that, and in some cases who and what we are, our relationships with those around us, and our expectations for our lives and futures. A somewhat more detailed example with its own stages is the invention of money which changed value from individual physical items to abstract values represented by \u201cprices\u201d rather than utility\u2014and over time changed pricing from bargained prices to fixed prices\u2014with each of these changes requiring people to learn new ways to think, feel and re-conceptualize the ways we acquire most of the things in their lives, until today we buy most of what we need at fixed prices.","This view of history (as discontinuous stages that include discontinuities in people's consciousness) fits the Expandaverse  stage  because the Expandaverse includes new forms of awareness and consciousness. In addition, the \u201cS-curve\u201d is used to represent each stage of history       because the S-curve describes how new technologies are spread, how they mature, and then how they are eclipsed and disrupted by newer technologies. In brief, innovations have a life cycle with a startup phase during which they are developed and (optionally) improved; they then spread from the innovator to other individuals and groups (sometimes rapidly and sometimes slowly) as others realize the value of each new invention; this diffusion and growth stage may increase in speed and scope if (optional) improvements are made in the technology; the process typically slows after the diffusions and improvements have been exhausted and a mature technology is in place; mature technologies are often ripe for replacement by new innovations that must start at the bottom of their own S-curve. While  illustrates this as major stages of history      , in reality there are countless smaller technologies, stages, innovations, and advances that have it each climbed their own S-curves, only to be replaced and eclipsed by newer innovations\u2014or declines, as illustrated by the Dark Ages .","In the center column's stages of history , these discontinuous stages in both history and consciousness are illustrated as: Agriculture  which roughly includes domesticated animals, fire, stone tools and early tools, shelter, weapons, shamans, early medicine and other innovations from the same period of history. City states  which roughly includes rulers, laws, writing, money, marketplaces, metals, blacksmithed tools and weapons, and other innovations from the same period of history. Empires  which roughly includes larger civilizations formed in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, Asia, and central and south America\u2014as well as the numerous innovations and institutions required to create, govern, run and sustained each of these empires\/civilizations. The Dark Ages  is noted to illustrate how humanity, civilization and our individual consciousness can be diminished as well as increased, and that there may be a correlation between the absence of freedom and the (e) quality of our lives. The Renaissance  roughly includes a rebirth of independent thinking with the simultaneous developments of science (such as astronomy, navigation, etc.), art, publishing, commerce (trade, the rise of guilds and skills, the emergence of the middle classes, etc.), the emergence of nation states, etc. The Industrial Revolution  produced too many innovations and changes in consciousness to list, with a few notable examples including going from the first flight in 1903 to the first walk on the moon in 1969 (less than 70 years), transportation (from trains to automobiles, trucks, national highway systems, and worldwide international jet flights), mass migrations for work (first to the cities and then to the suburbs and then to airports for routine inter-city job travel), electronic communications (from the telegraph to the telephone, cell phone, e-mail, and the Internet), manufacturing (from factories to assembly lines to mass customization of products and services), mass merchandising of disposable products and services (from \u201cwear it out\u201d to \u201cthrow it out\u201d), and much more.","Expandaverse : The Alternate Reality's Expandaverse stage of history diverges from the current reality's history starting with \u201cAnthroTectonic Discontinuities\u201d  that began during the recent digital era. This Alternate History posits a historic stage transition from the Industrial Revolution  to an Alternate Realities  Stage. In the Expandaverse individuals may have multiple identities, and each identity may live in one or a plurality of Shared Planetary Life Spaces (SPLS). Each SPLS may be its own alternate reality that is determined and managed by controlling its boundaries, with specific means for doing this described in the Alternate Reality Machine (ARM) herein. Each identity may switch between one or a plurality of SPLS's (alternate realities) by logging in and out of them. The Expandaverse's initial core technologies include those described herein, including in some examples: TPU (Teleportal Utility) , ARM (Alternate Realities Machine) , Multiple identities\/Life Expansion , SPLS (Shared Planetary Life Spaces) , TP SSN (Teleportal Shared Spaces Network) , Governances , AKM (Active Knowledge Machine) , TP Devices  (LTPs, MTPs, RTPs, AIDs\/AODs, VTPs, RCTPs, Subsidiary Devices), Directory(ies) , Auto-identification of identities , optionally including auto-classifying and auto-valuing identities, Reporting , optionally including recommendations, guidance, \u201cbest choices\u201d, etc., Optimizations , Etc.","Wealth System  (a right column of ): The third of this Alternate Reality's views of human history is the dominant system for producing wealth  which is also viewed as discontinuous stages because each Wealth System also requires new forms of awareness and consciousness to come into existence. These are illustrated in a right column of , titled Wealth System  and include: The oldest and longest is Agriculture . Agriculture was the dominant economic focus for most stages of human history     \u2014a long period in which food was scarce, average life spans were short, disease was common, the vast majority of people were involved in agriculture, and wealth was rare. Under Agriculture  humanity's standard of living stayed nearly the same\u2014\u201cpoor\u201d by today's standards\u2014for literally thousands of years. When the \u201chuman herd\u201d was thinned by war, natural disasters, plagues, etc. food became abundant, people were better off and the \u201cherd\u201d grew until scarcity and poverty returned. Thomas Hobbes was considered accurate when he described the \u201cNatural Condition of Mankind\u201d in Leviathan (1651) as \u201csolitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\u201d With the recent rise of Industry , \u201cCapitalism\u201d within a stable and regulated governmental system may be defined and practiced in many ways, but there is no question that where this has been practiced successfully for decades or centuries it has produced the largest increases in wealth ever seen in human history. As a system of wealth production, nothing has ever exceeded the combination of private ownership of the means of production, a stable legal system that attempts to reduce corruption, prices set by market forces of supply and demand rather than economic planning, earnings set by market forces rather than economic planning or high tax rates, and profits distributed to owners and investors without excessive taxation. In short, when there is a good set of \u201crules\u201d that provides the freedom to take independent personal and economic actions\u2014and profit from them\u2014the evidence from history shows that large numbers of people have a better chance to become prosperous and even rich than under any other economic or governmental system yet practiced.","A new Wealth System started emerging in this Alternate History from the ARTPM, Teleportal Presences & Knowledge . The \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the Expandaverse, a new digital world, opened new economic opportunities and exploitation, which is what happened when a \u201cnew world\u201d was discovered in the past (such as Columbus's discovery of the physical New World). First and most important, this new Wealth System  did not change Capitalism   as it operated under the Industry Wealth System . In fact, it multiplied it and strengthened capitalism and its support for acquiring personal wealth by ever larger numbers of people through their independent self-chosen multiple identities and multiplied actions. In an alternate history example, imagine what millions more college graduates could do if added to the economy\u2014so adding multiple identities allowed many college graduates to add new identities and the economy to rapidly obtain large numbers of economically experienced college graduates. In some ARTPM examples if you have multiple identities (with some public identities, some private identities, and some secret identities) each of your identities can live in separate alternate realities, earn separate incomes, own separate assets, and take advantage of different ways to produce wealth\u2014expanding your range of economic choices so you have multiple ways to become wealthy, consume more, enjoy more in your life, and do much more with your multiple earnings\u2014so that one middle class life may receive the equivalent of several middle class incomes and combine them to enjoy an upper class outcome. Rather than achieving life extension (because the goal of living for hundreds of years or longer will not be achieved during our lifetime), the Expandaverse provides life expansion into multiple simultaneous identities and alternate realities. Within these potentially expanded multiple incomes and combined consumption there is also a stronger dynamic alignment between people's goals, needs, desires and what is provided to them\u2014described herein as \u201cAnthroTectonics\u201d\u2014which operates within free market capitalism. This, as a Wealth System, may increase the volumes of economic creation and consumption by instantly multiplying the number of educated and successful people who may operate successfully, with global presence and delivered knowledge, throughout multiple modern economies\u2014in brief, each expensive college degree may now be put to more uses by more identities, and on a larger worldwide scale. The Alternate Reality's Wealth System  diverges from the current reality's Industry  Wealth System with discontinuities  that occur during the recent digital era. This Alternate History thus posits a Wealth System  transition from the Industrial Wealth System  to Teleportal Presences & Knowledge  that is described elsewhere.","Culture System  (far right column of ): The fourth of this Alternate Reality's views of human history is the dominant system for human culture  which is also part of this discontinuous stages because each Culture System also requires new forms of awareness and consciousness to come into existence. These differing sources of culture are illustrated in a right column of , titled Culture System  and are based on the communications technologies available in each system: The oldest, most direct and most physical is Local Cultures , which were based on the immediate lives that people experienced in extended families, tribes, city states, early empires, etc. Even though \u201cLocal Cultures\u201d spans a wide range of governances from tribes to empires, the common element is what people experience directly and personally from their local environment (even if it is controlled by dominant dictators from a distance as in an empire such as Rome or China). A new Culture System started with the gradual rise of Mass Communications , starting slowly with the invention of the printing press in the 1400's, but gained increasing scope and media during the industrial revolution of the 1800's, and exploded into a global culture after the advent of electricity, radio, television, photography, movies, the telephone and other media in the 1900's\u2014to culminate in an Internet era of global brands, mass-desired affluence and minute-by-minute twitter-blogger-24\u00d77 global news and culture bombardment in the early 2000's.","A new Culture System  emerged in this Alternate History after it was recognized that digital technologies give both individuals and groups new means to control reality. The \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the Expandaverse, a new digital world, opened new social opportunities to enjoy from multiple identities, setting boundaries on each SPLS, etc.; which is what happened when a new cultural trend was discovered in the past (such as printing, telephone communications, the automobile, flying, etc.). Specifically, the ARTPM included an Alternate Realities Machine (herein ARM) which enabled multiple Self-Selected Cultures to emerge as an alternative to the, Mass Communicated Culture that had previously dominated reality. In the Expandaverse's Self-Selected Cultures each person could have a plurality of identities (as described elsewhere) wherein each identity could have one or a plurality of Shared Planetary Life Spaces (SPLS). Each SPLS is essentially \u201calways on\u201d so that identities (\u201cI\u201d which includes identities, people and groups), places (\u201cP\u201d), tools (\u201cT\u201d) nand resources (\u201cR\u201d)\u2014herein IPTR\u2014in it are everywhere and connected at all times. Each SPLS also has multiple boundaries that can be controlled, so each identity can include what it wants and keep out what it doesn't want. If I have a plurality of identities, and each of my identities can also have a plurality of Shared Lives Connections, and each of my identities may be everywhere that is connected at any time that I choose, and I can include and exclude what I want from each Planetary Life Space, then there is no shortage of choices; rather, I have many more choices than today BUT they are my choices and the parts of the mass culture that I don't want no longer imposes itself on me.","In a brief alternate history summary of the Self-Selected Culture enabled by this Alternate Realities Machine (ARM), it gives each person multiple human realities, and makes each of them a conscious choice: We can choose to create multiple identities to enjoy multiple lives simultaneously, and each identity can have one or a plurality of Shared Planetary Life Spaces, and each SPLS can copy or create different boundaries (e.g., its settings of what to include and exclude), and more. In some examples we can include everything in the current reality such as its total carpet bombing of branded media messaging; in some examples we can prioritize it and make sure what we like is included such as our interests like our family, close relatives and friends and our shared interests; in some examples we can limit it and make sure what we dislike is excluded such as entertainment that is too sexual or too violent for our children; in some examples we may optionally choose to be paid to include media sources that want our attention and need it for their financial prosperity like advertisers willing to pay us to see their messages. Additionally, when one person has a plurality of identities, and when each identity has a plurality of SPLS's, and when each SPLS has different interests and boundaries, that one person may enjoy multiple different human realities that each have worldwide \u201calways on presence.\u201d In addition, analyses and reports on the outcome metrics from different \u201cARM reality settings\u201d and their results may identify those that produce the greatest successes (how ever each person prefers to use available metrics to define that)\u2014so that each identity can specify their goals, see the size of the gap(s) between themselves and those who reach them \u201cbest,\u201d and rapidly adopt the \u201cbest\u201d reality settings from what is generally most or more successful. Because ARM settings results are widely and personally reported as gaps to reach one's goals, the \u201cbest realities\u201d may be widely seen and copied\u2014perhaps providing new means to raise income, success, satisfaction and happiness by trying and evolving self-selected human reality(ies) at a new pace and trajectory to determine and help people determine what works best for varied peoples and groups. With additional success guidance from this alternate reality's Active Knowledge Machine (herein AKM), these self-chosen realities may also be applied more successfully.","Who doesn't walk down the street and dream about what should be improved, what should be better, what we would really like if we could choose and switch into a more desirable new reality just because we want it? In the alternate timeline, a new Self-Selected Culture emerged because new types of choices became possible: New means enabled specifying a plurality of goals, seeing the alternate realities whose metrics showed how well they achieved them, copying successful ARM settings let people try new realities and test them personally, a collection of alternate realities that work better could be kept, and then each person could shift at will between their most successful realities by logging in and out as different identities. As people learned about this new Self-Selected Culture they modified each of their chosen realities by changing its SPLS boundary settings, and kept what worked best to achieve their various and different personal goals, then in turn distributed the \u201cbest alternate realities\u201d for others to use to enjoy better and happier lives. Instead of one external ordinary public culture that attempts to control and shape everyone commercially, with the ARTPM's Alternate Realities Machine the alternate timeline gained multiple digital realities and individual control of each of them to enjoy the more successful and happier realities in which we would like to live.","ARTPM DISCONTINUITIES:  is a magnification of the \u201cAnthroTectonic\u201d digital discontinuities  in  between the current reality's timeline and the Expandaverse's timeline. In , \u201cAnthroTectonics Discontinuities: Simultaneous and Cyclical Transformations,\u201d three simultaneous and cyclical discontinuities are illustrated   including Technological Discontinuities  , Organizational Discontinuities  , Cultural Discontinuities  , and their resulting new opportunities  and new technologies  that produce newer discontinuities    with successive cycles of transformations. In the Alternate Reality timeline the first is Technological Discontinuities  that expand in size and scope. Some examples from the current reality are digital content types that are now created and distributed worldwide by individuals or small independent collaborations as well as by organizations such as words, pictures, music, news, magazines, books, movies, videos, tweets, real-time feeds, and other content types\u2014digital technologies made each of these faster and easier for a worldwide multiplication of sources to create, edit, find, use, copy, transmit, distribute, multiply, combine, adapt, remix, redistribute, etc. These discontinuities started in the 1950's and are ongoing and continuously expanding , and their total volume of views from new content sources may surpass the content products from large media corporations with notable examples such as the newspaper industry.","In the Alternate Reality timeline Technological Discontinuities  caused Organizational Discontinuities  that in turn alter organizations as many people, organizations, corporations, governments, etc. received numerous benefits from transforming themselves digitally. In some examples from the current reality, organizations have transformed themselves into digital communicators and digital content users (which includes entire industries, governments, nonprofit organizations, etc.) that increasingly utilize digital networks, content and data in many forms, and as a result organizations have adapted their employees' skills, human resources, locations, functions (such as IT), teams, business divisions, R&D processes, product designs, organizational structures, management styles, marketing and much more. These are currently taking place and are ongoing into the foreseeable fuure .","In the Alternate Reality timeline the combination of Technological Discontinuities  and Organizational Discontinuities  cause the emergence of Cultural Discontinuities  that also expand in size and scope. Continuing the examples from the current reality\u2014digital content\u2014the culture in content industries like music, movies, publishing, cable television, etc. are shifting radically as their customers, audiences, products, services, revenues, distribution, marketing channels and much more are altered by the current reality's transformation of them into digital industries.","This is cyclical . Each of these\u2014Technological Discontinuities , Organizational Discontinuities  and Cultural Discontinuities \u2014provides both new opportunities  and ideas for new technologies  that may in turn create new advances that are also discontinuities   . AnthroTectonics  is the result, which may be described by the geologic metaphor of a new mountain range: It is as if a giant flat continent existed but as the \u201cgeologic digital plates\u201d collide between new technologies  , new organizational adaptations   and cultural shifts   individual mountains rise up until there is an entire digital mountain range pushed high above the starting level\u2014with new mountains continuing to emerge   from the pressure of that new mountain range   .","These discontinuities        in  produce a new wealth system  , new economic growth, new income: A better metaphor is adapting \u201cthe goose that laid a golden egg.\u201d While some newly laid golden eggs are cashed in   , other eggs are hatched and grown into geese that lay more golden eggs    , with those new geese     producing both more gold and more geese that lay more golden eggs     until wealth becomes abundant rather than scarce. This is a new kind of wealth system   in which the more we take from it, and the more we drive it, the more wealth there is\u2014the traditional economist's ideas about scarcity have been made obsolete in the new AnthroTectonic Alternate Realities    . Consider two sets of examples, the first of which is historic from the current reality: In Germany about 400,000 years ago the golden eggs of human hunting were laid with first known spears; in Asia about 50,000 years ago marked the earliest known start of the golden eggs of ovens and bows and arrows; in the Fertile Crescent about 10,000 years ago the golden eggs of farming and pottery were laid; in Mesopotamia about 5,000 years ago the golden eggs of cities and metal were laid; in India about 2,000 years ago the golden eggs of textiles and the zero were laid; in China about 1000 years ago the golden eggs of printing and porcelain were laid; in Italy about 500 years ago the remarkably diverse Renaissance laid entire flocks of geese who themselves laid many new types of golden eggs of science, crafts, printing and the spread of knowledge; in England about 200 years ago the similarly diverse Industrial Revolution laid many more flocks of geese with golden eggs like steam engines, spinning jennys, factories, trains and much more; recently within the last few decades, an entire flock of digital geese laid the Internet's golden eggs and the many industries and new generations of golden eggs that have come from it.","In the current reality's history humanity created these numerous \u201cgeese\u201d that \u201claid these golden eggs\u201d\u2014none of them existed until humans created them: Traditional economists thought of them as scarcities but in the Alternate Reality Timeline these were thought of in the opposite way because they expanded humanity's wealth and abundance. These golden eggs have familiar industry names like transportation, communications, agriculture, food, manufacturing, real estate, construction, energy, retailing, utilities, information technology, hospitality, financial services, professional services, education, healthcare, government, etc. But in the Alternate Reality Timeline when something new is created it is as if a golden egg were hatched and a new gosling is born to lay many more golden eggs    . Transportation is one example of a flock of geese who lay \u201cgolden eggs\u201d like ships, cars, trucks, trains and planes. Retail is another and its flock lays golden eggs like malls, furniture stores, electronics stores, restaurants, gas stations, automobile and truck dealers, building materials stores, grocery stores, clothing stores, etc. When geese mate they produce more offspring that lay more golden eggs such as when transportation mates with retail it produces \u201cgolden eggs\u201d like warehousing, distribution, storage, shipping, logistics, supply chains, pipelines, air freight, seaports, courier services, etc. When the Alternate Reality Timeline uses global digital presence it accelerates economic growth by stimulating the production of many more golden eggs at ever faster rates\u2014the take-up of helpful new ideas and products, at a worldwide scale, is the normal way people live with an ARTPM.","The AnthroTectonic component of the ARTPM's alternate reality harnesses this \u201cgolden eggs\u201d model to drive new economic growth, prosperity and abundance by making this a set of simultaneous and parallel discontinuities        . It consciously uses these to leap out of the economic scarcity model into a future of consciously stimulated advances and expanding abundance. For an example of how this works, in the current reality ownership and property expand into a major source of middle-class wealth and assets with the centuries-long development of real estate property ownership and mass construction industry, such as the mass marketing of houses in large suburban developments\u2014which converted farmland into individually owned assets that appreciate in price. There is a visible connection between expanding the types of assets coupled with widespread ownership\u2014when a new type of \u201cgolden egg\u201d creates new types of properties in an existing or new industry, those new properties add to the available assets and the wealth of people and corporations. In the Alternate Reality Timeline new types of property are easy to create because Intellectual Property is real and the ARTPM follows that reality's established IP laws and rules (as described elsewhere outside of this document).","An example illustrates this from the ARTPM itself, and its alternate reality timeline: In some examples audiences for broadcast media may add boundaries and paywalls so they are paid for their attention, rather than providing it for free\u2014so your attention becomes your property, what you choose to perceive becomes your property, and your conscious has new digital self-controls\u2014your consciousness is your asset that you can control and monetize to produce more income. Similarly, in some examples the ARTPM lets individuals establish multiple identities, where each new identity may be a potential source of additional incomes so that each person may multiply their incomes and increase their wealth. Similarly, in some examples the ARTPM provides means for multiple \u201cgovernances\u201d (separate from and different from governments) where each governance may provide new activities that can scale up to meet various personal and social needs\u2014which in turn expands the economic activities and contributions from governances. Similarly, in some examples the ARTPM's Teleportal Utility (herein TPU) provides consistent means to add multiple new types of devices and services, some of which may include Local Teleportals (LTPs), Mobile Teleportals (MTPs), Remote Teleportals (RTPs), Virtual Teleportals (VTPs), Remote Control Teleportals (RCTPs), and other new types of devices that may each add rapidly advancing presence and communication features and capabilities beyond existing devices. Similarly, in some examples the ARTPM's Active Knowledge Machine (herein AKM) provides dynamic knowledge with systems to deliver what we each need to know, when and where we need to know it\u2014an infrastructure that delivers a growing range of human successes over the network rather than requiring each of us to achieve personal success independently and on our own. Similarly, in some examples many other types of property, capabilities and advances are provided by this discontinuous AnthroTectonic process        , which together constitute the digital discontinuities  in  and wealth system  and culture system  of the Expandaverse .","In the Alternate Reality timeline AnthroTectonic Discontinuities are larger and often \u201creversals\u201d of the assumptions that are common and widely accepted in our current reality. In the Alternate Reality Timeline's History some of the transformed organizations and transformed people realized that the new digital environment would become a cultural divergence that transforms everything. They consciously choose to help this divergence evolve for \u201ceconomic growth\u201d so that it would increase personal incomes, raise living standards and create more wealth faster; and for \u201cthe greater good\u201d so that it would help large numbers of people choose and reach their personal goals by both personal means (such as multiple identities and\/or boundaries) and collective means (such as governances). This helped those who promoted this, too, because those who led these divergences profited enormously from driving these AnthroTectonic Discontinuities. They placed themselves in worldwide leadership positions\u2014they gained corporate and personal dominance at the center of a new and more successful worldwide civilization.","An example is corporate training: In the current reality corporate training started with staff who wrote processes as procedural manuals, and taught those in classrooms on a fixed schedule. With the Internet this evolved into webinars and distance learning that trains remotely located employees who no longer need to travel to a central facility. Today consistent corporate training can reach many employees in less time, and even be managed and delivered globally. In the Alternate Reality Timeline a growing range of knowledge is made dynamic and is delivered by the network based on each person's real-time actions and activities, so they receive the knowledge they need when and where they need it. A source of success is the network, with two-way interactions making learning and succeeding a normal part of doing and being\u2014which is described in the ARTPM's Active Knowledge Machine (herein AKM).","How large are the Alternate Timeline's AnthroTectonic Discontinuities? To provide a new stage where human success is delivered as a normal process, and where the world is connected in new ways, the Expandaverse reverses or transforms many of the current reality's fundamental assumptions and concepts simultaneously :","Reality : FROM re.ality controls people TO we each control our own realities.","Boundaries : FROM invisible and unconscious TO explicit, visible and managed.","Death : FROM one life TO life expansion through multiple identities.","Presence : FROM where you are TO everywhere in multiple presences (as individual or multiple identities).","Connectedness : FROM separation between people TO always on connections worldwide.","Contacts : FROM trying to phone, conference or contact a remote recipient TO always present in a digital Shared Space(s) from your current preferred Device(s) in Use.","Success : FROM you figure it out TO success is delivered by the network.","Privacy : FROM private TO tracked, aggregated and visible (especially \u201cbest choices\u201d).","Ownership of Your Attention : FROM you give it away free TO you can charge for it if you want.","Ownership of Devices and Content : FROM each person buys these TO simplified access and sharing of commodity resources.","Trust : FROM stranger danger TO most people are good when instantly identified and classified.","Networks : FROM transmission TO identifying, tracking and surfacing behavior.","Network Communications : FROM electronic (web, e-store, email, mobile phone calls, e-shopping\/e-catalogs, tweets, social media postings, etc.) TO personal and face-to-face, even if non-local. Knowledge : FROM static knowledge that must be found and figured out TO active knowledge that finds you and fits your need to know.","Rapidly Advancing Devices : FROM you're on your own TO two-way assistance.","Buying : FROM selling by push (marketing and sales) and pull (demand) TO interactive during use, based on your immediate actions, needs and goals.","Culture : FROM one common culture with top-down messages TO we choose our cultures and we set their boundaries (paywalls, priorities [what's in], filters [what's out], protection, etc.).","Governances : FROM one set of broad politician-controlled governments TO choosing your life's purposes and then choosing one or a plurality of multiple governances that help you achieve your life's goals.","Personal Limits : FROM we are only what we are TO we can choose large goals and receive two-way support, with multiple new ways to try and have it all (both individually and collectively).","In the Alternate Reality's History both reversals and transformations turned out to be central to humanity's success because the information that was surfaced, the ways people became connected, and a plurality of simultaneous transformations enabled a plurality of people and groups to connect, learn, adopt \u201cwhat's best\u201d, and succeed in varied ways at a scale and speed that would have been impossible if the Alternate Reality's former timeline (our current reality) had continued.","TELEPORTAL MACHINE (TPM) SUMMARY: As illustrated in , \u201cTeleportal Machine (TPM) Summary\u201d this provides some examples that provide new capabilities for a Teleportal Machine  to deliver new devices, networks, services, alternate realities, etc. In some examples a Teleportal Utility (TPU)  includes providing new capabilities for the simultaneous delivery of new networks in some examples a Teleportal Network  (see below); in some examples a Teleportal Shared Space Network  (see below), in some examples a Teleportal Broadcast & Applications Network  (see below), in some examples Remote Control  of a plurality of devices and resources like LTPs , RTPs , PCs , mobile phones , television set-top boxes , devices , etc.; in some examples a range of other types of Teleportal Networks , in some examples Teleportal Social Network(s) , in some examples News Network(s) , in some examples Sports Network(s) , in some examples Travel Network(s) , and in some examples other types of Teleportal Networks ; in some examples running a Web browser   that provides access to the Web, Web applications, Web content, Web services, Web sites, etc. as well as to the Teleportal Utility and any of its Teleportal Networks, services, features, applications or capabilities. In some examples it may also provide Virtual Teleportal capabilities  for downloading widgets or applications that attach or run a Virtual Teleportal to online devices  in some examples mobile phones, personal computers, netbooks, laptops, tablets, pads, television set-top boxes, online video games, web pages, websites, etc. In some examples a Virtual Teleportal may be accessed by means of a Web browser  which may be used to add Teleportaling to any online device (in some examples a mobile phone by means of its web browser and data service, even if a vendor artificially \u201clocks out\u201d or blocks that mobile phone from running a Virtual Teleportal). In some examples Teleportals may be used to access entertainment , in some examples traditional entertainment products  and in some examples multiplayer online games , which in some examples have some real world components  (as described elsewhere) and in some examples exist only in a game world . Further in some examples, by means of the AKM (Active Knowledge Machine) said TPU provides interactions with numerous types of devices , which are detailed in the AKM and its components.","Unlike the wide range of different and often complex user interfaces that prevent some customers from using some types, models, basic features, basic functions, or new versions of various devices, applications and systems\u2014and too often prevents them from using a plurality of advanced features of said diversity of devices, applications and systems; said Teleportal Utility    , Teleportal Shared Space(s)  , Virtual Teleportals , Remote Control Teleportaling , Entertainment , Real World Entertainment , and AKM interactions  share an Adaptable Common User Interface  (see the Teleportal Utility below). The conceptual basis of said interface is \u201cteleporting\u201d, that is, the normal and natural steps one would take if it were possible to step directly through a Teleportal into a remote location and interact directly with the actual devices, people, situations, applications, services, objects, etc. that are present on the remote side. Because said Teleportal's \u201cfourth screens\u201d can add a usable interface  across a wide range of interactions         that today require customers to figure out difficulties in interfaces on the many types and models of products, services, applications, etc. that run on today's \u201cthree screens\u201d of PC's, mobile phones and navigable TVs on cable and satellite networks, said Teleportal Utility's Adaptable Common User Interface  could make it easier for customers to use said one shared Teleportal interface to reach higher rates of success and satisfaction when doing a plurality of tasks, and accomplishing a plurality of goals than may be possible when required to try to figure out a myriad of different interfaces on the comparable blizzard of technology-based products, services, applications and systems in the current reality.","As a result of said broad applicability of the Teleportal's \u201cfourth screen\u201d to today's \u201cthree screens\u201d, said Teleportal components           may provide substitutes and\/or additions to current devices, networks and services that constitute innovations in their functionality, ease of use, integration of multiple separate products into one device or system, etc.:","Substitutes: Some Teleportal Devices, Networks and Platform (see below) may optionally be developed as products and services that are intended to provide substitutes for existing products and services (such as run on today's \u201cthree screens\u201d) when users need only the services and functionality that Teleportaling provides, in some examples:","PCs as accessible commodities (online) : In some examples PC's may be used from Teleportals by means of Remote Control  instead of running the PC's themselves. In some examples the purchase of one or a plurality of PCs might be replaced by network-based computing whereby the user runs Web PC's and PC applications online by means of physical and\/or virtual Teleportals . In some examples said PC's may be run online by means of remote control when using a Teleportal(s) . This is true for the potential replacement of home PC's , laptops , netbooks , tablets , pads , etc. In some examples these devices may be replaced by utilizing unused RCTP controllable devices online  from other Teleportal users at some times of the day or evening. In some examples these devices may be unused overnight so might be provided as accessible online resources  for those in parts of the world where it is morning or afternoon, and similarly devices in any part of the world might be made available overnight and provided online  to others when they are not being used. In some examples individuals and companies have unused PCs or laptops with previously purchased applications software that are not the latest generation and are currently not in use, so these might be provided full-time online  to those who need to use a PC as a commodity resource. In some examples these devices may be provided for a charge  and provide their owners income in return for making them available online. In some examples these devices might be provided free online  to a charity who provides access to PC's worldwide such as to school children in developing countries, to charities that can't afford to buy enough PC's, etc.","Some mobile phone and landline calling services : In some examples one or a plurality of mobile and landline telephone services might be replaced by Teleportal Shared Space(s) , whether from a fixed location by means of a Local Teleportal (LTP) , from mobile locations by means of a Mobile Teleportal (MTP) , by means of Alternate Input Devices (AIDs) \/Alternate Output Devices (AODs)  , etc.","Mobile phone or landline telephone services: There are obvious substitutions such as substituting for telephone communications . In some examples some phone applications like texting  may be run on a TP Device , by means of a Virtual Teleportal , in some examples texting  may be run on a Web browser in a mobile phone , in some examples texting  may be run when a Web browser  in turn runs a Virtual Teleportal  that provides said services substitution), run by online TP applications , etc. In some examples location-based services such as navigation and local search may be replaced on Teleportals  (again with TP-specific differences). In some examples telephone services in some examples telephone directories, voice mail\/messaging, etc. may have Teleportal parallels  (though with TP-specific differences).","Cable television   and satellite television   on Teleportals instead of on Televisions: In some examples cable television set-top boxes, or satellite television set-top boxes (herein both cable and satellite sources are referred to as \u201cset-top boxes\u201d), may be used from Teleportals by means of Remote Control  instead of running the output signal from the set-top boxes on Television sets. In some examples the purchase of one or a plurality of cable and\/or satellite television subscriptions might be replaced by network-based viewing whereby the user runs set-top boxes online by means of physical and\/or Virtual Teleportals . In some examples said set-top boxes may be run and used online by means of remote control when using a Teleportal(s) remotely . This is true for the potential replacement of home televisions , cable television subscriptions , satellite television subscriptions , etc. In some examples these set-top box devices may be replaced by utilizing unused devices online  from other Teleportal users at various times of the day or night. In some examples these set-top boxes may be unused during late overnight hours so might be provided as accessible online resources  for those in parts of the world where it is a good time to watch television, and similarly set-top boxes in any part of the world might be made available during overnight hours and provided online  to others when they are not being used\u2014which may help globalize television viewing. In some examples individuals and companies have set-top boxes with two or more tuners where an available tuner might be run remotely to record a television show(s) for later retrieval or playback. In some examples television may be accessed and displayed by means of IPTV  (which is television that is Internet-based and IP-based). In some examples a teleportal may view television shows, videos or multimedia that is available on demand and\/or broadcast over the Internet by means of a Web browser  or a web application .","Services, applications and systems: Some widely used online services might be provided by Teleportals. Some examples include PC-based and mobile phone-based services like Web browsing and Web-based email, social networks access, online games, accessing live events, news (which may include news of specific categories and formats such as general, business, sports, technology, etc. news, in formats such as text, video, interviews, \u201ctweets,\u201d live observation, recorded observations, etc.), location-based services, web search, local search, online education, visiting entertainments, alerts, etc.\u2014along with advertising and marketing that accompanies any of these. These and other services, applications and systems may be accessed by means such as an application(s), a Web browser that runs on physical Teleportals, runs on other devices by means of Virtual Teleportals, runs on other remote Teleportals by means of Remote Control Teleportaling, etc.","New innovations: Entirely new classes of devices, services, systems, machines, etc. might be accessed by means of a Teleportal(s) or innovative new features on Teleportals, such as 3D displays, e-paper, and other innovative uses described herein.","Additions to Subsidiary Devices: Alternatively, vendors of PCs, mobile phones, cable television, satellite television, landline phone services, broadband Internet services, etc., may utilize ARTPM technology(ies) (it's IP [Intellectual Property]) and Utility(ies) to add Teleportal features and capabilities to their devices, networks and\/or network services\u2014whether as part of their basic subscription plan(s), or for an additional charge by adding it as another premium, separately priced service(s).","PHYSICAL REALITY\u2014PRIOR ART TO THIS ALTERNATE REALITY: The current reality is physical and local and it is well-known to everyone. As depicted in , \u201cPhysical Reality (Prior Art),\u201d the Earth  is the normal and usual physical reality for all human beings. When you walk out on a public city street  you are present there and can see everything that is present on the street with you\u2014all the people, sidewalks, buildings, stores, cars, streetlights, security cameras, etc. Similarly, all the people and cameras present on that street at that time can see you. Direct visual and auditory contact does not have any separation between people\u2014everyone can see each other, talk to each other, hear what any person says if they are close enough to them, etc. Physical reality is the same when you go to the airport to get on a plane  to fly to an ocean beach resort . When you arrive at the airport and are present in it you can see everyone and everything there, and everyone who is at the airport and in the same space as you can see you. Physical reality stays the same after you go through the airport's security checkpoint and are in the more secure area of your plane's boarding gate\u2014again, in the place you are present you can see and hear everyone and everything, and everyone and everything can see and hear you. Physical reality stays the same on the plane during the flight , when you arrive at your vacation beach resort , and when you walk on the beach. When you walk through the resort, go down to the beach and stand gazing over the ocean at the sunset  everyone who is present in the same physical reality as you can see you and talk to you. No matter where you travel on the Earth  by walking, driving a car or flying in a plane physical reality stays the same. The state of things as they actually exist is when you go into any public place anywhere, at any time, you can see everyone and everything that is there, and if you are close enough to a person you can also hear that person\u2014and in every public place you are present everyone who is there can see you, and anyone who is close enough to you can also hear you.","Physical reality is the same in private spaces such as when you use a security badge to enter your employer's private company offices in the city . Once you enter your company's private offices everyone who is in the same space as you can see you regardless of whether you are in a receptionist's entry area, a conference room, a hallway, a cubicle, an R&D lab, etc.\u2014and in each of these private spaces you can see everyone who is in each place with you. If you want to enter anyone's even more private space you can simply walk to their open door or cubicle entry and knock and ask if they have a minute, or if you see the person in a hallway you can simply stop and talk to him or her.","Physical reality stays the same in your most private spaces such as when you drive home to your house such as a home in the suburbs . If anyone is at home such as your family, and you are in the same room with any of them you can see and hear them and they can see and hear you. In this most private of spaces you can see and be with everyone who is in your house but not with you simply by walking down the hall and going into the room they are in.","Some issues about physical reality are helpful. We have long had the implicit assumption that using a telephone, video conference, video call, etc. involves first identifying a particular person or group and then contacting that person or group by means such as dialing a phone number, entering a list of email addresses, entering a web address, etc. Though not expressed a digital contact was person-to-person (or group to group in a video conference), and it was different than being simultaneously present in Physical Reality\u2014you need to contact someone to make a digital connection. Until you make a selection and a contact you cannot see and hear everyone and everyone cannot see or hear you.","Another issue is from fields such as science, ethics, morality, politics, philosophy, etc. This is also an implicit assumption that underlies many fields of human activity\u2014given what we know about the way the world is, we know this is not an ideal world and it has room for improvements, so what should those improvements be? It doesn't matter whether our recognition of this implicit assumption comes from the fields of science, ethics, morality, politics, philosophy, sociology, psychology, simply talking to someone else, or many other areas of society or life. As we stand anywhere on the Earth and look about us at our physical reality, including all the people, places, tools, resources, etc. we can see from the many things people have done there is a widely practiced implicit assumption that we can make this a better place\u2014whether we are improving it for ourselves, for other people, for the things around us, or for the environment in which everything lives.","This recitation starts with its \u201cfeet on the ground\u201d of physical reality and moves immediately to the two issues just raised: First, why doesn't digital reality work the same as physical reality? Suppose an Alternate Reality made digital reality work the same as physical reality\u2014you see everywhere, every one, and are present with everything connected. In the ARTPM's digital reality you have an immediate, open, always on connection with the available people, places, tools, resources, etc. Even more interesting as a transformation, everyone and everything (including accessible tools and resources) can see you, too. The ARTPM calls this a Shared Planetary Life Space (SPLS), and just as in physical reality there are both public SPLS's in which everyone is present, and private SPLS's where you define the boundaries\u2014and you can even have secret SPLS's where the boundaries are even more confidential. Just as when you walk out on a public physical street and see everything and everything sees you, when you enter a PUBLIC Shared Planetary Life Space you have an immediate open connection with everyone and everything that is available in that public digital SPLS. And just as when you walk into a private physical place such as your home or a company's private offices, when you enter a PRIVATE Shared Planetary Life Space you have an immediate private connection with everyone and everything that is a member of that private SPLS.","While it is a substantial change to make digital reality parallel physical reality, the real question is the second issue, that the world as it is not ideal and has room for improvements, so what should those improvements be? This Alternate Reality's answer is the ARTPM. Digital reality is designed by people so people can make it into what they want and need. As a starting point, can that be more meaningful and valuable then what has become known as virtual reality, digital communications, augmented reality, and various applications and digital communications achieved with telephone land lines, PCs, mobile phones, television set-top boxes, digital entertainment, etc.","This Alternate Reality has a digital reality that in some examples has the explicit goal of helping us become better in multiple ways we want and choose. In addition to Shared Planetary Life Spaces it includes self-improvement processes so a normal part of digital presence is receiving Active Knowledge about how to succeed, which may include seeing its current state, knowing the \u201cbest choice(s)\u201d available, and being able to switch directly and successfully to what's best\u2014to make your life better and more successful sooner. Your digital presence includes immediate opportunities to do more, want more, and have more.","The cultural evolution of this Alternate Reality has a divergent trajectory: \u201cIf you want a better reality, choose it.\u201d","As an addition to our Physical Reality (prior art), this recitation introduces the Expandaverse and it's technologies and components\u2014a new design for an Alternate Reality, collectively known as the Alternate Reality Teleportal Machine.","SOME ALTERNATE REALITY TRANSFORMATIONS\u2014MULTIPLE IDENTITIES AND DIGITAL PRESENCES: Turning now to , \u201cAlternate Reality (Expandaverse),\u201d this recitation includes a TP Shared Spaces Network (herein TP SSN), multiple identities  , an Alternate Realities Machine (herein ARM) with Shared Planetary Life Spaces  , boundaries management to control those SPLS's, and ARTPM components that relate generally to providing means for individuals, groups and the public to fundamentally redefine our common human reality as multiple human identities, multiple realities (via ARM management of the boundaries of Shared Planetary Life Spaces, or SPLS), and more\u2014so that our chosen digital realities are a better reflection of our needs and desires. In addition, this includes accessible constructed digital realities and participatory digital events that may be utilized by various means described herein such as streamed from RTPs (Remote Teleportals); digital presence at events such as by PlanetCentrals, GoPorts, alert systems, third-party services; and other means that relate generally to providing means for enjoying, utilizing, participating, etc. various types of constructed digital realities as described herein.","In our current reality physical presence is more important and digital contacts are secondary. The ARTPM diverges from our current reality which is physical, and where our primary presence is in a common current reality\u2014the ARTPM provides means for one or a plurality of users to reverse the current physical presence-first priority so that an SPLS provides closer \u201calways on\u201d connections to both people (such as individuals or identities) and parts of the world (such as unaltered or digitally constructed) that are most interesting and important to us, regardless of their locations or whether they are people, places, tools, resources, digital constructs, etc.\u2014it is a multi-dimensional Alternate Reality from what local physical reality has been throughout human evolution and history.","In some examples the ARTPM embodies larger goals: A human life is too short\u2014we die after too few decades. Many would like to live for centuries but this is medically out of reach for those alive today. Instead, the ARTPM provides means to extend life within our current life spans by enabling people to enjoy living multiple lives    at one time, thereby expanding our \u201clife time\u201d in parallel  rather than longitudinally. In brief, we can each live the equivalent of more lives   within our limited years   in more \u201cplaces\u201d  by having multiple identities , even if we are not able to increase the number of years we are alive.","In some examples another larger goal is the success and happiness of each of our identities   . Each identity  may create, buy, control, manage, participate in, enjoy, experience, etc. one or a plurality of Shared Planetary Life Spaces    in which they may have other incomes, activities or enjoyments; and each of their identities   may also utilize ARTPM components in some examples the Active Knowledge Machine (herein AKM), reporting of current \u201cbest choices,\u201d etc. to know more about what they need to do to have more successful lives in the emerging digital environments  . Thus, one person's multiple identities may each become better at learning, growing, interacting, earning, enjoying more varied entertainments, being more satisfied, becoming more successful, etc.\u2014as well as better connected with the people, places, tools and resources that are most important to them. In addition to the SPLS's    and the constructed digital realities    and participatory digital events    that are controlled and\/or enjoyed by each identity   , a person's identities   may be present in other SPLS's    and\/or in constructed digital realities    and\/or in participatory digital events    that may each be public (such as a Directory(ies), rock concert, South Pacific beach, San Francisco bar, etc.), or private (such as an extended family, a company where a person works, a religious institution such as a local church or temple, a private meeting, an invitation-only performance, a privately shared experience, etc.).","Therefore, in some examples it is an object of the Alternate Realities Machine to introduce a new digital paradigm for human reality whereby each person may control their identities   , their SPLS reality(ies)   , and their digitally realities    and presence at participatory digital events    by utilizing one or a plurality of means provided by the ARTPM\u2014means that diverge from our current historical reality by controlling our identities   , controlling our realities      , and ultimately may give us control over reality. In a brief summary, this new digital paradigm may be simple: \u201cIf you want a better reality, choose it.\u201d","SUMMARY OF THE ALTERNATE REALITIES MACHINE (ARM): Turning now to , \u201cTeleportal Machine (TPM) Alternate Realities Summary: Alternate Realities Machine (ARM),\u201d some components of the ARM, which is a component of the ARTPM, is illustrated at a high level. Said illustration begins with the Current Reality  in which the Earth  provides Physical Reality  for one person at a time . As our current mass communications culture and Digital Era emerged one characteristic of the Current Reality  is large and growing volumes of public culture , commercial advertising , media , and messaging  that floods each person   and competes for each person's attention, brand awareness, desires, emotional attachments, beliefs, actions, etc. Our expanding waistlines\u2014the worldwide \u201cgrowth\u201d of obesity\u2014is perhaps the most visible evidence of the success of the common culture in capturing the \u201cmind share\u201d of large numbers of people. In sum, many facets of the ordinary culture  and its imposed advertising , messages , and media  attempts to dominate a large and growing part of each person's   attention, desires and activities.","In a brief summation of some examples, the Alternate Realities Machine (ARM)  enables departure from the current common reality  by providing multiple and flexible means for people and groups to filter, exclude and protect themselves from what is not wanted, while including what is wanted, and also protecting themselves both digitally and physically. Additionally, the ARM provides means (optional TP Paywalls) so that individuals and groups may choose to earn money by permitting entry by chosen advertisers and\/or people which are willing to pay for attention and \u201cmind share.\u201d In a brief and familiar parallel, people typically use a television DVR (Digital Video Recorder) to skip advertisements and record\/watch only the shows and news they want, along with some \u201clive\u201d television that they would like to see. Similarly, the ARM provides what in some examples could be called an \u201cautomated digital remote control\u201d (its means are control over each SPLS's boundaries) so each separate SPLS reality excludes what we don't want and includes what we like, plus it may include optional paywalls and protections, so we no longer need to blindly accept everything the ordinary current reality attempts to impose on us. In fact, by using the ARM in some examples we can selectively filter the common mass culture to make it more like the individually supportive, positive, safe and successful culture that some might like it to be.","The ARM's means for this, at a high level and in some examples, includes each person  establishing one or a plurality of identities  (each of which may be a public identity, a private identity, or a secret identity). In turn, each identity  may have one or a plurality of Shared Planetary Life Spaces . In some examples, one identity  may have separate or combined SPLS's for various personal roles, activities, etc., with separate or combined SPLS's for personal interests such as a career  with professional associations, a particular job , a profession  with professional relationships, other multiple incomes , family , extended family , friends , hobbies , sports , recreation , travel , fun  (which may also be done by separate public, private, and\/or secret identities), a second home , a private lifestyle , etc.","Each SPLS defines its \u201creality\u201d by controlling boundaries  and in some examples ARM Boundaries Management         is employed, which has a plurality of example boundaries  to illustrate the use of boundaries to limit, prioritize and provide various functions and features for separate and different realities. In some examples these SPLS boundaries include priorities  to include and highlight what is wanted, filters  to exclude what is not wanted, (optional) paywalls  to require and receive payment for providing one's attention to certain elements of the common culture, and\/or protections  which may be used to provide both digital and physical protection (as well as to protect various devices from theft).","In some examples these boundaries define a range of types of SPLS's, some of which are included in a high-level visualization  that starts at the broadest public reality  and moves to the most private, personal and non-public reality . Starting broadly, the current public reality remains  with no ARM , no identities  , and no SPLS's  . Within that, ARM Boundaries Management  provides multiple levels of controls and multiple types of SPLS's     , which in some examples include: Public SPLS's  which are various manifestations of the ordinary public culture and provide only limited filters or protections, in some examples a state's citizens , in some examples a vendor's customers , in some examples a social network's members , etc. The next level is Groups' SPLS's  which in some examples may include the groups to which that person is a member , in some examples each of those groups' SPLS's, and filters or paywalls they have applied to their SPLS's; in some examples a company where one works , in some examples a governance that an identity has joined , in some examples a church or temple where one is a member , etc.; these group SPLS's would include the boundaries each group decides it wants, which in some examples would be more restrictive and confidential for many corporations , more values-based or behavior-based for religious institutions , etc. The next levels are personal SPLS's    and these include in some examples one's public personal SPLS's  in some examples one's private and\/or secret SPLS's  (if any), as well as any paywall(s)  that one might add; these would use whatever combination, of filtering , priorities , paywall(s) , and protections  each identity would like, with some identities employing more intense, different, or varied boundaries than others.","In some examples broad learning of \u201cwhat's best\u201d   with rapid distribution   and adoption of that  may be employed to help people achieve increasing success  over time . This would shift control over today's current singular reality to individual choices of multiple new and evolving trajectories. The pace of this would be affected by these new realities' capabilities for delivering what people would like    , as it would be affected by the excessive level and poor quality of messaging from the ordinary public culture  , as it would be affected by people's desires to create and live in their desired alternate realities    \u2014so this is likely to match what the people in each historical moment want and need , as well as evolving over time  to reflect their expanding or diminishing desires. This \u201cExpandaverse\u201d growth in human realities is based on another component of the ARM (Alternate Realities Machine) which is (are) Directory(ies)  that include public, group, private and other Directories . These may be \u201cmined\u201d  and analyzed  for various metrics and data  that may include users , identities , profiles , results , status data , SPLS's , presence , places , tools , resources , face recognition data , other biometric data , authorizations or authentications data , etc. Since SPLS metrics may be tracked and reported  (such as what is most successful, effective, satisfying, etc.) in some examples it is possible to choose one's goals  and look up these analyses , or perform them as needed , to determine \u201cwhat's best\u201d and the characteristics, choices, settings, etc. used to achieve that. Because it is possible to save, access, copy, install, and try those choices, ARM identity settings  , SPLS configurations     , etc. in some examples this enables rapid learning, setup and use of the most effective or popular ways to apply identities for various types of goals, including their boundaries settings such as priorities , filters , paywalls , protections , etc.","An important distinction is the potential scale and volume of manageable alternate realities that may be enabled by the ARM . In some examples this may be far more than a simple division of the one current reality into a few variations\u2014because each person   may have one or a plurality of identities   (which may be changed over time); and because each identity may have one or a plurality of SPLS's          (which may be changed over time); and because each identity may be public, private or secret. It is entirely conceivable that an identity may be created to control one SPLS's boundaries so that this \u201creality\u201d includes only one other person, a place or two, a couple of communications tools and financial resources, and everything else excluded\u2014a digital world created for one's true love so two people could find happiness and, while together, make their way in the larger world as a unique and special couple. With the ability to find  , copy  and re-use  settings any types of identities, lifestyles or personal goals that can be expressed           may become popular and copied widely , enabling both personal    and cultural    growth in multiple trajectories  that are unimaginable today.","CURRENT DEVICES\u2014PRIOR ART TO THIS ALTERNATE REALITY: Before describing the ARTPM's Teleportal Devices,  illustrates the current reality's numerous different digital devices that have separate operating systems, interfaces and networks; different means of use for communications and other tasks; different content types that sometimes overlap with each other (with different interfaces and means for accessing the same content); etc.","Essential underlying issues among the current reality's digital devices have parallels to the history of the book. Between about 1435 and 1444 Johann Gutenberg devoted himself to a range of inventions that related to the process of printing with movable type, and he opened the first printing establishment in 1455. In 1457 the first printed book with a printer's imprint was published (the famous Mainz Psalter). Printing spread by training apprentices and others who learned the trade, then went on to move to new cities and open their own printing shops. By 1489 there were 110 printing shops across Europe and by 1500 more than 200. At that time only about 200,000 Europeans could read so books were not the main part of a printer's business, which included posters, broadsheets, pamphlets, and varied shorter works than full books.","Early books were not standardized and took many different layouts and forms, many of them expensive to produce and buy. Most early books simply attempted to imitate the appearance of hand lettered manuscripts and many printers would cut a new typeface to imitate a manuscript when it was copied, even if the letter forms were fairly illegible. Basic elements of \u201cthe book\u201d had to be developed and then adopted as standards. An example is a title page that listed a definite title for the book, the author's name, and the printer's name and address. Even simple devices like page numbers, reasonable margins, and a contents page that refers to page numbers rather than sections of the text were both innovations and gradually emerging standards. The content of that century's books were often based on verbal discourse and storytelling\u2014the culture of most people (even those who could read) was oral or semi-oral\u2014so at the level of the text printers were required to regularize spelling, standardize punctuation, separate long blocks of text into paragraphs, etc. Gradually innovations were also made in making text more accessible and readable such as by breaking up the text into units so it was easier to read and return to a section or passage. Together, these innovations and emerging standards made books easier and faster to read which expanded the ways that books could be used, as well as helping spread literacy to more people.","It took about 80 years\u2014until about 1530\u2014before these innovations became widely enough adopted that it could be said that the \u201cbook\u201d was developed and standardized. Today, a \u201ctraditional\u201d book has many of the elements that took most of the book's first century. This initial century yielded the following \u201ctypical book\u201d: A book begins with a jacket with endpapers glued to it and the body of the bound book glued to the endpapers (though with a paperback the jacket and endpapers are the same wrap-around cover, with the bound book glued to it). The bound content normally follows a predictable sequence, with the right (or recto) side considered dominant and the left (or verso) side subordinate. The front matter (traditionally called \u201cpreliminaries\u201d) includes one or more blank pages, a series or \u201cbastard\u201d title on a new right page, a frontispiece on the left, the title page on the right, on the left behind the title page, dedication on the right, a Foreword that begins on the right, a Preface that begins on the right, Acknowledgments that begin on the right, Contents that begin on the right, an Illustrations List that begins on the right or the left, an Introduction that begins on the right. The body of a traditional book's text is equally structured and begins with a part title on the right (if the book is divided into major parts or sections), the opening of each chapter begins in the middle of a right page with the chapter title or chapter number above it (chapter numbers were traditionally Roman Numerals if a small number of chapters, or Arabic numerals if a larger number of chapters), and if illustrated a book may include a separate section for illustrations or plates (which began on a right page). The traditional book's \u201cback matter\u201d includes an Appendix that begins on the right, Notes that begins on the right, a Bibliography that begins on the right, Illustration Credits that begins on the right, a Glossary that begins on the right, an Index that begins on the right, a Colophon that begins on the right or the left, and one or more blank pages.","It was worth spending most of a century developing this \u201cstandardized\u201d or \u201ctypical\u201d book. This traditional book form communicates more than importance and distinction. It is visible proof that every word of a book is written, edited, designed and printed with care, credibility, authority and taste. For all who are literate the book's layout and design are predictable, easy-to-use, easy to store and care for, and easy to return to any needed parts or passages whenever wanted. These innovations and advances are part of why books are widely credited with playing key roles in the development of the Renaissance, Science, the Reformation, Navigation, Europe's exploration of the world, and much more. During the 1500's more than 200,000 book titles have been recorded, and with an estimated 1,000 copies per title, that is more than 200 million books printed. During the first half of the 1600's that number is estimated to have tripled\u2014so the spread of this new standard book \u201cdevice\u201d was increasingly part of Europe's wider economic, scientific and cultural progress.","Today, the emergence of our digital environment, with numerous overlapping devices, has parallels to the first century of the book. As depicted in , today's digital era is young and our many digital devices  are non-standard, not predictable to use, and do not have a common interface structure that can be employed easily for their range of features, and returned to easily after a period of non-use with easy pick-up where one left off. Yet today's digital devices      increasingly provide access to similar or overlapping digital media and content, and they also do many of the same things with digital content and interactions\u2014they find, open, display, use, edit, save, look up, contact, attach, transmit, distribute, etc.  lists some examples of these \u201ccurrent devices\u201d  which includes: Mobile phones , landline telephones , VOIP phone lines , wearable computing devices , cameras built into mobile devices  , PCs , laptops , stationary internet appliances , netbooks , tablets , e-pads , mobile internet appliances , online game systems , internet-enabled televisions , television set-top boxes , DVR's (digital video recorders) , digital cameras , surveillance cameras , sensors  (of many types; in some examples biometric sensors, in some examples personal health monitors, in some examples presence detectors, etc.), web applications , websites , web services , web content , etc.","Therefore, there was a recognition of today's parallels to the first century of the book in the \u201chistory\u201d of the Alternate Reality. They factored the parallel functionality and content of the many siloed digital devices  and the Alternate Reality evolved a digital devices environment (the ARTPM) that is summarized in . To facilitate this transition the Alternate Reality included the (optional) capability to use a plurality of current devices  as Subsidiary Devices to the TPM  in , essentially turning them into commodity input\/output devices within the TPM's digital environment\u2014but with a common and predictable TP interface that could be used widely and consistently to establish access and remote control, essentially raising the productivity of using a plurality of existing digital devices.","TPM DEVICES SUMMARY: After years of building and using the Internet and other networks (such as private, corporate, government, mobile phone, cable TV, satellite, service-provider, etc.), the capabilities for presence to solve both individual and\/or collective problems are still in their infancy.

Optionally, this \u201cwindow's\u201d remote presence may behave as if it were a local window because (1) the viewpoint displayed changes automatically to reflect the viewer's position relative to the remote scene (without needing to send commands to the Remote Teleportal's camera(s) by means of a Superior Viewer Sensor (SVS) and related processing in a Local Processing Module), and (2) audio sounds from the remote location may be heard \u201cthrough\u201d this \u201cwindow\u201d as if the viewer was present at the remote location and was viewing it through a local window. In addition, alternate video and audio input and output devices may optionally be used with or separately from a Local Teleportal. An In some examples this includes a video camera\/microphone , along with processing in the LTP's Processing Module  and transmission via the LTP's Communications Module  to use Teleportal Shared Space(s), and\/or to provide personal narration or other local video to make Teleportal broadcasts or augment Teleportal applications.

In addition, optional processing and storage by an RTP Processing Module  may be used with or separately from a Remote Teleportal (in some examples for running video applications, for storing video and audio; for dynamic video alterations of the content of a real-time or near-real-time video stream, etc.), along with transmission of real-time and\/or stored video and audio by an RTP's Communications Module . Optionally, alternative remote input to or output from this Teleportal Utility   may be provided by other means in some examples an AID\/AOD  (in some examples an Alternative Input\/Output Device such as a mobile phone with a video camera ) or other means.","Alternate Input Devices (AIDs) \/Alternate Output Devices (AODs) : In some examples these include devices that may be utilized to provide inputs and\/or outputs to\/from the TPM, such as mobile phones, computing devices, communications devices, tablets, pads, communications-enabled televisions, TV set-top boxes, communications-enabled DVRs, electronic games, etc. including both stationary and portable devices. While these are not a Teleportal they may run a Virtual Teleportal (VTP) or a web browser that emulates a LTP and\/or a MTP. Depending on the device's capabilities and connectivity, they may also be able to use the VTP or browser emulation to operate the device as if it were an LTP, a MTP or an RTP\u2014including some or many of a TP Device's functions and features.","Devices : In some examples the TPM includes an Active Knowledge Machine (AKM) which transforms a plurality of types of products, equipment, services, applications, information, entertainment, etc. into \u201cAKM Devices\u201d (hereinafter \u201cDevices\u201d) that may be served by one or more AKMs (Active Knowledge Machines).

The request is received, parsed, the appropriate Active Knowledge Instructions (AKI) and\/or Active Knowledge and\/or marketing or advertising is determined, then retrieved from Active Knowledge Resources (AKR). The AKM determines the receiving device, formats the AKI and AK content for that device, then sends it to said receiving device. The AKM determines the result by receiving an (optional) response; if not successful the AKM may repeat the process or the result received may indicate success; in either case, it logs the event in AK results (raw data). Through optimizations the AKM may utilize said AK results to improve the AKR, AKI and AK content, AK message format, etc. The AKI and AK delivered may include additional content such as advertisements, links to additional AK (such as \u201cbest choice\u201d for that type of device, reports or dashboards on a user's or group's performance), etc. Reporting is by means of standard or custom dashboards, standard or custom reports, etc., and said reporting may be provided to individual users, sponsors (such as advertisers), device vendors, AKM systems that employ AK results data, other external applications that employ AK results data, etc.","Teleportal Network (TPN) : In some examples a \u201cTeleportal Network\u201d (or TPN) provides communications means to connect Teleportal Devices in some examples LTPs , MTPs , RTPs , AIDs\/AODs  by means of various devices and systems that are in a separate patent application.

A pictorial illustration of this  view will be discussed in , \u201cSummary of TPM Connections and Interactions.\u201d The Teleportal Utility's (TPU's) Adaptable Consistent Interface and user experience is illustrated and discussed in  and elsewhere. To begin, the stack view in  summarizes the types of connections and interfaces in the TPM Devices Environment     in . From this view there are five main types of connections  and just one TPU Interface  across these five types of connections. With FIG. 's focused view of five connection types and one TPU Interface it can be seen that all parts of the ARTPM, including Subsidiary Devices, can be run in a manageable way by almost any user throughout the ARTPM digital environment. This architecture of five main types of connections  and one TPU Interface  is consciously designed as a radical Alternate Reality simplification of our current reality where a blizzard of devices and interfaces are comparatively complex and difficult to use\u2014in fact, our current reality requires an entire set of professions and functions (variously known as usability, ergonomics, formative evaluation, interface design, parts of documentation, parts of customer support, etc.) to deal with the resulting complexities and user difficulties.","This Alternate Reality TPM stack view includes: (1) Direct Teleportal Use  employs the consistent TPU Interface  across LTPs (Local Teleportals)   , MTPs (Mobile Teleportals)   , and RTPs (Remote Teleportals)   ; (2) Virtual Teleportal (VTP) use   employs an adaptable subset of the consistent TPU Interface  and is used on AIDs\/AODs (Alternate Input Devices\/Alternate Output Devices)    as described elsewhere (it is worth noting that whether a VTP can run on each of these AID\/AOD devices depends on the functions and capabilities of each AID\/AOD device; and when it can run only an adapted subset of VTP capabilities only some TP features may be available\u2014and those features would employ a subset of the Consistent TPU Interface ); (3) Remote Control Teleportaling (RCTP) use  employs an adaptable subset of the consistent TPU Interface  and is used on Subsidiary Devices    as described elsewhere (it is worth noting that whether an RCTP can run on each of these Subsidiary Devices depends on the functions and capabilities of each Subsidiary Device; and when it can run only an adapted subset of RCTP capabilities only some TP features may be available\u2014and those features would employ a subset of the Consistent TPU Interface ); (4) Devices In Use (DIU)  employs an AKM (Active Knowledge Machine) subset of the consistent TPU Interface  and is used on DIU's    or on Intermediary Devices    as described elsewhere (such as in the AKM starting in  and elsewhere; it is worth noting that the AKM subset of the adaptable TPU Interface  varies considerably by the functions and capabilities of each Device In Use and\/or its Intermediary Device; and when it can run only an adapted subset of RCTP capabilities only some TP features may be available\u2014and those features would employ a subset of the Consistent TPU Interface ); (5) Administration  of one's User Profile , account(s), subscription(s), membership(s), settings, etc. (such as of the TPU    ; TPN    ; etc.) employs the consistent TPU Interface  when said Administration  is done by means of a TP Device such as LTPs (Local Teleportals)   , MTPs (Mobile Teleportals)   , and RTPs (Remote Teleportals)   ; it employs an adaptable subset of the consistent TPU Interface  when Administration  is done by means of a VTP on an AID\/AOD (Alternate Input Device\/Alternate Output Device)   .","The TPU's Adaptable Consistent Interface  is an intriguing possibility. Improved designs have replaced the leaders of entire industries such as when Microsoft locked down market control of the PC operating system and Office software industries by introducing Windows and Microsoft Office. For another example; Apple became a leader of the music, smart phone and related electronic tablet industries with its iPod\/iPhone\/iPad\/iTunes product lines. These types of transformations are rare but possible, especially when a major company drives it. In a possible parallel business evolution, the advent of the Teleportal Utility's (TPU's) Adaptable Consistent Interface   in  \u201cUser Experience\u201d might provide one or more major companies with the business opportunity to attempt replacing current industry leaders in multiple business categories. They would offer users a new choice between today's blizzard of different and (in combination) hard to learn and confusing interfaces, or users could choose one TPU Adaptable Consistent Interface   across a digital environment. Another competitive advantage is the current anti-customer business model of leading vendors who have saturated their markets (like Microsoft) and are unable to fill their annual coffers if they can't compel their customers to buy upgrades to products they already own\u2014so in our current reality customers are required to buy treadmill versions of products they already own, with versions that often make their users feel more like rats on a wheel than the more advanced, more productive champions of the future depicted in their vendors' marketing. As a comparison, the Teleportal Utility's (TPU's) Adaptable Consistent Interface  is kept updated to fit a plurality of users' preferences and devices, as described elsewhere.","In summary, with one TPU Adaptable Consistent Interface  and a set of main types of connections , users are able to learn and productively utilize the TP Devices environment         , including Virtual Teleportals   on AIDs\/AODs, and with Remote Control of Subsidiary Devices . With this type of Alternate Reality TPM departure possible, is it any wonder why the \u201cAlternate Reality\u201d chose this simpler path, and chose to invent around the bewildering user interfaces problems of our current reality?","SUMMARY OF ARTPM CONNECTIONS AND INTERACTIONS: Some pictorial examples are illustrated in , \u201cSummary of TPM Connections and Interactions.\u201d These reverse the Stack View in  by showing the TP Devices depicted in , but listing each device's types of connections and interactions.

In some examples users may enter the TP Devices environment by using an (1) LTP  or an MTP , (2) a RTP , (3) an AID\/AOD , (4) Devices In Use , or for (5) Administration .","In each of these cases: (1) When a user  makes direct use of a Local Teleportal (LTP)  or a Mobile Teleportal  the user employs the Consistent TPU Interface ; when said user  employs the LTP  or MTP  to control a Subsidiary Device       the user employs Remote Control Teleportaling (RCTP)  which is an adaptable subset of the consistent TPU Interface  (it is worth noting that whether an RCTP can run on each of these Subsidiary Devices depends on the functions and capabilities of each Subsidiary Device; and when it can run only an adapted subset of RCTP capabilities only some TP features may be available\u2014and those features would employ a subset of the Consistent TPU Interface ); (2) When a user  makes direct use of a Remote Teleportal (RTP)  the user employs the Consistent TPU Interface ; when said user  employs the RTP  to control a Subsidiary Device       the user employs Remote Control Teleportaling (RCTP)  which is an adaptable subset of the consistent TPU Interface  (it is worth noting that whether an RCTP can run on each of these Subsidiary Devices depends on the functions and capabilities of each Subsidiary Device; and when it can run only an adapted subset of RCTP capabilities only some TP features may be available\u2014and those features would employ a subset of the Consistent TPU Interface ); (3) When a user  makes direct use of an Alternate Input Device\/Alternate Output Device (AID\/AOD)  because it may have a plurality of Teleportaling features built into it the user may employ the Consistent TPU Interface  for those direct Teleportaling features if that device's vendor also adopts the Consistent TPU Interface  for those Teleportaling features; when said user  employs an AID\/AOD  by means of a Virtual Teleportal (VTP)  that VTP is an adaptable subset of the consistent TPU Interface  as described elsewhere (it is worth noting that whether a VTP can run on each of these AID\/AOD devices depends on the functions and capabilities of each AID\/AOD device; and when it can run only an adapted subset of VTP capabilities only some TP features may be available\u2014and those features would employ a subset of the Consistent TPU Interface ); when said user  employs an AID\/AOD  by means of a Virtual Teleportal (VTP)  that may be used to control a Subsidiary Device       by means of Remote Control Teleportaling (RCTP)  which is an adaptable subset of the consistent TPU Interface  (it is worth noting that whether a combined VTP and RCTP can run on each of these Subsidiary Devices depends on the functions and capabilities of each Subsidiary Device; and when it can run only an adapted subset of VTP and RCTP capabilities only some TP features may be available\u2014and those features would employ a subset of the Consistent TPU Interface ); (4) When a user  makes direct use of TPU's Active Knowledge Instructions (AKI) and\/or Active Knowledge (AK) on a Device In Use (DIU)  the user may employ the Consistent TPU Interface  which contains an adaptable AKM interface for said AKM uses   if that device's vendor also adopts the Consistent TPU Interface  for said device's AKM deliveries and interactions (it is worth noting that whether a DIU can run an AKM interaction and display the AKI\/AK depends on the functions and capabilities of each DIU; and when it can run only an adapted subset of AKM capabilities only some AKI\/AK may be available\u2014and those features would employ a subset of the AKM portion of the Consistent TPU Interface ); when a user  employs an intermediary device (in some examples an MTP , in some examples an AID\/AOD , etc.) for an Active Knowledge Machine interaction on behalf of a Device In Use , the user employs the Consistent TPU Interface  which contains an adaptable AKM interface for said AKM uses  ; (5) When a user  administers said user's  profile , account(s), subscription(s), membership(s), settings, etc. (such as of the TPU  ; TPN  ; etc.) the user may employ the Consistent TPU Interface  when said Administration  is done by means of a TP Device such as LTPs , MTPs , and RTPs ; said user  employs an adaptable subset of the Consistent TPU Interface  when Administration  is done by means of a VTP on an AID\/AOD .","Again, the range of TP Devices         and types of user connections      employ one Consistent TPU Interface , which is customizable and adaptable by means of subsets to various AID\/AOD devices , Subsidiary Devices , and Devices In Use  as described in  and elsewhere. This means a user can learn just one interface and then manage and control the ARTPM's range of features and devices, as well as subsidiary devices. This Alternate Reality is designed as a radical simplification of our current reality which requires multiple professions, corporate functions and huge costs (such as parts of customer support, parts of documentation, usability, ergonomics, formative evaluation, etc.) to deal with the numerous user difficulties that result from today's inconsistent designs and complexities.","Logically Grouped List of ARTPM Components: To assist in understanding of the ARTPM (Alternate Reality Teleportal Machine)  through  provide a high-level logically grouped snapshot of some components in a list that is neither detailed nor complete.

You are physically present and as walk around a room the view you see changes. If you stand so the closest window is about 3 to 4 feet away from you and look through it, then take two steps to the left what you see through the window changes; and if you take three or four steps to the right what you see through the window changes again. If you step forward you can see farther down and up through the window, and as you walk backward the view through the window narrows. Physical presence is immediate, simple and direct. As you move your view moves and what you see changes to fit your position relative to the physical world. This is not how a television screen works, nor is this not how a typical digital screen works. A screen shows you one fixed viewpoint and as you move around it stays the same. The same is true for a PC monitor, a handheld tablet's display, or a cell phone's screen. As you move relative to the screen the screen's view stays the same because your only \u201cpresence\u201d is your physicalreality, and there is no \u201cdigital reality\u201d or \u201cdigital presence\u201d\u2014your screens are just static screens within your physical reality, so your actions are not connected to any \u201cdigital place.\u201d Your TV, PC, laptop, netbook, tablet, pad and cell phone are just screens, not Teleportals.","Teleportal use introduction: Now imagine that you are looking into a Teleportal which is a digital device whose display in some examples is about same size and shape as the physical window you were just standing in front of, the window that you were looking through. Also imagine that you have one or a plurality of personal identities, as described elsewhere. Also imagine that each identity has one or a plurality of Shared Planetary Life Spaces (SPLS's), as described elsewhere. You are logged in as one of your identities, and have one of your SPLS's open. Across the bottom of the Teleportal you can see SPLS members who are present, each in a small video window. You are all present together but you have video only, not audio because they are all in the background, just as if they were on the same physical street with you but far enough away that you could not hear their conversations. When you want to talk or work with one of them you make that a focused connection, which expands its size and immediacy. Now you and that person are fully present together with a larger video image and two-way audio. You decide to stand while together and as you move around in front of the focused connection your view of that person, and your view into their place and background changes based upon your perspective and view into it, just as it you were looking in on them through a real physical window, plus your view has digital controls with added capabilities so that you have an (optional) \u201cSuperior Viewer\u201d as described elsewhere. This is a single Teleportal \u201cfocused connection.\u201d You can add another SPLS member to this focused connection and you have the option of keeping each focused connection visible and separate on your Teleportal, or combining them into a single combined focused connection. That combined connection extracts each of those two SPLS members from their focused connections, and combines them with or without a background. If you choose to include a background you select it\u2014the background may be one of their real locations, it may be your location, or you may choose any real or virtual location in the world to which you have access. Similarly, the others present in the combined focused connection may choose the same background you select, or they may each choose any real or virtual background they prefer. If you want, any of you may add resources such as computing, presentations, data, applications, enterprise business systems, websites, web resources, news, entertainment, live places such as the world's best beachfront bars, stored shows, live or recorded events, and much more\u2014as described elsewhere. Each of you has a range of controls to make these changes, along with the size of focused connection, it's placement on the Teleportal, or other alterations and combinations as described elsewhere.","ARTPM reality introduction: In the same way that your SPLS's members have presence in your Teleportal in real time (even if most or all of them are not in a focused connection), you are also a member of each of their SPLS's\u2014and that gives you presence in their Teleportals simultaneously, and you are available for an immediate focused connection by any of them. Because you have presence a plurality of others' SPLS's and their Teleportals, your digital presence is simultaneous in multiple virtual places at one time. Because you have control over your presence in each of others' SPLS's, including attributes described elsewhere such as visibility, personal data, boundaries, privacy, secrecy, etc. your level of privacy is what you choose it to be and you can expand or contract your privacy at any time in any one or more SPLS's, or outside of those SPLS's by other means as described elsewhere. In some examples this is instantiated as an Alternate Realities Machine (herein ARM) which provides new systems for control over digital reality. Because you have control over each of your SPLS's boundaries as described elsewhere such as in the ARM, you may filter out what you do not like, prioritize what you include, and set up new types of filters such as Paywalls for what you are willing to include conditionally. This means that one person may customize the digital reality for one SPLS, and make each SPLS's reality as different as they want it to be from their other digital realities. Since each SPLS is connected to an identity, one person may have different identities that choose and enjoy different types of realities\u2014such as family, profession, travel, recreation, sports, partying, punk, sexual, or whatever they want to be\u2014and each identity and SPLS may choose privacy levels such as public, private or secret. This provides privacy choices instead of privacy issues, with self-controlled choices over what is public, what is private and what is secret. Similarly, culture is transformed from top-down imposition of common messages into self-chosen multiple identities, each with the different type(s) of digital boundaries, filters, Paywalls and preferences they want for that identity and its SPLS's. Thus, the types of culture and level of privacy in each digital reality is a reflection of a person's choices for each of his or her realities.","Optimization overlay: The ARTPM reverses the assumption that the primary purpose of networks is to provide connections and communications. It assumes that is secondary, and the primary purpose of networks is to identify behavior, track it and respond to success and failure (based on what can be determined). Tracked behaviors and their results are aggregated as described elsewhere, and reported both individually and collectively as described elsewhere, so the most successful behaviors for a range of goals is highly visible. Aggregate visibility provides self-chosen opportunities for individuals to advance rapidly, in some examples to \u201cleap ahead\u201d across a range of in some examples goals, in some examples device uses, in some examples tasks, etc. An Active Knowledge Machine, for one example, (herein AKM) delivers explicit \u201csuccess guidance\u201d to individuals at the point of need while they are doing a plurality of types of tasks. Thus, with an ARTPM some networks may start delivering human success so a growing number of people may achieve more of their goals, with the object of a faster rate of progress and growth.","Digital reality summary: In this new digital reality you simultaneously have presence in one or a plurality of digital locations as the one or multiple identities you choose to be at that moment, in the one or multiple Shared Planetary Life Spaces in which you choose to be present, in some examples with an ARM that enables setting its boundaries so that each reality is focused on what you want it to be, and in some examples with an AKM that keeps you informed of the most successful steps and options while you are doing tasks. With Teleportal controls you may include other IPTR (herein Identities [people], Places, Tools or Resources) by means of SPLS's, directories, the Web, search, navigation, dashboards [performance reporting], AKM (Active Knowledge Machine, described elsewhere), etc. to make them all or part of your focused Teleportal connections and your digital realities. When you identify a potentially more successful digital reality or option, and want to try it, the systems that provide those choices such as the ARM or AKM, also enable fast switching to the new option(s). At any one moment while you use and look through a Teleportal your view may change dramatically by your selection of background place, and by changing your physical juxtaposition to the Teleportal which responsively alters the view that it displays to you. Similarly, the views that others have of you may also be changed dramatically by their choices of their identities, SPLS's, background, goals, fast switching to various advances and their resulting digital realities\u2014with their Teleportals views changing as they move around and look through their Teleportals. You are both present together in a larger \u201cExpandaverse\u201d of a growing number of digital realities that may be changed and advanced substantially by anyone at any moment.","Teleportal devices: In some examples it is an object of Teleportal devices to introduce a new set of networked electronic devices that are able to provide continuous presence in one or a plurality of digital realities (as described elsewhere), along with other features and operations (as described elsewhere).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0552","num":"0551"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0553","num":"0552"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0554","num":"0553"},"figref":"FIGS. 19 through 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0555","num":"0554"},"figref":["FIG. 26","FIG. 93"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0556","num":"0555"},"figref":["FIG. 27","FIG. 28","FIG. 27","FIG. 28"]},"TP DEVICES SUMMARY: Turning to a high-level view , \u201cTeleportal (TP) Devices Summary,\u201d this provides a fourth alternative to the typical user's viewpoint there are three main high-level device architectures. In the first and simplest (named \u201cinvisible OS\u201d) the device's operating system is invisible, and a user simply turns on a device (like a television, appliance, etc.) then uses it directly then turns it off, and if the device connects to other devices (like a cable TV set-top box or DVR, it communicates over a network such as a public network like the Internet\u2014but most devices are typically different in each of their interfaces, features and functions from other devices because differentiation is a competitive advantage, so this simpler architecture often yields a hailstorm of differentiated devices. In the second and most complex (named \u201cvisible OS\u201d) the user must use the device's operating system to run the device, and Microsoft Windows is one example. A user turns on a PC which runs Windows, then the user employs Windows to load a stored program which in turn must be learned and used to perform its set of functions and then exited. To do something different a user loads a different stored program and learns it and uses it. To connect to and use a new type of electronic device the operating system must acquire its drivers, load its drivers and connect to the device; then it can use the device as part of its Windows environment. This \u201cvisible OS\u201d provides robustness but it is also complex for users and many vendors as electronic devices add new features, and as the numbers and types of connectable electronic devices multiplies. In the third and most controlled (named \u201ccontrolled OS\u201d) a single company, such as Apple with its iPhone\/iPod\/iPad\/iTunes ecosystem, maintains control over its devices and how they connect and are kept updated. From a user's view this is simpler but the cost is a premium price for customers and tight business and technical requirements for related vendors\/developers, plus the controlling company receives a substantial percentage of the sales transactions that flow through its ecosystem\u2014a percentage many times larger than any typical royalty would ever be.","Herein some examples in  illustrate a fourth high-level alternative (named \u201cTeleportal Architecture\u201d which is referred to here as \u201cTPA\u201d). In some examples a TPA includes a set of core devices that include LTP's (Local Teleportals) , MTP's (Mobile Teleportals) , and RTP's (Remote Teleportals) . In some examples these core devices (LTPs, MTPs and RTPs) utilize one or a plurality of other networked electronic devices (named TP Subsidiary Devices ) by remote control, herein named RCTP (Remote Control Teleporaling)     . In some examples one or a plurality of networked electronic devices (named AID\/AOD or Alternate Input Devices\/Alternate Output Devices ) may run a VTP (Virtual Teleportal)   in which they connect to and run core devices (LTPs, MTPs and RTPs). In addition, an AID\/AOD  running a VTP  may utilize a core device    to control and use one or a plurality of subsidiary devices  by means of RCTP .","In some examples said TPA provides a fourth overall interconnection model for an environment that includes a plurality of disparate types of networked electronic devices: in some examples the core devices (LTPs, MTPs and RTPs)    are the primary devices employed; in some examples the core devices (LTPs, MTPs and RTPs)    use remote control (RCTP)  to connect to and utilize one or a plurality of other networked electronic devices (TP Subsidiary Devices) ; in some examples one or a plurality of other types of networked electronic devices (AID's\/AOD's)  utilize a virtual teleportal (VTP)  to connect to and use the core devices (LTPs, MTPs and RTPs)   ; and in some examples the other networked electronic devices (AID's\/AOD's)   may use the core devices (LTPs, MTPs and RTPs)    to connect to and control the subsidiary devices (TP Subsidiary Devices by means of RCTP)  .","In summary, this TPA model simplifies a broad evolution of a plurality of disparate networked electronic devices into core devices (LTPs, MTPs and RTPs)    at the center with RCTP connections and control   going outward, and VTP connections and control   coming inward. Furthermore, a plurality of components (as described elsewhere) such as in some examples a consistent (and adaptive) user interface, simplify the connections to and use of networked electronic devices across the TPA.","In some examples of a TPA these devices (core devices, TP subsidiary devices, alternate input devices and alternate output devices) utilize one or a plurality of disparate public and\/or private networks ; in some examples one or a plurality of these networks is a Teleportal Network (herein TPN) ; ; in some examples one or a plurality of these networks is a public network such as the Internet ; in some examples one or a plurality of these networks is a LAN ; in some examples one or a plurality of these networks is a WAN ; in some examples one or a plurality of these networks is a PSTN ; in some examples one or a plurality of these networks is a cellular radio network such as for mobile telephony ; in some examples one or a plurality of these networks is another type of network ; in some examples one or a plurality of these networks may employ a Teleportal Utility (herein TPU) , and in some examples one or a plurality of these networks may employ in some examples Teleportal servers , in some examples Teleportal applications , in some examples Teleportal services , in some examples Teleportal directories , and in some examples other networked specialized Teleportal components .","Turning now to a somewhat more detailed view , \u201cTeleportal (TP) Devices Summary,\u201d illustrates some examples of TP devices, which are described elsewhere. In some examples a TP device is a stand-alone unit that may connect over a network with one or a plurality of stand-alone TP devices. In some examples a TP device is a sub-unit that is an endpoint of a larger system that in some examples is hierarchical, in some examples is point-to-point, in some examples employs a star topology, and in some examples utilizes another known network architecture, such that the combination of TP device endpoints, switches, servers, applications, databases, control systems and other components combine to form part or all of an overall system or utility with a combination of methods and processes. In some examples the types of TP devices, which are described elsewhere, include an extensible set of devices such as LTP's (Local Teleportals) , MTP's (Mobile Teleportals) , RTP's (Remote Teleportals) , AID's\/AODs (Alternative Input Devices\/Alternative Output Devices)  connected by means of VTP's (Virtual Teleportals) , Servers (servers, applications, storage, switches, routers, etc.) , TP Subsidiary Devices  controlled by RCTP (Remote Control Teleportaling) , and AKM Devices (products and services that are connected to or supported by the Active Knowledge Machine, as described elsewhere) . In some examples a consistent yet customizable user interface(s) is supported across TP devices          as described elsewhere; which provides similar and predictable accessibility to the functionality and capabilities provided by TP devices, applications, resources, SPLS's, IPTR, etc. In some examples voice recognition plays an interface role so that TP devices          and Teleportal usage may be controlled in whole or in part by voice commands; in some examples gestures such as on a touch screen or in the air by means of a hand-held or hand-attached controller plays an interface role so that TP devices          and Teleportal usage may be controlled in whole or in part by gestures; in some examples other known interface modules or capabilities are employed to control TP devices          and Teleportal usage as described elsewhere.","In some examples these devices and interfaces utilize one or a plurality of networks such as a Teleportal Network (TPN) , LAN , WAN , IP (such as the Internet) , PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) , cellular , circuit-switched , packet-switched , ISDN (Integrated Services Data Network) , ring , mesh , or other known types of networks . In some examples one or a plurality of TP devices          are connected to a LAN (Local Area Network)  in which the extensible types of components in  reside on that LAN . In some examples one or a plurality of TP devices          are connected to a WAN (Wide Area Network)  in which the extensible types of components in  reside on that one said WAN . Similarly, in some examples one or a plurality of TP devices          are connected to any of the other types of known networks , such that the extensible types of components in  reside on one type of network . In some examples two networks  or a plurality of networks  are connected such as for example the Internet, in some examples by converged communications links that support multiple types of communications simultaneously such as voice, video, data, e-mail, Internet phone, focused TP communications, fax, remote data access, remote services, Web, Internet, etc. and include various types of known interfaces, protocols, data formats, etc. which enable said internetworking.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0564","num":"0563"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 17","FIG. 17","FIG. 17","FIG. 17","FIG. 17","FIG. 17","FIG. 17"],"b":["1102","1103","1104","1102","1103","1104","1106","1110","1138","1116","1120","1130","1120","1121","1122","1123","1107","1108","1109","1107","1108","1109","1101","1110","1138","1116","1120","1130","1120","1121","1122","1123","1111","1115","1101","1106","1138","1116","1120","1130","1120","1121","1122","1123","1131","1117","1118","1119","1101","1106","1110","1120","1131","1132","1130","1120","1121","1122","1123","1121","1122","1123","1101","1106","1110","1138","1116","1130","1120","1121","1122","1123","1131","1101","1106","1138","1116","1132","1133","1133","1134","1134","1134","1135","1135","1135","1135","1135","1135","1136","1136","1136","1137","1137","1137","1132","1132","1130","1132","1120","1121","1122","1123","1101","1106","1110","1116","1120","1124","1131","1132","1101","1106","1110","1116","1120","1124","1131","1132","1130","1125","1126","1127","1121","1122","1123","1130","1120","1121","1122","1123"]},"The illustration in  merely illustrates some examples and actual configurations of TP devices          connected to one or a plurality of networks  will utilize choices of devices, hardware, software, servers, operating systems, networks, and other components that employ features and capabilities that are described elsewhere, to fit a particular configuration and a particular set of desired features. In some examples multiple components and capabilities may be incorporated into a single hardware device, such as in some examples one TP device such as one RTP  may control multiple subsidiary devices such as external cameras and microphones   ; and in some examples one hardware purchase may include part or all of an individual's TP lifestyle that includes a server and applications  with a specific set of TP devices             such that the combination of TP devices actually constitutes one hardware purchase that fulfills one person's chosen set of TP needs and TP uses. In some examples the TP devices          and network(s)  may be owned and managed in various ways; in some examples a customer may own and manage an entire system; in some examples a third-party(ies) may manage a customer owned system; in some examples a third-party(ies) may own and manage an entire system in which some or all TP devices and\/or services are rented or leased to customers; in some examples any known business model for providing hardware, software, and services may be employed.","Summary of some TP devices and connections: Some examples in  illustrates and further describe TP devices described herein. Turning now to some examples in  an overall summary  includes a Local Teleportal (LTP) , a Remote Teleportal (RTP) , a Teleportal Network (TPN) , which includes a Teleportal Shared Spaces Network (TPSSN)  and in some examples a Teleportal Utility (TPU) . Though the ARTPM is not limited to the elements in this figure, the components included are utilized to connect a user  in real-time with the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy . Without needing multiple cameras this one wide and tall remote view  is processed by the Local Teleportal's  processor(s)  to provide a varying view    of the Grand Canal , along with audio that is played over the Local Teleportal's speaker(s) . The viewpoint place displayed in the Local Teleportal  reflects how the view in a real local window changes dynamically as a viewer(s)  moves. The view displayed in the LTP  is therefore dynamically based on the viewer's position(s)    relative to the LTP  as determined by the LTP's SVS (Superior Viewer Sensor) . In some examples when a viewer stands on the left  of the LTP , the SVS  determines this and the LTP's processor(s)  displays the appropriate right portion  of the Grand Canal . In some examples as the viewer  moves to the center in front of the LTP  when the viewer reaches the center  then center view  is displayed of the Grand Canal , and in some examples when the viewer moves to the right  then left view  is displayed from the Grand Canal .","In some examples a calculated view  with ,  with ,  with  that matches a real window is displayed in LTP  by means of a SVS  that determines the viewer(s) position relative to the LTP, and a CPM  that calculates the appropriate portion of the Grand Canal  to display. In one example the viewer  stands to the left of the Teleportal  so he can directly see and talk to the gondolier who is located on the right of this view of the Grand Canal ; in some examples the remote microphones  are 3D or stereo microphones, in which case the viewer's speakers  may acoustically position the sound of the gondolier's voice appropriately for the position of the gondolier in the place being viewed.","To achieve this in some examples a Remote Teleportal (RIP)  is at an SPLS remote place and it comprises a video and audio source(s) , including a processor(s)  that provides remotely controlled processing of video, audio, data, applications , storage  and other functions ; and a Remote Communications Module  that in some examples may be attached to the Internet , in some examples may be attached to a Teleportal Network , in some examples may be attached to a RTP Hub Server , or in some examples may be attached to another communications network such as a private corporate WAN (Wide Area Network) . In some examples a Remote Teleportal  may include devices such as a mobile phone  that is capable of delivering both video and audio, and is running a Virtual Teleportal , and in some examples is attached wirelessly to a cell phone vendor's network , in some examples is attached wirelessly (such as by Wi-Fi) to the Internet , in some examples is attached to satellite communications . In some examples said RTP device  may possess other features such as self-propelled mobility (on the ground, in the air, in the water, etc.); in some examples said RTP device  may provide multicast; in some examples said RTP device  may dynamically alter video and audio in real-time, or in near real-time before it is transmitted (with or without informing viewers  that such alteration has taken place).","In some examples video, audio and other data from said RTP   are received by either a Remote Teleportal Group Server (RTGS)  or a Teleportal Network Hub Server (TPNHS) . In some examples video, audio and other data from said RTP   may be processed by a Teleportal Applications Server (TPAS) . In some examples video, audio and other data from said RTP   are received and stored by a Teleportal Storage Server (TPSS) . In some examples the owner(s) of the respective RTPs  , and each RTGS , TPNHS , TPAS , or TPSS  may be wholly public, wholly private or a combination of both. In some examples whether public or private the RTP's place, name, geographic address, ownership, any charges due for use, usage logging, and other identifying and connection information may be recorded by a Teleportal Index\/Search Server (TPI\/SS)  or by other TP applications  that provides means for a viewer  of a LTP  to find and connect with an RTP  . In some examples said TPI\/SS , TPAS , or TPSS  may each be located on a separate server(s)  or in some examples run on any Teleportal Server   .","In some examples the LTP  has a dedicated controller  whose interface includes buttons and\/or visual interface means designed to run an LTP that may be displayed on a screen or controlled by a user's gestures or voice or other means. In some examples the LTP  has a \u201cuniversal remote control\u201d  of multiple electronics whose interface fits a range of electronics. In some examples a variety of on-screen controls, images, controls, menus, or information can be displayed on the Local Teleportal to provide means for control or navigation  . In some examples means provide access to groups, lists or a variety of small images of other places (which include IPTR [Identities\/people, Places, Tools, Resources) directly available  . In some examples the LTP  displays one or a plurality of currently open Shared Planetary Life Space(s) \u2032. In some examples the LTP  displays a digital window style such as overlaying a double-hung window  over the RTP place    . In some examples the LTP  simultaneously displays other information or images (which include people, places, tools, resources, etc.) on the LTP  such as described in ,  and elsewhere.","In some examples an LTP  may not be available and an Alternate Input Device\/Alternate Output Device (AID\/AOD)     running a Virtual Teleportal (VTP) may be employed instead. In some examples an AID\/AOD may be a mobile phone  or a \u201csmart\u201d phone . In some examples an AID\/AOD may be a television set-top box  or a \u201csmart\u201d networked television . In some examples an AID\/AOD may be a PC or laptop . In some examples an AID\/AOD may be a wearable computing device . In some examples an AID\/AOD may be a mobile computing device . In some examples an AID\/AOD may be a communications-enabled DVR . In some examples an AID\/AOD may be a computing device such as a netbook, tablet or a pad . In some examples an AID\/AOD may be an online game system . In some examples an AID\/AOD may be an appropriately capable Device In Use such as a networked digital camera, or surveillance camera . In some examples an AID\/AOD may be an appropriately capable digital device such as an online sensor . In some examples an AID\/AOD may be an appropriately capable web application , website , web widget , servlet , etc. In some examples an AID\/AOD may be an appropriately capable application  or API that calls code that provides these functions . Since these do not have a Human Position Sensor  or a Communication\/Processing Module  these do not automatically alter the view of the remote scene  in response to changes in the viewer's location. Therefore in some examples AIDs\/AODs, utilize a default view, while in some examples AIDs\/AODs, utilize manual means to alter the view displayed.","In some examples two or a plurality of LTP's  and AIDs\/AODs provide TP Shared Planetary Life Spaces (SPLS) directly and with VTP's. This may be enabled if two or a plurality of Teleportals  or AIDs\/AODs     are configured with a camera  and microphone  and the CPM  or VTP includes appropriate processing, memory and software so that it can provide said SPLS. When embodied and configured in this manner, both LTP's  and AIDs\/AODs     can serve as a devices that provide Teleportal Shared Space(s) between two or a plurality of LTPs and AIDs\/AODs    .","LTP devices physical examples: Some examples in , along with some examples in  and elsewhere, illuminate and further describe some extensible Teleportal (TP) devices examples included herein. Turning now to some examples, TP devices may be built in a wide variety of devices, designs, models, styles, sizes, etc.","LTP \u201cwindow\u201d styles, audio and dynamic positioning: In some examples a single Local Teleportal (LTP)  in  shows that a Teleportal may be designed based on an underlying reconceptualization of a glass window the Window as a digital device that is a portal into \u201calways on\u201d Shared Planetary Life Spaces (SPLS), constructed digital realities, digital presence \u201cevents\u201d, and other digital realities (as described elsewhere)\u2014in this example the LTP has opened an SPLS that includes a connection to a view  that inside the Grand Canyon on the summer afternoon when this LTP is being viewed, with that view expanded to the entire LTP display\u2014as if it were a real window looking out inside the Grand Canyon on that day. Because an LTP's display is a component of a digital device, in some examples the decorative window frame   may be digitally overlaid as an image over the SPLS connection . In some examples the decorative window frame's style, color, texture, material, etc. (in some examples wood, in some examples metal, in some examples composites, etc.) to create the appearance of different types of windows that provide presence at this remote place . In the examples in  two window styles are shown, a casement window style  and a double-hung window style . In each example an LTP may include audio. Since in this example the window like display components (eg, the frame and internal window styles)   are a digital image that is overlaid on the SPLS place, these can be varied at a command from the viewer to show this example LTP window as partially open, or completely open. The audio's volume can be raised or lowered automatically and proportionately as the window is digitally \u201copened\u201d or \u201cclosed\u201d to reflect the audio volume changes that would occur as if this were a real local glass window with that SPLS place actually outside of it. Another LTP component in some examples is illustrated in , an optional Superior Viewer Sensor (herein SVS, as described elsewhere)  that may be used to automatically adjust the view of a focused connection place in response to changes in the position of the viewer(s), so that this digital \u201cwindow view\u201d behaves in the same way as a real window's view changes as a viewer moves in juxtaposition to it\u2014which may increase the feeling of presence in some examples with SPLS people, in some examples with SPLS places, etc.","Hide or show LTP over a local window, using a wall pocket: In some examples  show the combination of a Local Teleportal   with a local glass window  by means of a wall pocket . In some examples a traditional local glass window  may have a \u201cpocket door\u201d space in the wall  along with a mechanical motor and a track that slides the LTP   in and out from the pocket in the wall . In this example the local glass window view  is on the third floor of an apartment in the northern USA during a winter day, with the local glass window  visible and the LTP  hidden in the pocket in the wall  by mechanically sliding it into this pocket (as shown by the dotted line ). In some examples, as illustrated in , the single Local Teleportal (LTP)  is mechanically slid out from its wall pocket to cover the local glass window  with the LTP showing a TP connection to an SPLS place  that replaces the local glass window's view of the apartment building. This SPLS place  is inside the Grand Canyon during winter. In some examples the local glass window  is covered by the LTP  with an SPLS place visible . The dotted line  shows where the LTP is moved over the local glass window's view of an apartment building , whose local view was visible in a prior figure.","Multiple shapes for Teleportals: In some examples various shapes and styles may be employed for Teleportals, and some examples are illustrated in  which shows an SPLS place  inside the Grand Canyon during summer. In some examples local glass windows with various sizes and shapes can have a Local Teleportal (LTP) installed such as an arch shaped LTP  in some examples, an octagon shaped LTP  in some examples, and a circular shaped LTP  in some examples. Each of these example shapes, and other examples of shaped LTPs, may by accomplished by means such as (1) in some examples permanently mounting an LTP in a shaped local window   , (2) in some examples permanently mounting an LTP in front of a shaped local window   , (3) in some examples sliding a LTP in and out of a wall pocket    to use or not use the local window by means of a wall pocket and a mechanical motor and track, as illustrated in . To display an SPLS place appropriately in a shaped LTP of varying size and shape, in some examples automated controls set an appropriate amount of zooming out or magnification in of the SPLS place. and\/or manual controls. To display an SPLS place appropriately in a shaped LTP of varying size and shape, in some examples manual controls may be used to set an appropriate amount of zooming out or magnification in of the SPLS place. These examples are illustrated in  with the arch window slightly magnified , and the circular window is slightly zoomed out . Also in  the rectangular \u201cH\u201d above each of these three examples of differently shaped LTPs  represents an optional Superior Viewer Sensor (SVS) that adjusts the view in each LTP to match the position(s) of the viewer(s).","Local Teleportals in portable frames: In some examples the display(s) of a single Local Teleportal or a plurality of Local Teleportals   may be in a portable frame(s) , which in turn may be hung on a wall, placed on a stand, stood on a desk, or put in any desired location. As illustrated elsewhere, said outside \u201cframe\u201d  may be a digital border and\/or decoration rather than part of the physical frame, while in some examples it may be an actual physical frame . If said outside frame  is digital, then various frame designs and colors may be stored and changed at will by means of local or remote processing, or retrieved on demand to provide a wider range of designs and colors, whether these look like traditional frames or are artistically creative digital alterations such as \u201ctorn edges\u201d on the images displayed. In some examples an LTP that is in a portable frame may be in various sizes and orientations (in some examples portrait  or landscape , in some examples small or large, in some examples vertical or horizontal, in a larger example single or multiple views on one LTP, etc.) to fit each viewers' criteria in some examples, budget in some examples, available space in some examples, subject choices in some examples, etc. Because an LTP is a digital device that is a portal into \u201calways on\u201d Shared Planetary Life Spaces (SPLS), the LTP's in  show an example SPLS focused connection with a weather satellite that is located over a hurricane crossing Florida \u2014as if the viewer were in space looking out on that scene. In some examples LTPs in portable frames may be used to observe a chain of retail stores, and a single LTP  is observing a franchisee's ice cream store from an SPLS that includes all of that chain's retail ice cream locations. Also in some examples one SPLS place may be expanded to fill the entire LTP display, as in these examples  . Also in this figure, the rectangular \u201cH\u201d in the top of each of these two examples of framed LTPs  represents an optional Superior Viewer Sensor (SVS) that adjusts the view in each LTP to match the position(s) of the viewer(s).","Multiple Teleportals integrated into a single view: In some examples the displays of two or a plurality of Teleportals may be combined into one larger display. One example of this is illustrated in  which shows said integration in a manner that simulates the broad outside view that is observed from adjacent multiple local glass windows. In some examples the plurality of Teleportals may be touching to provide one panoramic view . In some examples the plurality of Teleportals may be slightly separated from each other as with some local glass window styles. Regardless of the physical shape(s) or style(s) of the said integrated Teleportals, together they may display one appropriately combined view , which in this example is from an SPLS place inside the Grand Canyon on that summer day, with that view expanded to the integrated LTP display\u2014as if it were a real window present at that place on that day. In some examples the Teleportal's SPLS place and the full Teleportal display is chosen by a single viewer  using a handheld wireless remote control . In some examples the window perspective displayed is determined by a single Superior Viewer Sensor (SVS)  by means of algorithms calculated by one or a plurality of processors . In some examples the window perspective displayed is determined by a plurality of Superior Viewer Sensors (SVS)    by means of algorithms calculated by one or a plurality of processors . The local sounds in the Grand Canyon are played over the Teleportal's audio speaker(s) . In some examples the window style of the Teleportal  may be physical. In some examples the window style of the Teleportal  may be digitally displayed from multiple stored styles and overlaid over the SPLS place .","Larger integrated Teleportals\/Teleportal Walls: In some examples known video wall technology may be applied so that multiple broader or taller Teleportals may span larger areas of a wall(s), room(s), stage(s), hall(s), billboard(s), etc.  illustrates some examples of larger integrated Teleportal Walls such as in some examples a 2-by-2 Teleportal , and in some examples a 3-by-3 Teleportal . The integration of multiple Teleportals into one \u201cTeleportal Wall\u201d is done by the processor(s) and software  in . Whether or not there should be one SVS (Superior Viewer Sensor)  or a plurality of SVS's    depends on the location of the Teleportal Wall  : In some examples it may be in heavily trafficked public areas with moving viewers, in some examples sports bars whose SPLS's are located inside of football stadiums, baseball stadiums, and basketball arenas; in which cases these might not include a SVS. In some examples a Teleportal Wall   may be in a more one-on-one location which in some examples a family room and in some examples is a business office or cublicle; there one or a plurality of SVS(s) may be utilized to provide appropriate changes in the Teleportal Wall scene(s) displayed in response to the viewer(s) position(s). Alternatively, in some examples a projected LTP display may be utilized instead of a LTP wall, in which case the LTP's display size may be large and varying based on the viewers' needs or preferences, and the projection size may also be determined by the features and capabilities of the projection display device; similarly also, in some examples one or a plurality of SVS may be utilized with a projected LTP display.","MTP devices physical examples: Mobile Teleportals (MTPs) may be constructed in various styles, and some examples are illustrated in , \u201cSome MTP (Mobile Teleportal) Styles,\u201d which are based on a common factoring of digital devices into Teleportals with new features such as \u201calways on\u201d Shared Planetary Life Spaces (SPLS). Because each MTP utilizes the same technologies as other Teleportal devices but implements them in a variety of form factors and assemblages of hardware and software components, said MTP's provide parallel features and functionality to other Teleportal devices. Since each form factor continuously integrates processors that become faster and more powerful, more memory, higher bandwidth communications, etc., these MTP styles exemplify an evolving continuum of Teleportal capabilities. Iri the examples in  three mobile phone styles  are illustrated including a full-screen design  that operates by means of a touch screen and a single physical button at the bottom, a flip-open design  such as a Star Trek communicator, and a full-button design  that includes a keyboard with a trackball and function keys. In each example audio input and output parallels a mobile phone's microphone and speaker, including a speakerphone function for audio communications while viewing the screen. Alternately, audio input\/output may be provided by wireless means such as a Bluetooth earpiece or headset, or by wired means such as a hands-free microphone\/earpiece or headset. In each mobile phone-like design an optional Superior Viewer Sensor (herein SVS, as described elsewhere)  is located on an MTP (such as at its top in each of these examples), and the SVS may be used to automatically adjust the view of a focused connection place in response to changes in the position of a viewer.","In the examples in  three tablet and pad styles  are illustrated including a small pad design  that has multiple physical buttons and a trackball, a medium-sized tablet design  that has a stylus and a physical button, and a medium to large pad design  that operates by means of a touchscreen and a single physical button. In each example audio input and output parallels a mobile phone's microphone and speaker, including a speakerphone function for audio communications while viewing the screen. Alternately, audio input\/output may be provided by wireless means such as a Bluetooth earpiece(s) or headset(s), or by wired means such as a hands-free microphone\/earpiece or headset. In each tablet-like and pad-like design an optional Superior Viewer Sensor (herein SVS, as described elsewhere)  is located on an MTP (such as at its top in each of these examples), and the SVS may be used to automatically adjust the view of a focused connection place in response to changes in the position of a viewer.","In the examples in  two portable communicator styles  are illustrated including a wireless communicator  that has multiple buttons like a mobile phone, with audio input and output that parallels a mobile phone's microphone and speaker, including a speakerphone function for viewing the screen while communicating; or, alternatively, a base-station with a built-in speakerphone; or, alternatively, a wireless Bluetooth earpiece or headset. In this type of design an optional Superior Viewer Sensor (herein SVS, as described elsewhere)  is located at the top of this communicator's handset, and the SVS may be used to automatically adjust the view of a focused connection place in response to changes in the position of a viewer. Another example of a portable communicator style is an eyeglasses design  that includes a visual display with audio output through speakers next to the ears and audio input through a hands-free microphone. In this type of design an optional Superior Viewer Sensor (herein SVS, as described elsewhere)  is located to one side or both sides of said visual display and use eye tracking to automatically adjust the view of a focused connection place in response to changes in the directional gaze of a viewer.","In the examples in  two netbook and laptop styles  are illustrated including the equivalents of a full-featured laptop and a full-featured netbook that are, however, designed as Mobile Teleportals. In each example audio input and output parallels a netbook's or laptop's microphone and speaker for audio communications while viewing the screen. Alternately, audio input\/output may be provided by wireless means such as a Bluetooth earpiece or headset, or by wired means such as a microphone or headset. In each netbook-like and laptop-like design an optional Superior Viewer Sensor (herein SVS, as described elsewhere)  is located on an MTP (such as at its top in each of these examples), and the SVS may be used to automatically adjust the view of a focused connection place in response to changes in the position of a viewer.","In the examples in  one portable projector style  is illustrated including a portable base unit  which provides Teleportal functionality and may be connected by cable or wirelessly with said projector  (or, alternatively, said projector and base station may be combined within one portable case). In said example portable projector's visual image  is displayed on a screen , a wall , a desktop , a whiteboard , or any desired and appropriate surface . In a portable projector audio input and output are provided by a microphone  and a speaker , including a speakerphone function for viewing the projected image  while communicating from a location(s) next to or near the projector. Alternately, audio input\/output may be provided by means such as a wireless Bluetooth earpiece  or headset , or a wired microphone or hands-free microphone\/earpiece. In each portable projector-like design an optional Superior Viewer Sensor (herein SVS, as described elsewhere)  is located on an MTP (such as at its top in this example), and the SVS may be used to automatically adjust the view of a projected connection place in response to changes in the position of a viewer.","RTP devices physical examples: Turning now to , \u201cFixed RTP (Remote Teleportal),\u201d in some examples an RTP  (as described elsewhere in more detail) is a networked and remotely controlled TP device that is a fixed RTP device  that may operate on land , in the water , in the air , or in space . In some examples said the RTP  is functionally equivalent to an LTP  (including in some examples hardware, software, architecture, components, systems, applications, etc. as described elsewhere) or an MTP  (as described elsewhere) but may have one or a plurality of additional sensors, an alternate power source(s), one or a plurality of (optional) means for mobility, communicate by means of any of a plurality of networks, and be controlled remotely over one or a plurality of networks  with a controlling device(s) such as an LTP , an MTP , a TP subsidiary device , an AID\/AOD  or by another type of networked electronic device.

In some examples it is possible for a TP device to utilize said mixing   to simultaneously create multiple new synthesized videos in real-time as described elsewhere such as in .","In some examples effects  may be added under automated and\/or user control  such as in some examples changing the size of a dimension(s) of a designated input    such as an overall size in some examples, a vertical dimension in some examples, a horizontal dimension in some examples, a cropping or zoom in some examples; in some examples changing the position(s) of one or a plurality of designated inputs   ; in some examples changing the hue of one or a plurality of designated inputs   ; in some examples changing the tint of one or a plurality of designated inputs   ; in some examples changing the luminance of one or a plurality of designated inputs   ; in some examples changing the gain of one or a plurality of designated inputs   ; in some examples changing the transparency of one or a plurality of designated inputs   ; in some examples changing the color difference of one or a plurality of designated inputs   ; in some examples simultaneously changing multiple values or attributes of one or a plurality of designated inputs   ; in some examples adding a border to one or a plurality of designated inputs   ; in some examples altering one or a plurality of persons  such as adding a beard in some examples, changing the hairstyle in some examples, changing hair color in some examples, adding glasses in some examples, changing the color of one or a plurality of clothing items in some examples, etc. In some examples it is possible for a TP device to utilize said effects   to simultaneously create multiple new synthesized videos in real-time as described elsewhere such as in . In some examples it is possible for a TP device to utilize both said mixing   and said effects   to simultaneously create multiple new synthesized videos in real-time as described elsewhere such as in .","While the TP device processing flow             has been described primarily in terms of video synthesis, in some examples each of these steps simultaneously processes audio with the respective video such that pictures and sound are appropriately synchronized during receiving  in some examples, conversion  in some examples, synthesis  in some examples, control  in some examples, output and display    in some examples, and network communication of said output  in some examples. In some examples the inputs  are directly output ; in some examples the mixed  combinations  are output ; in some examples the mixed  combinations  with added effects  are output ; in some examples the inputs  with added effects  are output ; in some examples other picture processing may be performed as directed by automated and\/or manual controls  then output .","While the TP device processing flow             has been described primarily in terms of video synthesis, in some examples each of these steps separately processes audio from the respective video but then recombines video and audio during specific steps such as compositing in some examples, such that pictures and sound are appropriately synchronized during receiving  in some examples, conversion  in some examples, synthesis  in some examples, control  in some examples, output and display    in some examples, and network communication of said output  in some examples.","Output  comprises components that in some examples includes media switch(es) , in some examples includes (optional) format conversion , in some examples includes one or a plurality of display processors , in some examples includes one or a plurality of BOC's (Broadcast Output Components)  which operate analogously to the output functions of a PC TV tuner card that includes two or more separate tuners on one card, and in some examples includes one or a plurality of displays . In some examples a timer\/sync generator  is utilized to synchronize output    as described elsewhere. In some examples one or a plurality of media switches  routes a synthesized real-time video  to a plurality of simultaneous uses such as in some examples a local display ; in some examples a simultaneous focused connection  with one or a plurality of remote participants connected by means of a network interface ; in some examples a simultaneous focused connection with a plurality of remote IPTR   connected by means of one or a plurality of network interfaces ; in some examples output a local playback   and\/or transmit a broadcast   of one or a plurality of recorded and\/or live programs; in some examples simultaneously recording said synthesized video  to local storage  and\/or to remote storage ; in some examples a simultaneous broadcast of said synthesized video  to an audience by means of one or a plurality of network interfaces     ; in some examples for other singular or simultaneous uses of said synthesized video . In some examples one or a plurality of external TP devices (such as in some examples RCTP, in some examples AIDs\/AODs, in some examples VTP's, in some examples other types of TP connections) may also provide said media switch  with their synthesized output(s) , and the plurality of uses of their synthesized video  may be visible in some examples, or in some examples said media switch  may provide routing of the external TP device's synthesized video  but the distributed uses are not visible to the external TP device. In some examples of media switches  one or a plurality of synthesized videos  may simultaneously be input from one or a plurality of TP devices, and then be output for a plurality of purposes and connections that include in some examples real-time uses, in some examples recordings for asynchronous and\/or on-demand uses at a different times, and in some examples be output for other simultaneous uses. In some examples said media switch(es)  may provide built-in format conversion, and in some examples said media switch(es)  may route one or a plurality of synthesized videos for separate (optional) format conversion  as needed by each video. In some examples said media switch(es)  may utilize timing signals  in the event two or a plurality of inputs require synchronization. Therefore, in some examples said media switching  is provided by one or a plurality of media switch(es)  which in some examples has scalable capacity and intelligence, and in some examples combining multiple switching and format conversion functions into a TP device reduces lags and latencies, and in some examples providing multiple media switches within a TP device reduces lags and latencies.","In some examples said media switch  includes one or a scalable plurality of parsers , one or a scalable plurality of DMA (Direct Memory Access) engines , and one or a scalable plurality of memory buffers that in some examples are components of the media switch  and in some examples are in memory . In some examples a media switch(es) includes explicit DMA engines  such as in some examples one or a plurality of video DMA engines ; in some examples one or a plurality of audio DMA engines ; in some examples one or a plurality of event DMA engines ; in some examples one or a plurality of private and\/or secret DMA engines ; in some examples one or a plurality of other types of DMA engines . In logical sequence, the inputs to said media switch  include synthesis  in some examples; other inputs such as external IPTR or TP devices    that may be passed through the TP device to the media switch with no processing in some examples, some processing in some examples, and a plurality of processing steps in some examples; and timing synchronization  that may be utilized in some examples and ignored in some examples. In some examples a parser  parses each input to determine its key components such as the start of all frames; in some examples a parser  parses each input to associate it with periodic timed pulses ; in some examples a parser  parses each input to identify and utilize a time code or other attribute that is part of said input. In some examples the parsing process divides each input into its component structure so that each component may be processed individually, and various types of component structure(s) and\/or indicators are known and may be utilized by said parser. As an input stream is received by a parser  it is parsed for its components such as each frame in some examples; in some examples when the parser finds the start of a component it directs that stream to a DMA engine  which streams said input to a memory buffer location   until the next component is identified by said parser  and streamed into its memory buffer location  . In some examples the memory buffer location of each component is provided to the media switch's program logic  via an interrupt mechanism such that the program logic knows where each memory buffer location starts and ends. In some examples the program logic  stores accumulated memory buffers locations to generate a set of logical segments that is divided and packaged in various formats to correspond to each type of output required; in some examples the program logic constructs a focused connection stream ; in some examples the program logic constructs one or more types of PTR stream(s) ; in some examples the program logic constructs a digital television stream as a broadcast source  and  in ; in some examples the program logic constructs an analog television stream as a broadcast source  and  in ; in some examples the program logic constructs a streaming media source  and  in ; in some examples the program logic constructs a stream suitable for recording and archiving for later editing and\/or playback; in some examples the program logic constructs a stream appropriate for another use. In each of these and other examples the program logic  converts the set of stored accumulated memory buffers locations into specific instructions to construct each type of output needed from a specific input, such as in some examples constructing a packet appropriate for the Internet that contains an appropriate set of components in logical order plus ancillary control data. In some examples the program logic  queues up one DMA input\/output transfer cycle then clears those associated memory buffers which limits the program steps, DMA transfers and memory buffers needed in part because this is a circular event cycle in which the number of parallel DMA transfers for each input is minimized by clearing each cycle when it is completed. This media switch component  in some examples decouples the CPUs   from performing one or a plurality of output routing, packaging and streaming steps.","In some examples one or a plurality of multiplexers  may be used instead of a media switch(es)  to route a synthesized real-time video  to a plurality of simultaneous uses such as in some examples a local display ; in some examples a simultaneous focused connection  with one remote participant communicated by means of a network interface ; in some examples a simultaneous focused connection with a plurality of remote IPTR   communicated by means of one or a plurality of network interfaces ; in some examples simultaneously recording said synthesized video at  to local storage  and\/or to remote storage ; in some examples a simultaneous broadcast  of said synthesized video  to an audience by means of one or a plurality of network interfaces ; in some examples for other simultaneous uses of said synthesized video . In some examples this means that a single synthesized video  may simultaneously serve multiple purposes and connections that include both real-time uses and recordings for asynchronous and\/or on-demand uses at a different time, and require multiplexer  routing of a single synthesized video , with or without format conversion , for each simultaneous use.","In some examples each type of output   is passed to other TP device components , or in some examples to other TP device components  , that may in turn further process that output such as in some examples adjusting output image(s) in response to input and processing from a device's viewer detection sensor(s) , in some examples encoding it, in some examples formatting it for a particular use, in some examples displaying it locally, etc. Therefore, a scalable media switch(s)  receives one or a plurality of inputs    and in some examples converts each input into one or a plurality of appropriately formatted outputs to fit a plurality of uses, or in some examples passes said outputs to successive TP device components   . In some examples a media switch  or format conversion  performs additional processing such as encoding using VBR (Variable Bit Rate) or in some examples another format. In some examples VBR reduces the data in successive frames by encoding movement and more complex segments at a higher bit rate than less complex segments, such as a blank wall requiring less space and bandwidth then a colorful garden on a windy day. Numerous formats may optionally be VBR encoded including in some examples MPEG-2 video; in some examples MPEG-4 Part 2 video; in some examples H.264 video; in some examples audio formats such as MP3, AAC, WMA, etc.; and in some examples other video and audio formats.","In some examples a single synthesized real-time video  is created by in some examples designating inputs , in some examples mixing , in some examples adding effects , in some examples previewing the output(s) in real time   and applying controls , and in some examples other synthesis steps as described elsewhere. In some examples said synthesized video  requires format conversion  such as in some examples NTSC encoding  to create a composite signal from component video picture signals. In some examples said synthesized video  does not require format conversion  and may be passed directly from synthesis  to in some examples a media switch(es) , in some examples to display processing , in some examples to a network interface , and in some examples to another use as described elsewhere. In some examples (optional) format conversion  is performed automatically based on the type of use(s) or display(s) in use by each TP device  in  such as in some examples to fit an SDI (Serial Digital Interface) interface as used in broadcasting; in some examples composite video; in some examples component video; in some examples to conform to a standard such as the various SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) standards; in some examples to conform to ITU-Recommendation BT.709 for high definition televisions with a 16:9 aspect ratio (widescreen); in some examples to conform to HDMI; in some examples to conform to specific pixel counts such as in various examples 640\u00d7480 (VGA), 800\u00d7600 (SVGA), 1024\u00d7768 (XGA), 1280\u00d71024 (SXGA), 1600\u00d71200 resolution (UXGA), 1400\u00d71050 (SXGA+), 1280\u00d7720 (WXGA), 1600\u00d7768\/750 (UWXGA), 1680\u00d71050 (WSXGA+), 1920\u00d71200 (WUXGA). 2560\u00d71600 (WQXGA), 3280\u00d72048 (WQSXGA), 480i (NTSC television), 576i (PAL television), 480p (720\u00d7480 progressive scan television), 576p (720\u00d7576 progressive scan television), 720p (1280\u00d7720 progressive scan high definition television), 1080i (1920\u00d71080 high definition television), 1080p (1920\u00d71080 progressive scan high definition television), and other pixel counts and display resolutions such as for various cell phones, e-tablets, e-pads, net books, etc.","In addition to formatting for displays (optional) format conversion  may be performed in some examples for video compression to reduce bandwidth for transmission in some examples on one or a plurality of networks, in some examples for broadcast(s), in some examples for a cable television service, and some examples for a satellite television service, or in some examples for another type of bandwidth reduction need. In some examples (optional) compression  is performed automatically based on the type of network, application, etc. that is being utilized such as in some examples H.261 (commonly used in videoconferencing, video telephony, etc.); in some examples MPEG-1 (commonly used in video CDs); in some examples H.262\/MPEG-2 (commonly used in DVD video, Blu-Ray, digital video broadcasting, SVCD); in some examples H.263 (commonly used in videoconferencing, videotelephony, video on mobile phones [3GP]); in some examples MPEG-4 (commonly used on video on the Internet [DivX, Xvid, . . . ); in some examples H.264\/MPEG-4 AVC (commonly used in Blu-Ray, digital video broadcasting, iPod video, HD DVD); in some examples VC-1 (the SMPTE 421M video standard); in some examples VBR as described elsewhere, and in some examples other types of video compression and\/or standards.","In some examples one or a plurality of display processors components  (also known as a GPU[s] or Graphics Processing Unit[s], which may also encompass a BOC[s] or Broadcast Output Component[s] that operates analogously to the output functions of a PC TV tuner card that includes two or more separate tuners on one card) receives said inputs and\/or output(s)      and utilizes a specialized processor that accelerates graphics rendering such as for displaying a plurality of simultaneous output streams in some examples, for 3-D rendering in some examples; for high definition video in some examples; for supporting multiple simultaneous displays in some examples; for 2-D acceleration in some examples; for GPU assisted video encoding or decoding in some examples; for adding overlays such as controls and icons to some displays in some examples; for specialized features such as resolution conversions, filter processing, color corrections, etc. in some examples; for encryption prior to transmission in some examples; or for other display-related functions.

In some examples said received  and processed signals  are selectively transmitted to the TP device component    which in some examples controls functions such as choosing between various broadcast sources ; in some examples displaying one or a plurality of interactive program guides ; in some examples choosing a particular channel to watch ; in some examples choosing a current broadcast   to watch; in some examples recording a particular broadcast  either currently or on a specific day and time; in some examples utilizing a current broadcast in synthesized communications ; in some examples utilizing a recorded broadcast in synthesized communications ; in some examples playing back a recorded broadcast   to watch it; in some examples playing back recordings   at scheduled dates and times and providing that as a TPTV (Teleportal Television) schedule for access by others ; or in some examples performing another controllable function .","In the examples each step and its automated control and\/or user control are known and will not be described in detail herein. In some examples said received broadcast is comprised of a broadcast stream (which may be in a multitude of formats such as in some examples NTSC [National Television Standards Committee], in some examples PAL [Phase Alternate Line], in some examples DBS [Digital Broadcast Services], in some examples DSS [Digital Satellite System], in some examples ATSC [Advanced Television Standards Committee], in some examples MPEG [Moving Pictures Experts Group], in some examples MPEG2 [MPEG2 Transport], or in some examples other known broadcast or streaming formats) and said (optional) tuner\/format conversion   may disassemble said broadcast stream(s) to find programs within it and then demodulate and decode said broadcast stream according to each kind of format received. In some examples this may include an IF (Intermediate Frequency) demodulator that demodulates a TV signal at an intermediate frequency; in some examples this may include an A\/D converter that may convert a TV signal into an analog or a digital signal; in some examples this may include a VSB (Vestigal Side Band) demodulator\/decoder; in some examples a video decoder and an analog decoder respectively decode video and audio signals; in some examples a parser parses the stream to extract the important video and\/or audio events (such as the start of frames, the start of sequence headers, etc. that device logic uses for functions such as in some examples playback, in some examples fast-forward, in some examples slow play, in some examples pause, in some examples reverse, in some examples fast-reverse, in some examples slow reverse, in some examples indexing, in some examples stop, or in some examples other functions); and\/or in some examples other known types of decoder, converter or demodulator may be employed. Therefore, in some examples a sequence of two or a plurality of demodulators\/decoders may be employed (for example, an ATSC signal may be converted into digital data by means of an IF demodulator, an A\/D converter and a VSB demodulator\/decoder; and for another example, an NTSC signal may be converted by means of a video decoder and an audio decoder), whereby said tuner\/(optional) format conversion  tunes to a particular program within said broadcast sources  , if needed provides appropriate format conversion , demodulation , decoding , parses said selected stream , and provides said appropriately formatted and parsed stream to the rest of the TP device.","In some examples after broadcast sources   are received  format conversion  is unnecessary, and the main controls employed  are to select a particular broadcast and pass it directly to output    to be watched  . In some examples after broadcast sources   are received  format conversion  is performed, and the main controls employed  are to select a particular broadcast and pass it directly to output    to be watched  . In some examples after broadcast sources   are received  and (optional) format conversion  is performed, the main controls employed  are to select a particular broadcast and pass it to the synthesis\/controls functions    (as described elsewhere) in some examples for recording   (as described elsewhere); in some examples for synthesis   (as described elsewhere); in some examples to utilize other features   (as described elsewhere). In some examples output  includes (optional) format conversion  and said (optional) format conversion  may include encoding video    such as in some examples encoding video to display it      as described elsewhere; in some examples encoding a television signal    to display on a television; in some examples to encode video    such as for streaming  to fit a remote use or system. In some examples output  includes (optional) format conversion  and said (optional) format conversion  may include formatting audio signals for outputting audio in some examples to a speaker(s) ; in some examples to an audio amplifier ; in some examples to a home theater system ; in some examples to a professional audio system ; in some examples to a component of media     ; or in some examples to another form of audio playback . In some examples output  includes (optional) format conversion  and said (optional) format conversion  may include encoding video and audio such as in some examples to display it as a processed synthesis   as described elsewhere; in some examples encoding a television signal to display on a television; in some examples to encode video    such as for streaming  to fit a remote use or system.","Said functions and choices may be controlled in some examples by one or a plurality of users by means of user I\/O devices ; in some examples by one or a plurality of remote controls ; in some examples a device  may be shared  and the remote user(s)  provides user control ; and in some examples a device  may be under remote control  and the remote user(s)  provides user control . As an example if a user turns the volume up or down by using a remote control    the control function  adjusts the output of the audio function.","The above may be extended and expanded by data carried in the VBI (Vertical Blanking Interval) of analog television channels, or in a digital data track of digital television channels (a digital channel may include separate video, audio, VBI, program guide, and\/or conditional access information as separate bitstreams, multiplexed into a composite stream that is modulated on a carrier signal; for example, in some examples digital channels transport VBI data to support analog video features, and in some examples a digital channel may provide additional digital data for other purposes). In some examples said additional data includes program associated data such as in some examples subtitles; in some examples text tracks; in some examples timecode; in some examples teletext; in some examples additional languages; in some examples additional video formats; in some examples music information tracks; in some examples additional data. In some examples said data includes other types and uses of additional data such as in some examples to distribute an interactive program guide(s); in some examples to download context-relevant supplemental content; in some examples to distribute advertising; in some examples to assist in providing meta-data enhanced programming; in some examples to assist in providing means for multimedia personalization; in some examples to assist in linking viewers with advertisers; in some examples to provide caption data; and\/or in some examples to perform other data and assist with other functions. In some examples it is optional whether or not to play back or use all or any subset of said additional data when playing back or using said broadcast streams or programs that contain said additional data (whether in some examples encoded in the VBI, in some examples encoded in digital data track[s], in some examples provided by alternate means, or in some examples provided by additional means).","In some examples said additional data may be included according to standards such as in an NTSC signal utilizing the NABTS [North American Broadcast Teletext Standard]; in some examples according to FCC mandates for CC [Closed Caption] or EDS [Extended Data Services]; in some examples other standards or practices may be followed such as an MPEG2 private data channel. In some examples said additional data is not limited by standard means for encoding and decoding said data such as in some examples by modulation into lines of the VBI, and in some examples by a digital television multiplex signal that includes a private channel; other appropriate and known ways may be used as well whether as alternates or additions to said standard means and in some examples said additional data may be directly communicated over a cable modem, in some examples may be communicated over a cellular telephone modem, in some examples may be communicated by a server over one or a plurality of networks, and in some examples any mechanism(s) that can transmit and receive digital information may be employed.","In some examples output  includes encoding and including various kinds of additional data    provided by the remainder of a TP device as described in this figure and elsewhere, such that said additional data is included in the output signal     ; and in some examples when said output is played back in a subsequent device's input said additional information may be used in various ways described herein and elsewhere (in some examples said additional data may include information such as the original source of a copyrighted program that has been used in synthesis and output; in some examples the date a synthesis was created and output; in some examples program title and description information for display in an electronic program guide; or in some examples other data included for other purposes and uses). Said output  may in some examples add data to a broadcast or a communication that goes beyond what is normally considered video and\/or audio data.","One characteristic of TP devices is processing one or a plurality of simultaneous connections as described elsewhere. , \u201cTP Device Processing\u2014Multiple\/Parallel,\u201d illustrates some examples of simultaneous processing of said connections in one device  by means of a scalable plurality of simultaneous processes illustrated in .

When turned on, this begins for each command  by entering a command with a user I\/O device or peripheral, and determining the type of command it is by determining the type of user I\/O device that originates said command     , and the command issued     . In some examples said user I\/O device(s)  and\/or user I\/O interface(s)  is a pointing device  by which a user inputs spatial (in some examples including multi-dimensional) data generally indicated by physical gestures that are paralleled on a screen by visual changes such as moving a visible pointer (including a cursor); in some examples said pointing device  is a mouse ; in some examples a pointing device is a trackball ; in some examples a pointing device is a joystick ; in some examples a pointing device is a pointing nub  (a pressure sensitive small knob such as those embedded in the center of a laptop keyboard); in some examples a pointing device is a stylus  (a pen-like device such as used on a graphics tablet); or in some examples is another type of pointing device .","In some examples said user I\/O device(s)  and\/or user I\/O interface(s)  is a voice interface  device by which a user inputs voice or speech commands to control a device; in some examples said voice control of a device includes a wired microphone(s) ; in some examples said voice control of a device includes a wireless microphone(s) ; in some examples said voice control of a device includes an audio speaker(s) to provide audio feedback ; in some examples said voice control  affects part of a device but not all of the device such as voice control over voicemail, or such as a voice-controlled web browser; in some examples said voice interface  is used to control another interface device such as a remote control  that in turn turns said voice controls into commands that are sent to control the device.","In some examples said user I\/O device(s)  and\/or user I\/O interface(s)  is a touch interface  device by which a user touches a device's display with in some examples one finger , in some examples two or more fingers  (such as a \u201cswipe\u201d), in some examples a hand , in some examples an object  (such as using a stylus on a graphics tablet), in some examples other means or combinations.

In some examples a \u201cuniversal remote control\u201d emulates and replaces the individual remote controls from multiple electronic devices by being able to transmit the commands from multiple brands and models to control numerous electronic devices. In some examples a remote control  includes a touchscreen whose interface provides graphical means for representing functions or buttons virtually (such as a virtual keyboard for text input), for displaying virtual buttons or controls, for including feedback from a device, for showing which device is being controlled (where a TP device uses remote control of other devices), for adding instructions (if needed), and for providing other features and functions.

Remote controls  typically communicate by IR (Infrared) signals, Bluetooth or radio signals. In some examples of using a remote control  a user presses one or a plurality of real buttons (or virtual buttons or images on a graphical touchscreen) to directly operate  a local TP device: or in some examples to control  another device that the TP device controls (such as in some examples when a TP device remote controls a PC , in some examples when a TP device remote controls a television set top box , in some examples when a TP device remote controls another TP device , in some examples when a TP device remote controls a different type of electronic device ).","In some examples said user I\/O device(s)  and\/or user I\/O interface(s)  is another type of user I\/O device  such as in some examples a graphics tablet or digitizing tablet ; in some examples a puck  (which in some examples is used in CAD\/CAM\/CAE tracing); in some examples a standard or specialized keyboard ; in some examples a configured smart phone ; in some examples a configured electronic tablet or pad ; in some examples a specialized version of a touch interface may be controlled by a light pen ; in some examples eye tracking  (in some examples control by eye movements); in some examples a gyroscopic mouse  (in some examples a mouse that can be moved through the air and used while standing up); in some examples gestures with a tracking device  (in some examples for controlling a device with physical movements with the gestures performed by a hand in some examples, by a mouse in some examples, by a stylus in some examples, or by other means); in some examples a game pad ; in some examples a balance board  (in some examples for exercising with a video game system); in some examples a dance pad  (in some examples for dance input during a game); in some examples a simulated gun  (in some examples for shooting screen objects during a game); in some examples a simulated steering wheel  (in some examples for driving a vehicle during a game); in some examples a simulated yoke  (in some examples for flying a plane during a game); in some examples a simulated sword  (in some examples for virtual fighting during a game); in some examples simulated sports equipment  (such as a simulated tennis racket in some examples such as for playing a sport during a game); in some examples a simulated musical instrument(s)  (such as a simulated guitar in some examples such as for playing an instrument during a musical game); in some examples sensors  (in some examples sensors observe a user[s] and respond to inferred needs without the user providing an explicit command); in some examples another type of user I\/O device .","In some examples these varied user I\/O devices , features , capabilities , etc. are components of providing a customized, personalized yet consistent interface for the various TP devices employed by each user\u2014as described in  through , in ,  through , and elsewhere.

In some examples a known I\/O device command  is not a TP device command , so it is translated  by receiving the command sent       and determining the TP command   necessary to perform the requested action. In some examples entering a command  on a user I\/O device      that is directed toward a particular DIU such as in some examples a subsidiary device  controlled by an RCTP, or in some examples an AID\/AOD  controlled by a VTP, causes an automated command translation    which in some examples retrieves from (local or remote) storage  a list of available commands for said DIU and each of their RCTP parallel commands , and each of their VTP parallel commands . Said translation   selects the appropriate RCTP command , or VTP command , as needed for the particular DIU that is being controlled  . Said translated command   is then sent to the particular DIU   to perform the requested action.","In some examples said entered command       is not a TP device command , and it is also not a known I\/O device command , and it is also not a known device command  that applies to a particular Device in Use (DIU)    , so in some examples a new user I\/O device  may be added; in some examples a new feature  may be added to an existing user I\/O device      ; and in some examples a new command  may be added to an existing user I\/O device      . In some examples the addition of a new user I\/O device , a new feature  to an existing user I\/O device, or a new command  to an existing user I\/O device (herein collectively referred to as an \u201cAddition\u201d) starts by an initiating said Addition ; in some examples said Addition  requires (optionally) automatically or manually retrieving  the appropriate configuration from (local or remote) storage  (which may include in some examples an installation CD-ROM , in some examples an installation DVD , in some examples a manual or automated download , or in some examples other manual or automated means for retrieving   a configuration); in some examples configuration  of said Addition is automated while in some examples configuration  is a manual step; in some examples one or a plurality of (optional) tests  may be performed automatically and visibly, in some examples said tests  may be performed automatically and invisibly, in some examples said tests  may be performed manually, and in some examples testing  is not performed; in some examples tests  are performed and if one or more parts of said tests fail re-configuration  may be performed, or (optionally) a different configuration may be retrieved   to perform said re-configuration ; in some examples use  of said Addition requires the user or the system to modify the Addition and in such a case re-configuration  may be performed, or (optionally) a different configuration may be retrieved   to perform said re-configuration ; in some examples use  of said Addition accomplishes the desired result so that said Addition  is complete and goes into use .","Universal remote control: One category of user I\/O devices \u2014a TP Universal Remote Control (URC) \u2014has the potential to improve the use of other digital devices substantially, because said TP remote controls  separate their use from the need to control each TP device directly and individually\u2014making it possible to use and control one or a plurality of devices from a single portable and wireless controller. Said URC is described in  and :",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0688","num":"0687"},"figref":"FIG. 36"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0689","num":"0688"},"figref":"FIG. 37"},"Turning now to , \u201cUniversal Remote Control (URC),\u201d with one or a plurality of TP remote controls  a user may utilize one or a plurality of TP devices   in some examples; utilize one or a plurality of TP subsidiary devices  in some examples; and\/or be utilized by one or a plurality of AIDs\/AODs  in some examples\u2014literally a range of digital devices     and digital capabilities\u2014without needing to run each one of them personally and directly.

Said URC  also includes wireless communications  that may employ any type of wireless communications (which in some examples is WiFi  , in some examples line-of-sight IR {Infrared]  , in some examples radio  , in some examples Bluetooth  , and in some examples other means for wireless communication  ) that is configured to communicate with one or a plurality of devices   and can couple together an enabled URC(s)  and an enabled device(s) . In some examples said URC's display screen   displays one or a plurality of components of said controlled device's interface   where said display   may employ any type of display (which in some examples is an LCD [Liquid Crystal Display] that includes a touchscreen for user input). In some examples said URC  includes a processor  which may employ any type of computer processor (which in some examples is a CPU [Central Processing Unit] , in some examples is a DSP [Digital Signal Processor] , in some examples is a microcontroller , in some examples is a device controller , in some examples is a computation engine  and in some examples is other means for processing ). In some examples said URC  includes local memory  and local storage  which may employ any type of volatile and non-volatile storage that can hold data in some examples when the URC  is powered down, and in some examples when the URC  is on and processing (which in some examples is RAM [Random-Access Memory] , in some examples SRAM [Static RAM] , in some examples DRAM [Dynamic RAM] , in some examples a hard drive , in some examples flash memory , in some examples ROM [Read-Only Memory] , in some examples EPROM [Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory] , in some examples an optical disk drive , and in some examples is other means for memory  and storage ).","TP device(s) remote control processing : In addition to other hardware, functions, features and capabilities as described elsewhere, in some examples a TP device that is enabled for remote control includes Remote Control Processing (herein RCP) . In some examples said RCP  includes wireless communications  that may employ any type of wireless communications (which in some examples is WiFi  , in some examples is IR  , in some examples is radio  , in some examples is Bluetooth  , and in some examples is other means for wireless communication  ) that is configured to communicate with one or a plurality of URC's   and can couple together an enabled URC(s)  and an enabled device(s) . In some examples said RCP  includes processing   which in some examples employs the device's  processor(s), and in some examples employs another processor(s)   which may be any type of computer processor (which in some examples is a microcontroller  , in some examples is a DSP [Digital Signal Processor]  , in some examples is a GPU  , in some examples is a device controller  , in some examples is a computation engine   and in some examples is other means for processing  ). In some examples said RCP  includes local memory and local storage which may employ any type of volatile and non-volatile storage that can hold data in some examples when RCP  is powered down, and in some examples when RCP  is on and processing (which in some examples is the device's local memory and local storage, and in some examples is additional memory and\/or additional storage).","Remote control of TP Devices: In some examples each TP device's RCP   includes interface processing  that extracts the control and navigation components of the device's interface   as if that were presented in a small interface control window on its display. In some examples said interface processing  utilizes a markup language that renders and describes a GUI (Graphical User Interface) , controls , as well as include data  (which in some examples is HTML , in some examples is XML , in some examples is XHTML , in some examples is another user interface markup language  that provides reuse for presenting a user interface). Instead of displaying said processed interface control window  on the device's display , said processed interface control window is communicated  through a wireless connection to a URC's communications , and displayed  on the URC's display . When a user interacts with the URC's display interface  , the user's inputs    are communicated  to the device's RCP communications  where said user's remote control inputs  are received , processed  as if they were entered on a small interface control window on the local display, and said user inputs control the device  (in some examples as described in  and elsewhere). In some examples said small interface control window includes RCTP control of a subsidiary device(s)  as described elsewhere. In some examples said small interface control window includes control over an RTP(s)  as described elsewhere.","Therefore, without constructing an \u201cintelligent\u201d remote control device or system, the TP's URC provides remote control  over one or a plurality of devices    through a scalable system of extending the display of a device's interface     to a remote control   where it is received and displayed   , and a user's inputs on said URC    are communicated   and processed by said RPC   . As a result, in some examples a URC  operates a TP device  as if a user had interacted directly with an interface window that was displayed on the TP device's display, and therefore the URC  controls said TP device  from its remote display   of that rendered interface window, and a user's inputs    are communicated   to said device's RCP    . As resulting and continuing steps after using each said input  , said device's interface  is processed and updated , said updated interface is communicated by the device   to the URC  where the updated interface is displayed   and ready for further user inputs   \u2014in the same continuous process as if the device's interface were being used locally.","In some examples for a particular device (such as in some examples a TP subsidiary device , and in some examples and AID\/AOD ) a URC  may load a RCTP (Remote-Control Teleportal) from its storage , run said RCTP for that device by means of the URC's processor  and memory , utilize communications   to control a TP device  and thereby communicate with the particular subsidiary device or AID\/AOD under control, display said RCTP on the URC's display screen  , accept user inputs    to said RCTP by means described elsewhere, and communicate   said user inputs to control said TP device . In some examples a URC  and for a particular device (such as in some examples a TP subsidiary device , and in some examples and AID\/AOD ) a URC may load a VTP (Virtual Teleportal) from its storage , run said VTP by means of the URC's processor  and memory , utilize communications   to control a TP device  and thereby communicate with a subsidiary device or an AID\/AOD under control, display said VTP on the URC's display screen  , accept user inputs    to said VTP by means described elsewhere, and communicate   said user inputs to control said TP device . In some examples for a particular device such as in some examples a TP subsidiary device , a URC  may display the part of a TP device's interface   that controls said TP subsidiary device ; such as in that example the TP device  runs a RCTP that controls the subsidiary device , and the URC displays the TP device's RCTP so the user can control the RCTP and subsidiary device by means of the URC . In some examples a direct display of a device's interface may be less effective, even with translation of commands (as described elsewhere), such as in some examples for various types of TP subsidiary devices , and in some examples for various types of AIDs\/AODs .","Remote control of some Subsidiary Devices  (by means such as an RCTP), and\/or by some AIDs\/AODs  (by means such as a VTP): In some examples a TP device is used to control some of one or a plurality of subsidiary devices by means of RCTP (Remote Control Teleportaling); in some examples said TP device's interface processing   includes the capability to translate one or a plurality of commands for a subsidiary device  or for an AID\/AOD  as described in     and elsewhere, and display those translated commands as if they were a TP device interface such as described herein   , in  and elsewhere. Therefore in some examples, the interface to control some of a subsidiary device  or some of an AID\/AOD  is processed to appear the same as or similar to a TP device interface  as if they were a TP device. Furthermore, in some examples that translated and mapped TP device interface  is communicated   to a URC \u2014so that a URC   may control a TP device   in some examples, a subsidiary device  in some examples, or an AID\/AOD  in some examples. In some examples extracting the control and navigation components and\/or commands that match a TP device interface and presenting them on the remote control's display similar to a TP device's interface produces a wireless connection and an interactive remote control display of those commands that may be executed on a subsidiary device  or on an AID\/AOD . When a user employs the URC  , it operates through the RCP  and its command translation to remotely control some of a subsidiary device  or some of an AID\/AOD . Therefore, without constructing an \u201cintelligent\u201d remote control device or system, this provides some remote control over one or a plurality of devices through a scalable system of interactive interface extension.","Turning now to , \u201cUniversal Remote Control Interface (URCI),\u201d in some examples a device is turned on  (such as described in  and elsewhere) and said device is waiting for a URC to send its ID or its user's input(s). To start discovering and connecting to devices  a URC  must be turned on, at which point the default is for the URC's communications  to broadcast its last used user ID as it discovery command . Optionally, a user may select a different identity  for a URC  (as described elsewhere), and optionally one or a plurality of said user's identities may require authentication (as described elsewhere). Optionally, turning on a URC may have a default setting to require identity selection  and authentication  to prevent taking control of a secure device by means of its URC. Devices (such as an enabled and configured TP device  in some examples) that receive the communicated discovery command communicate a response  that is received by the URC . In some examples said discovery process     occurs automatically for each discovered device; in some examples said discovery process may have one or a plurality of errors  in which case AKM instructions (Active Knowledge Machine guidance, as described elsewhere) for manual discovery and connection may be displayed in some examples on the URC's screen  , and in some examples on the device's screen  . This discovery and communication process     repeats until the available devices have been discovered and subsequent preparation steps have been performed (    as described below). Thereafter, previously discovered devices do not need to be rediscovered when they are used. In addition, said URC periodically broadcasts to discover new devices . Also additionally, said user may choose a different identity , in which case said URC broadcasts  to discover devices appropriate for that identity. Also additionally, said user may add a plurality of identities for simultaneous use , in which case said URC broadcasts  to discover devices appropriate for that user's current set of open identities.","URC display of a device: A device's response  may optionally cause a URC to display in some examples the newly connected device's name , in some examples the device's manufacturer's logo , in some examples a list of controllable functions for user selection  (such as if an LTP in some examples can open one or a plurality of SPLS's , in some examples open one or a plurality of focused connections , in some examples watch one or a plurality of broadcasts  by selecting between a plurality of sources, in some examples play a pre-recorded DVD movie , in some examples provide other functions ), etc. Optionally, in some examples one or a plurality of portions of said initial or subsequent display (such as in some examples a manufacturer's logo, in some examples the device's name, in some examples the list of controllable features available, in some examples other information or video) may be communicated  from said controlled device's storage; in some examples one or a plurality of portions of said initial or subsequent displays may be pre-stored on said URC  and displayed   from said URC's storage ; in some examples one or a plurality of portions of said initial or subsequent displays may be stored remotely and retrieved by said controlled device , then downloaded and communicated  to said URC  and displayed by said URC   .","Device selection (list, interface, navigation, etc.): In some examples as a device is discovered and connected     it is added to a device list  of one or a plurality of controllable devices that may be accessed at any time to select a device to control , and when said device list is accessed  it is displayed on the URC   so that a user can select the desired device to control . In some examples said device list  is text; in some examples said device list  is graphical icons; in some examples said device list  is hypertext links; in some examples said device list  is a menu; in some examples said device list  is an interface widget (such as a graphical map, a pulldown list or another type of widget interface); in some examples said device list  and device selection  is provided by other navigation and\/or other interface means. In some examples said device list  includes too many devices to fit on one URC screen, and in this case various types of known navigation may be used such as in some examples multiple URC screens with navigation between the screens ; in some examples devices may be grouped in device categories (such as in some examples categories such as TP devices, PCs\/computers, other subsidiary electronic devices, AIDs\/AODs, etc.) so that one selection screen  utilizes a hierarchy of categories and each category's list of devices; in some examples other means for a device selection interface and navigation may be employed to find and select a larger number of devices.","Device Interface communications and use: In some examples as each device is added to said device list  it's Device Interface (herein DI) is downloaded  to the URC and stored in memory  so that said DI is immediately available to be displayed  as soon as a specific device is selected . In some examples said DI is downloaded from a device ; in some examples said DI is downloaded from another source ; in some examples parts of said DI have been previously downloaded to the URC (such as in some examples a manufacturer's logo, in some examples a list of controllable device features that may be selected, and in some examples other data) and is stored  in said URC for repeated uses over time. As described elsewhere, in some examples as said DI is used    it is displayed on the URC  ; in some examples a user interacts with said DI  on the URC by means such as a touchscreen , or buttons , or any type of input  or interaction; in some examples the user's input(s) are communicated  by means of URC communications  to the controlled device's communications ; in some examples the user's input or command is performed by the controlled device  ; in some examples the controlled device's interface is (optionally) updated   by processing means described elsewhere (because in some examples an operation may only be started and stopped such as by selecting a play or pause button without needing to update the interface, while in some examples an operation may be changed such as by displaying an EPG [Electronic Program Guide] to end one broadcast by choosing a different broadcast and start playing it); in some examples the updated DI is communicated by communications on the controlled device   and received by the URC's communications ; in some examples an entirely updated DI is displayed   for use on the URC as needed  , while in some examples secondary information is all that is updated such as adding information relating to a current function (such as in some examples the title of a movie that is being watched, or in some examples the name and background data of the identity in a focused connection).","Subsidiary devices and AIDs\/AODs: In some examples a device is a subsidiary device  or an AID\/AOD , then each step in this continuous control process      is performed by utilizing command translation and interface means described elsewhere, with the result that in some cases very little control  is possible, in some cases some features may be controlled  but other features are not available, and in some cases considerable control  may be used from a URC. In some examples a device is a subsidiary device  or an AID\/AOD , then each step in this continuous control process      is performed by utilizing RCTP means or VTP means described elsewhere and displaying said RCTP interface (in a single whole screen or in segmented parts), or VTP interface (in a single whole screen or in segmented parts), in the interface window  on the URC  , with the result that in some cases very little control  is possible, in some cases some features may be controlled  but other features are not available, and in some cases considerable control  may be used from a URC.","Advertising and marketing: In some examples the URC's  display  may be updated with marketing or advertising messages such as in some examples each device vendor offering newer or upgraded models for sale: in some examples third-party retailers offering competing devices for sale; or in some examples behavioral tracking identifying a user's task(s) and offering products or services that fit said user's needs. In some examples said advertising and marketing process is attached to an external selling service or system that analyzes said data and provides specific advertisements that in some examples are based on the user's needs, in some examples are based on the user's context of use, and in some examples are based on what the vendor is trying to sell. In some examples this updating process  (whether in some examples it is based upon using a controlled device   with a URC  , or in some examples it is based on advertising and marketing) is repeated continuously     for each user input on each device selected.","Other high-level selections: In some examples a user selects a different device to use  by using components of the URC interface   to display the list of controllable devices  and selecting a different controllable device , which has been discovered previously  and had its DI downloaded , so that when selected  said new device's DI is immediately available for display and use  four the available functions that may be controlled from the URC     . In some examples a user connects to a new or remote device  by coming into range of it and automatically discovering it    ; while in some examples a user connects to a new or remote device  by manually connecting to it     with the URC (such as in some examples a TP device , in some examples a TP subsidiary device , in some examples an AID\/AOD , or in some examples another type of device).","CONSTRUCTED DIGITAL REALITIES (RTPs AND OTHER TP DEVICES): A world with Teleportal devices includes Remote Teleportals (herein RTPs)\u2014which comprise Teleportal devices in a plurality of fixed and mobile locations to view those physical locations, provide live viewing of an RTP location(s), (optional) two-way communications with that place(s), gather various kinds of data from said place(s), and transform one or a plurality of RTP places' physical realities into multiple types of broadcasted and\/or recorded digital realities.","In some examples RTPs extend and expand the current growth of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and augmented reality. These current and emerging technologies include GPS (Geographic Positioning Systems), turn by turn directions, Google streetview, augmented maps that identify places we want to find, and many more new and emerging services such as pointing a smart phone's camera at a landmark and having Augmented Reality data (such as a restaurant menu, another customer's comments or a landmark's Wikipedia entry) displayed automatically. Together these are creating a \u201cknowing world\u201d with wireless services and systems that provide route guidance, information, and answers at many locations along the way. In such a world, RTP's are just one more eye to find the same destination to which everyone is traveling.","That \u201cknowing world\u201d may not be the biggest or the best prize. While those who live in it will be safer and more informed this will be a paternalistic world whose systems turn its users into bystanders and observers even while they travel through their guided and information-rich physical environment. Instead of discovering, interacting and deciding or creating at every step, they are led turn-by-turn through the authorized ways of how to go everywhere, told the approved information about what they are seeing, and directed to what they should see and know during their journey. Their structured world will take them to far worse destinations than what their goal seem to be at first. In the end a \u201cknowing world\u201d will organize the world's people\u2014it is the people who will be directed, structured and known\u2014as they are turned into sleepwalkers who are herded through a reality they don't own or control, guided to destinations that are curated and presented as if it were the only world in which they can and should live.","In some examples, however, Remote Teleportals provide new types of systems for constructing one or a plurality of digital realities out of our physical reality and sometimes beyond it, in addition to providing the standard live or augmented views of each physical place. In some examples multiple constructed realities are simultaneously broadcast from a single RTP's fixed or mobile locations, so that those who view that location remotely (as well as those who are in that place and view it digitally) can enjoy it as it is\u2014and switch immediately to one or a plurality of creatively altered digital realities, according to the desires and tastes of one or a plurality of digital creators.","As will be demonstrated, the potentials of these multiple \u201cdigital realities\u201d may be more dynamic, dramatic, artistic, fertile, inspired, visionary, original and \u201ccool\u201d than the \u201cphysical reality\u201d they replace. In a brief summary, an RTP (as well as other TP device processing that may also be broadcast, such as LTP's and MTP's that are mobile) provide means to turn physical reality into a broadcasted stage, with tools that one or a plurality of creative imaginations can use to transform the ordinary into a plurality of digital versions of reality that anyone can choose to enjoy or alter further, rather than be guided through by today's GIS and augmented reality systems. These RTP digital realities are not under any type of control, are not curated, nor are they paternalistic. Rather than guiding us, they give us the freedom to represent reality in any way we want.","Each has different types of value: Today's emerging GIS, GPS and augmented reality systems enhance physical reality and RTPs can show that. In addition, RTPs also diverge from physical reality and provide means to transform the world\u2014one place and one vision at a time\u2014into a plurality of digital realities that might make the world into a plurality of more interesting, entertaining compelling, or powerful visions of reality than existed before.","Some examples include: Art and music realities (Artists and musicians can add overlays to locations, adding sculpture gardens, static images, dynamically moving artworks, re-decorated buildings, creative digital interactions, musical themes and much more to numerous locations. Services can randomize these overlays and additions with various themed templates, allowing numerous artists to transform multiple physical places from the ordinary into the extraordinary.); Graffiti realities (Graffiti artists and edgy musicians can add overlays and substitutions to locations, turning the world upside with their divergent creations.); A living, natural restored reality (Transformative programs could allow environmentalists to GPS an outdoor location, identify its natural plant and animal species, then overlay a fully restored scene over the current [usually badly managed] physical location\u2014showing what it would look like if its natural plants and animals were restored to their full populations with that place's natural carrying capacity\u2014then periodically switching back and forth to show the contrast between what nature would produce and that place after it was \u201ccivilized\u201d); Events (Couple fixed or mobile RTPs with events, and broadcast digital events with accessible digital presences [such as live, recorded, or both] for interested audiences, as described elsewhere in more detail.); Alerts realities (Couple various types of RTP sensors and systems with digital alerts so a plurality of \u201calerts channels\u201d auto-display the types of events different people would like to see wherever they appear, as soon as they happen anywhere. Sound-based channels can jump to the latest location based on a type of sound such as guns firing [violent crimes, political repressions, firefights in war zones, etc.], car accidents, sirens or alarms, the sound of a person screaming, or more.); Celebrities realities (Identity-based channels can jump to sightings of celebrities, political leaders, newsmakers, etc. [who are placed on face recognition \u201cwhite lists\u201d] by those who use templates and identifiers to create one or a plurality of \u201ccelebrity alert channels,\u201d \u201cpolitician alert channels,\u201d \u201cnewsmaker alert channels,\u201d etc.); Persons realities (Identity-based channels can jump to sightings of the people in one's life such as family, friends, co-workers, business associates, etc. [who are placed on face recognition \u201cwhite lists\u201d] by those who use templates and identifiers to create one or a plurality of \u201cfamily alert channels,\u201d \u201cfriends alert channels,\u201d \u201cco-worker and business alert channels,\u201d etc.); Privacy realities (Couple RTP displays to face distortion software for those who put themselves on \u201cprivacy lists,\u201d so when they're in public they're covered up in \u201cRTP digital realities.\u201d); Superhero realities (Extract \u201csuper heroes\u201d from different types of movies or other sources, and extract sports figures in action from different types of sports events. Then cruise them through real locations, whether standing and walking, or performing their sport [such as catching a pass, running, snowboarding, skydiving, etc.], or performing daring missions [such as from superheroes sequences in movies and television]. These can be overlaid into real places, both as if they were normally present, and also as if they were performing sports there, or fighting villains and saving that world.); Healthy\/Overstuffed realities (Reshape the people in a place by slimming those who are overweight so they are all height-weight proportionate, or inflate and parody the people so everyone there is obese.) Militarized\/Demilitarized realities (Extract uniformed military and police, and their vehicles, and overlay them into locations so those places appear completely controlled police states. Or conversely, remove police from locations where they are normally positioned in force\u2014to show how those places would look if they were not directly controlled by that government's police and military.); Revolutionary realities (Digitally alter weapons in dictatorships such as by putting flowers in gun barrels, revolutionary graffiti on tanks and military vehicles, overlaid revolutionary political slogans on government buildings, and more, with these digital realities processed abroad and broadcast into dictatorial countries.); Utopian realities (A variety ideals may be dynamically visualized and overlaid on everyday places to show what they would be like if each of those ideals came true.).","Multiple realities that produce new revenues and income: Audiences have value and can be monetized\u2014and larger audiences earn more money\u2014so the most popular digital realities, with larger audiences, are the most attractive for those who want to monetize all or parts of their RTP's outputs. An RTP's stream(s) can be received at one's local TP devices or on network devices, transformed into new digital realities, and rebroadcast\u2014so one RTP's streams can produce multiple incomes, some of which are sharable with the RTP's source and some of which are unique to a creator. If wanted, a transformed stream(s) can be substituted for the original physical reality stream's at a source RTP(s) as if it were the real source (as described elsewhere), or broadcast as additional digital reality streams directly from a source RTP(s)\u2014the revenues from those audiences can be turned into revenues for both the RTP owners who create the original streams, and for those who create compelling digital realities that attract audiences.","With RIP-constructed digital realities one or a plurality of RTP owners and additional creators could simultaneously redesign the physical world's live or recorded streams in a plurality of ways and broadcast the transformations from one or a plurality of sources such as RTP's, LTP's, MTP's, etc. Those in the audience(s) can choose the versions of reality they prefer and want\u2014with the audience including both remote observers and those in that place but using their TP screens to be guided through one of its digital transformations.","Then, as each person uses a screen to go through the world they can choose which digital reality(ies) in which they want to live. The \u201cknowing world\u201d of GIS, GPS and augmented reality becomes just one option that can now compete with a plurality of constructed and imaginative digital realities\u2014which can be designed to be more entertaining, more self-determined and more user-centered than the step-by-step \u201cpackaged reality\u201d of GPS and augmented reality systems.","RTP-constructed digital realities may also be coupled with the ARM (Alternate Realities Machine, as described elsewhere) so that each person sets their own boundaries of what they want to include and exclude from their self-chosen \u201cworld(s)\u201d (as described elswehre). The ARM's personal boundaries prioritize (include) what a recipient wants, block or diminish what a recipient does not want, and adds additional capabilities such as paywalls (which require those who want a person's attention to pay for that attention or be blocked instead), and protection (as described elsewhere).","RTP-constructed digital realities may also be coupled with Governances (as described elsewhere) so that groups may collectively construct digital realities (and optionally set their members' ARM boundaries) to fit each type of digital reality they choose to create (such as the three example governances described herein: IndividualISM's that expand self-directed personal freedoms, CorporatISM's that sell comprehensive solutions like entire lifestyles and living standards, and WorldISM's that support collective actions [like environmentalism] that transcend nation-state borders).","Taken together, it is clear that RTP processes of constructing digital realities have some differences from physical presence and GPS\/augmented reality systems, especially since RTP's stream much more than \u201clive\u201d reality\u2014RTP's may stream digital realities that may be altered in a plurality of locations by a plurality of creative imaginations\u2014each for their own different purposes\u2014and then (optionally) substituted and streamed as if their alteration(s) were the real source. Those who receive either \u201clive\u201d or constructed digital realities may also alter the received digital realities further during their presentation, if they impose their own self-selected boundaries during reception and local presentation by means such as the ARM (Alternate Realities Machine), governances boundaries, etc. as described elsewhere. Some examples of alterations during reception and presentation include prioritizing what each receiver desires, excluding what each receiver does not want, and applying other filters such as a Paywall so that receivers earn income for providing their scarce attention to specific added components such as to a specific product, brand or organization (that may be added during creation or during reception).","Therefore in some examples a meta-view of digital reality includes both the construction of a digital reality(ies) to suit varying goals, entertainments, desires, envisioned worlds, etc.; and also the filtering and altered presentation of said \u201creal\u201d and also digital realities as part of receiving them, so that a combination of a real place, creative digital reality constructions, and receivers' boundaries and alterations are simultaneous co-participants in creating the final digital reality(ies) experienced and enjoyed\u2014with multiple monetization opportunities for multiple participants in this (value creation) chain. In combination with other capabilities described herein, RTP constructed digital realities are a way to grow beyond physical limits by providing devices, tools, resources and systems so that a plurality of creators and receivers may help choose, construct, live in and earn monies from any digital realities they prefer to ordinary physical reality. Over time, a plurality of constructed digital realities may be preferred to the ordinary physical world and may in some examples provide greater monetization opportunities and revenues for more participants (including recipients) than a controlled and \u201cpackaged\u201d physical reality. If they choose, a plurality may try to shatter the glass ceiling between who they are and what they aspire to become by bringing the world they desire to (digital) \u201clife,\u201d then live their lives as they would like to \u201csee themselves,\u201d or perhaps in a simpler description, create the digital identities they would like to become and live the one or plurality of digital lifestyles they prefer.","Instead of strait-jacketed GPS and augmented reality systems that turn people into organized sleepwalkers who are herded through a curated and \u201cknowing\u201d world, some who think for themselves may attempt a breakaway and envision both their dreams and how they can become the independent actors who create and journey through digital realities that support their dreams. They may define or choose the constructed digital reality(ies) they want, instead of passing through a pre-defined physical reality that controls itself and them at the same time.","RTP processing: Together  illustrate some examples of RTP processing including processing within a single RTP; a plurality of locations where the processing of RTP data may be performed; and resources that may be created and used to construct digital realities (as well as expand their use and increase their revenues); similar processes for constructing digital realities may in some examples be employed by other TP devices.

The sources of said improvements may be TPU (Teleportal Utility) Services ; TPU Applications ; large industry-leading vendors  ; new technology startups  ; various digital reality sources ; one or a plurality of RTP owners , individual users , digital reality audience members , etc. The architecture provides capabilities so that each addition  may be included   in one or a plurality of repositories  and provided by one or a plurality of selection and delivery services  (such as in some examples for selecting a type of digital reality , in some examples for selecting and applying various elements of digital reality[ies]  , and in some examples for selecting and applying elements so as to create new combinations and new digital realities  ) so that developers of new digital realities may use them to construct new digital realities , or to modify or update existing digital realities . This provides continuous improvement opportunities for digital realities to potentially become an accelerated creation of intuitive, rapidly maturing, increasingly familiar and stable digital realities that may be created and\/or delivered by a plurality of types of devices, and used by growing audiences     who independently choose and enjoy the types of digital realities they prefer. Since audiences are valuable and can be monetized  , the metrics and data on different digital realities   produces rankings that surface the most valuable digital realities , and said rankings  may be used when storing and selecting digital realities  , and storing and selecting elements of digital realities  \u2014so that new and updated digital realities   may produce larger audiences     and larger incomes .","In some examples said digital realities construction  begins by logging in to a TP device as a specific identity  or user  and starting the creation of a new digital reality by running a setup application  such as in some examples a wizard  and in some examples a software program .

As illustrated in some examples (such as in ) an ARM includes filters\/priorities so that recipients can determine what each wants to include and exclude; in some examples it includes digital and physical self-chosen personal protections for individuals, households, groups, and the public; in some examples it includes Paywalls so that individuals may earn money from providing their attention, rather than giving it away for free to those who sell it to advertisers. The result is personally controlled Shared Planetary Living Spaces (herein SPLS's) that have some parallels to how DVR's (Digital Video Recorders) are used to control hundreds of television channels\u2014we record the television shows we want to see, play and watch what we prefer, and skip what we don't want.","Therefore, in various examples one or a plurality of SPLS boundaries are made explicit and manageable by said ARM. Within a particular set of Boundary Settings one's digital reality may be considerably different than someone else's. In addition, the ARM includes means to save, distribute and try out new Boundaries Settings so the most desirable alternate realities may rapidly spread and be tried, personally altered and adopted wherever they are preferred. As a result, the best alternate realities may be tried and applied with this scope and Seattle that the best realities deserve\u2014possibly providing multiple better competitors than the common shared reality. In some examples the \u201cbest\u201d Boundary Settings may be designed, marketed, sold and\/or supported by individuals, corporations, governances, interest groups, organizations, etc. to improve the lives and experiences of those who live in their Shared Planetary Living Spaces.","Finally, in some examples a person has multiple identities (as described elsewhere in more detail) and each identity may have its own one or a plurality of SPLS's (as described elsewhere in more detail), and each SPLS may have one or a plurality of ARM Boundary Settings. In other words, in some examples by switching to a different established identity (as described elsewhere), a person immediately changes their SPLS(s) and ARM boundaries the new \u201creality\u201d and is thereby able to experience and enjoy life differently. If a person has a plurality of identities, they may change their ARM boundaries to fit their SPLS's and ARM boundaries in each different identity. As a result, one person may change how reality is presented to them (and therefore perceived by them) as often as they want. The implication is that for one or a plurality of persons, reality can be put under their personal control\u2014rather than the other way around.","Turning now to , \u201cIntegration with ARM Boundaries Settings (Choose Your \u2018Reality[ies]\u2019),\u201d illustrates some examples of the above ARM processes which begin in some examples with RTP digital realities  as described elsewhere; in some examples with digital sources  as described elsewhere; in some examples with a broadcasted stream  as described elsewhere; in some examples with governances  as described elsewhere; etc. In some examples this also begins with a person's ARM boundaries settings ; and in some examples this begins with an identity's ARM boundaries settings  (in which case an individual has one or a plurality of identities); and said person or identity has one or a plurality of ARM boundary settings.","In some examples after experiencing a source such as a digital reality , a broadcasted stream , a component of a governance , or another type of source , said identity  may optionally choose to modify an ARM boundary for that source . In some examples ARM boundaries (as described elsewhere in more detail) include priorities\/exclusions , a Paywall , protection , etc. In a brief summary a subset of said ARM boundaries are illustrated, namely the optional ARM boundary setting for prioritizing  or excluding  the source  that was experienced. In a similar manner, the experience of any source  may be utilized to modify any appropriate ARM boundary setting  for a person  or for one of said person's identities .","In some examples the modification of said ARM boundary  begins by deciding whether or not to apply a known ARM boundary  that is based on said source ; in some examples a source  is tried because it is new and popular so there may be an associated ARM boundary setting to rapidly include and prioritize said popular new source ; in some examples a source  is tried because it may seem interesting but some of those who tried it may have disliked it so there may be one or a plurality of associated ARM boundary settings to exclude said source , or to provide partial blocking of that source . In some examples a source  may belong to a category such as rock music stars, urban crimes in progress, new technology product launches, or any other category that a person may want to raise or diminish in importance. In some examples where there is an existing priority boundary and\/or exclusion boundary for a category  (rather than a specific source) it can be selected  and adapted  by increasing or decreasing that category's priority as described elsewhere. Said existing priority boundary(ies)  and\/or exclusion boundary(ies)  is retrieved from one or a plurality of existing priority\/filters databases , displayed for selection , and either used  or not used ; then, if selected and used it may be adapted to fit the user's preferences .","In some examples an existing boundary  is not used and an ARM boundary setting may be created and set    . In some examples said source  may be added to priorities  by adding it at a top priority  or setting its priority level  ; in some examples said source  may be added as an exclusion  by adding it as completely blocked  or setting its priority level  . In some examples said source  is already part of an ARM boundary so that it may have been part of that identitys experience because that ARM boundary did not block it, made it a slight priority, or included it as a top priority; so in some examples a user would want to modify the ARM boundary that affects said source \u2014if the experience was superior then the priority level of said source  would be increased  ; and if the experience was poor then the priority level of said source  would be decreased  ; and if the experience was negative or any reason then the ARM boundary would be set for varying levels of exclusion  , right up to a complete block . In some examples varying scales   may be used to set ARM boundaries such as priority boundary(ies)   and\/or exclusion boundary(ies)  , such as the seven-point scale used herein (though numerous types of scales are known, and may be employed appropriately). In some examples a seven-point scale for priorities   through exclusions   includes almost half that scale employed for priorities such as \u201ctop priority\u201d , \u201cstrongly preferred\u201d  and \u201csomewhat preferred\u201d . In some examples a clear non-preferential midpoint maybe may be included such as \u201cneutral\u201d  which neither prioritizes nor excludes said source . In some examples said seven-point scale   includes almost half that scale employed to filter exclusions such as \u201csomewhat blocked\u201d , \u201cusually blocked\u201d  and \u201ccompletely blocked\u201d .","In some examples after adding a priority boundary  , adding an exclusionary filter  , or modifying an existing priority\/exclusion     by selecting the preferred level for a source  from the boundary's scale  , that boundary may be saved to a priority\/filters database . That boundary and said user's preference then becomes available for rapid display and selection , where it may either be used  or not used ; then, if selected and used by another person or identity it may be adapted to fit another user's preferred level of prioritization\/exclusion  for that source .","In some examples In some examples after adding a priority boundary  , adding an exclusionary filter  , or modifying an existing priority\/exclusion     by selecting the preferred boundary level for a source  from the boundary's scale  , that boundary may be saved to a user's profile  where it may be retrieved and used by an identity . In some examples said ARM boundary for priorities\/exclusions  is not altered so in that case another ARM boundary may (optionally) be modified . In some examples after completing the modification of said ARM boundary  and saving said updated ARM boundary , a person  or identity  may (optionally) choose to modify another ARM boundary based on the experience of that source . In some examples other ARM boundaries that may be set (as described elsewhere in more detail) include a Paywall , protection , etc.","In some examples after desired ARM boundary modifications are complete    said ARM boundaries settings process(es) ends , and said updated ARM boundaries are applied .","SUPERIOR VIEWER SENSOR: Typical current displays on televisions, computers, digital picture frames, electronic pads, tablets, cell phones, etc. are \u201cunreal\u201d in that their displayed images are fixed and do not have the changing field of view that is easily seen by looking through any window and moving from side to side or stepping forward and back, nor do they have parallax shifts when the screen's user changes position and obtains a new perspective (e.g., a new line of sight).","In some examples a subsystem that may be optionally added to varied devices is a Superior Viewer Sensor (herein SVS) which automatically and\/or manually updates and controls a visual display(s) based on the position of one or a plurality of viewers relative to said display, in order to simulate the changing real view that is seen through a real window. In some examples this provides TPDP (Teleportal Digital Presence) with an automated simulation of views through a real window so that as one or a plurality of viewers move relative to the device's screen the image displayed is adjusted to match the position(s) of the viewer(s). Because an SVS is digital it may also provide other digital features and functions.","As a result of an SVS subsystem, a viewer becomes a \u201csuperior viewer\u201d because the viewer's \u201cnormal\u201d digital presence may be seen, heard, experienced, manipulated, used and understood in more detail and in more ways than the physically present local world is generally experienced\u2014making digital presence in some examples a richer, wider, more varied, simultaneously multiplied (with more views and\/or locations at once), interesting and controlled experience than one's local physical presence. Therefore, in some examples an SVS subsystem produces a simulation of the view through a window by means of a display screen, as well as digitally enhanced views and sounds of what is displayed by means of digital video processing and\/or digital audio processing. In some examples an SVS subsystem is comprised of a device such as devices illustrated in  and described elsewhere; real-time video processed by said device and\/or stored video or images; a display screen that displays said video and\/or images; a sensor that detects and locates one or a plurality of observers with respect to said display screen; a display control system, method or process that automatically adjusts the image displayed based upon the location of one or a plurality of observers with respect to the display screen; and optional digital visual enhancements and digital audio enhancements where said display control system, method or process adjust the image(s) and\/or sounds based upon a command(s) provided by one or a plurality of observers.","In some examples an SVS subsystem may be provided entirely within a single local device; in some examples parts of an SVS subsystem may be distributed such that various functions are located in local and remote devices, storage, and media so that various tasks and\/or program storage, data storage, processing, memory, etc. are performed by separate devices and linked through a communication network(s).

By utilizing the RTP's wide and tall view of the Grand Canal an SVS subsystem can display varying simulated realistic window views in real-time to viewer ","In a first example said viewer has approached the LTP for a closer view of the Basilica of St. Mary of Health (Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute), a Roman Catholic church whose dome has become a landmark and emblem of Venice. In response to said change in the viewer's location an SVS sensor determines the new location of the viewer with respect to the LTP display screen , calculates  and displays  the appropriate view for said viewer's position to simulate the appropriate view through that \u201cRTP window\u201d in that location on the Grand Canal. In another example said viewer has stepped back from the LTP for a central view up the Grand Canal, and in response to said change in the viewer's location the SVS sensor determines the new location of viewer with respect to the LTP display screen , calculates  and displays  the appropriate view of the Grand Canal for said viewer's new position to simulate the appropriate view through that \u201cRTP window\u201d on the Grand Canal. Optionally, viewer may employ SVS commands by means such as a handheld remote control  that control video processing  and\/or audio processing  such as in some examples zooming in to see details, in some examples zooming out to see the big picture of the Grand Canal, in some examples audio zooming to hear specific sounds more clearly, etc.","In another example said viewer has stepped up close to the left side of the LTP for a close up view of a gondolier on Venice's Grand Canal, and in response to said change in the viewer's location the SVS sensor determines the new location of viewer with respect to the LTP display screen , calculates  and displays  the appropriate view of the gondolier and Grand Canal for said viewer's new position to simulate the appropriate view through that \u201cRTP window\u201d on the Grand Canal. Because said gondolier seems close enough, viewer calls \u201cHello\u201d to gondolier and because the local RTP on the Grand Canal is full-featured, said viewer's voice is projected from the local RTP's speaker(s). If the gondolier answers \u201cCiao\u201d in Italian in some examples an automatic translation subsystem contextually identifies participants in the United States and Italy, that the US participant spoke the English word \u201chello\u201d and the Italian participant responded in that language, and provides automatic real-time language translation as described elsewhere. In some examples US viewer may need to use a command or the handheld remote control  to start a translation subsystem, service, application, etc. If a conversation ensues between said US viewer and said gondolier, in some examples automatic audio enhancement contextually identifies the appropriate remote participant(s) which in this case is a gondolier, and determines if said gondolier's voice is below sufficient audio legibility, and if so isolates and boosts said gondolier's voice audio to increase its clarity and volume by means such as noise cancellation, equalization, dynamic volume adjustment, etc. In some examples US viewer may need to use a command or the handheld remote control  to start audio enhancement processing application, subsystem, service, etc. As a result in some examples a US viewer may talk directly to a passing gondolier on Venice's Grand Canal.","SUPERIOR VIEWER PROCESS: In some examples a device or a device SVS includes one or a plurality of viewer sensors, a viewer detecting section, an optional viewer processing section and other device components as described elsewhere, such as in some examples display output processing  in . In some examples one or a plurality of sensors may be employed individually or in combination to provide viewer detection and viewer location with respect to a device's display screen which in some examples is imaging such as by means of a camera(s), in some examples is ultrasonic, in some examples is infrared, in some examples is radar, in some examples is a plurality of audio microphones, in some examples is a plurality of pressure sensors such as in a floor, and in some examples is other detection means. In some examples each type of sensor provides its own type of data such as image data from a camera, so each corresponding processing by a viewer detecting section analyzes the data provided by each type of sensor. In some examples as image data is provided by an image sensor a face detecting section detects an object's face area, face size, face orientation, skin color, or other cues depending upon that type of sensor. Similarly, each type of sensor provides its corresponding data types such as the use of audio cues when the sensor(s) includes a plurality of microphones that determine presence and position by means of audio sounds and levels.","In some examples one object of a device's sensor is to detect certain characterizing components of objects such as the face of a person relative to a device's screen, herein generally referred to as viewer detection. In some examples said viewer detection includes detecting one or a plurality of objects, then detecting a section of said object that characterizes a portion of said object, then detecting a human face as the characterizing portion. In some examples a number of known technologies may be employed such as in some examples technologies used in digital cameras to determine the presence of faces in a picture taking region, determine the distance to the detected faces, and employ that data to set the camera's focus so that one or a plurality of faces is automatically rendered clearly and in focus when a picture is taken. In addition, other known facial analysis technologies provide various types of face data analysis such as technologies used in digital cameras that determine when a face in a picture has blinked and then display a \u201cblink error\u201d or \u201cblink warning\u201d to the picture taker so the picture can be checked and retaken if needed. In some examples other face detection technologies are known for detecting one or a plurality of viewers with respect to a display screen such as the identification and use of skin colors, identification of candidate face region areas with hierarchical verification levels, etc.","In some examples the term viewer detecting section refers to software that is run by a device's processor(s), but with alternative types of sensors and sensor data this viewer detection may be implemented by different detection software, or alternatively by a hardware circuit or system. In some examples the viewer detection software is stored in a device's local and\/or remote storage, said software is run, and the resulting processed viewer detection data such as viewer information, face size, face position, face orientation, etc. is stored in said device's memory. In some examples said device uses this processed viewer detection data in memory to adjust the device's display screen appropriately for the location(s) of one or a plurality of viewers. Said viewer detection data is retained in memory for repeated use until viewer detection is performed again, at which time newly processed viewer detection data overwrites it and is stored for use until the next viewer detection occurs.","Turning now to , \u201cSVS Process,\u201d illustrates some examples in which a device that includes an SVS (as used herein, the term SVS also includes any type of viewer sensor[s]) is turned on  and the SVS is turned on  and active . In some examples the SVS sensor is a camera or other sensor that employs light, in which case an initial step is to measure luminance  to determine if sufficient luminance is present  because if there is insufficient luminance viewer detection that is based on images will produce erroneous results. Luminance may be measured  by using image data from said SVS to determine if it possesses sufficient luminance  to perform viewer detection . If sufficient luminance is present   then viewer detection  may be performed. If sufficient luminance is not present   the process performs a luminance adjustment step  and then repeats the luminance measurement step  to determine if there is sufficient luminance . Sufficient luminance may be secured  by one or a plurality of means such as in some examples opening a camera arperture , in some examples increasing an image sensor's sensitivity  such as by raising its ISO, or by other known means (such as in some examples means that are employed in video cameras that record acceptable images at extremely low lux levels). In the event luminance adjustment  is performed and the subsequent luminance measurement  indicates sufficient luminance  is not present, then said luminance adjustment step  is repeated with increased values and\/or additional luminance sensitivity means until sufficient luminance  is obtained and viewer detection may be performed .","In some examples viewer detection  is image-based and performed by an SVS. Said image-based viewer detection  starts by detecting a moving image, capturing it by means of an image sensor and analyzing the captured image data for face detection information such as skin color, face image(s), face size, face position, etc. At step  it is determined whether one or a plurality of viewers has been detected and if no viewers are detected  then the SVS and display are auto-set for a default  viewer who is located centrally in front of the display and at a reasonable distance from it for that type of device (which may be reasonably estimated from known ergonomic data for certain types of mobile devices and certain types of stationary devices). Alternatively in some examples with a device in a fixed location, if no viewers are detected  the SVS and display may be auto set for a default  that is based upon the entrance to the room in which said device is positioned so that the entrance of a viewer will trigger the SVS and cause its display to respond dynamically as said viewer moves into and through that room. Alternatively in some examples with a mobile or fixed device, if no viewers are detected  the SVS and display may be auto-set for a default  that represents the most common viewer location from which this display has been used in the past (if that device's previous viewer location raw data is stored and analyzed, with the analyzed data stored for future uses such as determining said default display setting). In some examples if no viewers are detected  the SVS may loop in a motion detection process in which it repeatedly and periodically performs motion detection  (such as in some examples periodically capturing two or a plurality of frames of image data and performing a motion detection comparison between them).","In some examples the processing of SVS sensor data determines that one or a plurality of viewers are present  in which case the detected viewer data is stored in memory and used to perform display adjustment . In some examples other viewer engagement data may be stored in memory  such as in some examples participation in a focused connection, in some examples other uses of a device as described elsewhere. Said viewer detection data as well as other viewer engagement data is retained in memory until viewer detection is performed again, at which time newly processed viewer data overwrites it and is retained in memory until the next viewer detection is performed. Storing viewer detection data and viewer engagement data makes it possible to determine the presence of one or a plurality of viewers, along with the optional partial or full engagement of said users with the display. In some examples sufficient or appropriate sensor data  is available in memory so that an optional viewer processing section determines the viewer(s) orientation relative to the display screen . In some examples where a face(s) has been detected  the position, size and\/or orientation of said face data  may be used to determine the orientation  of one or a plurality of viewers relative to the display screen  as an indication of each viewer's partial or full attention to said display. In some examples viewer engagement  includes audio sensor data  and in some examples it includes data from other types of sensors. In some examples if one or a plurality of viewers are not engaged  the viewer processing section may loop and repeatedly and periodically perform viewer engagement processing  (such as in some examples periodically capturing a set of frames of image data and performing a face orientation comparison between them). In some examples if one or a plurality of viewers are not engaged  the display may be adjusted to its default  as described elsewhere. In some examples if one or a plurality of viewers are partly engaged  such as in some examples by talking to each other in addition to paying intermittent attention to the display ; in some examples by using other handheld devices or mobile devices or stationary devices as well as paying intermittent attention to the display ; in some examples by multitasking as well as paying intermittent attention to the display ; in some examples by any other simultaneous activity or engagement as well as paying intermittent attention to the display ; the optional viewer processing section determines that said partially engaged viewers should be treated as full viewers and included in the adjustment of the display. In some examples if one or a plurality of viewers are engaged  the viewer processing section may periodically reconfirm said engagement by looping and performing viewer engagement processing  (such as in some examples periodically capturing a set of frames of image data and performing a face orientation comparison between them).","In some examples a recognition subsystem  (as described elsewhere) is present and said image adjustment  may utilize said recognition subsystem  to determine one or a plurality of specific viewers, such as the owner or principal user of a device. In some examples recognition subsystem  may be a service such as TP biometric recognition . In some examples one or a plurality of recognizable identities may be prioritized  such as in some examples the owner of the device in use, in some examples family or friends of the owner of the device in use, in some examples a recognizable member of a designated group or category of users of said device such as a company's employees whose cubes or offices are located around a particular conference room where said device is used, in some examples any other designated identity(ies) and\/or group(s). In some examples one or a plurality of recognized identities  may be prioritized  so that said display adjustment  may be completely prioritized to reflect the presence  and\/or optional orientation(s)  of one or a plurality of said identified  and prioritized  viewers, such as by performing display adjustment  as if only the identified  and prioritized  viewer(s) were present. In some examples one or a plurality of recognized identities  may be prioritized  so that said display adjustment  may be partly prioritized to reflect the presence  and\/or optional orientation(s)  of one or a plurality of said identified  and prioritized  viewers, such as by weighting the identified  and prioritized  viewer(s) at the same higher value than a lower weighting for unidentified  and unprioritized  viewer(s). In some examples one or a plurality of recognized identities  may be prioritized  so that said display adjustment  may be differentially prioritized based on the different identities of recognized viewers  to reflect the presence  and\/or optional orientation(s)  of one or a plurality of said identified  and differentially prioritized  viewers, such as by providing different weights for each identified  and prioritized  viewer as well as providing a lower weighting for unidentified  and unprioritized  viewer(s).","In some examples viewer detection , optional viewer orientation , and\/or optional viewer engagement  determines the one or a plurality of viewers and their position(s) with respect to the display. Since a device's output automatically adjusts  based upon the position of one or a plurality of viewers, including dynamic changes in the position(s) of a viewer(s), the adjustment process is as follows and as described elsewhere. In some examples one viewer is detected     and the position of said viewer is determined with respect to the display, and in some examples the processor determines metrics for said user such as the viewer's angle from the center of the display in some examples, the viewer's distance from the center of the display in some examples, or other alignment metrics in some examples; and said position metrics are used to determine how the display should be adjusted  to serve that viewer; and in some examples processing provides a corresponding positioning for the \u201cwindow\u201d output  in  that simulates the view that is seen through a real window. In some examples a plurality of viewers is detected     and the positions of said viewers are determined with respect to the display, and in some examples the display is adjusted  based on a median or average viewing position of the collection of viewers that are recognized; that is, the metrics for each user are determined individually, then the set of two or more viewers'positions are determined with respect to the display screen, and the processing provides the average or best corresponding positioning for the window output  that simulates the view seen through a real window.","In some examples after detecting one or a plurality of viewers     and adjusting said output display  there is a change in the position of one or a plurality of viewers; and in some examples after detecting one or a plurality of viewers     and adjusting said output display  there is a change in the number of viewers who are partially or fully engaged  with the display; either individually or in combination various changes serve as a trigger(s) to perform viewer detection  and repeat the appropriate steps that update the viewer data in memory so that processing may determine the corresponding adjustments of the display  that synchronize its displayed \u201cwindow\u201d with the new location(s) and\/or new collection of one or a plurality of recognized viewers. In some examples after detecting one or a plurality of recognized viewers     said viewers are automatically tracked by a SVS so that changes in their position(s), the addition of a new viewer(s), and\/or the exiting of a recognized viewer(s) triggers viewer detection  and an appropriate corresponding updating of the displayed \u201cwindow\u201d . In some examples after detecting one or a plurality of recognized viewers     a subset of said viewers' behaviors, cues, or task indicators are tracked by a SVS so that changes in said tracked cues, behaviors, task indicators, etc. trigger viewer detection  and corresponding updating of the \u201cwindow\u201d displayed .","In some examples one or a plurality of settings that control the frequency, timing, smoothness, transitions, and other attributes of said display adjustments  may optionally be set and saved . In some examples this provides for different types of devices to employ display adjustments  such as for example when a device has insufficient processing or bandwidth for smooth real-time display adjustments it may utilize settings for periodic adjustments with a specified type of transition such as a jump cut or page turn from one display view to the next display view. In some examples when said attributes are stored , then retrieve and apply said attributes  at the start of said displays  and continue applying said attributes  to subsequent display adjustments  until said attributes are edited and the updated settings are saved and stored .","Because the resulting display  is digital, in some examples a viewer may choose to utilize various SVS commands  that alter the display   in one or a plurality of ways. A range of commands, subsystems, services, applications, tools, resources, etc. may be used to implement those digital capabilities   including any known technology or service. Without limiting these digital capabilities some examples include in some examples zooming in or out   ; in some examples changing the display's view   ; in some examples taking a static snapshot of a display   ; in some examples performing various types of analysis on live video or on a static image or snapshot   ; in some examples identifying an identity or object in a display   ; in some examples retrieving information about an identified identity, object, etc.   ; in some examples enhancing audio so that remote conversations, sounds, etc. are heard clearly   ; in some examples making visible or surreptitious recordings   ; in some examples altering and\/or editing the display, its participants, location or content in real-time   ; in some examples substituting an edited display as source output with or without informing other participants   ; in some examples recording an edited display as if it were a source event with or without adding information that an altered display was recorded   ; or in some examples performing other real-time digital manipulations. In some examples SVS commands may be entered   by voice and one or a plurality of wired and\/or wireless microphones; in some examples SVS commands may be entered   by gestures; in some examples SVS commands may be entered   by a handheld remote control; in some examples SVS commands may be entered   by a touchscreen; in some examples SVS commands may be entered   by visible on-screen controls; in some examples SVS commands may be entered   by pointing devices; in some examples SVS commands may be entered   by many systems; in some examples SVS commands may be entered   by any known type of software or hardware control or controller. In some examples of commands entered  such as in some examples \u201cright\u201d , in some examples \u201cleft\u201d , in some examples \u201cdown\u201d , in some examples \u201cup\u201d , in some examples \u201czoom in\u201d , in some examples \u201czoom out\u201d , in some examples \u201crecognize identity(ies)\u201d , in some examples \u201cretrieve (identity name's) data\u201d , in some examples \u201cmake (identity name) invisible\u201d , in some examples \u201ctrack (identity name)\u201d , in some examples \u201cstart (or pause or stop) recording\u201d , or any other available command   device processing provides the appropriate command(s) and\/or processing steps to the appropriate display output(s)  or to the appropriate digital processing application(s)  in some examples to move the image(s) displayed the appropriate amount , in some examples to carry out the corresponding digital image processing functions , in some examples to utilize local device and\/or remote resources to perform said commands .","In some examples commands entered  may be to set , edit  and\/or save  attributes of the SVS subsystem such as in some examples the sensitivity of luminance measurement  and\/or luminance adjustment(s)   (if an SVS sensor incorporates light); in some examples settings for viewer detection features ; in some examples selecting from a set of default(s)  when viewers are not detected ; in some examples motion detection parameters  when viewers are detected  or in some examples when viewers are not detected ; in some examples the complete use, weighted use or non-use of a recognition subsystem   if a recognition subsystem is present; in some examples the timing of a display's responses to facial orientation changes  to permit a viewer to have intermittent facial orientation toward other people or tasks before the display is changed; in some examples the timing for adjusting the display  such as in some examples smooth real-time scrolling , in some examples threshold-based jump cuts , in some examples wipes , in some examples scrolling , in some examples other types of transitions between display adjustments ; in some examples the various attributes of each display command  ; in some examples automatic device operation    when use is ending; in some examples any other SVS display or digital command setting(s) that may be saved and retrieved for use in the future. In some examples said saved setting(s)   are retrieved and applied to the operation of each subsystem feature and capability to which each setting applies.","In some examples when the use of a device with an SVS subsystem ends  if the device remains on and is not turned off then after a defined period of non-use  the device is timed out and set to a default such as in some examples a blank display screen , in some examples a standby state , in some examples everything powered down except motion detection and corresponding processing for detected motions  that trigger a device \u201cwake up\u201d process if sufficient motion is detected  with a resulting re-start of the SVS process . In some examples of ending use  a device is turned off , in some examples the device is powered down , in some examples the device is taken off line , in some examples the device is put into another non-use state or mode  with a resulting re-start  when said device is turned on  and its SVS is on and operating . In some examples device use continues   and use is not interrupted.","Superior viewer field of view changes: In some examples an SVS determines the image(s) displayed by determining the location(s) of one or a plurality of viewers in relation to a display screen, and utilizing the viewer(s)'s angle and\/or distance to adjust the image(s) displayed, stimulating a view through a real window to said viewer(s). In some examples said simulated view on said display screen is dynamically updated to reflect the changing location(s) of one or a plurality of viewers in relation to said display screen by means of one or a plurality of SVS sensors as described elsewhere. In some examples the image(s) received for display are from one or a plurality of remote lenses with a wide enough angle and high enough resolution so that the portion of said received image(s) that is displayed may be adjusted rapidly, smoothly and in real-time to respond directly and quickly to the changing location(s) of said viewer(s). In some examples this process is utilized with stored pre-recorded images whether they are from natural sources such as the real world, from pre-recorded entertainment programs, from synthesized and blended realities such as described elsewhere, or from other stored sources. Alternatively, in some examples said received images may be from one or a plurality of remotely located cameras that have remotely controlled motorized camera functions such as panning, filtering, zooming, etc. and whose images are displayed directly on the display screen; in some examples changes in the location(s) of one or a plurality of viewers with respect to the display screen causes appropriate corresponding commands to be sent to said remotely controlled cameras to adjust their individual remote camera view(s) by panning, tilting, zooming, etc. to provide said simulated view(s) through a real window on said display screen. Alternatively, in some examples said received image(s) may be received from any AID\/AID (as described elsewhere) and\/or any TP device (as described elsewhere) with a camera function and communication capability for live viewing, and\/or with a camera function and storage capability for viewing stored images.","Turning now to , \u201cSVS Changing Field of View Due to Viewer Horizontal Location(s),\u201d in some examples the received image A is larger than the viewing area of a display screen A that in some examples is mounted on a wall A. In some examples an SVS sensor determines the location of a viewer A as described elsewhere. For located viewer A, a horizontal portion A of said received image A is displayed in said display screen's viewing area A as determined by a viewer's angle A between an imaginary line A that is perpendicular to the display screen's center A and an imaginary line between said viewer A and the center of the display screen A. In some examples a plurality of viewers is detected and the location of each viewer with respect to the display screen A is determined by said SVS subsystem as described elsewhere; in some examples for each viewer A that viewer's angle A is determined based on an imaginary line between said viewer A and the center of the display screen A, and in some examples the displayed portion A of the image received A is selected based on a median or average viewing angles of the collection of viewers that are detected and located; that is, the angle A for each viewer A is determined individually, then the set of viewers' angles are determined with respect to the display screen, and known processing means provides the average or best corresponding positioning for the simulated window displayed A that simulates the view seen through a real window from that average or median viewing location. In some examples a plurality of viewers is detected and a recognition subsystem is present and employed to determine the identity of said detected viewers; in some examples a subset of detected viewers is selected based upon identity recognition, with varying preset prioritization or weighting based upon the identity of each recognized viewer (such as the highest priority for the owner of the device in use); and therefore in some examples the simulated window position A that is displayed A provides a more realistic simulated window view for one or a plurality of recognized and prioritized detected viewers.","In some examples a viewer A moves C with respect to the display screen A B, with a change such as from location A to location B with respect to said display screen. Since received image B is larger than the viewing area of the display screen B that in some examples is mounted on a wall B, in some examples an SVS sensor determines the new location of the viewer B as described elsewhere. For located viewer B, a responsively adjusted horizontal portion B of said received image B is displayed in said display screen's viewing area B as determined by said viewer's new angle B between an imaginary line B that is perpendicular to the display screen's center B and an imaginary line between said viewer B and the center of the display screen B. In some examples a subsystem employs means (as described elsewhere) to determine the location of one or a plurality of viewers based on their individual angle(s) with respect to said display screen; and in some examples said subsystem employs known processing means to calculate and select the appropriate image(s) A B for each respective viewer location A B as well as the (optional) dynamic transition(s) as said viewer moves C between locations, in order to simulate a real window's view for the one or a plurality of viewers.","In some examples a viewer starts in position B with angle B with respect to an imaginary line B that is perpendicular to the center B of the plane of the display screen B, which is on the right side of said display, so the portion of received image B determined by processing is the left side of received image B, which is a centered on the Basilica of St. Mary of Health (Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute) B on Venice's Grand Canal. If said viewer keeps a constant distance from said display screen but moves his or her location to the left side of said display with angle A with respect to an imaginary line A that is perpendicular to the center A of the plane of the display screen A, processing would adjust the display to correspond to said viewer's new position A and show the right portion A of received image A.","In some examples said display screen alteration A B in response to said viewer's location change A B with respect to a display screen A B, as well as additional SVS digital display functions as described elsewhere, may be provided by an application designed for use with one or a plurality of display devices that utilize an appropriate viewer sensor and processing means to adjust the image(s) displayed in order to simulate a dynamic window view to one or a plurality of viewers; with said application stored as code on either local storage, remote storage for both; with said application available as a computer program product, a downloadable application, a network service, or in another format. Said application consisting of means for receiving and displaying one or a plurality of images; means for determining the location(s) of one or a plurality of viewers with respect to said display; means for calculating and displaying an appropriate portion of said received image(s) based on angle and\/or distance of one or a plurality of viewers from said display; and means for outputting the appropriate portion(s) of said received image(s) on said display screen in order to simulate a dynamic view through a live window for one or a plurality of viewers.","Turning now to , \u201cSVS Changing Field of View Due to Viewer Distance from Screen,\u201d in some examples received image A is larger than the viewing area of a display screen A that in some examples is mounted on a wall A. In some examples an SVS sensor determines the location of a viewer A as described elsewhere, wherein said viewer location comprises the distance A between said viewer A and the center of said display screen A; and based on said distance A displays a portion A of said received image A.","In some examples of plurality of viewers is detected and the distance A of each viewer from the center of said display screen A is determined by said SVS subsystem as described elsewhere; in some examples for each viewer A that viewer's distance A from the center of said screen, and in some examples the displayed portion A of the image received A is selected based upon a median or average viewing distance of the collection of viewers that are detected and located; that is, the distance A for each viewer A is determined individually, then the set of viewers' distances are determined with respect to the display screen, and known processing means provides the average or best corresponding simulated window displayed A that simulates the view seen through a real window from that average or median viewing location.

Since received image B is larger than the viewing area of the display screen B that in some examples is mounted on a wall B, in some examples and SVS sensor determines the new location of the viewer B as described elsewhere. For located viewer B, a responsively adjusted portion B of said received image B is displayed in said display screen's viewing area B as determined by said viewer's new distance B from the center of said display screen B. In some examples a subsystem employs means (as described elsewhere) to determine the distance of one or a plurality of viewers based upon their individual distance(s) with respect to the center of said display screen; and in some examples said subsystem employs known processing means to calculate and select the appropriate image(s) A B for each respective viewer location A B as well as the (optional) dynamic transition(s) as said viewer moves C between locations, in order to simulate a real window's view for the one or a plurality of viewers.","In some examples the distance B of viewer B from the center of said display screen B corresponds to the distance and lens size at which said received image B is acquired, so that the image received B may be displayed directly on the display screen B; in an example close to that the distance B of B from the center of said display screen B is only slightly different from the distance and lens size at which said received image B is generated, so that the image received B may be adjusted only slightly B before being displayed on the display screen B.","In some examples the distance of viewer B changes such as to the distance of viewer A in which said new distance A increases by distance C, so that the process and adjusted displayed image A is zoomed in and magnified on said display screen to simulate a real window's view at new distance A.

In the ARTPM \u201cdigital reality\u201d works in a parallel way to \u201cphysical reality\u201d\u2014the user's digital reality is continuous and present, but this is produced electronically so that digital reality is automatically visible, usable and ready. In some examples users do not need to take the steps required by current electronic devices and digital communications, where each device must be turned on and off (like booting a PC, then loading video conferencing software and using it to select someone to call, then using it to make a video phone call); and each current electronic device's connection must be made separately (like making a mobile phone call or starting and setting up a video conference); and in our current digital electronic devices when most \u201cuses\u201d are ended a device's use is finished and that feature must be closed or the device must be turned off, like running shutdown on a PC, using a remote to turn the power off on a television, or hanging up a phone call.","Automated On\/Off\/On\/Off Devices: Many consumer electronic devices attempt to simplify turning devices on and off somewhat by adding immediate on\/off, which is often achieved by means of a power-down state where a device's most recent operation(s) is suspended and saved (such as a home theater's settings when that system includes multiple linked devices), ready to be resumed in that state when power is restored. For example, a major PC annoyance is being forced to wait while the PC boots up (e.g., turns on) and then wait again when the PC shuts down (e.g., turns off). After 30 years of PC development, it has been said that the large revenues from selling PC operating systems forces users to see and use (and endure the frustrations of) a PC operating system\u2014a component every other consumer electronic device has embedded and made invisible (at far lower revenues than the PC's operating system vendor receives).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0816","num":"0815"},"figref":"FIG. 49"},"Turning now to , \u201cContinuous Digital Reality Subsystem\/Service (Automated On-Off Subsystem),\u201d in some examples an LTP  may include continuous digital reality\/automated on-off as one or a plurality of subsystems; in some examples an MTP  may include continuous digital reality\/automated on-off as one or a plurality of subsystems; in some examples an RTP  may include continuous digital reality\/automated on-off as one or a plurality of subsystems; in some examples an AID\/AOD  that is running a VTP may include continuous digital reality\/automated on-off as one or a plurality of subsystems, in some examples a TP subsidiary device  that is running RCTP may include continuous digital reality\/automated on-off as one or a plurality of subsystems, in some examples another type of electronic device(s) that are enabled with an in-use detector   (such as in some examples an SVS, in some examples a motion detector, and in some examples another type of in-use detector) may include continuous digital reality and\/or automated on-off as one or a plurality of subsystems; and in some examples another type of electronic device that is enabled with an in-use detector and user recognition (for more secure on\/off) may include continuous digital reality and\/or automated on-off as one or a plurality of subsystems.

In some examples of an automated language recognition process , each Participant's identity is known (such as in some examples if they are members of an SPLS, in some examples if they are employees of a Corporation and logged into a corporate network, and in some examples by other identification means); in such a case the language recognition process  may (optionally) determine the identity of a new Participant     , retrieve said identity's directory entry, user profile data or other identity data; and in some examples utilize a \u201cnative language\u201d attribute in said Participant's retrievable data to determine at least one of each Participant's fluently spoken language(s) . In some examples of an automated language recognition process , each Participant's identity is known (as described elsewhere) but one or a plurality of Participants does not have a retrievable \u201cnative language\u201d data attribute; in such a case the language recognition process  may (optionally) determine a likely fluent spoken language language for said new known Participant by utilizing retrievable identity data such as in some examples a current home address, in some examples a current business or work address, in some examples a current telephone country code and\/or area code, in some examples GPS data such as provided by a cellular telephone, in some examples of GPS data such as provided by another type of device, and in some examples other retrievable location indicating data to determine at least one of each Participant's fluently spoken language(s)  in that geographic region.","In some examples of an automated language recognition process, as Participant   and Participant   communicate directly, an automated language recognition process  would recognize that Participant  speaks English  and Participant  also speaks English , in which case all the Participants speak the same language and said language recognition process  would not initiate language translation ; in addition, said automated language recognition process  would not perform another language recognition  until a Participant enters  or exits  said communication  .","In some examples of an automated language recognition process, as Participant   and Participant   communicate directly, Spanish-speaking Participant   is present from the beginning of a communication   , and in some examples Spanish-speaking Participant   joins a single language (English) communication after it has begun; in either case an automated language recognition process  recognizes that Participant  speaks English  and Participant  also speaks English  but Participant   speaks Spanish; in which case said automated language recognition process  would map the input and output language(s) of each Participant and initiate language translation ; as a result, Participant 's  spoken and\/or written communications would be translated into English by a translation subsystem  before being received by Participant   and Participant  ; in parallel, it would initiate language translation  such that Participant 's  and Participant 's  spoken and\/or written communications would be translated into Spanish by a translation subsystem  before being received by Participant  ; in addition, said automated language recognition process  would not perform another language recognition  until a Participant enters  or exits  said communication   .","In some examples of an automated language recognition process, as Participant   and Participant   and Participant   communicate directly, French-speaking Participant   is present from the beginning of a communication    , and in some examples French-speaking Participant   joins a two-language (English and Spanish) three-party communication after it has begun; in either case an automated language recognition process  recognizes that English is spoken by Participants   and , Spanish is spoken by Participant  , and French is spoken by Participant  ; in which case said language recognition process  would initiate language translation  such that Participant 's  spoken Spanish communications and\/or written Spanish communications would be translated into English for Participants   and  , and into French for Participant  , by a translation subsystem  before being received by Participants   and   and  ; in parallel, it would initiate language translation  such that Participant 's  spoken French communications and\/or written French communications would be translated into English for Participants   and  , and into Spanish for Participant  , by a translation subsystem  before being received by Participants   and   and  ; in parallel, it would initiate language translation  such that Participants 's  and 's  spoken English communications and\/or written English communications would be translated into Spanish for Participant  , and into French for Participant  , by a translation subsystem  before being received by Participant   and by Participant  ; in addition, said automated language recognition process  would not perform another language recognition  until a Participant enters  or exits  said communication   .","In another example, an automated language recognition process  would adjust the translation mapping  as Participants  through N      enter  or exit  communication in order to provide parallel and simultaneous translation(s)  for each of the Participants in said communication. In some examples entering  a communication may mean an appropriate translation indication as described elsewhere. In some examples exiting  may mean leaving a communication  , and in some examples exiting  may mean temporarily suspending a communication (including in some examples exiting a room, in some examples putting a portable communication device away, in some examples logging out as an identity, in some examples a manual suspend command, in some examples other actions that indicate that a device is no longer in use such as by that device entering a suspended state, or in some examples other temporary suspend use indicators as described elsewhere).","In some examples known means are used to store, retrieve and process the respective language designation of each of the Participants in a communication; in some examples known means are used to transmit to each calling device in a communication one or a plurality of Participants' language designation(s) such that said designation(s) may be stored, retrieved and used to process the respective translation(s) required to receive each Participant's spoken and\/or text communications; in some examples known means are used to transmit to each calling device in a communication one or a plurality of Participants' language designation(s) such that said designation(s) may be stored, retrieved and used to process the respective translation(s) required to transmit that Participant's spoken and\/or text communications. In some examples known means are used to transmit to each calling device in a communication one or a plurality of Participants' language designation(s) such that each device may provide appropriate and separate language processing when various components are distributed to the respective devices (such as spoken translation and\/or text translation).","In some examples known means are used to transmit to each calling device in a communication one or a plurality of Participants' language designation(s) such that said designation(s) may be manually modified or controlled by each Participant in a communication. In some examples a calling device(s) and a called device(s) are in one or a plurality of different communication systems and known means are used to transmit the one or a plurality of Participants' language designation(s) according to the call signaling of each respective communication system.","In some examples of networked communications a translation function  is dynamically inserted in a communication for translating spoken and\/or text communications that are directed to a Participant into a language in which that Participant is fluent. In some examples communications are direct between devices but by means of a language recognition function in one or a plurality of said communicating devices , a translation service(s)  may be automatically or manually inserted in said direct communications (as described elsewhere). In some examples each Participant's device     , each language recognition component , and each translator  (whether a translation subsystem, a translation service, a translation module, a translation application, or another known translation means) may use the same local or distributed set of language translation components, or alternatively may use a different set of local or distributed language translation components, in order to effect real-time translation or near real-time translation; with the distribution of various functional components not limiting the implementation of language recognition  and\/or language translation .","In some examples a plurality of language translations  are performed in parallel so that a plurality of Participants in a communication, who are each fluent in a different language may simultaneously receive each spoken and\/or text communication in their respective and different languages; which may be effected in some examples by parallel processing, in some examples by multiple sound cards, in some examples by multiple processors, in some examples by software controlled switching techniques, in some examples by multiple translation subsystems, in some examples by multiple translation services, and in some examples by other known means. In some examples spoken translation includes any form of speech, conversation, verbal presentation, voicemail, voice messages, voice commands, one or a plurality of data packets that encapsulate a voice signal, or other types of verbal communications. In some examples text translation includes any form of non-spoken content such as IM (Instant Messaging), chat, e-mail messages, fax (facsimile), SMS, an electronic file (such as an e-mail attachment), and electronic language file (such as for sign language or Braille), or other types of text-based messages and\/or non-spoken content. In some examples a translated language(s) includes one or a plurality of Participants utilizing a dialect such as in some examples a non-standard variety of a language that is used by one ethnic or regional group of a language's speakers, in some examples a non-standard variety of a language that is used by a social class within a society, in some examples the heavy use of non-standard words such as slang, or in some examples another type of non-standard variety of a language. In some examples a translated language(s) includes one or a plurality of Participants utilizing a non-spoken language such as in some examples encoded sign language, in some examples Braille, and in some examples another type of non-spoken language.","In some examples said language translation  is performed by known means: In some examples language translation  includes separate translators such as in some examples at least one translator for spoken language, in some examples at least one translator for text language, in some examples at least one translator for dialects, and in some examples at least one translator for non-spoken languages. In some examples language translation  produces translated output in a second language that is derived from speech input in a first language, by means of said speech input signal converted into a digital format with a voice model that includes a content component and a speech pattern component, whereby the content component is translated from the first language into the second language, and an audible output signal is generated that comprises the translated content with an approximation of the speech input signal's speech pattern. In some examples language translation  comprises distributed components that include a real-time translator that has a microphone (or another voice receiver) at a calling device, a converter that converts voice to text, a text-to-text translator that receives the input of a first language and translates it to a selected second language, a converter that converts text to voice for producing audible output of said translation in a second language, and a speaker (or another voice emitter) for playing the voice output at a called device, with said conversion components and translation components distributed so as to effect the translation process. In some examples language translation  may be resident at one or a plurality of host computers, or at one or a plurality of networked data centers, where each language input from a Participant is speech that is processed by speech recognition, translated into one or a plurality of output languages, and said translation is processed by speech generation before each appropriate translated and generated second language speech is transmitted to each appropriate second language-speaking Participant, where it is played or recited by the called device. In some examples language translation  may include components such as speech conversion, language conversion, language translation, transcription, speech generation, language generation, a language translation user interface, and\/or one or a plurality of language databases. In some examples language translation  includes speech recognition based on a combination of attributes such as semantics and syntax to map received speech to machine-readable intermediate data that indicates words and\/or sounds in a first language (such as English) from a first Participant, whereby said indicated words may be translated into a second language (such as Spanish) for a second Participant that correspond to the sounds and words in the first language, and then generates a translated audio voice signal in the second language that is audibly played for the second Participant in real time (or in near real time). In some examples language translation  receives live speech, converts the speech to text, translates the text into one or a plurality of different languages of the Participants, and then in some examples transfers a translated text to each second language Participant in that Participant's language, or in some examples utilizes said translated text to generate and transmit synthesized speech in each second language Participant's fluent language in such a case either one or both text and\/or generated speech may be provided. In some examples language translation  includes recognizing phrases and sentences (rather than only words) in a naturally spoken first language to determine some expressions and\/or meanings that are used to determine recognition hypotheses from general language models of the source language; when source expressions are determined they may be translated into similar expressions in a second language so that the speaker's intended meaning(s) may be more accurately provided in the second language translation. In some examples language translation  receives speech signal in a first language from a first Participant, converts it to text, translates that text into a second language, and displays that translated second language as closed captioned text overlaid on the visual image of the first Participant speaking the untranslated speech. In some examples language translation  may use any translation software, system, method, process, service or other known means to effect the required translation(s).","In some examples speech synthesis may correspond to and reflect the vocal and audio characteristics of the respective Participants in a communication. In some examples language translation  may include a known profile of one or a plurality of Participants so that speech synthesis may automatically select an audible voice that reflects each speaking Participant's gender, age, weight, etc. In some examples language translation  may include voice analysis of one or a plurality of Participants so that speech synthesis may automatically select an audible voice that corresponds to the speaker's voice tone and quality, so that said voice selection approximates as best as possible the sound of the voice of each Participant.","In some examples speech synthesis may correspond to and reflect the visual characteristics of the respective Participants in a communication. In some examples language translation  displays and speaks a completed translation in a second language by means of a visual animated display such as an animated character image (that in some examples corresponds to a speaking Participant's age, sex and\/or weight; wherein the animated character's mouth moves appropriately when speaking the words and sounds in the second language's translation; in addition, in some examples other facial features may also be animated to display facial characteristics that relate to the speaker's speech pattern such as inflection or tone. In some examples such an animation may accurately reflect at least some of the real first Participant's real facial appearance, real mouth movements, and\/or other real facial expressions whereby some of their movements may be correlated when speaking the translation to the inflections that the first Participant used to say specific words or phrases while speaking the source statement in the first language (in other words, a dynamic near real-time animation may include a likeness or appearance of the first speaker).","In some examples language translation  may include a transcription component that produces a saved transcript in one or a plurality of languages, with said saved transcripts archived such that each transcript in each language is searchable, retrievable in whole or in part, downloadable, automatically e-mailed, or otherwise accessible to one or a plurality of Participants, or to others who may be interested in a particular communication; and in addition, said transcription component may be configurable by a user interface or by commands to display the communication's transcript on one or more networked devices while a communication occurs. In some examples said transcription component of language translation  may be available when translation is not utilized such as during a communication that is only between English speaking Participants  , and said transcription component may be utilized to produce a saved transcript in the Participants' language, with said saved transcript archived such that it is searchable, retrievable in whole or in part, downloadable, automatically e-mailed, or otherwise accessible to one or a plurality of Participants, or to others who may be interested in a particular communication; and in addition, said transcription component may be configurable by a user interface or by commands to display the communication's transcript on one or more networked devices while a communication occurs.","SPEECH RECOGNITION: , \u201cSpeech Recognition Interactions\u201d illustrates speech recognition, which is one of a plurality of ARTPM user I\/O capabilities (as described elsewhere), that in some examples converts spoken words to text, in some examples converts spoken words to device instructions or commands, in some examples provide text input, and in some examples includes two-way interactions with a device that employs speech synthesis to produce responses. In some examples an LTP, MTP, RTP, AID\/AOD that is running a VTP, a TP subsidiary device run by RCTP, networked systems, or another type of electronic device may include speech recognition. In some examples a device has a microphone, an audio speaker and a speech recognition and speech synthesis system, and in some examples a device has a microphone, an audio speaker and networked communications that can transmit voice data for networked speech recognition and speech synthesis processing. In some examples users start speech recognition by a verbal indication, in some examples by a physical indication means, in some examples by a software indication means, and in some examples by another type of indication. In some examples speech services processing is performed by a speech recognition system in the local device, and in some examples speech services processing is performed by networked speech recognition processing with two-way communications. In some examples a spoken instruction are matched with a speech recognition vocabulary, which in some examples is contextual and appropriate to when a user utilizes a device to perform different types of operations. In some examples speech recognition is performed by one or a plurality of known speech recognition means, methods, processes, or systems. In some examples speech recognition fails; in some examples a speech recognition engine may attempt to determine the cause of the failure and provide audio, visual and\/or other means to correct it. In some examples a visual and\/or audio indication is provided by one or a plurality of means that speech recognition succeeded. In some examples after speech recognition succeeds a recognized instruction(s) is matched with the corresponding device command(s) which are utilized to perform the instruction(s) and show the result.

In some examples an LTP  may include speech recognition ; in some examples an MTP  may include speech recognition ; in some examples an RTP  may include speech recognition ; in some examples an AID\/AOD that is running a VTP  may include speech recognition ; in some examples a TP subsidiary device  (as described elsewhere) that is running RCTP may include speech recognition ; in some examples one or a plurality of networked systems  (such as in some examples a server , in some examples an application , in some examples a database ; in some examples a service , in some examples a module within an application that utilizes an API to access a server or service , or in some examples another network means ); in some examples another type of electronic device such as in some examples an AKM device  (as described elsewhere) may include speech recognition ; in some examples another type of networked electronic device  may include speech recognition , or in some examples speech recognition may be provided for a networked electronic device  (such as in some examples an AKM device ) by a network subsystem , a network service , or by other remote means over a network  such as an application, a speech recognition server, etc.","In some examples speech recognition  may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment that is located in one or a plurality of locations and provided by one or a plurality of vendors, in some examples an entirely software embodiment that is located in one or a plurality of locations and provided by one or a plurality of vendors, or in some examples a combination of hardware and software that is located in one or a plurality of locations and provided by one or a plurality of vendors. In some examples speech recognition  may take the form of a computer program product (e.g., an unmodifiable or customizable computer software product) on a computer-readable storage medium; and in some examples speech recognition may take the form of a web-implemented software product, module, component, and\/or service (including a Web service accessible by means of an API for utilization by other applications and\/or services, such as in some examples communication services). In some examples said devices, hardware, software, systems, services, applications, etc.  are connected by one or a plurality of disparate networks ; in some examples parts of said speech recognition  may be distributed such that various functions are located in local and\/or remote devices, storage, and media so that various steps are performed separately and link through said network(s) ; in some examples the equivalent of said speech recognition  may be provided by means other than exemplified herein and provided over said network(s) .","In some examples speech recognition  begins when a speaker interacts verbally with a device that has a microphone, an audio speaker and a speech recognition system ; and in some examples speech recognition  begins when a speaker interacts verbally with a device that has a microphone, an audio speaker and networked communications that can transmit voice data   for networked speech recognition processing. In some examples to start speech recognition a user speaks an appropriate command word that initiates speech recognition followed by a task instruction, such as in some examples \u201c(device name) (command) (object)\u201d such as \u201cTeleportal focus the connection with Jane,\u201d which in some examples instructs a device (a Teleportal) to perform an action (from a currently open SPLS, focus the current live connection with the SPLS member named Jane). In some examples a command word is not needed and instead one or a plurality of speech recognition indications are provided such as in some examples by using a pointing device to highlight an indicator such as a speech recognition icon, in some examples by a gesture, in some examples by a predefined type of touch on a screen or icon or button, in some examples by a predefined button or touch on a remote control, in some examples by a predefined physical indicator such as by means of a user I\/O device, in some examples by means of a predefined software indicator such as a user interface element, and in some examples by another indication means.","In some examples speech services processing    is performed by a speech recognition system in the local device ; and in some examples speech services processing    is performed by networked speech recognition processing with two-way voice communications  . In some examples a spoken command word and instruction are matched with a speech recognition vocabulary which in some examples is stored in a local device  , in some examples is stored by networked speech recognition processing   , and in some examples is stored by a combination of a local device   (for a shorter response time) and networked speech recognition processing    (for a broader range of speech recognition capabilities, algorithms and vocabularies).","In some examples to increase recognition accuracy and speed, speech services processing  is contextual  such as when a user utilizes a device to perform different types of operations. In some examples based on a setting or use of an element in the user interface, the selection of an operation causes the display of a set of contextually appropriate commands  and instructions  in a proximate location to the portion of a display where that selected operation is located; and in some examples said list of contextually appropriate commands  and instructions  dynamically adapts to the user's words while issuing a command so that both valid and likely speech recognition instructions options are presented at all times. In one illustration of one type of operation such as a focused communication , certain commands are more likely and may be displayed for verbal use and more accurate recognition  such as in some examples \u201cTeleportal increase volume,\u201d \u201cTeleportal change background to [say location, like \u2018the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.\u2019],\u201d \u201cTeleportal start recording,\u201d \u201cTeleportal end focused connection,\u201d etc.). In a second illustration of a second type of operation such as constructing a digital reality , different commands are more likely and may be dynamically adapted to the current stage of a task for greater relevance and recognition  such as in some examples \u201cTeleportal display RTP views of Times Square,\u201d \u201cTeleportal select aerial view ,\u201d \u201cTeleportal change all advertising displays [name a product such as Coca-Cola or a person such as your sister],\u201d \u201cTeleportal broadcast this digital reality with the name \u2018It's Jane's day in Times Square\u2019],\u201d etc.). In a third illustration of a third type of operation such as editing a boundary Paywall , different commands are more likely and may be dynamically displayed based upon previous types of Paywall edits which that user has performed for greater personalization and recognition  such as in some examples \u201cTeleportal list brands blocked from this identity's digital realities,\u201d \u201cTeleportal add Kellogg's to the list of blocked brands,\u201d \u201cTeleportal respond to Kellogg's ads and product images with my usual Paywall payment offer,\u201d etc.). In a fourth illustration a Context Free Grammar (herein CFG) may be employed to limit the vocabulary and syntax to a narrow set that fits numerous application states such as start, stop, focus, end focus, record, stop recording, add background, change background, remove background, etc.","In some examples after each command and instruction speech recognition is performed  by matching the instruction against that context  and that context's vocabulary ; in some examples by matching each instruction against a controlled vocabulary  (including \u201cfuzzy\u201d matching in some examples); in some examples by transforming digital audio into an acoustic representation, extracting phonemes, applying a \u201cgrammar\u201d to determine which phonemes were spoken, and to convert phonemes into words ; in some examples by using a hidden Markov model ; in some examples by permitting continuous dictation in certain instances such as to transcribe text input into a field or a text zone ; in some examples by permitting the recognition of continuous speech under any and all conditions ; and in some examples by utilizing another process by which a device and\/or local or remote system utilize speech as a means of issuing commands, entering data input, or converting speech to text .","In some examples a visual or audio indication is provided that recognition succeeded  which in some examples may be by performing the instruction , visibly showing the result  and awaiting the next instruction ; in some examples an indication may be showing a success icon or image known to the local culture such as a green check mark ; in some examples an indication may be synthesizing and \u201cvoicing\u201d a verbal reply such as \u201cDone. Say undo, or what to do next\u201d ; in some examples by highlighting the instruction that was just performed such as a background that was replaced ; in some examples by another type of indication ; and in some examples by a combination of two or more types of indications  such as in some examples showing the result, highlighting it and displaying a green check mark next to it .","In some examples speech recognition fails  such as in some examples because the speaker's word(s), language or accent were not understood ; in some examples a controlled vocabulary did not include the speaker's words ; or for another reason that an instance of speech recognition might fail . At the occurrence of a failure  this speech recognition engine attempts to determine the cause of the failure  and in some examples select a clarifying request  or question ; in some examples generate a clarifying question or request ; in some examples select a short list of the most likely valid instructions ; or in some examples utilize a different type of prompt or corrective action. Said request  or question  is synthesized as speech  and transmitted as a response to be played by the audio speaker(s) of the user's device , so that the user may attempt to respond appropriately  and speech services processing  may re-attempt speech recognition  of said user's reply. Alternatively, the list of the speech engine's best guess of valid instructions  may be transmitted  and displayed  for the user to select and say one of the instructions , or for the user to construct a different instruction that resembles the examples displayed , and speech services processing  may re-attempt speech recognition  of said user's reply. Alternatively, in some examples optimizations  may (optionally) be performed as described in .","In some examples after speech recognition succeeds   the recognized instruction(s)  is matched with the appropriate device command(s)  and are utilized to perform the instruction  and show the result . In effect, device performance  is directed by spoken interactions  with repeated indications of success  and the results produced  when speech succeeds, and recovery actions   when it fails. In addition, in some examples clear and visible guidance such as contextually valid and appropriate instructions may be displayed as a default setting or as a recovery action at any time guidance is desired or helpful. In some examples visible, appropriate and sequenced speech instructions guidance may be set to display whenever a user starts an unfamiliar task such as in some examples constructing a new digital reality, in some examples setting one or a plurality of boundaries that control what is included and what is it excluded from an identity's digital realities, in some examples copying an entire set of personal boundaries that have been proven to produce high revenues for their users, or in some examples starting another type of unfamiliar task. In some examples these sequenced speech instructions may be downloaded to a device as needed from an AKM (as described elsewhere) when a user starts an unfamiliar task. Therefore, in some examples a device such as a Teleportal may offer a wide range of capabilities to a novice user, but simultaneously provide means to enable potential performance success when attempting a new task for the first time.","Turning now to , \u201cSpeech Recognition Processing,\u201d some examples are illustrated of processing speech recognition .

In some examples speech interactions may be optimized by collecting and recording failed attempts ; in some examples by categorizing collected and recorded failures into groups  (such as in some examples by content analysis software or system , in some examples by the users' choices of speech or wording  , in some examples by their context of use  , in some examples by the application and application stage  , in some examples by a task such as adding a digital event to an online resource such as to a PlanetCentral or a GoPort   [as described elsewhere], and in some examples by other categorization means ); and in some examples by ranking collected and recorded grouped categories of failures  by each category's rate of success and rate of failure.","In some examples optimization  proceeds by identifying failures  then identifying when a subsequent success occurs and collecting and recording said successes ; in some examples by associating successes with collected categories of failures  to create parallel categories of recorded successes ; in some examples by sub-grouping the successes within each category  (such as in some examples by content analysis software or system , in some examples by the users' choices of instruction wording , and in some examples by other categorization means ); and in some examples by ranking collected and recorded group successes  by each's rate of success and rate of failure.","In some examples specific failures  may be associated with specific successes  and the means employed in those successes to interactively turn failures into successes (such as in some examples as part of its speech recognition interface  ; in some examples as part of interacting with a user by means of speech I\/O   ; in some examples generating and transmitting a correction request  , in some examples generating and transmitting example interactions  , in some examples displaying a list of example corrections  , and in some examples generating and delivering other types of corrective actions or suggestions  ); and in some examples means that turned failures into successes  may be tested  (such as in some examples by automated means as described elsewhere, and in some examples by manual means).","In some examples the result of certain tests  is a declining rate of user success  (which in some examples may be measured and\/or reported as an increased rate of user failure ), and said means are discarded rather than utilized to improve user success . In some examples the result of certain tests  is to deliver a higher rate of user success  and said tested means to improve user success may subsequently be delivered to users in some examples as part of a speech recognition interaction system    (such as in some examples when providing a speech recognition interface  ; in some examples in the steps or process[es] utilized to interact with a user by means of speech I\/O   ; in some examples when generating and transmitting a correction request  , in some examples when generating and transmitting example interactions  , in some examples when displaying a list of example corrections  , and in some examples when generating and delivering other types of prompts, suggestions, corrective actions, etc.    ); and in some examples as part of an additional system that raises speech recognition success rates (such as AK as part of an AKM which may improve user success as well as provide additional optimizations, as described elsewhere).","RCTP (REMOTE CONTROL TELEPORTALING): Productivity means doing more with fewer resources. Efficiency means producing more with fewer steps and at lower costs. Effectiveness means reaching goals in faster and better ways. Happiness means eliminating problems while spending more time doing what we want. Wealth means earning more and being able to do more while spending less.","Today we live in a blizzard of new and complex networked electronic devices that increasingly require us to figure out and use new combinations of hardware, software, networks, communications, services, data, entertainment, etc. Some of these are illustrated in the subsidiary devices zone   in , \u201cRCTP\u2014Subsidiary Devices (SD) Summary.\u201d In a brief summary of some examples, some of these SD's  include mobile phones , wearable electronic devices , PCs , laptops , netbooks , tablets , electronic pads , video games , servers , digital televisions , set-top boxes , DVR's (digital video recorders) , television rebroadcasters , surveillance cameras , sensors , Web services , and RTPs (Remote Teleportals) . Increasingly, a single task can become multi-faceted if it includes picking up or starting one of these SD's (like a a tablet, pad or smart phone); turning it on and connecting it to a network (like the Internet or a mobile phone service); running an application that uses a remote service (like search, an electronic reader, a social media application for a service like Facebook, voice-recognition texting, etc.); then accessing remote and\/or local data to perform a task that includes a different remote service (like taking a photograph with the device, cropping it with a picture editor on the device, using a messaging application to write a text message or a social media update, attaching the cropped photo and sending it).","SD's  run different operating systems, use different interfaces, access the Internet over different services, and employ different means for communications and for other digital tasks. Superficially, they seem to be many different types of devices but when factored down they are basically digital means to work with words, pictures, video, music, entertainment, communications and data\u2014they provide many of the same features even though they have different physical appearances, software interface designs, protocols, networks, applications, etc. Factoring their differences shows that they have many similar features that include find, open, display, scroll, select, highlight, link, navigate, use, edit, save, record, play, stop, fast forward, fast reverse, go to start or end, display menu, lookup, contact, connect, communicate, attach, transmit, disconnect, copy, combine, distribute, redistribute, broadcast, charge, bill, make payments, accept payments, etc.","Is it possible to tame this blizzard of overlapping features, devices and their remote services in ways that make us more productive because we can do more with fewer resources? In ways that make us more efficient because we can produce more with fewer steps and at lower costs? In ways that make us more effective because we can reach goals in faster and better ways? In ways that make us happier because we can eliminate the problems from needing to buy, learn and use too many different devices and different complicated interfaces, so that we can spend more time on what we want? In ways that make customers wealthier because we can do more and earn more from what we do, while spending less on unnecessary devices and services? Remote Control Teleportaling (herein RCTP) provides means to turn some types of electronic devices into SD's (subsidiary devices) that can be run in some examples with a common, familiar interface from devices such as LTP's (Local Teleportals) and MTP's (Mobile Teleportals); and in some examples with a remote control interface that resembles each SD's interface; and in some examples with a different remote control interface.","In some examples it is therefore possible to turn a plurality of types of networked electronic devices into SD's that can be run in some examples by RCTP either as an SD's owner, and\/or without needing to buy those SD's, their applications, their digital content, or pay for the services to which they subscribe. That latter option may be provided by SD Servers which in some examples are servers, in some examples are services, in some examples are applications, in some examples are provided by third-parties, in some examples are provided by API's, in some examples are provided by modules, in some examples are provided by widgets, and in some examples are provided by other means.","If this is possible it could affect industries  such as devices, applications, content and services, which are larger than just the devices that some vendors sell. In some examples the affected industries include mobile phones , in some examples computers , in some examples tablets , in some examples servers , in some examples televisions , in some examples DVR's , in some examples surveillance , in some examples various types of sensors , and in some examples other types of networked electronic devices and\/or devices with networked electronic controllers. The affected industries  could also include the vendors of in some examples device operating systems , in some examples software applications , in some examples office software , in some examples creative applications for creating or editing content , and in some examples modules or services for providing these applications through these devices . The affected industries could also include the vendors of digital content such as in some examples music , in some examples movies , in some examples television shows , in some examples books , in some examples expensive college textbooks , in some examples digital magazines , in some examples news , in some examples other types of digital content . The affected industries could also include some network-based industries  that provide bandwidth such as in some examples mobile phone services , in some examples cable or satellite television services , in some examples other types of specialized connectivity . In addition, it could also affect the remote services industries  that customers use with SD's such as in some examples videoconferencing services , in some examples subscription-only documents  such as journals, in some examples restricted databases  such as purchased by research libraries and available only to authorized patrons, and in some examples other types of remote services . In some examples the affected industries could also include other industries that sell other types of products, equipment, applications, software, content, services and more to owners of SD's.","From an economic history view, it is possible to draw a parallel between RCTP and unbundling compound products. In one example the music industry used to sell single songs for a single song price, but over time managed to evolve the product to selling entire albums for $10 to $16 each\u2014but when digital technology recently re-enabled the selling and buying of single songs, the customer's average music purchase dropped from an album to a song and the industry lost a major portion of its revenues. Similarly, newspapers and magazines never wanted to sell individual articles for pennies so packaged their products to selling a whole magazine or a whole newspaper with multiple editorial components, and even further evolved the product packaging to locking customers into subscribing to multiple issues\u2014yet again, when digital technology enabled clicking to only the individual article that a customer wants to read, instead of a buying a whole publication customers stopped subscribing, and many stopped paying for most editorial content. In another example cable TV bundles television into a dual stream of forcing subscribers to buy numerous channels (availability of 500 channels times 24 hours a day of programming) plus charges to advertisers (running ads across 500 channels times 24 hours a day of programming) for access to those subscribers\u2014but digital DVRs and Internet television shows make it possible for customers to view or buy only the few shows they actually watch with almost no advertisements, which has started unbundling cable TV. In some examples RCTP might be viewed as a similar digital unbundling, wherein each customer no longer needs to buy their own entire networked electronic device with its required software, copies of digital content and specialized services, just to receive the functions they occasionally want, but can instead click to just what they need when they need it\u2014which in some examples might simultaneously unbundle a plurality of hardware, software, content, services and other industries.","In some examples RCTP could help simplify the range of SD's\u2014with fewer devices that need to be bought, fewer interfaces that need to be figured out and learned, less content that needs to be bought and owned by each individual, and fewer network services that need to be paid to be used. Potentially, one or a plurality of customers and users could be more productive, more efficient, more effective, happier and wealthier\u2014doing more and receiving more, while spending less. Potentially, this would also be different for the affected industries'  manufacturers and vendors because RCTP access and use of one or a plurality of types of electronic devices might alter the number of device manufacturers, software developers, network services vendors, remote services vendors, and application creators\u2014as well as alter the operations and focus of each industry's leading vendors\u2014because what they sell and how it is used could be more accessible to a wider range of customers, in some examples because each user would no longer need to purchase or personally own as many devices, applications, content and services. As a result, one or a plurality of those devices, vendors or industries might be turned into a more of a service in some examples, a commodity in some examples, a smaller industry in some examples, a large vendor of generic functions in some examples, a successful niche vendor of a superior branded function in some examples, a leader in one or a plurality of categories that has a large customer base through digital access in some examples, or have other material and operating consequences.","In the end, is it possible to turn today's hailstorm of complex electronic devices into \u201csubsidiary devices\u201d (herein SD), and enter a \u201cPost Subsidiary Device Stage\u201d (herein \u201cPost SD Stage\u201d) of electronic device development? When printing and publishing began, it took about 75 years to develop the modern book (from about 1445 to 1520) during which time the printed book evolved from a few expensive copies of hand-rendered calligraphy into its now familiar standard components, order and layouts that became more affordable by a wider range of readers. Might RCTP help advance a similar evolution of digital devices today, wherein some digital devices and functions are rationalized into a smaller number of consistent usage designs and predictable processes within an accessible digital environment that is more affordable for wider use with greater benefits to more people? If so, that would be an Alternate Reality indeed\u2014a Post SD Stage whose evolution is envisioned and described by the ARTPM.","Additionally, in some examples RCTP systems, methods, apparatuses and processes for remote control can be embodied in specific systems that each provide a range of focused benefits; such as in some examples an SD server(s), in some examples a help desk for various types of electronic devices (such as subsidiary devices enumerated elsewhere), in some examples customer support that includes hands-on use of a device or system being supported, in some examples an education or teaching system that utilizes a plurality of SD's under individual remote control or simultaneous remote control, in some examples technical support for complex equipment or complex devices, in some examples for services such as telecommunications, vehicle operations, equipment operations, etc.","RCTP\u2014Subsidiary Devices Summary: Currently, large numbers of people have become buyers and users of electronic devices such as computers , laptops , netbooks , tablets , video games , mobile phones , televisions , television set-top boxes , digital video recorders , network services , Web services , remote services , etc.\u2014not to mention the numerous types of software, digital content and services that run on them, or provide connectivity or content to them. As these have become increasingly ubiquitous and popular users have the growing problem of too many devices and too many expenses for using similar features and performing similar tasks in the many different ways sold by what gradually become competing industries. Here, this RCTP advance provides means for remote control that enables a user to gain remote control over one or a plurality of electronic devices, and thereby turn them into subsidiary devices\u2014perhaps reducing the dependence on any one of those industries, devices, services, applications, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0892","num":"0891"},"figref":"FIG. 55"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0893","num":"0892"},"figref":"FIG. 56"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0894","num":"0893"},"figref":"FIG. 57"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0895","num":"0894"},"figref":"FIG. 58"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0896","num":"0895"},"figref":"FIG. 59"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0897","num":"0896"},"figref":"FIG. 60"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0898","num":"0897"},"figref":"FIG. 61"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0899","num":"0898"},"figref":"FIG. 62"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0900","num":"0899"},"figref":"FIG. 63"},"Turning now to , \u201cRCTP\u2014Subsidiary Devices Summary,\u201d some examples of layers in an RCTP architecture are illustrated. In some examples an affected industries electronic devices layer  includes a range of electronic subsidiary devices  as described elsewhere. In some examples a subsidiary device's components layer  includes the components of a wired and\/or wireless electronic device , which in some examples includes a CPU  coupled to a wired network interface  for communicating with a network such as a LAN  and a Controlling Device (herein CD) such as an LTP or an MTP; in some examples includes a CPU  coupled to a wireless network interface  and an optional antenna  for communicating with a wireless network or directly with a device remote control such as WiFi , Bluetooth , IR (line-of-sight infrared) , cellular radio , etc. and thereby with a CD such as an LTP or an MTP; in some examples includes a CPU  coupled to memory  which may also load and run an optional control application  or an optional viewer application  (as described elsewhere); in some examples includes a CPU  coupled to (optional) video processing , audio processing , graphics processing , television tuner processing , or other media processing ; in some examples includes a CPU  coupled to (optional) storage  that may store data or applications utilize in Remote Control Teleportaling such as in some examples a stored control application , and some examples a stored viewer application , in some examples a stored device profile , in some examples a stored device interface , in some examples one or a plurality of communications protocols ; in some examples includes a CPU  coupled to an (optional) display , which in some examples may be a touch screen display , in some examples may be an LCD display , and in some examples may be another type of visual display ; in some examples includes a CPU  coupled to one or a plurality of user interfaces  such as in some examples a keypad , in some examples a keyboard , in some examples a pointing device , in some examples a control panel , in some examples buttons , in some examples dials , in some examples a voice command interface , in some examples other types of user interface controls  as described elsewhere.","In some examples said electronic subsidiary device(s)  wireless  or wired  interconnections may be directly with a CD such as an LTP or an MTP; in some examples said wireless  or wired  interconnections may be with a CD such as an LTP or an MTP over one or a plurality of networks; in some examples said wireless  or wired  interconnections may be with one or a plurality of SD server(s) over one or a plurality of networks, and said SD server(s) provide interconnections with a CD such as an LTP or an MTP. Alternatively, a CD (the controlling device) may be a different type of SD (subsidiary device) such as in various examples a mobile phone , a wearable electronic device , a PC , a laptop , a netbook , a digital tablet , an electronic pad , a video game , a server , a digital television , a set-top box , a DVR (digital video recorder) , a television rebroadcaster , a Web service , a remote service , etc.","In some examples an individual's subsidiary devices (layer ) includes one or a plurality of records  that may be contained in one or a plurality of databases, with each record containing data that corresponds to an identity's device         or with each record containing data that corresponds to a device associated with an SPLS        . In some examples said records  are stored by an identity's CD; in some examples said records  are stored remotely but accessible by said identity's CD; and in some examples said records  are associated with one or a plurality of SD server(s). Collectively, said records contain data that corresponds the subsidiary devices  associated with an individual .","For ease of illustration, only a portion of the database  is illustrated relating to a components layer   and an affected industries electronic devices layer  ; though said database  may contain other subsidiary device data utilized in providing access to, and control of, specific SD's. As shown in said SD layer , an individual's SD's  and\/or a server's SD's  includes one or more records, each associated with an SD. In some examples each record contains data corresponding to an SD such as in some examples an identity name field  contains the name of one of an individual's identities (as described elsewhere; such as John Smith); in some examples an SPLS name field  contains the name of one of an individual's SPLS's (as described elsewhere; such as family, coworkers, members of team X, etc.); in some examples an identity\/SPLS name field  contains the combined name of one of an individual's identities combined with the name of one of said individual's SPLS's (as described elsewhere; such as John Smith\/family); in some examples a device name field  contains a user's name for a specific device  (such as laptop, mobile phone, etc.); in some examples an icon field  contains an icon or symbol that represents said device graphically (wherein said icon or symbol may be provided by a vendor, based on a vendor's logo, selected by a user to fit a personal preference, etc.); in some examples a device's vendor field  contains a device's vendor's name (such as Apple, HP, Samsung, etc.); in some examples a device's model name field  contains a device's model name (such as iPhone4, G62m laptop, 6500 TV, etc.); in some examples a vendor\/device model name field  contains the combined name of a vendor combined with a device's model name (such as Apple\/iPhone4, HP\/G62m laptop, Samsung\/6500 TV, etc.); in some examples a device's communications protocol(s) field  contains the names of the device's communications protocol(s) (such as RDP, Modbus, UPnP, etc.); in some examples a device's address field  contains the device's address (such as its IP address such as the IPv4 address 170.12.250.4, or an IPv6 address); in some examples a device's interface field   device's network interface or it's communications interface (such as Ethernet, LAN, WiFi, line of sight IR, etc.); in some examples a device's control application(s) field  contains the name (including version number) of its control application or the name (including version number) of its viewer application (as described elsewhere), and in some examples contains the device's control application  and\/or it's viewer application ; in some examples a login requirement field(s)  contains whether login and\/or authentication is required and if so data such as a login ID and\/or password, or whether said subsidiary device may be accessed without login, authentication or authorization ; in some examples other subsidiary device data may be included as needed to provide access to, and control of, a subsidiary device(s).","In some examples each SD record is representative of a single SD device and contains data for selecting said device, accessing said device, and accessing and running the appropriate control and\/or viewer application(s) to control said device (which will be discussed in connection with subsequent figures). The fields in said record may contain the actual items (such as in some examples icons or symbols, in some examples control or viewer applications, etc.) or alternatively maybe pointers to locations in storage or memory (whether local or remote) where the relevant data may be found and retrieved.","RCTP\u2014Plurality of Simultaneous Subsidiary Devices: The control of subsidiary devices (SD's) is a departure from today's practice of requiring each person to own a plethora of different types of electronic devices in order to access and use their different features, functions and capabilities. The combination of TP devices and SD's has the potential to assist in converging different types of digital electronics into a single model\u2014a digital environment (as described elsewhere)\u2014which in some examples includes direct use of a spectrum of different digital devices' features and capabilities from one or a plurality of TP devices. Turning now to : \u201cRCTP\u2014Simultaneous Plurality of Subsidiary Devices,\u201d a user  who employs a TP device  has continuous access to visible indications of the availability of a plurality of SD's  , which in some examples provides access to that user's owned SD's , and in some examples provides access to additional remote SD's  such as through an (optional) SD server(s) that may be accessed, controlled and used on demand\u2014together providing means to quickly identify and employ the features, functions and capabilities of a wide range of subsidiary devices without necessarily needing to own and\/or physically use them locally. Instead, a range of digital electronic devices, tools, services, applications, etc.\u2014together an emerging plurality of digital capabilities that exists with and alongside one's owned electronic devices\u2014may be used and run from one or a plurality of controlling devices .","In some examples a user  employs a Controlling Device (herein a CD) which may be an LTP  which includes a display, means for user interaction, a CPU, memory, storage, communications, and software (as described elsewhere). In some examples a user may employ visually simple and clear means   on said CD to select an icon, name, label, menu choice, graphical object or other clear and direct representation of an available SD (subsidiary device)    from the display of a CD . In some examples rather than displaying said SD's on CD , a list of SD's or a graphical representation of available SD's may be transmitted for display and selection on a remote control held by a user  (such as described elsewhere such as in some examples a URC [Universal Remote Control] described in part in  and ). In some examples said user  employs an electronic device to access one or a plurality of SD servers  which include databases that, among other things, associate user requests for SD's with currently available and accessible SD's (as described elsewhere); and said SD server(s)  provide a list of SD's or a graphical representation of available SD's that is transmitted for display and selection; with that user's selection of one or a plurality of SD's transmitted to the SD server . After a user selects one or a plurality of SD's, said selection(s) is communicated to CD processing  which retrieves the selected SD's record  either locally or remotely, including said record's data and address        , and initiates CD processing , SD access and SD control (which are described in more detail elsewhere).","In some examples a single user  with a single CD  may be used to simultaneously access and control a plurality of SD's    , including accessing and controlling other TP devices  by RCTP means as if they were SD's. Providing means for a single user  to access, view and control multiple SD's provides a greater span of control for a single user, such as to provide seamless navigation and control over multiple simultaneous activities, tasks, resources, tools, devices, etc. in multiple locations. In some examples this is accomplished by means of a TP device  (such as described in more detail elsewhere) which in some examples includes an intuitive user interface and supervisory\/management processing that provides interactions and control with one or a plurality of SD devices.","As illustrated in  in some examples a user  utilizes an LTP  to receive and display   indications of available identities and SPLS's (which include IPTR as described elsewhere\u2014Identities, Places, Tools and Resources\u2014which include SD devices; and which may also list SD's independently of a user's identities and SPLS's); in some examples selecting one or a plurality of SD's from said displayed indications    ; processing each said selection to obtain access and control of each selected SD; administering (optional) user authorization and authentication to be permitted control over each SD; displaying on the user's CD \u201cwindowed\u201d means to control and view the output from each SD device (as described elsewhere) such as a PC laptop  , a set top box with a DVR  , a video game system  , and an RTP digital reality (as described elsewhere) running on a remote RTP  ; entering an instruction on the CD for one of the SD's; if needed, translating the instruction into a device-specific command; relaying to the SD the instruction or device-specific command; receiving and performing the instruction by the SD; transmitting the SD's output to the CD; and receiving and displaying each SD's output on the CD's display    .","In some examples a CD apparatus and system  allows for simultaneous control of one or a plurality of SD's that are connected to said CD. Each SD is separately viewed in an \u201cSD window\u201d     wherein each SD's window contains the processed video signal(s) from that one separate SD, and each window may be moved and\/or resized as desired. In some examples a CD, such as a TP device , has substantial capacity for multiple simultaneous operations (as described elsewhere in more detail) that in some examples includes simultaneously controlling a plurality of subsidiary devices; while in some examples a CD may have less capacity (such as in some examples where a CD is a netbook, an electronic tablet, a mobile phone, or other electronic device that includes a display, means for user interaction, CPU, memory, storage, communications, and appropriate application software). In each example the number of SD's that may be controlled directly and simultaneously may vary based on each CD's capacity such that some CDs may provide simultaneous control of a larger number of SD's than other CD's can provide. Alternatively, in some examples a smaller CD such as an AID\/AOD (such as a mobile phone running a VTP) may control a larger capacity TP device like an LTP, and utilize the larger LTP device's capacities to control more SD's simultaneously, wherein the LTP communicates all the SD windows, controls and outputs within one focused connection to the AID\/AOD.","In some examples control over each SD is managed by processing signals from the CD device's  user interface(s) (as described elsewhere, including both direct interfaces such as a pointing device, keyboard, voice, and other means, and also including a URC [Universal Remote Control]). In some examples the focus of a user interface passes from one SD window to another    , such as by using a pointing device's pointer to point at a PC laptop's window  and thereby highlight it and make it the focus for instructions, and then moving said pointer over a set top box's window  and thereby highlighting said second window and make said second SD window the focus for instructions, and subsequently point at any desired SD device's window which both highlights it and makes that SD the focus for commands and instructions. As said user interface is employed to move the focus from one SD window to another, CD processing automatically generates the necessary user interface signals to interact with each highlighted and focused SD. In some examples to control a particular SD    , a user  moves the user interface pointer to highlight that particular SD's window. Then, to control a different SD the user  highlights the desired SD's window. If the user does not want active control of one or a plurality of SD's, the user may focus the user interface off of any one or all of the SD devices.","In some examples an SD device continues performing the last instruction received even when active control is moved away from it, such as in some examples a PC laptop   continues to run the previous software applications that were started (such as in some examples a web browser with multiple tabs open, word processing a document, receiving and replying to e-mail, etc.); in some examples a set top box with a DVR   continues to play a recorded movie or a currently broadcast television show; in some examples a video game   continues running a game; in some examples an RTP   continues to display a real remote place and the specific digital reality applied to it; etc. In some examples an SD's continuing operation(s) may be changed by using a user interface to highlight that SD window and make that SD the focus, then use the SD window interface to issue a new instruction(s) or command(s).","In some examples each SD's audio is managed by the CD  processing the audio from each source      separately and providing automatic and manual audio control over which audio is played, which audio is muted, and the volume of each SD source that is played. As with the video signals, in some examples audio signals are transmitted from each SD     to the CD  for processing and output. In some examples the audio from each SD is sent from their respective outputs to an audio controller and processor within the CD. Said audio controller and processor controls an audio mixer that is connected to the CD's audio amplifier(s) and speaker(s). In some examples the simultaneously received SD audio signals are mixed and controlled so that they match the current preferences of a user , with some user preferences automated and some user preferences manually controlled. In some examples the audio is automated so that only a highlighted window plays audio, so that focusing the user interface on a specific SD window plays its audio; in this example moving the focus to the video game window  plays its audio and mutes other audio sources, while then moving the focus to the set-top box  turns on its broadcasted audio while muting the other sources. In some examples the audio from all sources is mixed and manually controlled so that all audio sources      are available with each SD's volume under user  control; in this example a user could listen to a set top box broadcast show  at a normal full volume while playing a video game  softly and muting other sources. In some examples the audio is mixed and played with a combination of automated and manual controls so the combination matches a user's preferences with as little manual adjustment as possible; in this example a user could set all focused connections  with others to automatically and always be set at full normal volume, while adjusting other sources manually     as desired at any given time.","In some examples a CD can utilize remote control means (as described elsewhere) to select between the plurality of simultaneously controlled SD's the one SD that the user wants to control remotely at a given moment. In some examples a user can select between the plurality of simultaneously controlled SD's the two or a plurality of SD's that the user wants to control remotely at a given moment. In some examples a user can select two or a plurality of remotely controllable SD's to perform a single remote control instruction that corresponds to said plurality of selected SD's; such as in some examples to open two or a plurality of SD's simultaneously, in some examples to end the remote control session with two or a plurality of SD's simultaneously, in some examples to start the recording function of two or a plurality of SD's by entering a single remote control instruction; and in some other examples to perform a different but commonly available remote control feature or function with two or a plurality of SD's simultaneously.","As illustrated in the examples in , said CD user  has a focused real-time connection (as described elsewhere) with another identity (user) .

In some examples an RCTP system and apparatus may be described as turning unitary and generally solitary electronic devices into virtualized resources that may be accessed and employed by a plurality of users and audiences.","Plurality of Identity(ies) with Subsidiary Device(s): As described elsewhere in some examples TP devices enable a consistent system wherein subsidiary devices (SD's) and the applications, services, features, functions, and capabilities they provide are logically and automatically available for connection and use\u2014in other words, selecting available SD's may be automated and direct. While it may be imagined that it is complicated to select and use one or a plurality of identities, and then select one or a plurality of subsidiary devices, the use of a TP device  may include in some examples the identification of a user , in some examples the identification of one or a plurality of said user's identity(ies)    (as described elsewhere), or in some examples the selection of one or a plurality of one of said user's identities' SPLS(s)    (as described elsewhere).

Said adaptation in some examples is based upon an industry standard; in some examples said adaptation is based on an industry standard that a device vendor has followed in part and altered in part; and in some examples said adaptation is not based on a uniform or industry standard because a device vendor has not utilized one. In some examples this adaptation customizes and configures varying parts of said CD's software, processing, communications, protocols, data transformation(s), etc. while enabling it to use a consistent hardware platform. Said SDCP adaptation is expressed in the form of a device profile file. In some examples a CD's hardware and communications software may be adapted to fit a variety of different manufacturers, components, networks, protocols, etc. such as a subset of a CD , communication network(s)  , SD's   , and in some examples an (optional) SD server(s) , and in some examples a remote source of device profiles , in some examples a remote source of DI's , in some examples a remote source of control applications , and in some examples a remote source of viewer applications .","Device profile: In some examples adaptations accommodate the differences based on instructions provided in the device profile of each SD    , where the device profile's structure and definition encapsulates the variability of each SD. In some examples the device profile file addresses variability such as in some examples the communications physical interface; in some examples serial communication port settings; in some examples serial communication protocol; in some examples network communication port settings; in some examples network communication protocol; in some examples data locations (such as in some examples a register address, in some examples addresses, in some examples storage location[s]); in some examples data attributes (such as in some examples how data is represented such as by types [integer, floating-point, Boolean, etc.], conditional based on a parameter, min\/max scaling, alarm conditions, alarm levels, or any processing that produces meaning [such as status codes, alarm codes, transforms, etc.]); in some examples operating states; in some examples parameters (such as in some examples how the data should be accessed, in some examples a method for retaining data in memory, in some examples the frequency of data access, etc.); in some examples device instructions or commands; in some examples instructions transformation specification, or commands transformation specification (as described elsewhere); in some examples device interface screens; in some examples user interface screens. In some examples a device profile utilizes and follows an industry standard; in some examples a device profile utilizes part but not all of an industry standard; and in some examples a device profile is independent of industry standards. In some examples the device profile is altered by addition; in some examples the device profile is altered by subtraction; in some examples the device profile is altered by extension; and in some examples the device profile is altered as additional subsidiary device variability is developed and added. In some examples a device profile allows adaptive representation of SD data, so a CD can adapt to the different and varying ways that each manufacturer and vendor represents the data within each device.","In some examples a CD requests and receives data collected from a SD; and in some examples a CD receives data transmitted by a SD. In some examples said received data is transformed based on values defined in a device profile (as described elsewhere), and placed and stored in a data table based on values defined in a device profile, for remote control use by a CD. In some examples said remote control instructions are transformed into device control commands (as described elsewhere) for transmission to an SD. As a result in some examples a device profile provides adaptability to the variability of a given SD from a given manufacturer or vendor.","Sources: In some examples a device profile     is defined and provided by a device's vendor    ; in some examples a device profile     is defined and provided by a third-party developer ; in some examples a device profile     is defined and provided by a device user ; in some examples a device profile     is defined and provided by others such as an open-source contributor  or an SD access service . In some examples a control application   is defined and provided by a device's vendor    ; in some examples a control application   is defined and provided by a third-party developer ; in some examples a control application   is defined and provided by a device user ; in some examples a control application   is defined and provided by others such as an open-source contributor  or an SD access service .

In some examples a CD is capable of controlling an SD as described elsewhere using a control protocol(s) and\/or a communications protocol(s) that in some examples is a standard that is already developed (such as in some examples RDP [Remote Desktop Protocol], in some examples UPnP [Universal Plug and Play and its DCP, or Device Control Protocol], in some examples Modbus, in some examples DLNA [Digital Living Network Alliance], in some examples WiFi, in some examples 802.11b\/g\/n, in some examples HTTP, in some examples Ethernet, or in some examples another known protocol); in some examples a protocol that is developed in the future; and in some examples a protocol that is generated as needed by known means then stored for future re-use. In some examples one or a plurality of known and\/or generated protocols are stored locally and\/or remotely such as in some examples in local memory, and in some examples on a server. In some examples said stored known protocols can be modified such as by addition, deletion, updating, replacing, or editing.","In some examples a CD is utilized to present a list of SD's (as described elsewhere) and when one SD is selected its device profile is retrieved (as described elsewhere). Said device profile identifies said selected SD  and that SD's protocol(s) , providing data so the CD can determine the type of SD being controlled remotely , and the protocol(s) required in some examples for communications  and in some examples for control . In some examples said CD uses the identified SD protocol(s)  to determine if said protocol(s) is known and stored locally , or if not then if it is known and stored remotely . In some examples said protocol(s)  is known and stored locally , in which case it is recognized by the system and retrieved for use in establishing and maintaining SD communication and control , and remote control proceeds . In some examples said protocol(s)  is known but not stored locally , in which case it is recognized either system and retrieved  from remote protocol storage  (such as in some examples in a server[s], in some examples in a protocol database[s], in some examples in a protocol library[ies], in some examples in a protocol access service[s], in some examples in another storage device[s]) for use in establishing and maintaining SD communication and control , and remote control proceeds .","In some examples said protocol(s)  is not known   and\/or not retrievable  then a uniform standard protocol is retrieved and used to generate a protocol (herein named \u201cgenerated protocol\u201d) based upon said device's device profile  (as described elsewhere). In some examples said generated protocol  is successful enough to use it in establishing and maintaining SD communication and control , and remote control proceeds . In some examples said generated protocol  is successful enough to be used  and is then saved for future re-use   in said remote protocol storage  (as described elsewhere). In some examples the attempt to generate a protocol  fails  and in that case AKM steps are employed  (as described elsewhere); if said AKM steps succeed  then the resulting solution  is used in establishing and maintaining SD communication and control , and remote control proceeds ; but if said AKM steps fail  then the AKM error process initiates , and an appropriately worded error message is displayed to the user .","In some examples a generated protocol  is created by utilizing a uniform standard protocol and data in a device profile. In some examples said uniform standard protocol is stored locally , and in some examples said uniform standard protocol is retrieved from remote protocol storage . In some examples said generated protocol  is created by factoring and abstracting common elements, instructions, commands, data types, etc. out of the uniform standard protocol and the specific SD's device profile, and then generating a protocol using the common elements . In some examples said generated protocol  is created by factoring and abstracting common elements, instructions, commands, data types, etc. out of the uniform standard protocol and the specific SD's device profile, and then creating a translation table using the common elements  and writing said translation table to memory with said translation table used to establish and maintain SD communication and control  (as described elsewhere). In some examples identifiable common elements include common elements in protocols such as in some examples identification(s), in some examples user IDs, in some examples create, in some examples select an instruction, in some examples perform an instruction, in some examples provide state information, in some examples set an alarm or an alarm condition; in some examples terminate a session, in some examples other common elements can be used instead of or in addition to these examples; non-common elements are discarded; and a new \u201ccommon protocol\u201d is generated based on the common elements.","In some examples a third-party (such as in some examples the vendor of the SD, in some examples a developer of similar SD protocols, in some examples a developer of standard protocols, in some examples a user of that SD, or in some examples another third-party) provides information such as which elements of the SD's protocol are unique and which are common. In some examples a generated protocol  may be created by an application or a module that is designed to recognize, identify and extract common elements from one or a plurality of unknown protocols.","In some examples after said generated protocol  has been generated, it is used to establish and maintain SD communication , and remote control proceeds ; and in some examples said generated protocol  is used to establish and maintain SD control , and remote control proceeds. Therefore, in some examples a CD will support retrievable protocols A through N while a specific SD runs protocol X, and the two devices may still establish CD's remote control of said SD using a generated protocol  based common elements between a uniform standard protocol and protocol X. As a result, some CDs can establish remote control of some SD's that run different and unknown protocols without needing to develop (ahead of time and by a separate developer or by a separate development effort) a unique protocol or interface for that combination of CD and SD. In addition, said generated protocol  can be saved  in remote protocol storage  for future retrieval  and re-use  by that combination of CD and SD. As a result in some examples differences in some communications protocols and some control protocols may be abstracted out in a system, method or process that provides for connecting some CDs with some SD's in some examples; and a system, method or process that provides for some CDs to control some SD's in some examples. In addition, in some examples the protocols of new CDs and new SD's may be written to a set of common elements that fit said protocol generation capability  and at least approximate a uniform standard protocol, and thereby new devices may be made capable of communications and remote control in an easier and more direct process.","In some examples these systems, methods and processes may be implemented with hardware; in some examples they may be implemented with software (such as in some examples program code, in some examples instructions, and some examples modules, in some examples services); and in some examples they may be implemented with a combination of both hardware and software (such as in some examples a server running an application and storing a database, in some examples a service, in some examples a protocol generation application). In some examples these may take the form of software that runs on hardware and can access stored data so they become an apparatus or machine for practicing this system, method or process.","Control and viewer applications: , \u201cRCTP\u2014Control and Viewer Applications,\u201d illustrates some examples in which control applications    and\/or viewer applications    are run in some examples by one or a plurality of CDs (controlling devices) , in some examples by one or a plurality of SD's (subsidiary devices) , in some examples by one or a plurality of servers or remote services , and in some examples by one or a plurality of specialized SD servers or services  (as described elsewhere).

Alternatively, in some examples the required control application and\/or viewer application are not stored locally , then in some examples they may be manually retrieved by means of remote control interface  or application  which utilizes a button, menu, widget, servlet, search, or other user interface component that lists the appropriate control application and\/or viewer application required by the selected SD so that the user may select it and retrieve it  from remote storage  by downloading, and then execute said downloaded application(s) .","Alternatively, a remote control interface may be generated under program control  such as by Java commands, such as in some examples when the required control application and\/or viewer application are not stored locally  and they are also not retrievable remotely ; or as in some examples when a uniform remote control interface is desirable. In some examples said generated remote control interface can include a subset of factored standard commands based on each SD's retrieved device profile   (such as in some examples turn on, end [control session], exit, pause, suspend, open, run, display, scroll, highlight, link, click, use, edit, save, record, play, stop, fast-forward, fast reverse, pan, tilt, zoom, look up, find, contact, connect, communicate, attach, transmit, disconnect, copy, combine, distribute, redistribute, broadcast, charge, bill\/invoice, make payment, accept payment, etc.). Additionally and optionally, in some examples said generated remote control interface may include a uniform interface (as described elsewhere such as in ) that may be adapted to the specific devices in use (as described elsewhere such as in ). In some examples a generated interface  may include only a control application , and in some examples a generated interface  may include only a viewer application , and in some examples a generated interface  may include both a control application  and a viewer application .","In some examples the SD  does not need a control application and\/or viewer application , in which case it continues processing said CD requests and instructions   as described in  . In some examples a selected SD needs a control application and\/or viewer application  and has that stored locally , in which case it retrieves said application(s) and runs it . In some examples the selected SD needs a control application and\/or viewer application  and does not have that stored locally , in which case it notifies the CD  that it needs a required control application and\/or viewer application  ; in which case the CD can retrieve  the device's required application(s) and download said application(s)  to the SD  where the SD can execute the required application(s) . In some examples, after said required control application and\/or viewer applications have been executed  said CD requests and instructions   are processed as described in  .","For an illustration, in some examples a user of a CD  selects a specific SD  and its control application is not available on the CD . In some examples a manual process is employed to retrieve and execute said control application. In some examples a web browser is manually opened  on a remote system  which provides its home page. In some examples downloadable SD control applications are accessible from said home page   by means of a hyperlink, a menu, a widget, a servlet, a search field, a support page, a downloads page, or other known web navigation means. In some examples a request for the category or list of downloadable SD control applications   is made using a web navigation means, and the downloadable SD control applications is displayed such as in a list of hyperlinks, a pulldown list, or other known web selection means. In some examples the specific selected SD's control application is selected for download from a known web selection means  , and the SD control application is downloaded to the CD. In some examples the CD runs the downloaded application by clicking on it or activating it by other known means .","For another illustration, in some examples of a user of a CD  selects a specific SD  and its control application is not available on the CD . In some examples an automated process is employed to retrieve and run said control application. In some examples the selection of said SD  auto-retrieves its device profile  such as in some examples from local storage , in some examples from remote storage , and in some examples from a selected SD . As described elsewhere, in some examples said device profile includes the name and address of its control application (and\/or its viewer application) so the SD selection process includes utilizing said data to auto-retrieve the SD's control application   which in some examples is remote storage  and in some examples is the SD . In some examples the SD control application is a compressed file (such as a zip file) in which case the retrieved file  is auto-extracted and executed .","In some examples when said control application runs , and\/or viewer application runs , the control application and\/or viewer application sends a request to the SD  and said SD parses and attempts to run the request , which in some examples is a device control request , and in some examples is a viewer (device monitoring) request . In some examples CD requests   may include session creation; instructions, commands or requests within a created session; session deletion; or session timeout. In some examples CD requests may include other processing as described elsewhere, such as in some examples in . In some examples communications paths          may be secure (e.g., encrypted), and in some examples communications paths          may be non-secure. In some examples multiple communications paths          may operate within a single session.","Control Subsidiary Device: , \u201cRCTP\u2014Control Subsidiary Device,\u201d illustrates some examples of remote control of an SD by a CD. In some examples an SD has been selected  as described elsewhere, and said CD sends a connection control request to said SD . In some examples an SD server  was used to select an SD as described elsewhere, and said CD in some examples sends a connection control request to said SD by means of the SD server , and in some examples said CD sends a connection control request directly to said SD . In some examples the appropriate device profile, control application(s) and\/or viewer application(s) have been retrieved and executed as described elsewhere, and said application(s) is used to send a connection control request to said SD  . In some examples said connection control request   is sent via communications paths as described elsewhere to initiate a control session; using a messaging system and protocol that the SD supports and a message format that the SD can receive, parse and act upon. In some examples a control session is the period during which an SD is available for control by a CD. In some examples a control session continues after a controlling CD has exited, during which the SD remains active and available for control, until the SD's control session reaches the end of a timeout period. In some examples a control session can be enabled by any remote control technology such as in some examples Microsoft's Terminal Services, in some examples Modbus, in some examples UPnP, in some examples a vendor's proprietary communications and\/or control protocol, in some examples a vendor's proprietary adaptation of a standard protocol, in some examples any other known communications and\/or remote control technology or application. In some examples an SD receives a connection control request , and (optionally) the CD, SD and\/or identity may be authenticated  and\/or authorized  using known authentication processes or TP authentication and authorization processes described elsewhere. In some examples after (optional) authentication  the CD connects to the SD  using in some examples a known communications protocol and in some examples a known control protocol; and said protocols are retrieved from memory or storage (whether local or remote) and employed instead connection. In some examples said communications protocol and\/or said control protocol are unknown and therefore may be generated to establish said connection and control , as described elsewhere. If a protocol is generated and used to establish a successful connection  it may be stored in a pre-determined library of protocols (as described elsewhere) for future remote control sessions between that type of CD and that type of SD.","In some examples it is after a CD connects to a SD  that a control application  and\/or a viewer application  are executed. In some examples it is after a CD connects to a SD  that a DI (Device Interface) is downloaded and displayed on the CD's screen , or other SD data are retrieved and displayed as needed . In some examples a control application  may display said DI and other data on a CD's screen . In some examples a viewer application  may display said DI and other data on a CD's screen . In some examples other known means are utilized to display on a CD's screen means for remote control  such as an interface that lists the available remote control options. In some examples different remote control components, widgets, visual interfaces, etc. may be included in a CD's control screen  for each type of remotely controlled SD ; for one example, if the SD contains a PTZ camera then the CD screen may include a compass rose so the camera's Pan, Tilt and Zoom may be remotely controlled; for another example if the SD contains a thermostat then the CD screen may include a vertical (or optionally horizontal) slider with fahrenheit and or centigrade temperature markings with an indicator that a user may move to set a desired temperature; for another example if the SD is a PC then the CD screen may display the entire SD's interface by means such as RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) for direct user control of the SD PC. In some examples use may (optionally) be monitored  and logged  by known means such as in some examples when said use has been set up by an SD server (as described elsewhere) , in some examples when a user pays for use , in some examples when use is based on a membership or a subscription , in some examples when use is free but includes retrieving and displaying sponsored marketing or messages , and in other types of uses where it is desirable to monitor  and\/or log  use(s). Said (optional) monitoring data  and\/or (optional) log data  may be communicated by one or a plurality of networks to the appropriate monitoring and\/or logging application or facility where said data is received and stored (such as in some examples   in ).","In some examples a CD is now capable of controlling an SD, in which the user of the CD can operate the SD to perform any available SD function (such as its features, functions or applications; or settings for any of those features, functions or applications), or use any desired SD resource (such as play, use or edit its stored content) that is available for remote control  . In some examples the CD displays  the SD's control panel; in some examples the CD displays  the SD's user interface; in some examples the CD displays  an adapted or third-party developed version of the SD's control panel or user interface; in some examples the CD displays  buttons, icons, GUI interface, lists, control panel, or menus that displays SD instructions, commands and features; and in some examples the CD displays  a subset of the SD's full set of controls. In some examples the CD's display  can be designed and configured in any number of known ways to include any or all of the available SD controls that may be utilized for remote control from a CD.","In some examples the CD's display  can include a \u201cshow all\u201d button, link or command to list all of the currently available SD commands or instructions that may be utilized for remote control of the SD; in some examples said \u201cshow all\u201d list may be in alphabetical order; in some examples said \u201cshow all\u201d list may be a hierarchy; in some examples said \u201cshow all\u201d list may be in frequency-of-use order; in some examples said \u201cshow all\u201d list may be a multi-level menu; and in some examples said \u201cshow all\u201d list may be in a different order or organization. In some examples said \u201cshow all\u201d list may be pre-determined, saved and retrieved from storage; while in some examples said \u201cshow all\u201d list may be constructed when requested by retrieving the CD's display  from memory, then sorting and reorganizing it in the order and format requested, for display and presentation on demand. In some examples said \u201cshow all\u201d list may be searchable by keyword, or by a keyword string. In some examples said \u201cshow all\u201d list includes labeled choices that the user may select individually  to control the SD.","In some examples each displayed  or listed  SD instruction , command , feature , icon , GUI interface , widget , etc. has associated with it an SD control command that effects the SD to perform that specific step or function. In some examples the CD's user can enter an SD control instruction  that corresponds to an area of interest by selecting a button , icon , GUI interface component , listed choice , control panel component , menu choice , etc. from the available choices. In some examples said control instruction  selects the SD command associated with said control instruction  and determines if translation into a specific SD control command is required . In some examples no translation is required  and the SD command associated with said control instruction  is transmitted to the SD . In some examples the CD interface  displays one or a plurality of SD instructions  that require translation   into SD commands  before being transmitted to the SD  (with said translation  described in more detail elsewhere, such as in ). Alternatively, in some examples translation of an SD instruction  is required   and said translation is performed at the SD   after said SD instruction  is transmitted to the SD. Alternatively, in some examples translation of SD instruction  is required   and said SD instruction  is transmitted to an SD server or a third-party application or service which performs said translation remotely  .","In some examples a CD can utilize said remote control means (such as in some examples a control application, in some examples of viewer application, in some examples both a control application and a viewer application, in some examples a generated remote control interface, in some examples no control or viewer application and no generated remote control interface) to control two or a plurality of SD's simultaneously (as described elsewhere such as in ). In some examples a user can select between the plurality of simultaneously controlled SD's the one SD that the user wants to control remotely at a given moment. In some examples a user can select between the plurality of simultaneously controlled SD's the two or a plurality of SD's that the user wants to control remotely at a given moment. In some examples a user can select two or a plurality of remotely controllable SD's to perform a single remote control instruction that corresponds to said selected SD's; such as in some examples to open two or a plurality of SD's simultaneously, in some examples to close two or a plurality of SD's simultaneously, in some examples to start the recording function of two or a plurality of SD's by entering a single remote control instruction; and in some other examples to perform a different but commonly available remote control feature or function with two or a plurality of SD's simultaneously.","In some examples the SD remote control instruction selected  and transmitted  (whether or not translated into an SD command  ) is received by the SD , where it is utilized to perform the selected instruction . In some examples performing an instruction includes entering a mode ; in some examples performing an instruction includes executing a command ; in some examples performing an instruction includes running an SD application ; performing an instruction includes includes running an SD application  and loading data (or in some examples a data file, or in some examples data attributes or conditions) from said SD or from a remote source; in some examples performing an instruction includes another feature , function , capability , etc. of the remotely controlled SD by known remote control means.","In some examples an SD receives a remote control instruction  and performs it  resulting in a new SD state , SD condition , SD data , etc. In some examples said updated SD state, condition, data, etc. is transmitted to the CD  under automated program control. Alternatively, in some examples an SD  acquires and transmits its updated state  when it receives  when it receives an instruction to do so  that is transmitted by a CD    , and is received and executed by an SD  .","In some examples said updated and transmitted SD state, condition, data, etc. does not need to be translated to be displayed  and\/or utilized   by said CD, so the updated and transmitted SD state, condition, data, etc. are transmitted to the SD   . In some examples said updated and transmitted SD state, condition, data, etc. needs to be translated in order to be displayed  and\/or utilized   by said CD, therefore in some examples said CD receives  said SD's transmission , determines if translation into a specific CD control application protocol or interface  is required , and performs said translation  (with said translation  described in more detail elsewhere, such as in ). In some examples no translation is required   of SD transmitted update(s), while in some examples translation is required   , and the SD's updated state, condition, data etc. is utilized to update the CD's control screen  four entering subsequent SD remote control instructions . Alternatively, in some examples translation of SD updates  is required   and said translation is performed at the SD   before said SD updates  are transmitted to the CD. Alternatively, in some examples translation of SD updates  is required   and said SD updates  are transmitted to an SD server or a third-party application or service which performs said translation remotely  .","In some examples a CD remains at an SD interface  where the CD's user may enter SD controls or instructions  until the control session is ended  , exited  , or terminated  . In some examples said control session may be ended   in some examples by timing out at the end of a period where an SD is not used; in some examples by being ended under program control when determined by an SD server, an SD service or another source; in some examples by timing out or being terminated when determined by the owner of the SD being used; in some examples at the end of a predetermined block of time such as for the free use of an SD in high demand; in some examples by other preprogrammed criteria; and in some examples by manual command(s).","Translate CD Instructions to SD, and SD Outputs to CD: Turning now to FIG. , \u201cRCTP\u2014Translate CD Instructions to an SD, and SD Outputs to CD,\u201d in some examples translation is not required for CD instructions to an SD, and in some examples translation is not required for SD outputs to a CD\u2014which provides direct means for remote control of an SD by a CD. In some examples, however, a networked SD capable of control can be managed and controlled by a CD even if said CD does not locally maintain in some examples control applications, and some examples viewer applications, in some examples communication protocols, or in some examples the SD's control instructions for remotely controlling every controllable SD. In some examples translation provides means for one or a plurality of RCTP implementations that may be implemented in one or a plurality of combinations of CDs and SD's.","In some examples a CD's instructions are translated into an SD's commands. Said process starts with a CD's control screen  for remote control of an SD (as described elsewhere). In some examples a CD user enters a remote control instruction  to be transmitted to an SD. In some examples a control instruction  is specific to a unique SD , and in some examples a control instruction  includes identification of the unique SD  under control and its address, such that a CD communicates directly with an SD. In some examples said control instruction  does not need translation  such as in some examples because it is already an SD control command; and said control instruction  is transmitted  directly to said SD  to perform the instruction . In some examples said control instruction  requires translation   which in some examples may be performed by the CD  , in some examples may be performed by the SD  , in some examples may be performed by an SD server , in some examples may be performed by a TPU server , in some examples may be performed by a third-party SD service , and in some examples may be performed by another application or resource.","Though said translation can be performed    in one of a plurality of apparatuses, applications or services; in some examples the instruction is translated into an industry standard protocol   , in some examples the instruction is translated into a proprietary protocol   , and in some examples the instruction is translated with a custom integration between the devices   .

In some examples an example task might include turning on one of these devices             , such as connecting it to a network  and downloading a VTP  and running a VTP , including in some examples storing the downloaded VTP  in the device's local storage for faster future use by that networked electronic device            .","VTP Processing (AIDs\/AODs): Turning now to , \u201cVTP Processing (AIDs\/AODs),\u201d in some examples one or a plurality of AIDs\/AODs   may connect by one or a plurality of disparate networks  with TP devices such as in some examples one or a plurality of LTP's ; in some examples one or a plurality of MTP's ; in some examples one or a plurality of RTP's ; in some examples one or a plurality of another type of networked electronic device  (as described elsewhere); and in some examples to utilize an RCTP on an LTP  or an MTP , selecting and controlling one or a plurality of subsidiary devices .","In some examples a VTP  comprises a VTP server that runs on a TP device (such as in some examples an LTP , in some examples an MTP , and in some examples an RTP ) or in some examples runs on another type of networked electronic device (such as a TP Server , Teleportal Utility, Teleportal Network Service, Web server , Web service , or other external means configured to provide Teleportal functions); a VTP client runs on one or a plurality of AIDs\/AODs   (such as in some examples an application running within a web browser , in some examples a downloadable application , in some examples a purchased software application  [e.g., an unmodifiable or customizable software product] that is sold by one or a plurality of vendors; in some examples an applet , in some examples a component within an application , in some examples a module within an application , in some examples a browser-based interface to a web service , in some examples a code-generated user interface and control application , and in some examples known means other than illustrated herein); that are coupled by one or a plurality of disparate networks  (such as in some examples the Internet , in some examples a local area network , in some examples a wide area network , in some examples the public switched telephone network , in some examples a cellular network , and in some examples another type of wired and\/or wireless network).","In some examples a VTP server is coupled to TP processing (as described elsewhere) performed by a TP device, by means of a TP command processing component that translates information from a VTP client into TP processing performed by a TP device; in some examples the output from said TP processing is processed for display by a VTP client by TP processing means as described elsewhere; and in some examples the TP command processing component transfers information in both directions between a TP device's network interface such as providing commands to TP processing as well as providing display output from TP output processing for VTP client display. In some examples a VTP server serves the needs or requests of one or a plurality of VTP clients, and may be instantiated in some examples as software, in some examples as hardware, in some examples as a software\/hardware system or subsystem, in some examples as a specialized device such as a rack-mounted VTP server; and just as other servers do a VTP server may utilize any known form of technology or programming to provide services to clients.","In some examples a VTP client includes an information client (such as in some examples a web browser and in some examples other means as described elsewhere) capable of requesting  and receiving a VTP app\/applet  from a VTP server or from another network-accessible source of VTP apps\/applets, or from another accessible storage means. In some examples that information client provides sufficient identification of the requesting AID\/AOD  and (optionally) sufficient identification of the requesting user's identity  so that the appropriate VTP app\/applet may be selected (as described elsewhere such as in some examples  through ) and downloaded to the AID\/AOD. In some examples prior to download one or a plurality of validation(s) are performed  such as in some examples identity authorization , device compatibility with that specific VTP , device capabilities such as its display interface , communications protocol , and\/or other validations . In some examples upon download  and initial execution  one or a plurality of validation(s) are performed  . In some examples upon execution  that information client defines a virtual machine environment that is hardware independent and operating system independent. In some examples the VTP client executes the downloaded VTP app\/applet  within its defined virtual machine environment to configure that AID\/AOD as a \u201cTP device controller\u201d that connects over the network with a VTP server, and communicates over the network to send commands  to the VTP server's TP command processing component  and receive display output from it  by means of those communications. In one example a VTP applet may be Java programming language code and the virtual machine environment can be created within a Java-enabled web browser.","In some examples a user employs a VTP client on an AID\/AOD  to enter commands  (e.g., requests for service) that are transmitted over the network to a VTP server where a TP command processing component  translates those commands into TP processing by a TP device or similar means ; and in some examples the TP device responds to those commands  as described elsewhere; and in some examples the TP command processing component transfers back over the network, to the VTP client, the resulting display output from TP output processing for display by the VTP client . In some examples a VTP client generates commands for monitoring  in some examples a TP device , in some examples an SPLS , in some examples a focused connection , and in some examples another process that a TP device performs . In some examples a TP device responds to selected commands  from a VTP client  received over the network by a VTP server and continuously transfers the resulting output over the network back to the VTP client . In one example a VTP client requests a focused connection with one of an SPLS's IPTR, such as with a specific identity, the TP device opens that focused connection and continuously updates that connection on the AID\/AOD by means of its VTP server and the VTP client. In some examples alternative means may be employed such as process control in which a VTP client Java applet generates a message or command  to a VTP server that includes an object manager that responds to the message or command , and invokes a method that controls a process  and\/or monitors a process  in a TP device, and provides an updated display for the VTP client .","In some examples the VTP client and VTP server process remain open and connected unless manually ended  , and in some examples the VTP client and VTP server process automatically end   after a timeout or other pre-specified ending trigger (and in some examples that automated ending trigger[s]  may be edited and saved). In some examples if a VTP client is ended  , exited   or terminated   that VTP client and its settings may be saved to a local AID\/AOD device, which will provide faster and more direct VTP uses in the future.","In some examples another alternative may be to enable one VTP server on one TP device to support a plurality of AID\/AODs simultaneously while they each run a separate VTP client. In other words, in some examples a plurality of AIDs\/AODs   simultaneously each run a VTP client  that together communicate with one VTP server that in turn utilizes   a single TP device's    processing , functions , capabilities , and outputs   to simultaneously support a plurality of separate VTP clients   , with each VTP client on one of a plurality of AIDs\/AODs  .","In some examples this parallels known uses of a client and server system that utilizes a single server to facilitate the simultaneous use of a plurality of clients. In one example of this a VTP server on a single TP device may enable multiple virtual machines  in which each virtual machine contains a TP command processing component  that translates the commands from one VTP client into TP processing by the TP device ; and in some examples the TP device responds separately to the commands  from each one virtual machine in a VTP server; and in some examples the resulting display output from TP output processing of that one virtual machine's commands are transferred back over the network to the appropriate single VTP client, for display by that VTP client  on its AID\/AOD.","In some examples a VTP server has multiple virtual machines  contained within, with each virtual machine capable of being connected to by one VTP client    running on one AID\/AOD. In some examples a user of a first AID\/AOD runs a VTP client  that has been previously downloaded and configured, which in turn communicates over one or a plurality of disparate networks and connects to a first virtual machine  running on a TP device's VTP server. In some examples the user of that first AID\/AOD employs its VTP client  interface and the I\/O means of that AID\/AOD (such as in some examples mouse clicks, in some examples keyboard input, in some examples touch screen, in some examples voice recognition, and in some examples any other user I\/O means) to input commands , data , etc. that are communicated to its respective virtual machine  on a VTP server. In some examples the first virtual machine in the VTP server receives data from that first AID's\/AOD's VTP client which is then processed by the TP device (as described elsewhere). In some examples a single refreshed display is produced by the TP device which the first virtual machine  in the VTP server communicates to the VTP client in the first AID\/AOD to update and refresh its display ; in some examples continuously updated video and audio are produced by the TP device which the first virtual machine  in the VTP server communicates continuously to the VTP client in the first AID\/AOD to continuously update the display of its video and the playing of its audio ; and in some examples other TP device processing may be output (such as in some examples bitmaps, in some examples images, in some examples user interface screens or component(s) of an interface screen(s), in some examples files, in some examples commands, in some examples other types or formats of data) which the first virtual machine  in the VTP server communicates to the VTP client  in the first AID\/AOD for delivery to the user and\/or for use by the user.","In some examples a second VTP client    simultaneously interacts with one VTP server that runs a plurality of virtual machines  within it, so that said second VTP client    interacts with a second dedicated virtual machine  within the VTP server. In some examples a plurality of VTP clients    simultaneously interact with one VTP server that runs a plurality of virtual machines  within it, so that each VTP client    interacts with one dedicated virtual machine  within the VTP server. In some examples by implementing a plurality of virtual machines  that each correspond to one VTP client   , a single VTP server facilitates Teleportaling and TP device use by a plurality of AID\/AOD users.","In some examples a TP device   may run a separate VTP server  for each VTP    that connects to it, with each VTP server capable of being connected to by one VTP client    running on one AID\/AOD  . Therefore, a plurality of VTP clients    on a plurality of AIDs\/AODs   simultaneously interact with one TP device   that runs a plurality of VTP servers  within it, so that each VTP client    interacts with one dedicated VTP server  within the TP device. In some examples by implementing a plurality of VTP servers  that each correspond to one VTP client   , a single TP device facilitates Teleportaling and TP device use by a plurality of AID\/AOD users.","In some examples a TP device   runs one or a plurality of VTP servers  where each VTP server runs one or a plurality of virtual machines  within it, so that each VTP server  may interact with one or a plurality of VTP clients   . Therefore, in some examples a plurality of VTP clients    simultaneously interact with a plurality of VTP servers on a single TP device   by means of a plurality of virtual machines  within said VTP servers, so that each VTP client    interacts with one dedicated virtual machine  within the plurality of VTP servers. In some examples by implementing a plurality of VTP servers wherein each may run a plurality of virtual machines  that each correspond to one VTP client   , a single TP device facilitates Teleportaling and TP device use by a plurality of AID\/AOD users.","In some examples a VTP server connected to a network receives the output from TP output processing and compresses it before communicating it over a network to a VTP client; in some examples that VTP client receives and decompresses the data received from the VTP server; in some examples a VTP client compresses its data before communicating it over a network to a VTP server; and in some examples one or a plurality of known means for compressing and decompressing said data are utilized.","In some examples the output display area of a Teleportal is larger than the smaller screen size of a specific AID\/AOD, and in such a case that VTP client sends specific data of the currently displayed area on the AID\/AOD (the portion displayed with respect to the full output display area of a Teleportal) to the virtual machine in the VTP server; in such a case the virtual machine in the VTP server prioritizes the order of the visual display blocks communicated (such as in some examples first communicating the currently displayable area of the AID\/AOD so that it is received and displayed first, in some examples second communicating the TP output display areas immediately adjacent to the currently displayed area of the AID\/AOD so said adjacent areas are rapidly available in the event a user wants to scroll in any direction, and in some examples third communicating the remaining TP output display areas) so that the current area where a user is viewing is updated first. In some examples continuous video and audio are output by a TP device (such as in some examples from a focused connection, in some examples from a constructed digital reality, in some examples from a TPDP event, and in some examples from another TP process that provides continuous real-time data), and in that case the communication priority is to continuously update the displayed AID\/AOD screen so that the available processing and bandwidth is focused on the current area and real-time interaction(s) viewed and\/or listened to by a user.","In some examples a VTP client sends a command or other data and in such a case that is given priority over other communications such that the command is executed immediately before other operations and\/or communications are continued, so that a dedicated virtual machine in a VTP server provides rapid responses to user commands. In some examples a VTP client issues a command that changes what will be displayed on the AID\/AOD, and that in turn interrupts and ends any video and\/or audio that are being sent by a VTP server, so that available processing and other resources, and available network bandwidth, may be directed to responding to said VTP client's command with the fastest speed available.","In some examples others alternatives for downloading a VTP may include in some examples detecting the presence of one or a plurality of local devices that may be controlled as a user moves into their proximity so that VTP control may be essentially transparent and in some examples \u201calways on\u201d (with such connectivity as described elsewhere such as with a TP URCI [Universal Remote Control Interface]); in some examples an AID\/AOD with one or a plurality of VTP's may store one or a plurality of identifiers for controllable devices for which it has already downloaded and set up VTP control, and in such a case executing a specific device's VTP may prompt a user for authentication or credentials prior to taking remote control; in some examples an AID\/AOD with one or a plurality of VTP's may store one or a plurality of identifiers for controllable devices for which it has already downloaded and set up VTP control, and in such a case automatically acquire remote control for one or a plurality of VTP controllable devices when a specific device's VTP is executed; in some examples a device may store one or a plurality of VIP's for controlling it and may download the appropriate VTP when requested by an authorized identity; in some examples when a device downloads an appropriate VTP to an AID\/AOD for controlling it, it may initiate an authentication and authorization process to confirm and validate the identity of the user who is taking control; in some examples when a device downloads an appropriate VTP and authenticates the user who has taken control, that authorization may be saved and stored for future rapid re-use in the device in some examples and in the VTP on the AID\/AOD in some examples.","In some examples to select a specific device's (AID's\/AOD's) VTP in some examples an AID\/AOD may transmit its type of device including data such as its manufacturer, model name, model number, etc.; in some examples a user may manually provide one or a plurality of data items such as in some examples a device's manufacturer, in some examples a device's model number, in some examples other device-specific data; in some examples to select a specific device's VTP a user may select a type of controllable device at a high level such as by choosing an icon or a name on a list, and that may automatically transmit sufficient device data, such as a model number to in some examples remote storage and in some examples directly to a device, sufficient to select and download the corresponding and appropriate VTP to the requesting AID\/AOD; in some examples remote storage may store one or a plurality of VTP's for controlling one or a plurality of remote devices, and it may download an appropriate VTP for a specific AID\/AOD to take control of the specific type controllable device it specifies; in some examples an AID\/AOD is configured to display a pick list of controllable devices in some examples directly and in some examples by running a stub application; in some examples an AID\/AOD may access a server through a network to download a pick list of controllable devices; in some examples a pick list of controllable devices includes a hierarchical list of manufacturers and models; in some examples when a controllable device is selected by any means, the AID\/AOD receives the users selection of a controllable device, transmits that data to a source of the corresponding VTP for that AID and that controllable device, and downloads the appropriate VTP; in some examples one or a plurality of these selection and downloading processes may be performed by any networked electronic device capable of the necessary steps such as in some examples a PC, in some examples a netbook, in some examples a laptop, in some examples an e-pad or e-tablet, in some examples a smart phone, or in some examples another type of networked electronic device.","VTP Connections with TP Devices: Turning now to , \u201cVTP Connections with TP Devices,\u201d some examples are illustrated of initiating VTP control of devices over a network. In some examples a VTP running on an AID\/AOD  provides means to access , control  and use  one or a plurality of features, functions and capabilities of controllable devices  . In some examples a VTP running on an AID\/AOD  provides means to extend one or a plurality of features of a Teleportal environment to one or a plurality of AIDs\/AODs , by allowing users to access and utilize their Teleportal environment from one or a plurality of locations by means of one or a plurality of devices.","In some examples an initial step is for an AID\/AOD  to run a VTP , and in some examples a next step is to select a TP device such as in some examples an LTP , in some examples an MTP , in some examples an RTP , and in some examples another networked electronic device capable of being controlled. In some examples a VTP  running on an AID\/AOD  presents one or a plurality of representations that each corresponds to a device that can be controlled  . In some examples a VTP  accepts a user's selection of a representation of a device and initiates direct communication with the device which receives that VTP request  from that AID\/AOD  ; in some examples any required identification, authorization and\/or credential is predetermined and pre-stored and included in said communication so that authorization and communication proceed rapidly and directly; and in some examples any required identification, authorization and\/or credential are required to be entered manually during each instance of use. In some examples a VTP  utilizes navigation and\/or search means such as an SD server  to select and request a specific controllable device and\/or a controllable function provided by a controllable device; in some examples the right to use a device may not be automatic so that in some examples this may require appropriate identification , in some examples authorization ; in some examples authentication , and in some examples other permissions steps as described elsewhere. In some examples when a VTP  utilizes navigation and\/or search means such as an SD server , in some examples other SD criteria  may be required and validated by means of predetermined settings  such as in some examples a paid use that is restricted to commercial users with an account  , in some examples a paid use that requires a prepaid fee or a paid ticket  , in some examples usage may be restricted to members of an authorized group  , in some examples usage may require agreeing to accept sponsor(s) advertisements  , and in some examples other types of predetermined settings  ; and if settings conditions  are met then VTP usage proceeds \u2014which in some examples includes monitoring  and\/or logging . In some examples a VTP  may request direct connection with the controllable device , or in some examples a VTP may request connection by means of an SD server  , and in some examples said VTP requests are denied in which case said VTP connection is blocked .","In some examples a VTP connection  between an AID\/AOD  and a controllable device   is established, in which case the AID\/AOD  displays an appropriate user interface   (as described elsewhere); which in some examples includes a subset of the controllable device's interface ; in some examples includes a consistent look and feel with other Teleportal interfaces ; in some examples displays available Teleportal functions and capabilities  (as described elsewhere); and in some examples represents selectable functions, applications, data, services, etc. on the controllable device  (herein controllable functions). In some examples a VTP accepts a user selection of a controllable function  and sends that user selection    to the controlled device    (as described elsewhere). In some examples the controllable function is processed by the controlled device   , which produces a result that represents the device's response  (which may include a continuous video and audio response such as from a focused connection or from a broadcast reception), and that response of the controlled device to the user's selection is communicated   to update the VTP display on the AID\/AOD   . In some examples the user enters another command  which continues the process         ; and in some examples the user exits the VTP and ends the connection.","In some examples an AID\/AOD  is employing a VTP  to utilize a controllable device   which has one or a plurality of open SPLS(s); and in some examples a remote SPLS member opens a focused connection on the controlled device  . In this case in some examples the AID\/AOD  displays the focused connection by means of the communications link   between the controlled device   and the VTP; in some examples the controlled device   performs appropriate processing of the focused connection , produces appropriate output(s) , and sends said output(s) to the VTP    which displays it on the AID\/AOD ; and in some examples said user employs the VTP on the AID\/AOD  to interact with the identity in the focused connection, with the above process handling the focused connection in accordance with its processing and communications while monitoring for other commands from the user  .","In some examples a separate server, application, Web service, or other resource performs one or a plurality of the required steps. For one example a network application may provide means for an more basic AID\/AOD  with limited functions to run a VTP that has limited capabilities while still controlling a full-featured TP device  ; such as in some examples the network application receiving the command from the VTP   and transmitting it to the TP device     where it is processed  and its output  is transmitted  to the network application; then transforming the received output in real-time to a format suitable for the more basic AID\/AOD .","Adapted VTP Interface Processing: Turning now to , \u201cAdapted VTP Interface Processing,\u201d some examples are illustrated of alternatives for providing one or a plurality of interface adaptations that are created in real-time for to fit the output capability(ies) of one or a plurality of AIDs\/AODs  such as in some examples mobile phones , in some examples personal computers , in some examples laptops , in some examples netbooks , in some examples e-tablets or e-pads , in some examples networked televisions , in some examples set-top boxes for cable television or satellite television , in some examples wearable networked computing and broadcasting devices , and in some examples other types of wired and\/or wireless networked electronic devices .","In some examples a generalized VTP  that can initiate one or a plurality of connections with one or a plurality of controllable networked electronic devices    is run; in some examples a specific VTP  that is adapted to a specific AID\/AOD  is selected (as described elsewhere) and run; in some examples a VTP is downloaded to an AID\/AOD  (as described elsewhere) and run ; in some examples a VTP has previously been downloaded and stored on an AID\/AOD  (as described elsewhere) is run ; and in some examples a VTP is run  and executed by an AID\/AOD .

In some examples a TP UIA is an application; in some examples at TP UIA is a module; in some examples at TP UIA is a component; in some examples at TP UIA is a system; in some examples at TP UIA is a process; in some examples at TP UIA is a method; in some examples at TP UIA is a service, etc.","In some examples a VTP server generates and transmits an appropriate user interface for display by the VTP   on that AID\/AOD; and in some examples a TP UIA generates and transmits an adapted user interface for display by the VTP   on a specific AID\/AOD.

In some examples a GUI entity adaptation is required  and the TP UIA analyzer searches for a match between the TP device's GUI entity that requires adaptation and a known GUI entity that may be displayed in the VTP interface, and if a match is found it performs said adaptation in the interface layout ; in some examples the TP UIA analyzer continues with each subsequent GUI entity  until an adapted VTP interface is completed and transmitted  for display in the VTP interface .","In some examples a GUI entity adaptation is required  and the TP UIA analyzer searches for a match between the TP device's GUI entity that requires adaptation but is unable to find a match ; in some examples additional TP UIA adaptation is required  and the TP UIA analyzer may search and retrieve additional adaptations data  (such as in some examples additional settings for that specific AID\/AOD , in some examples additional GUI entities adaptations for one or a plurality of interfaces on that specific AID\/AOD , in some examples additional interface layouts specific to the required GUI entity adaptation , and in some examples additional adaptations data that may be available from one or a plurality of remote databases ). In some examples an appropriate match is found  and the required adaptation is performed  in the interface layout and an adapted VTP interface is completed   and transmitted  for display in the VTP interface . In some examples a match is not found  and in some examples a substitute layout is selected for the set of GUI entities that can be displayed , and a sufficient adapted VTP interface can be produced   and transmitted  for display in the VTP interface .","In some examples where GUI entity adaptations are required  and a VTP interface cannot be adapted  (such as by in some examples attempting to utilize predetermined retrieved data  that included known interface adaptations, in some examples by searching and retrieving additional adaptations data  from remote databases, and in some examples by selecting and utilizing a substitute layout for the set of GUI entities that can be displayed ), then in some examples a Web browser-based interface may be utilized . In some examples in which an AID\/AOD  has an Internet browser capability, a TP UIA    that runs on the same TP device as a VTP server and may be employed to construct a Web browser-based interface . For one example, a VTP web browser-based interface  may be broadly and generically constructed  using Web technology such as DHTML web pages that are displayed by a web browser on the AID\/AOD. In this example a TP UIA may convert a TP device's output  into DHTML web pages  that send   the adapted Web browser-based interface  to a VTP for display  by an AID\/AOD  that has an Internet browser (which may display the adapted interface regardless of its operating system, its communications connection[s], etc., such as in some examples a mobile phone , in some examples a PC , in some examples a laptop , in some examples an e-pad  or an e-tablet , in some examples a network game system , in some examples a networked television , or in some examples another type of networked electronic device ) with some adaptations that result from the screen size and other factors specific to each AID\/AOD  . In some examples said VTP monitors GUI events within said VTP browser-based web page(s)  on the AID\/AOD  for user commands  and sends said user commands   to the TP device  for processing , with output conversion .","In some examples in which an AID\/AOD  has an Internet browser capability, a TP UIA    or in some examples a different web browser interface conversion application  may run on a different device that is connected by one or a plurality of disparate networks to a controlled TP device and to an AID\/AOD that is running a VTP. In some examples said web browser interface conversion application  may reside and run on a networked web server or other third-party application that is remote from a TP device and is also remote from the AID\/AOD; in such a case the conversion application  may receive a TP device's output via a network connection, process it into one or a plurality of appropriate web pages for a specific AID\/AOD, and communicate   said adapted interface to the VTP that displays the adapted Web browser-based interface  running on the AID's\/AOD's Internet web browser . In some examples said VTP monitors GUI events within said VTP browser-based web page(s)  on the AID\/AOD  for user commands  and sends said user commands   to the TP device  for processing , with output conversion  on the remote device via a network.","In some examples a VTP server (or a virtual machine within a VTP server) accepts processed output from the TP device and continuously processes GUI entities as received, and consolidates overlapping and adjacent GUI entities into the minimal set required to update that portion(s) of the VTP client interface (which may reflect the highest current priority part[s] of an application, feature, function, etc. being run by a TP device based on the command[s] of a VTP client such as in some examples the video and audio interactions in a focused connection); and said VTP server updates the VTP client as each set of GUI entities is completed and available for transmission. In some examples a VTP client running on an AID\/AOD receives interface updates in the manner of a Web client, that is by polling a VTP server to request updates; and in some examples a VTP server (or a virtual machine within a VTP server) accepts processed output from a TP device, constructs the VTP interface and buffers the constructed interface until a VTP client request is received, at which time it is transmitted to the VTP client. In some examples a VTP server (or a virtual machine within a VTP server) runs an additional TP UIA to provide an adaptive VTP interface so that TP device output fits the display capability(ies) of one or a plurality of disparate AIDs\/AODs.","In some examples adaptive interface processing by means of a TP UIA proceeds according to retrieved settings and data   to produce transmitted processed results  that are displayed by a VTP client . In some examples changes are required in that adaptive interface processing     in order to produce transmitted processed results  that are displayed via a VTP client ; and in some examples said adapted interface processing changes are automatically saved  in some examples to the TP UIA  for automated future retrieval and use    , and in some examples to remote databases  for automated future retrieval and use    . In some examples the saving of said changes  may prompt a user to manually authorize saving the changes made in adaptive interface processing     so that the user's judgment determines whether or not to save the new adaptive interface changes to a local TP UIA  and\/or to remote databases . In some examples said processes for retrieving, using and saving changes to adaptive interface processing enables the extension of adaptive VTP interface processing to additional and\/or evolving AID\/AOD devices, interfaces, display technologies and capabilities.","In some examples an AID\/AOD may run one or a plurality of VTP's; in some examples a TP device may run one or a plurality of VTP servers (as described elsewhere); in some examples a VTP server may run a plurality of virtual machines that each support a separate AID\/AOD (as described elsewhere) and each virtual machine may run a separate TP UIA to adapt the TP device's output to each specific AID\/AOD. Therefore, in some examples one or a plurality of VTP(s), one or a plurality of VTP server(s) and one or a plurality of TP UIA instances may combine to enable one or a plurality of AIDs\/AODs to simultaneously receive adaptive interfaces while controlling and\/or using one or a plurality of TP devices such as in some examples one-to-one (one AID\/AOD to one TP device); in some examples many-to-one (a plurality of AIDs\/AODs to one TP device); in some examples one-to-many (one AID\/AOD to a plurality of TP devices); and in some examples many-to-many (a plurality of AIDs\/AODs to a plurality of TP devices).","In some examples a TP device's output  can be both adapted to a specific AID\/AOD  and also modified by means of additional post-processing such as in some examples utilizing post-processing to add advertising or other marketing messages (as described elsewhere); in some examples utilizing post-processing to blend in the appearance of a new person or object (as described elsewhere); in some examples utilizing post-processing to remove a person or object (as described elsewhere); in some examples utilizing post\u2014processing to change the behavior of an interface component such as a widget (such as in some examples altering commercially significant data such as which vendor's online store receives a user's purchase actions); in some examples utilizing post\u2014processing to make a combination of changes such as replacing displayed advertisements and changing the online store visited by any remaining advertisements; and in some examples performing other transformations (as described elsewhere). In some examples said additional post-processing transformations are performed by the same TP device as runs the VTP server. In some examples said additional post-processing transformations are performed by a different device such as in some examples an application server, in some examples a third-party service, etc.; and in some examples said different device is connected by one or a plurality of disparate networks to receive the formatted output from a controlled TP device, and also to transmit the additionally post-processed output to one or a plurality of AIDs\/AODs that run one or a plurality of VTP's. In some examples said post-processing may be visible such as in some examples the user of a receiving AID\/AOD may be informed of the additional post-processing; and in some examples said additional post-processing may be unspoken and performed by intercepting VTP server output and providing one or a plurality of alterations (such as insertions and\/or deletions) without informing the one or a plurality of users who receive and view such altered output(s).","SD SERVERS\u2014PRODUCTIVITY FACILITY: A further object of RCTP and VTP is to provide means to aggregate the availability of a plurality of SD's for control by a plurality of CDs, and in some examples provide means to find available SD's (such as in some examples by maps, in some examples by search, in some examples by categories, in some examples by lists, in some examples by menus, in some examples by API's for third-party applications, in some examples by API's for third-party services, in some examples by other types of navigation); in some examples provide means to learn about available SD's; in some examples provide means to find and use SD's immediately; in some examples provide means to find and schedule SD's in the future; in some examples by automated alerts and\/or notifications of the availability of pre-selected SD's, etc. In some examples these may be named an SD Server, in some examples SD Service, in some examples \u201cHave It All\u201d Center, in some examples \u201cEnjoy It All\u201d Center, in some examples \u201cDo It All\u201d Center, or in some examples other names and interfaces may be utilized to make visible aggregated SD's as visible, accessible, navigable, usable, and schedulable by a plurality of users, customers, members, subscribers, etc. In some examples an SD Server(s), an SD Service(s), a \u201cHave It All\u201d Center, etc. may be provided as an independent system, method, process, server, service, etc. In some examples an SD Server(s), an SD Service(s), a \u201cHave It All\u201d Center, etc. may be provided as a client(s), module(s), component(s), widget(s), etc. that may be provided by a separate application(s), service(s), network(s), portal(s), etc.","As a result, in some examples one or a plurality of SD Servers may help advance a digital environment that supports the classic definition of productivity: producing more (and doing more) with fewer resources at lower costs. In some examples this may produce the equivalent of greater wealth for consumers because they can accomplish as much or more, while spending less. In addition, SD Servers may increase the revenues or wealth of some companies and\/or individuals because they may earn new income from the SD's they own\u2014providing their SD's, when not in use, to others for varying fees while collectively earning new revenues from making their SD's available.","Therefore, in some examples one or a plurality of SD Servers may enable fewer resources to be used such as producing one or a plurality of fewer electronic devices (such as in some examples subsidiary devices as described elsewhere), fewer licenses for application software (such as in some examples office software, productivity software, creation software [for words, music, movies, photos, databases, etc.] and other types of software applications), fewer copies of digital content (such as in some examples music, movies, TV shows, books, magazines, and other digital content), and utilize those SD's already paid for services (such as in some examples communications, teleconferencing, databases, search, e-mail, etc.) which together lowers costs for consumers who do not need to buy as much of any of these\u2014while still being able to access and use the quantity needed of one or a plurality of these when they need them.","However, if greater usage is stimulated in some examples one or a plurality of SD Servers may enable a larger number of networked electronic devices to be produced (such as in some examples subsidiary devices as described elsewhere), more licenses for application software (such as in some examples office software, productivity software, creation software [for words, music, movies, photos, databases, etc.] and other types of software applications), more copies of digital content (such as in some examples music, movies, TV shows, books, magazines, and other digital content), and greater utilization of those SD's for services that require additional payments (such as in some examples communications, teleconferencing, databases, search, e-mail, etc.) which may still lower costs for consumers who do not need to buy as much of any of these\u2014while still being able to access and use a greater quantity needed of one or a plurality of these when they need them.","The affected industries include industries such as electronic devices, application software, digital content, and various network and digital services). No longer would each customer be required to purchase their own unit(s) of each type of device, software, application, content, and service. Instead, the impact of substantial productivity advances on the leading vendors in these industries can be profound. The advent of a higher productivity digital environment with SD Servers might their alter these and other related industries by turning numerous products into immediately available, reservable and schedulable commodity services.
