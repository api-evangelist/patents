No. 10\/162,470, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,558,820, filed on Jun. 4, 2002, which application claims priority from Japanese patent application No. 2001-167815 filed on Jun. 4, 2001 and Japanese patent application No. 2002-8278 filed on Jan. 17, 2002. The disclosures of all said applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a log collecting\/analyzing system, a method of log collection, a log collection program, a method of log analysis, a log analysis program, a log collecting device, a log analyzing device, a log collection terminal device and a log server, all of which include separated functions of collecting log information and analyzing the collected log information, and in which the log information is collected at a client side and transmitted to a server side, and the server side stores the log information to analyze.","2. Related Art","Conventional log collecting\/analyzing systems are used for the purpose of observing something in systems for providing certain services. For instance, if a log collecting\/analyzing system is applied to some on-line system, it is possible to ascertain how unfair access, systems faults or so forth occurred by analyzing the log. In addition, if the log collecting\/analyzing system is applied to a WWW (World Wide Web) server, it is possible to record details like what a client referred to, when, and what contents by analyzing the log. And, as a result, it becomes possible to learn the interest level of the user with respect to the contents for example.","However, in the conventional log collecting\/analyzing systems described-above, when the contents for servicing are determined first, the contents for observing are also fixed depending on the determined contents for servicing. And, as a result, the collected log information requires a specialized analysis system. Accordingly, an analyzing system for observing the log at the on-line system is entirely different from an analyzing system for the log of the WWW server, for instance.","In addition, as for the method of log collection itself, an exclusive design and mounting are provided in every service system. For this reason, although only the basic function of collecting the log is desired, subtle differences are generated on log collection items. As a result, an exclusive design and mounting is required for every service as for the basic collecting system.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a log collecting\/analyzing system, a method for log collection, a log collection program, a method for log analysis, a log analysis program, a log collecting device, a log analyzing device, a log collection terminal device and a log server, all of which are capable of performing flexible log collection and analysis without being a fixed log system as before.","A log collecting\/analyzing system can have a configuration in which a client terminal device collects log information and transmits collected log information to a log server via a network, and then the log server stores the received log information to analyze. In addition, the client terminal device can be provided with a function for forming the basic structure of a log, a function for generating desired log information from the basic structure of the log and a function for transmitting the generated log information to the log server","Namely, the log collection function can be separated into a basic collection function and a specific collection\/analysis function, so that the basic log collection function is capable of being used as a common log collection function. According to this configuration, the log collecting\/analyzing system using the log collection function may not need to conduct mounting of its basic function. In addition, it may be possible to design and mount specific collection\/analysis functions more easily by using this basic collection function. As a result, it may be possible to collect effective logs. In addition, it may be possible to establish a common log form as well as a common analysis function.","In addition, log collection had an aspect in which utilization at an on-line system was taken to be an assumption. Heretofore, because utilization at the server side of service system was the main utilization. However, the log collection analysis function of the log system can be separated into a function of log collection for the client side and a function of log analysis for the server side. The client side can conduct collection of the log and the server side can conduct analyses of the log. The client side in such case can be capable of collecting the log in an off-line condition.","Preferred embodiments of the invention are described in detail below, with reference being made to the accompanying drawings. A specific embodiment to which the present invention is applied will be described in detail below, referring to the accompanying drawings.","The present embodiment provides an entirely new example of a log collecting\/analyzing system in which a client side collects log information and transmits the collected log information to a server side, and the server side stores therein the transmitted log information to analyze. Namely, the present invention separates the function of the log collecting\/analyzing system into two functions of collecting a log and storing\/analyzing the collected log, in which the client side collects logs while the server side stores and analyzes the logs.","In addition, the function of the client side is to establish the basic structure of the log and then generate desired log information from the basic structure of the log. On the other hand, the function of the log server is to execute storage-analysis of the received log information and then analyze the log information in every application program.","The Configuration of the Entire Log Collecting\/Analyzing System","In the first place, the rough flow of log collection, analysis and provision in the log collecting\/analyzing system will be described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","4","5","5"]},"In the log collecting\/analyzing system illustrated in , the log collection terminal devices  to  collect logs and store the logs therein temporarily. The log collection terminal devices  to  transmit log information that is collected and stored therein to log server  via the network . The log server  is provided with log storage area  for storing the received log information. The log server  reads out the stored log information from the log storage area  and then executes analysis processing of the log information before storing the analyzed result in the log storage area  again.","It should be noted that respective procedures for analysis processing executed by the log server  are defined by log collection service utilizing companies  to . In addition, the design and mounting are established so that the collection program when conducting log collection and analysis processing corresponds to the log collection side and the log analysis side, respectively.","Here, consideration is made in connection with the case that the log collection service utilizing companies  to  require an analyzed result of the log. At this time, to begin with, the log collection service utilizing companies  to  input acquisition requirements of the analyzed result to the log server  via the network . The log server  which has received the acquisition requirements from the log collection service utilizing companies  to  authenticates the log collection service utilizing companies  to  connected to the network and then adopts or rejects companies  to  on the basis of the authentication result. After that, the log server  transmits the log analyzed result to the authenticated companies. It should be noted that a plurality of log collection service utilizing companies are connectable to the log server  via the network . Then, the log server  is capable of transmitting the log analyzed result to any of the log collection service utilizing companies  to  that are authenticated to be connected to the log server  via the network .","Log Collection Terminal Device (Client Side)","Configuration of Log Collection Terminal Device","The following describes the configuration of the log collection terminal devices  to .  illustrates the internal configuration of one log collection terminal device. The log collection terminal device comprises image\/sound control unit , CPU (central calculation processing unit) , communication control unit , media control unit , RAM , external memory control unit , input control unit , and HDD (magnetic recording medium)  as principal configuration elements, in which these respective elements are connected with each other via a bus.","The image\/sound control unit  controls the image output to a monitor unit that is not illustrated and the voice output to a speaker and so forth, or the input from a video camera and a microphone. The CPU  controls the total operation of the log collection terminal device. The communication control unit  that is connected to the network  illustrated in  controls communications executed between the communication control unit  and the network . The media control unit  controls a media drive which is not illustrated, in that the media control unit  inputs therein signals from external recording media such as a CD-ROM and\/or a DVD-ROM and so forth loaded in the media drive, or the media control unit  writes signals to the external recording media.","The HDD  records various kinds of programs for realizing the log collection processing of the present embodiment and\/or various kinds of data. The RAM  stores therein a program read out from the HDD  and\/or data utilized during execution of various kinds of processing. The external memory control unit  is connected to nonvolatile memory  existing at an external part of the log collection terminal device. The external memory unit  controls the transmission\/reception of the data as well as the write\/read of the data between the external memory control unit  and the memory . The input control unit  controls user interface input units, such as a keyboard, mouse, and so forth that are not illustrated.","Flow of Processing at the Time of Log System Utilization According to the Log Collection Terminal Device","The flow of processing (principally, processing of an application part according to the present invention) at the log collection terminal device will be explained using . It should be noted that the processing illustrated in  is mainly achieved by the function of the CPU mounted in the log collection terminal device. First, as the processing of STEP S, the log collection terminal device initializes the log collecting\/analyzing system illustrated  in order to permit utilization of the log collecting\/analyzing system. In this initialization, determinations are made in which the log collection terminal device ascertains the log user in order to use the log collecting\/analyzing system, the log collection terminal device determines whether it is capable of using the log collecting\/analyzing system, and so forth. When the processing in the log collection terminal device is completed, initialization of the application is executed as the processing of STEP S.","When the initialization of the application is completed, the log collection terminal device provides main processing (application main processing) of the application as the processing of STEP S. It should be noted that the application main processing will be described later. Then, the log collection terminal device, when the application main processing is completed, executes processing to terminate utilization of the log collecting\/analyzing system as the processing of STEP S. According to this termination processing, the log collection terminal device stores the log information maintained in the RAM  for the sake of the log collecting\/analyzing system in the HDD  and so forth. Further, the log collection terminal device releases resources that are used for the log collecting\/analyzing system. After that, the log collection terminal device conducts termination processing of the application of the present embodiment as the processing of STEP S. After that, the log collection terminal devices  to  are in a condition in which they are capable of being terminated.","Initialization of the Log Collection Terminal Device for the Use of the Log Collecting\/Analyzing System","The following describes details of the processing to enable utilization of the log collecting\/analyzing system as conducted in STEP S of .  illustrates a flowchart for initialization processing of the log collection terminal device to enable utilization of the log collecting\/analyzing system. First, the log collection terminal device conducts login processing of the log user as the processing of STEP S. This login processing is necessary processing for identifying the user who is using the log collecting\/analyzing system, and the processing provides information concerning the user so that the user is identified.","In the identification processing of STEP S, when the user is not registered as a log user, log user registration processing is conducted in the processing of STEP S. In this registration processing, the log collection analysis terminal device, to determine whether double registration of the user is being conducted, compares information registered beforehand with information input by the log user registration whether the user is an unfair user, and so forth. Then, in the processing of STEP S, when user registration has been successful, the log collection terminal device continues log system initialization. In the processing of STEP S, if the user registration is not made for some reason, the log collection terminal device interrupts the log system initialization and sets the log system in a use prohibition condition in the processing of STEP S. Thereafter, the log collection terminal device concludes the log system initialization.","On the other hand, in the processing of STEP S, when registration as a log user is successful, the log collection terminal device inputs therein log user information stored in, for instance, the HDD  and\/or the nonvolatile memory  as the processing of STEP S. Further, the log collection terminal device inputs therein log system utilization title information as the processing of STEP S.","Then, the log collection terminal device determines whether the log system can be utilized as the processing of STEP S. It should be noted that this determination is conducted to control the period of using the log system. For instance, in cases where certain log service is established so as to provide service for only one month, if, for instance, the service period of the log collecting\/analyzing system has been concluded, it is no longer possible to transmit the log to the log server . Therefore, the log collection terminal device determines whether the log collecting\/analyzing system may be used in order to forestall the occurrence of such condition.","When it is determined in STEP S that the log collecting\/analyzing system cannot be utilized, the operation of the log collection terminal device proceeds to processing of STEP S, in which the log system is set in the use prohibition condition. This use prohibition condition is one in which the log collection terminal device overrides the recording of the log in the log collecting\/analyzing system, and the function of transmitting the log to the log server , and so forth. Thus, when the log collecting\/analyzing system is set to the use prohibition condition, an application that employs the log collecting\/analyzing system is capable of executing processing in the same way as during normal functioning regardless of whether the log collecting\/analyzing system is effective or ineffective. However, the specific processing to record logs and\/or transmit logs is not executed. Namely, the log collection terminal device realizes control of the use prohibition condition in such a way as to internally control whether the processing to record logs and to transmit logs is affected.","On the other hand, when it is determined that the log collecting\/analyzing system is capable of being used at STEP S, the log collection terminal device executes transmission processing of logs that have not yet been transmitted as the processing of STEP S.","The present invention is characterized in that it is possible to realize the function of collecting logs in an off-line environment. The processing of STEP S relates to the function of collecting logs in an off-line environment. Namely, when the log collection terminal device is always connected to the network , it is possible to process surely the transmission of a log to the log server , while when the network  is interrupted, or when it is not possible to transmit log information to the log server  because of some kind of obstacle, the log collection terminal device stores the log information temporarily, and then transmits the log again when the network  or the log server  is restored to a normal condition. The processing of STEP S is one in which the retransmission function is realized.","Record of Log User Information","Next, information registered as log user information and the registered position thereof are explained.","If the log user information is recorded in nonvolatile recording media on the log collection terminal device, any recording position is permitted. For instance, it is possible to record the log user information in the nonvolatile memory  or the HDD  illustrated in , or on writable media controlled by the media control unit . However, when convenience and\/or confidentiality are taken into consideration, recording in the nonvolatile memory  is desirable because information recorded in a nonvolatile memory may be easily utilized for login processing at another log collection terminal device. It is assumed in the present embodiment that the log user information is recorded in the nonvolatile memory . In the present embodiment, each user is assigned a nonvolatile memory  and each user uses the nonvolatile memory , whereby the log collection terminal device is capable of identifying respective log users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["22","23","24","25","26","27","28","28","28","28","21","21","21"]},"Login Processing","The login processing of STEP S illustrated in  will now be explained. A flowchart of this login processing is illustrated in . First, as the processing of STEP S, the log collection terminal device allows a monitor unit (not illustrated) to display a login screen , as illustrated in  for example. The log collection terminal device causes the login screen  to display user ID display line  and password input line . The user ID display line  displays the ID that is recorded in the authentication card  (nonvolatile memory ). The password input line  is where the log user inputs the password .","In addition, the log collection terminal device determines whether the log user has the authentication card  at the time of the processing of STEP S. Namely, the log collection terminal device determines whether the log user has the authentication card  by detecting whether the authentication card  is connected to the external memory control unit , and whether the log user information is recorded within the authentication card .","In STEP S, when the log collection terminal device determines that the log user does not have the authentication card , the log collection terminal device regards the log user as a new one, and then moves the processing to the new registration processing of STEP S. On the other hand, when the log collection terminal device determines that the log user has the authentication card  at STEP S, the log collection terminal device determines that the log user already has been registered as a log user, and then the log collection terminal device moves the processing to the processing of STEP S. When proceeding to the processing of STEP S, the log collection terminal device inputs therein the log user ID  from the authentication card  and then causes the log user ID  to be displayed on the user ID display line .","Next, the log collection terminal device, in STEP S, takes in the password  input by the log user. The log collection terminal device then verifies the password  in STEP S. It should be noted that the password  is input via an input unit, such as a keyboard and so forth. When the result of verifying the password  in STEP S is that the password input by the log user does not agree with the registered password, the log collection terminal device causes the processing to move to the processing of STEP S in which login failure processing is conducted. In this login failure processing, it is possible to request input of the password  again or it is possible to simply terminate processing as a login failure. It should be noted that it is assumed in the present embodiment that the login is terminated as a result of the login failure processing of STEP S.","When the result of verifying the password  in STEP S is that the password input by the log user agrees with the registered password, the log collection terminal device determines that user authentication is completed, and then executes login success processing as the processing of STEP S. After that, the log collection terminal device terminates the login processing. It should be noted that in the login success processing in STEP S, for instance, a screen indicating success in login and so forth may be displayed.","System Configuration of a Log Collection Terminal Device",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":"7"},"The program illustrated in  comprises an application  for utilizing the log system, a log system basic function processing unit  for providing the basic functions of the log collecting\/analyzing system and an operating system  for operating the log collecting\/analyzing system, in which the upper side and lower side relationship illustrated in FIG.  means that the function positioned at an upper order utilizes the function of a lower order.","The log system basic function processing unit  is separated into several processing units. Login interface management unit  manages a login interface . The login interface , which is independently defined by the log collection service utilizing companies  to  for utilizing collected log information, executes processing for outputting a log that is specialized in accordance with the respective log service. When the application  requires the login interface , the login interface management unit  is initialized to provide the desired login interface .","Log object processing unit  is a unit for controlling the function of the log object as being basics of the log. Log object transmission unit  is a unit for controlling the processing to transmit log information to the log server . Log object management unit  is a unit for managing the log itself, such as a storage area of the log object, elimination processing thereof and so forth. For instance, when executing storage of logs, the log object management unit  specifies an appropriate position for the storage. Also, on the occasion of eliminating an unnecessary log, the log object management unit  controls the elimination.","Configuration of a Log Object",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["40","40","41","1","4","42","45","41","40","1","4","42","45","38","40"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["41","41","46","47","46","47"]},"Next, the configuration of the log data  to  ( to ) is explained using the example of .  illustrates the configuration of the log data  () which is divided into nodes and elements having a tree structure. The node is capable of including nodes or elements. It should be noted that the node cannot be utilized as a terminal device. On the other hand, the element is capable of being utilized as a terminal device and capable of including arbitrary data. The node  is a root node, and the front of the log data refers to the front node of the root node . The node  includes element  at a lower position.","The log data  to  ( to ) are capable of adopting an arbitrary log structure as a result of managing the tree structure. Here, in the present embodiment, XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is utilized as the specification for defining this tree structure.  illustrates one example thereof. This  illustrates an example in which is recorded a selected play mode and the number of utilization of the play mode in a certain application such as a video game and so forth. The tag <playDate> in  indicates data as to when the user takes the log, and the tag <mode> records the play mode name that is used in this case (indicated by the tag <name>) and the number of uses thereof (indicated by the tag <selectedTimes>). This example indicates that the record is one in which PracticeMode is used three times at 2000, 12,","When extracting data from this log data, it is possible to retrieve desired data by following the tag. Here,  illustrates an example of the case in which the log object illustrated in  is expressed as XML. In the example of , <info> tag  describes both the log application ID (hereinafter referred to as log appli. ID ) for indicating the log application program (hereinafter referred to as the log appli.) that generates the log object and the log user ID  indicating the user to become the object of the log.","In addition, the log related to the login interface is described in <DATA> tag . That is, the <DATA> tag  illustrated in  describes that this tag is one which is generated by the login interface indicated by interface ID. Further, the inside of the <DATA> tag  describes the log itself constituted by the login interface indicated by the interface ID. The shape of the <DATA> tag  at this time is like the one illustrated in . Accordingly, if these tags are followed, it is possible to retrieve desired data. It should be noted that these IDs are utilized in order to homologize the analysis interface used on the occasion that the analysis of the log is executed onto the log at the log server  later.","Relationship Between Login Interface and Service","The tree structure of the log illustrated in  is also capable of being output directly from respective applications. However, when preparing such configuration in every application, there may be problems that programs for forming the tree structure are redundant. In addition, since pre-arrangements for recording the log are large, development efficiency decreases. Since the development of programs for forming the tree structure in every respective application causes bad efficiency, the present embodiment enhances development efficiency of the application by providing programs for forming the tree structure as a library.","In order to solve the above object, the present invention separates functions such as preparation, storage and so forth of basic structures of the log as basic functions, further designing and mounting specific recorded parts of the log at the application side that utilizes its basic function as a login interface, whereby the present invention realizes an effective log collecting\/analyzing system capable of flexibly coping with various kinds of uses.","That is, in the present embodiment, the login interface  illustrated in  provides the above-described log data  to . The login interface  described in the present embodiment is a program that is designed and mounted in order to collect and record logs, in which the login interface  functions as an API (Application Programming Interface) between the application  illustrated in  and the log system basic function processing unit . This library with the login interface  mounted allows a log basic library for preparing a basic tree structure on the inside thereof to access, in which the log basic library outputs the result and receives in accordance with a determined format. In addition, the log basic library hierarchically constructs the log and then designs and loads a specialized log for the application program.","Here, the login interface  is specifically designed depending on the necessary log contents, and one example thereof is illustrated in . In the login interface  illustrated in , API  is one in which the date of use is recorded. At the side of the application , it is possible to generate the <PlayDate> tag by accessing this API . In addition, it is possible for the application  to prepare the <mode> tag and the following structure bodies by accessing the API . It should be noted that, as for the API , device is slightly added in this mounting in that, when a mode with the same name is used, 1 is added to the record of the number of times of use. Thus, according to the mounting of the login interface  of the present embodiment, the side of the application  can manage data desired to be recorded, and also the side of the login interface  is capable of managing the data desired to be recorded. Thus, any of them is capable of recording necessary data.","Next, the storage method of the above-described log object including logs will be described using . Log objects are recorded in a nonvolatile storage area such as HDD20, a flash memory and so forth. In the present embodiment, log objects are recorded in authentication card . In addition, the log object is managed in every application unit in which the log object is used. Namely, the log object is managed in its storage area in every application with the shape of title , title , . . . illustrated in , in which the logs are registered to those respective areas. For instance, log storage area  illustrated in  is managed for the sake of application of title , and log  is registered to the area  in that the application utilizes the log .","The log object is stored with a structure as illustrated on the right side of . Namely, the log object consists of a transmission flag , a log object size 58 and a log object . The transmission flag  records conditions when transmitting logs to the log server . Thus, the transmission flag  has three conditions of, for instance, un-transmitted, finished transmission and in transmission. The un-transmitted condition means that the log has not yet been transmitted to the log server. The finished transmission condition means that the log has already been transmitted to the log server . The in transmission condition means that transmission of the log to the log server  has not been completed as a result of some interruption of the transmission in the last time transmission of the log. When transmitting the logs, the un-transmitted log or the in transmission log is transmitted to the log server . In addition, the log storage area  increases to accumulate the logs. However, it is possible to remove the logs which have finished transmission. For this reason, memory areas such as HDD , flash memory and so forth are not pressured.","Termination Processing of the Log System","Next, termination processing at the side of the log collection terminal device will be explained. In the side of the log collection terminal device, when an application is made to terminate, first, it is necessary to terminate utilization of the log collecting\/analyzing system. This processing is necessary in order to record the log without contradiction. For this reason, the log collection terminal device allows utilization termination processing of the log collecting\/analyzing system to execute (the processing of STEP S illustrated in ) before the termination processing of the application (the processing of STEP S in ). Specifically, the log collection terminal device forcibly stores therein the log object in use, and\/or executes use termination processing of the log storage area, and so forth in safety. The log collection terminal device subsequently executes termination processing of the log application itself at STEP S, and thus terminates operation of the log collection terminal device itself.","Log Server (Server Side)","Configuration of the Log Server","The configuration of the log server  side will now be explained. The log server , as illustrated in , is composed of image\/sound control unit , CPU , communication control unit , media control unit , RAM , input control unit  and HDD  as the principal configuration elements. These elements are all connected to one another via bus .","The image\/sound control unit  controls image output for a monitor unit that is not illustrated and voice output for a speaker and so forth, or controls inputs from a video camera and a microphone.

It should be noted that the processing illustrated in  is mainly conducted by CPU  of the log server . Firstly, as the processing of STEP S, the log server system is initialized. In this initialization, the database manager is initialized in order for the log server system to use the database. Also initialized are computer resources for the log server  that require the above initialization of the database manager. Next, in the processing of STEP S, the log server system is put in a log reception condition to receive signals (log information) transmitted from the log collection terminal device. Here, a stand-by condition continues until the log reception is completed.","When the log server receives the logs, the log server  executes analysis processing of the received logs in the processing of STEP S. The analysis processing of the logs in STEP S executes respective appropriate analyses according to log analysis interface  that specifies the contents of the logs. Further, when terminating analysis of the logs, the log server system executes a termination check in the processing of STEP S. Generally, since the log server system continues operation, the log server system returns to the processing of STEP S to come into the log reception condition. However, when the log server system determines that a termination order has been issued, processing proceeds to STEP S to execute termination processing of the log server system. Termination of the log server system indicates termination of the computer resources and the database manager that the log server system uses.","It should be noted that the flow of processing of the log server system illustrated in  is simply an example. Therefore, the flow of processing illustrated does not limit the processing of the log server system.","Flow of Log Reception","The flow in which the log server receives the log will now be explained using the flowchart of . Firstly, in the processing of STEP S, a determination is made as to whether the log server has received logs. When the log server  has not received logs, the processing returns to STEP S itself, which processing is repeated until a log is received. When a log is received, processing proceeds to the processing of STEP S in which the <info> tag included in the log is read out. The <info> tag describes the log user ID and log appli. ID. Next, in the processing of STEP S, the received log is stored in the log storage area  illustrated in .","The log storage area  is capable of being specified by the log user ID as well as the log appli. ID. The log user management table  of the log management database  is read out first. Then, the log storage table for user  is identified by using the log user ID. The received log is stored in the log storage table for user , and, at this time, a log reception ID is obtained. The log reception ID is a number for uniquely determining the log. In addition, the utilization log application management table  records the date and time the log is received and the log appli. ID in such a way as to match the former with the latter.","Next, the log application management table  of log management database  is read out. Then, the log storage table for the log application is identified by using the log appli. ID. The log reception ID, log reception date and time and log user ID are recorded in the table. The log reception ID is the log reception ID that is obtained when storing the log in the log storage table for user . In addition, the log reception date and time is the same reception date and time that was provided for the user. The reception processing is completed after the above-described processing.","Flow of Log Analysis Processing","Next, the flow of log analysis processing will be explained using the flowchart illustrated in . Firstly, when the log server  receives logs, analysis is started when the log is moved to the log storage area . Thus, in the processing of STEP S, a log list of registered logs is pulled up on the basis of the log appli. ID. That is, a log list registered according to the log appli. ID is pulled up from the log storage table for log application  of the log storage database  illustrated in . The log list is prepared on the basis of the log appli. ID because the analysis in every analysis unit is executed in every log application unit. Next, in the processing of STEP S, the log server  determines whether the log list is empty.","When the log list is empty in STEP S, since it is not possible to execute a log analysis of the log application, the log analysis ends, and the processing proceeds to STEP S, in which termination processing of log analysis is executed. When the log list includes logs, the processing proceeds to STEP S in which a log is pulled out from the log list and a login interface ID is pulled out from the <DATA> tag. Next, in the processing of STEP S, the log analysis interface  is generated from the login interface ID. In this processing, the login interface management unit  illustrated in  is asked to generate the log analysis interface  with the result that it is possible to generate the log analysis interface . Next, in the processing of STEP S, the log contained in the <DATA> tag is analyzed using the log analysis interface  generated in STEP S. As a result, necessary items of data are extracted, and then, in the processing of STEP S, the result illustrated in  is stored. Subsequently, the processing from STEP S to STEP S is repeated until the log list is empty.","Method for Providing Log Analyzed Result","Next, a method for providing the log analyzed result analyzed by the log server  to the log collection service utilizing company that utilizes the log analyzed result will be explained using the flowchart illustrated in .  illustrates the flow in the case that log collection service utilizing companies  to , as log utilization terminal devices, require the log analyzed result acquired by the log server .

Namely, each log collection service utilizing company transmits the name of the log collection utilization to the log server , i.e., transmits the licensee name and authentication data to the log server  via the internet  illustrated in . The log server  uses this information to authenticate the log collection service utilizing companies. Then, the processing of STEP S determines the authentication result. When the authentication data is determined to be effective data, the processing proceeds to STEP S. On the other hand, when the authentication data is not effective, the fact that login processing has failed is input to the log server  and the log analyzed result acquisition processing is terminated.","In STEP S, when the log collection service utilizing company succeeds in login, the log collection service utilizing company enters a state in which log analyzed result acquisition is feasible. In STEP S, the log collection service utilizing company specifies the log analyzed result it desires to obtain. Namely, the log collection service utilizing company specifies and then transmits the login interface ID. As a result, the analyzed result is retrieved from the log server , and then the processing of STEP S transmits the retrieval result to the log collection service utilizing company. Then, the processing of STEP S determines whether the log analyzed result acquisition processing is to be terminated. When additional log analyzed results are needed, the processing returns to the processing of STEP S, at which point the processing of STEP S to STEP S are repeated. Here, when it is determined that no additional log analyzed results are needed, the log analyzed result acquisition processing is terminated","As described above, the log collection service utilizing company is capable of acquiring desired log analyzed results. However, the login interface ID which may be specified is limited to the login interface  established by the log collection service utilizing company. When another login interface  is specified, no analyzed results are returned","Next, the processing at the side of the log server  in this log analyzed result acquisition processing will be explained with reference to the flowchart illustrated in . Firstly, in STEP S, the log server  processes the login requirements from the log collection service utilizing companies  to . Namely, the log server  acquires the licensee name and authentication data. Next, in the processing of STEP S, the log server  retrieves the authentication data corresponding to the licensee name from the log application management table  illustrated in .

Namely, in the processing of STEP S, log server  acquires the corresponding log analyzed result management table  to receive the licensee name from the log application management table  illustrated in . Then, in the processing of STEP S, the log server  receives the login interface ID transmitted from the log collection service utilizing company. Next, in the processing of STEP S, the log server  reads out the analyzed result from both the received login interface ID and the log analyzed result management table. Then, the log server  transmits the read out result to the log collection service utilizing company in the processing of STEP S.","In the processing of STEP S, the log server  determines whether the processing to read out analyzed results has been terminated by the log collection service utilizing company. If the log server  determines that the processing to read out analyzed results has not been terminated in this STEP S, the processing returns to STEP S, and the processing to read out log analyzed results is repeated. When the processing is to be terminated, the log server  executes processing to terminate log analyzed result acquisition. In addition, in the processing of STEP S, when the log server  determines that the login is not effective, the log server  informs the log collection service utilizing company that the login has resulted in failure at STEP S, and then the log analyzed result acquisition processing at the side of the log server  is terminated.","As described above, in the present embodiment of the log collecting\/analyzing system, log collection terminal devices  to  collect logs to generate desired log information, and then the log information is transmitted to the log server .
