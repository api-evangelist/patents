title: Identification and management of fraudulent credit/debit card purchases at merchant ecommerce sites
abstract: Transaction processing of online transactions at merchant sites determines the likelihood that such transactions are fraudulent, accounting for unreliable fields of a transaction order, which fields do not reliably identify a purchaser. A scoring server using statistical model uses multiple profiles associated with key fields, along with weights to indicate the degree to which the profiles identify the purchaser of the transaction.

No. 09\/782,681, filed Feb. 12, 2001 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,263,506, which claims benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60\/195,156, filed on Apr. 6, 2000, each of which is incorporated in its entirety by this reference.","This invention relates generally to transaction processing to identify fraudulent transactions, and more particularly, transaction processing of online payment transactions occurring over public networks to identify fraudulent transactions.","Credit card purchases of goods and services over the Internet are now a common practice. In a typical transaction, a consumer selects some number of items to purchase, provides information identifying themselves, such as name, address, and the like, and provides payment information typically in the form of a credit card.","There is, however, great risk associated with merchants doing business on the Internet. The anonymity of online customers makes the incidence of fraud incomparably higher for online merchants than for brick-and-mortar, in-house shopping venues, where the customer is present for all transactions. In March of 1999, Visa International, Inc. reported in Computerworld that less than 2% of their credit-card transactions occurred over the Internet, but that online transactions accounted for up to 50% of their disputed charges. Recent reports state that \u201cone in five online buyers has reportedly been a victim of Net-related fraud . . . according to a National Consumers League survey.\u201d The National Consumers League reported that between 1997 and 1998 there was a 600 percent increase in reports of Internet fraud.","Credit card transactions present various significant risks to the merchant. These include:","Loss of Payments & Merchandise","Online fraud presents the risk of huge revenue losses to Internet merchants. When fraud occurs, both the payment and the merchandise are gone. When consumers use credit cards in person and fraudulent transactions occur, issuing banks reimburse cardholders. Thus, if a cardholder's card is lost or stolen and then used by another fraudulently, it is the issuer that must absorb fraudulent charges, as federal law limits the cardholder's liability. This is because when a card is presented in person, the merchant does not have liability for fraudulent charges.","With Internet commerce, however, the merchants, not the banks, must reimburse issuers for 100% of the fraudulent purchases. Regulations created by Visa, MasterCard and other card issuer associations specify that in card-not-present (CNP) situations, merchants assume the full risk of purchases made by credit card, regardless of authorizations made by issuing banks. Because CNP transactions are the standard for e-commerce, and because these transactions will continue to grow in volume, the current framework shifts the burden of these losses primarily to the merchants. Indeed, for large companies, which do all of their business over the Internet based on CNP transactions, this loss exposure can be in the tens of millions of dollars.","Beyond using a stolen credit card or fabricated card number, other types of fraud abound in the online purchasing arena. With Internet orders, it's easier than ever for customers to dispute charges. For example, a husband may make charges and deny them to his wife, who in turn calls the card issuer and fervently disputes their bill. Though these purchases are valid, the card company may decide in favor of their customer, and the merchant is responsible for the chargebacks. In addition, merchants are responsible for loss from disputed charges when customers claim non-receipt of goods, non-arrival of goods due to incorrect shipping addresses, or goods refused on delivery.","Loss from Shipping Charges","The charges for shipping physical goods are normally paid by consumers. When online fraud occurs, however, shipping charges become the responsibility of the online merchant\u2014yet another hit in the merchant's profitability.","Loss from Human Intervention","Online merchants attempting to use parameter-based rules and negative files to determine credit card fraud often watch their administrative costs skyrocket along with the increased staffing needed for time-consuming fraud investigations.","Loss of Valued Customers","Poorly managed fraud-control systems can lead to decreased customer satisfaction resulting in lost revenues. Many online retailers burden their customers with lengthy and complex online-order forms in an attempt to minimize fraud, consequently resulting in unacceptably elevated order abandonment, as legitimate customers become frustrated, lose interest in pursuing their purchases, and flee to other vendors. In the same vein, worthy customers become insulted when inaccurate rules turn down their orders. Such customers often permanently migrate to other websites where they find better treatment. The misguided merchants then waste valuable marketing dollars attempting to replace the very customers they turned away.","Loss from Chargeback Fees","A chargeback is a charge levied onto a merchant for the amount of a purchase that has previously been charged onto a payment card, and has been successfully disputed by a customer. When a chargeback is processed, the merchant must pay a fee of $15.00 to 25.00. If the merchant disputes the chargeback and wants to re-present, or re-issue, the charge, an equivalent fee is billed to the merchant. If the card issuer again decides in favor of the customer and processes a second chargeback, the merchant is charged yet another fee, and this time the charge cannot be re-presented. The merchant can, however, arbitrate the charge, whereupon the issuing bank can charge an up-front, non-refundable fee of up to $50.00.","Loss from Chargeback Fines","In addition to paying a fee for each chargeback, issuing banks can levy fines on merchants having too many chargebacks. Typically 1.5-3.0% of the merchant's chargeback volume, such fines can range from a few hundred dollars per month, to $10,000 or even $100,000 per month, with fines escalating higher as chargebacks continue unabated.","Loss of Credit Card Privileges","The final blow\u2014after months of escalating fines, if chargebacks exceed a small percentage of a merchant's overall credit-card sales, the merchant can lose the privilege of receiving payment through credit card issuers.","Limitations of Most Fraud-Risk Solutions","On-line retailers have been quickly implementing a wide range of fraud fighting techniques to combat this perplexing and ubiquitous problem. The technological level of Internet fraud solutions today is similar to where credit card issuers were in 1992, when the incidence of bankcard fraud exploded and was expected to reach US $1 billion by 1995.","Typical solutions that have been deployed include the use or rule sets and basic checks such as address verification.","Rule Sets","Rule sets use if\/then logic that attempts to identify aberrant behavior using limited data, including negative file information. Rule sets are difficult to implement because there is no real predictive capability associated with them. Throughout the 1990's, banks issuing credit cards quickly determined that rule-based fraud approaches by themselves were ineffective because they:\n\n","Address Verification Service (AVS)","AVS was designed for mail and telephone orders (MOTOs), and many online merchants use AVS today because it is the only tool they have. AVS has no international fraud detection capability, is inconsistent in its results, and, while providing some value, it is not designed for online transactions, and is by no means considered a complete solution for Internet fraud detection and revenue optimization.","Accordingly, there remains the need to identify and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions occurring over public networks, such as the Internet.","In order to identify fraudulent consumer credit card transactions in an online environment (e.g., the Internet), it is desirable to create a profile for each buyer that summarizes the transactional behavior the buyer, preferably for as many of the buyer's Internet purchases as possible. Such a profile makes it possible to contrast a currently attempted transaction with the historical behavior pattern of the buyer to help ascertain the likelihood of fraud. Also, such profiles make it possible to identify a pattern of transactions that are individually benign, but in aggregate indicates a likelihood of fraud. Two examples make this point clearer.","A buyer who normally buys only office supplies and airline tickets, and does so only during business hours, will have a profile indicating this behavioral pattern. If that buyer (or more specifically, someone purporting to be that buyer by using their credit\/debit card number) were to purchase adult entertainment images at a late night hour, the likelihood of fraud\u2014given the contrast of the transaction request and the established profile pattern\u2014should be estimated as higher. In contrast, a buyer who regularly patronizes such merchants, would have that information in their profile, and the same transaction would appear less suspicious.","A buyer, who normally transacts once a month, makes 10 transactions, at different merchants, in a 10-minutes span. None of the 10 transactions may be suspicious on their own, but once their accumulation is recognized within the profile, the suspicion level of the latter transactions will be accentuated. This example becomes more complicated, if two different credit cards numbers are used.","In order to create a profile of a consumer, it is necessary to identify transactions of that consumer in the data streams received from many different sources. In segregating transactions, a key is used to identify and distinguish transactions of one buyer from transactions of another. A key is said to be reliable if it identifies a unique buyer with a very low likelihood of multiple buyers being associated with the same key or multiple keys associated with the same buyer. The Social Security Number, for instance, is considered a very reliable key. The government, in issuing those numbers, goes to great length to minimize the likelihood of an individual being assigned multiple numbers or the same number assigned to multiple individuals. A key is said to be unreliable if the likelihood of multiple individuals sharing the same key or multiple keys identifying the same individuals is not very low. For instance, a person's name is an unreliable key. A person may spell their name in multiple ways (including nicknames), and multiple individuals may have the same name. Credit card numbers, postal addresses, email addresses, IP numbers, and phone numbers are additional examples of unreliable keys. U.S. Pat. No. 5,819,226 discloses the creation and use of profiles based on transactional behavior. However, as disclosed this system assumes that each buyer uses the same credit card for each transaction, and thus transactions by the same buyer can be identified on the basis of the credit card number alone.","It is a fact of the Internet marketplace that there is no single reliable key that all buyers have and that is required to complete all transactions. For example, while SSN maybe highly reliable, it is not used in credit card purchases. Instead, at best a multitude of unreliable keys that are frequently required (name, address, phone number, etc.). The lack of a single reliable key is a fundamental problem with any effort to create a buyer's profile that tracks transactions at occur at multiple merchants and with different credit or debit cards. This is because each merchant independently decides which information about buyers to require and how that information is recorded, encoded, and organized. Even the same information required by different merchants (e.g., name) may end up being different in form; for example one merchant may truncate names over a certain length while other merchants do not. This means that there is no simple way to identify the various transactions made by the same buyers as such merely by matching individual keys (e.g., matching name and address fields).","Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a reliable way of identifying and aggregating transactions of individuals in order to build profiles of consumers for application to predictive modeling.","The present invention aids merchants by detecting Internet credit card transactions that are likely to be fraudulent, and optionally providing the merchants with mechanisms for managing a suspected transaction as it occurs. While the primary discussion herein focuses on credit card transactions, the principles of the present invention are equally applicable to debit cards, ACH transactions, micropayments, and other types of transactional mechanisms employing identification numbers as well, and thus no limitation to credit cards is intended.","A fraudulent transaction is one where the buyer supplies a credit card number without being an authorized user\/cardholder (for instance, a stolen card number). The financial responsibility for such a fraudulent transaction rests with the merchant who accepted the credit card number in payment. Accordingly, by identifying fraudulent transactions as they occur, the present invention enables merchants to reduce their exposure to these types of losses.","In one embodiment, a buyer, transacting through the Internet, requests the purchase of certain goods from a merchant operating on the Internet and submits a credit card number as a form of payment. The Internet merchant forwards to at least one centralized scoring server relevant information about the requested transaction including identifying information about the buyer (e.g., name, shipping address, Email, IP address, credit card number, etc.) and about the transaction (e.g., amount, items ordered, click-stream through the web site prior to the purchase, etc.). The scoring server performs a mathematical calculation designed to estimate the likelihood that the transaction is fraudulent. That calculation takes advantage of information intrinsic to the transaction, information about other transactions that the same buyer has been making elsewhere (e.g., at other e-commerce sites and optionally at non e-commerce sites) and reported to the scoring server, and the contrast between this transaction and a profile established with respect to these prior activities. The estimation, in the form of a score, and optionally reasons for the score, special situation reports, and rules exceptions; is returned to the Internet merchant. The Internet merchant then decides whether to approve, decline, ask for more information, out-sort to a human analyst, or take other actions with respect to the transaction using the fraud estimation.","The scoring server performs its fraud estimation using a statistical model of fraudulent transactions. Historical data is collected to enable the creation of the fraudulent transaction model. The historical data contains the same types of information that merchants, in the operational system, transmit to the scoring server for each transaction. In addition, the historical data is tagged to identify which transactions subsequently proved to have been legitimate, and Which subsequently proved to have been fraudulent (i.e., a supervised learning model). The historical data, excluding the fraud tags, is used to create the buyer profiles. A profile is created for each buyer who transacted at a subscribing Internet merchant.","The identification of the association of the various transactions with their respective buyers is done using a multi-keyed algorithm. The multi-key solution stems from the observation that while no one, universally required, key (e.g., last name, or address) is reliable, many keys together provide a probabilistic identification. Between them, multiple individually unreliable keys provide a higher-degree-of-accuracy probabilistic identification than any one key alone. Since an overall online fraud detection system may be designed to produce a statistical result, a probabilistic identification is sufficient\u2014so long as the available information is contained within it. The multi-keyed algorithm accumulates and profiles transactional information with respect to different keys that can be used to identify a buyer. Each buyer's profile contains information summarizing the progression of transactions the buyer has executed over the Internet, including information typifying those transactions (typical amounts, types of purchase, type of merchants, hours of day, etc.). A self-learning computerized system is then used to train a statistical model to estimate the likelihood of fraud, in the historical data, of a given transaction given the information contained in the transaction as well as the state of the profile of the buyer in that transaction at the time the transaction is executed.","Transactions received at any participating merchant are forwarded to the statistical model for evaluation. The various profiles corresponding to the different keys of the transaction, along with the current transaction information is input into the model; the model provides an estimate of the likelihood of fraud. The merchant can then process the transaction based on this estimate, by either approving, declining, or out-sorting the transaction, or requesting additional information from the purchaser.","These features are not the only features of the invention. In view of the drawings, specification, and claims, many additional features and advantages will be apparent. The specification describes the invention for readability and instructional purposes. It does not limit the invention. A review of the claims is necessary to determine the invention.","The figures depict a preferred embodiment of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the illustrated structures and methods may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention.","Overview of System Architecture","The present invention is described herein with respect to one preferred embodiment which is called \u201ceFalcon\u201d for purposes of reference and identification. It is understood that the present invention may be embodied in other forms and configurations other than the exact specifications and features of eFalcon as described in this specification.","Referring now to , there is shown an illustration of an embodiment of one eFalcon system that operates in accordance with the present invention. Here, eFalcon system  includes a merchant web site  and a scoring system ; these are communicatively coupled either by a point-to-point connection (e.g. dedicated T1 line) or any other Internet type connection. The merchant web site includes an order fulfillment system  that receives incoming orders  via the Internet from client computer  (only a single client computer  is shown, but in practice there are many individual client computers  operating). The orders  may contain standard types of product or service order information (e.g. product code and other attributes of a product being ordered) and along information identifying the purchaser, (e.g., name, shipping address, e-mail address, IP address), and along with a payment identifier, such as a credit card number. The orders  may alternatively (or additionally) be received via mail or telephone, and then interfaced appropriately to the fulfillment system . The order fulfillment system  forwards orders to be processed to a rule engine . The rule engine  forwards this information to the scoring system  as a scoring request. The connection between the rule engine  and the scoring system  is preferably secured (e.g. SSL) given the highly confidential information contained in the transaction, purchaser, and payment information.","The scoring system  analyzes the provided information in the scoring request and estimates the likelihood that the transaction is fraudulent. In generating this estimate, the scoring system  matches information about the purchaser derived from the scoring request with information about other transactions that are most likely made by the same purchaser elsewhere (e.g. at other e-commerce sites and optionally at non e-commerce sites) to obtain an overall profile of the purchaser's historical buying behavior. More specifically, multiple profiles corresponding to different key values derived from the scoring request are obtained and used by the scoring system . The profiles provide summaries of historical transactions for the individual(s) associated with the profile. In embodiment, every transaction received from a merchant is used to update the profiles associated with that transaction.","The scoring system  includes one or more predictive models of fraudulent transactions. The profile(s) and the current transaction information are input into the predictive model(s) to produce the estimated likelihood of fraud. A predictive model is preferably a statistical model of fraudulent transactions. Multiple models may be used, with a particular model being employed for scoring a transaction depending on various transaction attributes, such as product type, merchant category code, or the like. The predictive model is derived from historical data containing the same types of information that merchants, in the operational system, transmit to the scoring system  for each transaction. In addition, the historical data is tagged to identify which transaction subsequently proved to have been legitimate, and which subsequently proved to have been fraudulent (i.e., a supervised learning model). The historical data, excluding the fraud tags, is used to create the various key profiles. A profile is created for each buyer who transacted at a subscribing merchant; key profiles for different keys are also created. The estimation, in the form of a fraud score, reasons for the score, special situation reports, and rules exceptions is returned to the merchant's rule engine . In one embodiment, the fraud score is a scaled scored between 1 and 999, though certainly other scales may be used.","The scoring system  operates in a service bureau or application service provider model, and may contain multiple servers operating in parallel to ensure high speed scoring of transactions from many different vendors. In one embodiment, as shown in , a proxy server  operates between the rule engine  and the scoring system . The proxy server  is used preferably by an Internet merchant service or commerce infrastructure provider, typically supporting multiple merchant sites . In this embodiment, the proxy server  acts as a conduit, by receiving the scoring requests from the merchant sites , delivering them to the scoring system , and then receiving the scores from the scoring system , and returning them to the requesting rule engines .","The rule engine  implements various rules  that establish its policies for dealing with fraudulent or potentially fraudulent transactions.","Given the fraud score for the transaction, the merchant's rule engine  perform  various actions, including:\n\n","The merchant defines rules  that apply the foregoing actions as desired, based on the fraud score. The rules  are defined and updated using a policy management workstation (PMW) . The PMW allows the merchant to write policies formulated as computational rules that become active within the rule engine , integrating a real-time decision making process into the merchant's order fulfillment system . The PMW allows the merchant to define, edit, delete any rules it desires. The use of the rules enables the merchant's fraud-risk prediction system to automatically determine actions based on the fraud scores, order data and information from external sources, and to incorporate information from the negative files that the merchant may have already accumulated. The use of rule bases (rule sets)  releases the merchant from the limitations of using a binary Yes or No to determine the action to take on the fraud score.","One embodiment of the eFalcon system operates as described using the rule engine  and the PMW . A more sophisticated embodiment includes the order management workstation (OMW) , as illustrated in , which is used to handle out-sorted orders. The out-sorted orders are those that are neither immediately approved nor declined (e.g. in the \u2018gray\u2019). The out-sorted orders  are stored in a file system (and may be sequenced for handling), where an operator using the OMW  can review each order and decide what further action to take in order to finally dispose of the order. The OMW  displays order, customer and merchant information for individual transactions. Having detailed order information helps representatives determine which orders are likely to be fraudulent. OMW  users can view a variety of data, such as customer name and address, and details about order items. Users can also see any previous activity on the order, and enter comments. Thus, the OWM is used for control and manipulation of orders being processed, so as to fulfill as many orders as possible, while avoid the risk of fraudulent orders.","After reviewing the data, the representative can determine whether the order is fraudulent, and decide to hold, accept, or reject the order. The OMW  also allows the merchant to specify the reason for the decision, such as non-sufficient funds (NSF, applicable to ACH), or an anonymous email address. If a representative wants to accept an order immediately, without reviewing the data (for example, if the order is placed by a known good customer), an OMW Accept Order option processes the order with no further action required.","In addition to review functions, the OMW  enables supervisors or other authorized personnel to create queues, add new users to the OMW , and perform other administrative tasks. Queues are tools that group orders according to like characteristics (for example, orders over two thousand dollars) and direct those orders to specific representatives for review. The system gives the merchant the ability to define and create queues according to user-specified criteria. This queue definition feature gives the merchant the ability to control and direct workflow. Through the use of queues, administrators select the type of orders that go to each representative, making the most efficient use of available resources. If no queues are specifically defined, default queues determine the sequence in which orders are presented. Once a queue is defined, it may be assigned to one, multiple, or all representatives.","The present invention differs from conventional approaches to merchant situated fraud detection in various ways. In one regard, it does not look at each transaction on its own, but instead contrasts the totality of behavior of a buyer across all (subscribing) merchant sites. This allows for a more accurate profile of the overall purchasing behavior of the buyer, since it considers transactions at multiple merchants. This is only possible with the use of consolidated transactional information from many merchants and only if the problem of identifying transactions of a buyer across a multitude of sites is resolved, since it is necessary to accurately identify which transactions belong to which buyers at the multiple sites. Also, this method uses information not typically supplied with credit card authorization data (for instance, information about specific orders such as product identifying information) and not traditionally used in fraud control. Conventional authorization based fraud control typically used just the merchant information, buyer information and the amount of the transaction\u2014but not details about the items being purchased. Item information is useful here to create a more complete picture of the types of products and services each buyer typically purchases over the Internet.","Multi-Key Identification of Purchasers","As noted above, in order to accurately determine whether a given transaction of a purchaser is fraudulent, it is desirable to compare that transaction with prior transactions of the purchaser. However, accurately matching the purchaser identified in a given scoring request with data of known purchasers is difficult because of the vagaries, irregularities, and inconsistencies typically observed in purchaser information in online environments. In one embodiment, the system described above overcomes the problem of purchaser identification using a multi-key approach.  illustrates a sample embodiment of the eFalcon system using this approach, considering both the development and production environments.","Generally, to provide a multiple-key solution, a number of unreliable or not perfectly reliable key fields are selected for both training and production use. In one embodiment, these fields include:\n\n","Other keys that may arise in certain circumstances (such as frequent flier number, company name, company address or telephone number, fax number, account number, and like may also be used.","This information is collected  from many different merchants from transactions  conducted at these merchants' e-commerce sites. More particularly, a large number of transactions are accumulated from the many merchant sites. Optionally non-e-commerce transactions may also be used.","A profile is built  based on each key (at least individually), as if it was reliable. Thus, all transactions sharing the same name are profiled together, as are all transactions sharing the same address, and so on, for each of the selected individual keys. These profiles are stored in a profile database , in association with their specific key.","As result of the profiling of each key field, some profiles include information that pertains to multiple individuals and some profiles contain information that pertains only to some of the transactions of a specific individual. As an example of the former, a profile based on shipping address will capture all transactions to that address, at which there may be several individual cardholders. As an example of the latter, a profile based on IP address will capture transactions from a specific computer, but a cardholder may well use many different computers to make purchases (e.g., a home computer and a work computer).","In an optional embodiment, profiles based on combinations of keys may be generated . For example, combination keys may be defined such as:\n\n","Consequently, each transaction is used to update  multiple profiles in the profile database . That is, the transaction will influence the transaction pattern of each profile for which it matches at least one key. Thus, a given transaction for which name, address, email address, and IP address is known, will be used to update at least four different profiles, one for each of these keys.","Variables are generated  from for each key (or combination key) profile. That is, transactional summary variables, such as averages, rates, total, frequencies of transactions, authorizations, declines, dollars, SIC codes, and so forth are generated from the transactions in each of the profiles. These profile variables are stored in their associated profiles. These variables usefully describe the historical purchasing behavior of the individual(s) contributing to the profile.","For certain pairs of these profiles and for certain variables in the profiles a contrast measure is computed . Preferably the contrast measure is the ratio of the profile variable value in the pair of profiles. The contrast measure provides a measure of how similar the profiles are to each other and thus how reliable they are in describing the buyer's transactions. The idea here is that if two profiles have very similar variable values, then they are most likely derived from the same set of transactions, and thus represent the same buyer.","Example: Suppose there is a \u201cvelocity\u201d variable (any variable that measures the rate with which a buyer does something, such as execute transactions, make purchases, obtains authorizations or the like) There will then be a \u201ctransaction velocity\u201d variable for each of the unreliable (or not-always-available) keys: \u201cname profile transaction velocity\u201d, \u201cemail profile transaction velocity\u201d, etc. Thus if there are six keys of interest, then there are six transaction velocity variables. Likewise for any of the other variables in each profile for which a transaction velocity is desired. (Other rate variables may be measured as well, not merely transaction rate).","From here, the system can calculate, say, the contrast measure between various pairs of the profile \u201cvelocities.\u201d For example, a contrast measure may be computed for:\n\n","For each pair, when using a ratio, the closer the contrast measure is to 1.0, the higher the confidence in the value provided by the two velocities contrasted for the specific transaction since it would be a remarkable coincidence for two velocities to be almost the same unless the transactions that went into each (and hence each profile) were nearly identical. Identical profiles likely means identical entities, e.g. purchasers, associated with these profiles, and thus accurate identification of the purchaser. Obviously, if using the difference as the contrast measure, then closer the measure is to 0.0, the more likely the profiles are for the same purchaser.","Finally, to train the scoring model , each transaction, its associated set of key profiles, and the contrast measures are input in a supervised learning environment. The contrast measures allow the scoring model  to weight the influence of the different key profiles in terms of their reliability for fraud prediction. In this way, absolute accuracy in matching up profiles with a particular buyer during operation is unnecessary, since the scoring model  appropriately weights more \u201caccurate\u201d profiles to increase their influence in describing the buyer's transaction behavior. The scoring model  may be developed with standard statistical computer-learning packages, such as SAS, the HNC Data Mining Workstation, S+, or the like. Once developed, it is deployed within the scoring system .","In one embodiment, the scoring model  is one or more neural networks. Neural network scoring is effective for fraud and risk assessment because of its ability to observe patterns and detect the slightest behavior anomalies. Criminals normally make fraudulent transactions to purchase items easily converted into cash. The behavior displayed in using a bankcard for Internet fraud is fairly specific, and varies from the typical way consumers make transactions. Consumer transactions normally have the following detectable patterns:\n\n","Through the use of the profiles during model training, the scoring model  learns what patterns of transactions are indicative of non-fraudulent and fraudulent behavior, taking into account what behavior is normal in an account, as described by each consumer's profile. What looks normal for one account may be flagrant fraud for another account. For example, if a consumer only uses his credit card in the evenings to buy computer equipment from an online electronics outfit, then a charge on this same credit card for a case of Vodka from an online merchant at 10 a.m. looks suspicious. However, this same charge appears more reasonable for many other accounts, which have a history of early morning purchases at liquor merchants. Typically, the score for a transaction is high for orders appearing abnormal, and especially high for orders that both appear abnormal and similar to some pattern of fraudulent activity.","In general, there are three categories of information that the scoring model  models: the general characteristics of fraudulent orders, individual cardholder behavior and normal customer behavior at the merchant's site. Each of these contributes important variables to an evaluation of the likelihood of fraudulent activity. While methods of perpetration of fraud change frequently, the basic criminal behavior and activity with fraudulent cards is slow to change. As a result, the scoring system  contains both dynamic and static components. The dynamic components include \u201creasonable and customary\u201d account models updated in real-time with each order. The static components include the fraud behavior models maintained and updated as fraud behavior changes, or as increased prediction accuracy is achieved. The scoring model  is developed by using historical transaction and account information from as many different card issuers and other transaction information sources as possible, which is known as \u201cconsortium data.\u201d","In the operational environment  then, the flow is very similar to that described above. A scoring request for transaction  for a transaction is received . The information corresponding to the profiled keys is extracted , for example, the buyer's name, address and so forth (if such information is available). The matching profile for each key is retrieved  from the profile database .","For example, if the transaction information contains the following:","Name: John Public","Address: 123 Main Street, Belmont, Calif.","Telephone: (650) 599-3929","Email: jpublic@network.com","IP address: 121.080.212.121","Then the profiles corresponding to the value of each of these keys are retrieved. Thus, the profile for the string \u201cJohn Public\u201d, and for the address \u201c123 Main Street, Belmont, Calif.\u201d and so on are each obtained .","Any profile variables that are dynamic are generated , and the appropriate contrast measures between selected ones of the profiles are also computed .","The current transaction information is then input into the scoring model  for scoring , along with the various profiles associated with each of the individual key values (or combinations), and the contrast measures (which act to weight the profiles). The scoring model uses this information to compute the fraud score. This output fraud score is returned to the merchant's rule engine .","In an alternative embodiment, instead of all profiles being input in the scoring model , certain profiles are selected for input prior to scoring based on their contrast measures, such as selecting those profiles whose associated contrast measures are above a certain threshold.","Scoring System","A suitable scoring system  for scoring transactions, and for storing a model of fraudulent transactions is the Capstone Model Manager, which may be purchased from HNC Software, Inc. of San Diego, Calif.","In one embodiment, the scoring system  includes a model manager, a scoring model , and a profile database . The model manager is used to develop the scoring model . Model development begins with data pre-processing. This stage is handled by a model manager driver. During this stage raw data, such as the historical transactions, is converted by the driver into variables for the model development data set.","The desired variables are first defined using a modeling language (such as the Capstone Model Manager Language) to define and calculate all variables that may be used in the model. Defining the variables in separate files (based on variable categories) and then including them into the main model can further localize the variables. This modularizes the model development process and logically separates it from any expert rule bases that are also being employed. In this embodiment, the defined variables will include the desired transaction summaries to be calculated for each profile (e.g. the velocity measures discussed above), along with the contrast measures for selected sets of profiles.","Once all the variables and their associated calculations have been defined, (along with other ancillary code) the modeling data set is generated. This is done by feeding the raw data through a modeling driver, which performs the defined calculations on the data, and then uses an output functions to write out the values of the calculated variables to a designated file.","Once the modeling data sets have been generated, the modeler can now perform statistical analysis using standard tools like SAS, S-Plus or HNC's Marksman. These tools can be used for variable selection and model building. The completed model preferably is a statistical model, e.g., a neural network or regression model, but may also include rules for further transaction processing. One example of a statistical model is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,819,226, which is incorporated herein by reference. As mentioned above, this approach uses one or more profiles of each consumer's historical spending behavior, to determine whether a particular transaction presented by the consumer is aberrational.","The model manager includes a rule editor for editing model rules, and a model driver that accepts the raw input data and calculates variables for model development. Rules may be used to execute variable calculations, flow control and data manipulation. Rules are extremely useful in creating expert systems or to control model inputs and outputs. For example, rules may be written to flag transactions with certain attributes (e.g. very high transaction amount).","The model may also include functions and calculations. Functions are very similar to rules, except that they take arguments and return values. Calculations may be performed within rules or functions, or within variable calculation blocks. A variable calculation block includes a variable declaration followed by the method by which the variable is to be calculated. In addition variables calculations can be logically grouped together so that at execution time, all variables within a group can be calculated via a single function call.","As noted above, scoring system  includes a profile database . As previously explained, this database will store profiles related to different keys derived from the historical transactions, which profiles are then used in model development, e.g. as the source of the variables, contrast measures, and the like. It is important to note that the transactions used here in model development come at least in part from a variety of different merchants, and are not limited to transactions from single merchant. This gives the model a robust set of transactional data that best approximates the purchasing behavior of individuals, who shop at multiple merchants. The multiple keys allow for the reliable identification of an individual as that individual transacts at multiple merchants. Hence, the multiple key profiles summarize an individual's transactional behavior across multiple merchants.","Merchant System","The merchant system  includes the fulfillment system , the rule engine , the OMW , the PMW , and their associated data stores, the outsorted orders  and fraud policies . The fulfillment system  may be any type of online ordering system that supports conventional product ordering process flow, such as providing a catalog of available products, order forms and scripts for receiving product information and purchaser information, and any other business logic that the merchant desires. It is preferably that the fulfillment system  capture sufficient information to basically identify the purchaser, as indicated above; otherwise, there is no constraint imposed on the features of the fulfillment system  by the present invention.","The rule engine  operates on a conventional computer system, such as a Sun Microsystems's UltraSparc\u2122 or Intel Pentium\u2122 class computer, executing a conventional operating system, such as Sun Microsystems's Sun Solaris or Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT. The rule engine  is coupled to the scoring system  by either a convention Internet connection or by a point-to-point connection, such as an ISDN or T1 line, or frame relay.","Rule Engine","The rule engine  interfaces between the fulfillment system  and the scoring system . The rule engine  includes modules that receive transactions from the fulfillment system , provide the scoring requests to the scoring system , and then apply rules  to the scored transactions. The interface to the scoring system  is provided by a client application programming interface (API) that provides various function calls to the rule engine .","API to Scoring System","The scoring system  provides an interface (API) that enables the merchant to link the rule engine  to the scoring system , such as through the proxy server mentioned above. The calls are made to a shared object library on a Sun Solaris, Linux or HP-UX platform; other platforms may be used as well. The library functions provide connection and scoring invocation services.","The API library supports both synchronous and asynchronous scoring by the scoring system . In asynchronous mode, the API returns immediately to the calling application when a scoring request is made. In synchronous mode, the API does not return until the scoring system  has returned the score, or a timeout has occurred.","The API library provides fully redundant connectivity between the rule engine  and the scoring system . This is provided through multiple point-to-point connections such as direct network connectivity, T1 lines, or Internet access. Failover is handled automatically by the library. The redundancy is completely transparent to the applications programmer using the API.","Communication between rule engine  and the scoring system  is provided by the passage of messages across the communications interface. The API library provides a series of function calls permitting application programmers to build messages for the scoring system  by concatenating a series of fields. When message building is complete, the application programmer sends the message by invoking another API function.","Table 1 below provides a description of the function calls in one embodiment of the API.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0147"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Summary of Client API Function Calls"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Call","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["AllocHandle","Allocates memory for and returns a pointer to"]},{"entry":[{},"an Handle_t, an internal handle structure used"]},{"entry":[{},"by the API functions.

This processing flow is discussed now is more detail, with reference to various ones of the API functions used.","Generally, in calling the scoring system , the calling application (which is typically the rule engine  but ostensibly can be any application that has access to the data of a transaction and to the API) requests allocation (AllocHandle) of a handle for a threaded connection to the scoring system , and then requests connection via the handle to the scoring system  (Connect). Given the handle then, the calling application forms a scoring request by setting a number of data fields using data from the transaction (SetField, SetDefaultField, SetFields, SetDefaultField, ClearField, ClearDefaultField, ClearFields, or ClearDefaultFields).","The fields are set as (name, value) pairs. While these fields are illustrative, not all are mandatory. Also, while a scoring request is being constructed, the calling application can query the request to obtain field data (GetField, GetDefaultField, GetFields, or GetDefaultFields). The calling application then sends the scoring request via the provided handle to the scoring system  (Send).","The calling application then separately requests the scoring result from the scoring system  (GetResponse). This call is responded to as the scoring system  as it becomes available. The calling application then disconnects (Disconnect) from the handle to close the connection to the scoring system . A multi-threaded implementation would create multiple threads at once, with a handle for each thread, and define a scoring request in each thread.","Table 2 describes the various different fields that may be used to define a scoring request:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0153"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"301pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Summary of Scoring Request Fields"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Field","Description","Format","Indexed?"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["ABA","The bank ABA routing number","Char(9)","No"]},{"entry":[{},"(only allowed when PAYMETHOD = A)",{},{}]},{"entry":["ACCTEXPDT","Expiration date from cardholder","Date","No"]},{"entry":[{},"file.","ccyymmdd",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"(8",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"bytes)",{}]},{"entry":["ACCTTYPE","The account type for ACH","Category","No"]},{"entry":[{},"transactions (only allowed when",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"PAYMETHOD = A)",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"C = Checking",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"S = Savings",{},{}]},{"entry":["ACHRESPONSE","Uses predefined ACH codes.","Category","No"]},{"entry":["AUTHAMT","The amount requested for","Numeric","No"]},{"entry":[{},"authorization.","(12.2)",{}]},{"entry":["AUTHDECISIONCD","Authorization or posting:","Category","No"]},{"entry":[{},"Approve\/decline code:",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"A = Approve",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"D = Decline",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"I = Approve with positive ID",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"P = Pick up card",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"R = Reref",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"C = Reref continuously",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Payment: Payment type:",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"B = Balance transfer",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"C = Check",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"E = EFT",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"I = Internal transfer",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"W = Cash",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"K = Convenience check",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"O = Other",{},{}]},{"entry":["AUTHDT","The date of the authorization","Date","No"]},{"entry":[{},"request",{},{}]},{"entry":["AUTHPOST","Text (1 byte)","Category","No"]},{"entry":[{},"Type of transaction:",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"A = Authorization",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"P = Posting",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Q = Payment",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"N = Nonmonetary (nonmon)",{},{}]},{"entry":["AUTHPOSTCD","Authorization or posting.","Category","N"]},{"entry":[{},"Transaction type:",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"C = Cash",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"M = Merchandise",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"K = Convenience check",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"T = Balance transfer",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"R = Crediting the account",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"V = Reversal",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"A = Address verification",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"X = Cancel transaction",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"B = Merchandise with cash back",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"S = Code 10 merchant suspicious",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"All credit models score C and M",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"transactions; some score K and B",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"transactions.

The PMW  allows fraud managers to easily define and deploy rules to automate various fraud prevention procedures in response to information provided by the scoring system . It provides a simple means of writing and implementing rules that can be used to create or reopen fraud cases based on the order fields or the score. PMW  lets the merchant apply different score thresholds to different sets of credit cards or to users whose IP addresses fall within certain ranges.","More specifically, the PMW  allows the merchant to:\n\n","Overview of the Rule Engine and Rule Bases","In order to better understand the operation of the PMW , there is first described the operation of the rule engine  in using rules to process scored transactions. Referring now to , there is shown the basic processing flow provided by the rule engine  for a typical order. The flow illustrates an incoming order  after it has been assigned a score, reason code and exception code from the scoring system , and returned with this data the rule engine . As the order  proceeds through the rule engine , it is processed through rule bases  containing rules that recommend the final outcome, resulting in one of the sample actions  shown on the right of the diagram.","In the illustrated embodiment, there are five different rule bases  used by the rule engine .","NEGATIVE FILES : This rule base is used by the rule engine  to check incoming customer data against stored negative information, such as phone numbers, IP addresses, card numbers and so on. A Negative file lists data that is identified to be linked with fraudulent or suspicious activity or sources of transactions. Negative results from these rules can immediately reject incoming orders. A sample rule might reject orders from customers with certain IP addresses. When an order is rejected, the customer does not actually receive the information. A flag is set and the data is returned back to the merchant so they can take action. In one embodiment, a generic set of negative rules is provided, and merchants can use the PMW to modify such rules.","DFLT_CHAMPION : This rule base contains the rules to be processed against incoming scored orders.","DEFAULT : This rule base contains a sample rule that specifies when to apply the rules of the DFLT_CHALLENGER , DFLT_TEST and DFLT_CHAMPION rule bases. In one embodiment, it provides a rule syntax that applies the rules of the DFLT_CHALLENGER and DFLT_TEST rule bases if the customer placing the order is generated a random number greater than or equal to 95, and to apply the rules of the DFLT_CHAMPION rule base otherwise.","DFLT_CHALLENGER : This rule base is a test bed for rules that may eventually be introduced to the DFLT_CHAMPION rule base . For example, the default challenger may contain all rules of another rule base, with one of the rules deleted, or a new rule added, or one modified rule. These rules must be created with different rule names, however. A small percentage of orders will go through this rule base to determine if it is more effective than the rule base currently in use. If the default challenger is proven to be more effective than the champion, it can be promoted to replace the champion.","DFLT_TEST : This rule based contains additional rules that may eventually be added to the DFLT_CHALLENGER rule base. Contains rules to be tested before going into production. The rules are fired and logged, but do not have any affect on the outcomes of orders.","The challenger, champion, and test rule bases may also contain sequential rules that define the sequence in which other rules in the rule base are to be executed.","Once processed by the rule engine , the result is that the order is either rejected, accepted, outsorted, or more information is requested from the consumer by displaying a web page form.","Rules do not affect the score provided by the scoring system . Rather, they fine-tune the prediction of the eventual outcome of the transaction so that users or the fulfillment system  itself can take different actions depending on the circumstances. For example, a rule might take an action based on a consumer's IP address or email address, such as hotmail.com, and outsort the order specifically for further review.","Rules typically are \u201cif-then\u201d constructs that are based on human judgment and experience and can be used to add knowledge to models and specify actions to take based on various circumstances. Various factors are to be considered when designing the rules. The type of goods being purchased is one consideration, for example, digital versus physical. The category of merchandise is another consideration, such as books versus gambling. The price of goods is another consideration, especially when determining whether to outsort an order. For example, if an order has a relatively high score, but is also for a very high amount, the merchant may want to try to rescue the order from rejection by further human investigation. The Policy Management Workstation also provides the capability of generating risk-based form filling, where there is provided a basic form that the consumer fills out, and the scoring system  evaluates and returns a score. Based on that score, the rules can spawn new pages that request more information, request that the consumer call the merchant or inform the consumer to expect a phone call from the merchant. However, a concern here is that the more information the merchant asks of the consumer, the less likely he or she is to buy.","Rules can also be used to add knowledge to the scoring models, and enhance the decision making process. The scoring models are based on historical information. Sometimes a recent event, however, can change the statistical likelihood predicted by a model. For example, a theft of credit cards from a post office could raise the likelihood of fraud in the zip codes covered by that post office, at least for a time. However, this event would not be reflected in an scoring model because the model was not built using data reflective of this type of occurrence. Consequently, it would be useful to deploy a rule to open fraud cases on all transactions in the affected zip codes, regardless of their fraud scores. In effect, the rule would add knowledge of the theft to the existing model.","In addition to using rules to respond to short-term fraud threats, the merchant can use them to represent patterns not reflected in the scoring model. Rules can also be deployed to reflect fraud trends that have not yet become solid in the historical data used when building the scoring model, and to take into account data sources not used by the model.","Rules are generally written by identifying fraud detection problems that the merchant wishes to solve, and articulating narrative expressions of the rules for detecting such fraud. The narrative expressions are then converted to pseudo code \u201cif-then\u201d statements, and organized in a logical manner. From there, the rules are encoded in the syntax of the rule base, using the appropriate functions, operators, and constants. For example, a rule may be:\n\n","This rule states that if a customer's email address is hotmail.com, the order is rejected per reason code \u2014a suspicious email address.","Another sample rule displays a web page to obtain additional information from the customer:\n\n","This rule requests additional information or requesting that the customer contact the merchant, and sends orders with scores greater than \u201cHighestScore\u201d to the Order Management Workstation via the OutsortOrder function. Here HighestScore is a global constant set up by the merchant. For example, HighestScore might be equal to 950.","Rule Structure","More generally, rules consist of statements that define conditions and determine actions to be taken if the conditions prove to be true\u2014for instance: If a customer's IP address falls within a certain group of numbers, then reject the order. Rule statements are written in a simplified version of the Pascal programming language. The following syntactic constructs are supported:\n\n","In one embodiment, the PMW  provides an easy to use graphical user interface that includes various windows and menus for creating rules, selecting operators, variables constants, functions, and other rule elements, and for sequencing the rules within a rule base.","The IF . . . THEN . . . ELSE construction of rules is generally conventional, allowing for nesting of conditions and actions. Begin and end block are set off by the BEGIN and END keywords, and delimit distinct elements of a rule to be treated as unit. Blocks group actions, nested conditions, or the creation of variables. BEGIN and END keywords must correspond.","Variable value assignment is provided by a VAR keyword, followed by a variable name and type.","There are several requirements when defining a variable:\n\n","The structured reference to data elements is provided by template fields. Template fields have two parts to their names, separated by a period (.). The segment to the left of the period indicates the data feed or template from which the field comes. The segment to the right of the period is the name of the field. A template is either an order or response template. The order template contains all fields containing data pertaining to online orders. The response template contains all fields containing responses from the scoring system . By specifying the appropriate template field, a rule can respond to the value of any element of the order or the response. For example \u201cORDER.billstate\u201d provides the billing state of the customer.","The operators include the standard +, \u2212, *, \/, =, <>, <, >, <=, >=, AND, NOT, OR, and IN. Functions include standard date, time, and string manipulation and conversion functions (e.g. converting time or dates to seconds or day numbers, days of week; left, right, mid string truncation) and numeric functions (maximum, minimum, absolute value, modula, random value, round).","In addition, functions specifically for accepting, rejecting, and outsorting orders are provided, along with a function for displaying a page. The syntax of these functions is as follows:","AcceptOrder\n\n","DisplayPage\n\n","OutsortOrder\n\n","RejectOrder\n\n","Finally, a rule is provided to test a field value against a negative file ","NegativeFile\n\n","An example negative file function is the following:\n\n","In this example, the phones negative file is queried to see if the phone number on the order matches one of the numbers in the phones negative file. If so, the order is flagged for rejection.","Decision Codes","The response structure used by the rule engine  uses the decision codes to indicate the status of each order following rule processing. These codes are used by the OMW to select the appropriate queues or by the fulfillment system to complete processing of the order.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0178","num":"0289"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 5"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Decision Codes"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Code","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["0","Sends flag to accept order"]},{"entry":["1","Sends flag to reject order"]},{"entry":["2","Sends flag to send order as an outsort to"]},{"entry":[{},"the Order Management Workstation."]},{"entry":["3","Processes the specified pageID to display"]},{"entry":[{},"a browser page, according to customer-"]},{"entry":[{},"developed programming linked to e-"]},{"entry":[{},"commerce application."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Using Negative Files","a) Card Number Negative Files","Most conventional fraud detection systems rely heavily on negative files for their online payment card fraud-risk decisions. While the scoring system  allows the merchant to build and use negative files, the system's scoring model already takes into consideration negative customer behavior on each payment card account, in a way that is vastly superior to the simple use of negative files. Credit-card based negative files, on the other hand, are human constructs that only describe the past negative behavior on those accounts. The use of this type of negative file alone in fraud decisions is by definition extremely limiting and ineffective. This is because by the time the information is placed into negative files by humans, the cards have usually been cancelled, and subsequent authorizations declined. If the merchant accepts a card which has been cancelled, the merchant is assessed a chargeback.","Merchants get a good volume of chargebacks from cardholders who take advantage of the card-not-present (CNP) charge-back rules and lie to disclaim participation in a purchase in which they participated. Card issuers often will not reissue cards on accounts with two or more CNP charge backs. Some issuers allow more. Issuers view the need to reissue cards as an added expense and inconvenience to their customers.","This means that online merchants can get transaction requests from cardholders who have successfully disputed legitimate transactions, and thereby stolen from them. Charge requests can be authorized by the issuer because they did not block the card. Orders can then pass through the merchant's fraud-detection system if the merchant has not put the card number in its negative files.","The merchant therefore should create a negative file for card numbers of customers who have stolen from them before. The limitation to this is that the customer can use another credit card the next time they make a fraudulent purchase. The multi-key profiling capability described above, provides a solution to identify such customers.","b) Using Addresses & Phone Numbers","Another kind of negative file that may be used by a merchant is a file of addresses of customers who have made fraudulent purchases, so that the merchant no longer sells and ships goods or services to those same addresses. The merchant can also create files to block orders from phone numbers where fraudulent purchases were made. The limitations, however, are that these are static negative files and people have a tendency to move, especially people in the habit of defrauding others. Someone else may move to the same address who is a legitimate customer. The phone company also reuses phone numbers. Thus both the address and phone number negative files may block good customers from making purchases. It is desirable therefore to institute policies and procedures for updating these files on a regular basis.","c) Using eMail Addresses","A merchant can also create a negative file of all email addresses from which fraudulent orders have been made. The limitation here is that it is easy to use a bogus card to sign up for a new email address online, with AOL, Hotmail or Yahoo. Fraudsters can then give a new email address the next time they make a purchase. Again, these files need to be frequently updated.","d) Using IP Addresses","A substantial amount of charge-back losses may be experienced on orders submitted from a specific IP address or range of IP addresses. These IP addresses can then put into a negative file. It is, however, easy to spoof an IP address, and is common that fraudsters use different IP addresses the next time they attempt an order. Again, frequent updating is desirable.","e) Using Zip Codes, Country Codes","Significant chargebacks may be experienced from certain zip codes. Likewise, some countries have high fraud percentages, such as Russia, Romania, Brazil and Argentina. The merchant can set up negative files of zip codes and countries to which it does not wish to ship merchandise.","f) Fake or Rude Names","It is also desirable to establish negative files for customer names, including the names of customers who made fraudulent purchases, in addition to names such as John Doe, Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck. Another more obtuse but interesting names negative file includes keyboard strings like \u201cASDF\u201d, \u201cQWER, :LKJ\u201d, \u201c1234\u201d, and so on, that are quick to type. Some fraudsters use rude strings to rub in the fact that they are stealing from the merchant. These names should also be put into negative files. The limitation is that as fraudsters become more sophisticated, they will not use keyboard strings and raunchy names.","Rules created via PMW  may be used to overcome some of the limitations of negative files described earlier, such as address and phone number changes. For example, a rule may say if the fraud score is high and the phone number is in a negative file, decline the order, but if the score is low approve or outsort the order. Rules can also cover multiple negative file hits. For example, if the rule looks at three negative files, Rude Names, Keyboard Strings, and Email Addresses, and all three are found, then a higher risk is assigned than if only two are found.","Using Velocity Rules","A velocity rule is a rule created via PMW, that lets the merchant track the number of times orders have been processed for certain key data, and lets the rule engine  automatically execute decisions based on those velocities. The rule engine  lets the merchant easily track velocities on multiple ORDER template fields over multiple time frames. Key data can be specific instances of any field of the ORDER template, such as credit card numbers (CARDNO), Social Security numbers (CUSTSSN), or customer IP addresses (CUSTIP).","The following table shows all fields of the ORDER template whose velocities the merchant can track using rules.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0199","num":"0310"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 6"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Fields Available for Velocity Tracking"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["ABA","CUSTFAX","PRODQUANTITY"]},{"entry":["ACCTTYPE","CUSTFIRSTNAME","PRODSKU"]},{"entry":["ACHRESPONSE","CUSTHOMEPHONE","PRODTYPE"]},{"entry":["AUTHAMT","CUSTID","PRODUNITPRICE"]},{"entry":["AUTHDT","CUSTIP","REGLOYALTY"]},{"entry":["AUTHRESP","CUSTLASTNAME","REGPROMOS"]},{"entry":["AUTHTM","CUSTMAXAGE","RESCORE"]},{"entry":["AVSRESPONSE","CUSTMIDNAME","RETURNALLOWED"]},{"entry":["BILLAPT","CUSTMINAGE","SHIPAPT"]},{"entry":["BILLCITY","CUSTSALUTATION","SHIPCITY"]},{"entry":["BILLCOUNTRY","CUSTSSN","SHIPCOMMENTS"]},{"entry":["BILLSTATE","CUSTWORKPHONE","SHIPCOUNTRY"]},{"entry":["BILLSTREET","CVV2DATA","SHIPFAX"]},{"entry":["BILLZIPCD","DEFFORMFILL","SHIPFIRSTNAME"]},{"entry":["CARDEXPDT","FORGOTPWD","SHIPINSTRUCTION"]},{"entry":["CARDNO","GIFTCARDTYPE","SHIPLASTNAME"]},{"entry":["CARDTYPE","GIFTMSG","SHIPMENTNO"]},{"entry":["CARRIER","HANDLING","SHIPMETHOD"]},{"entry":["CORPCITY","MANPARTNO","SHIPMIDNAME"]},{"entry":["CORPCOUNTRY","MANUFACTURER","SHIPSALUTATION"]},{"entry":["CORPFAX","MERCHANTCOUNTRY","SHIPSTATE"]},{"entry":["CORPNAME","MERCHANTID","SHIPSTREET"]},{"entry":["CORPPHONE","MERCHANTNM","SHIPZIPCD"]},{"entry":["CORPPONBR","MERCHANTSIC","SUBTOTAL"]},{"entry":["CORPPURCHASE","MERCHANTZIPCD","TAX"]},{"entry":["CORPPURCH-","ORDERBIN","TEST"]},{"entry":["DESC",{},{}]},{"entry":["CORPSTATE","ORDERDT","TOTAL"]},{"entry":["CORPSTREET","ORDERTM","TRANCATEGORY"]},{"entry":["CORPSUITE","ORDERTZ","TRANTYPE"]},{"entry":["CORPZIPCD","PASSWORD","UPC"]},{"entry":["CURRCD","PAYMETHOD","WEBSITE"]},{"entry":["CUSTAGE","PRENOTE","WRAPPED"]},{"entry":["CUSTBDATE","PREVIOUSCUST","PRODCD"]},{"entry":["CUSTCOOKIES","CUSTEMAIL","PRODCATEGORY"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Each of these fields may be associated with a unique code or tag, which can then be used to identify the field instead of by its field name.","Types of Velocity Rules","There are two types of velocity rules the merchant can create. The rule types work together to track velocities and make decisions based on tracked velocities:\n\n","Velocity rule bases are created like other rule bases, and sequenced for execution as well. It is preferable that velocity rules are executed before negative files in order to track the data fields in orders rejected by the negative files.","To create both types of velocity rules, the merchant uses a tag integer value that maps velocity fields to integers used internally by the rule engine . To make it easier to see which velocities are being tracked, the merchant should set up each field to be tracked as a constant that represents its tag integer value. For example the CARDNO field may be represented by a constant tag \u201c12\u201d. To track velocities then, the merchant adds a rule that creates and updates records for the key value of each field whose velocity the merchant wish to track. For example, the merchant can create a rule that will create and update a record that tracks velocity for each credit card number, Social Security number or IP address. This done using an UpdateVelocity rule function, which updates the flat file that tracks the desired field.","The UpdateVelocity function takes the following arguments:\n\n","For example, the function appears as follows when the merchant wish to update the velocity on all credit card numbers:\n\n","The merchant repeats this process for each field whose velocity the merchant is tracking. Additional examples of velocity tracking.\n\n","Once the UpdateVelocity rule is define, the merchant next defines a velocity decision rule, using the tracked velocity field. For example:\n\n","This rule states that if three or more orders have been placed in the past six days for the current credit card number, the order is flagged as a reject and assigned reason code , representing a suspicious velocity.","More generally, the Velocity rule has the following syntax:\n\n","The tag and key arguments are the same as those described above. The period argument represents the time over which the merchant wishes to calculate the velocity for the specified field, represented by nS, nM, nH, nD or nW, where n is an integer and S, M, H, D or W specify seconds, minutes, hours, days or weeks.","Once one or more velocity rules are defined, the rule engine  is restarted in order to register the new rules.","The rule engine  API includes functions to effect the use of velocity rules by the fulfillment system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0214","num":"0338"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00007","num":"00007"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 7"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Rule Engine API Velocity Functions"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Function","Description"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"VelocitySystemInit","Initializes the velocity database files."]},{"entry":[{},"OpenVelocityFile","Opens a velocity file for the specified"]},{"entry":[{},{},"field, or if necessary, creates and opens"]},{"entry":[{},{},"a new velocity file for the field."]},{"entry":[{},"CloseVelocityFile","Closes the velocity database for the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"tagged variable."]},{"entry":[{},"VelocitySystemTerm","Terminates the velocity database file"]},{"entry":[{},{},"system"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"The following sample code opens a velocity flat file that tracks up to three orders made on each credit card number for up to 6 days (6\u00d724=144 hours), and holds up to 10,000 records",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0216","num":"0340"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00008","num":"00008"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"static void VelocitySystemInit(void *Handle)"]},{"entry":[{},"{"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002OpenVelocityFile(Handle, CARDNO, 10000, 3, 144);"]},{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},"static void VelocitySystemTerm(void *Handle)"]},{"entry":[{},"{"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002CloseVelocityFile(Handle, CARDNO);"]},{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"Once a set of rules is defined, it is placed into the production environment through a testing protocol.

The merchant can then evaluate these rules individually before deciding to move them into their corresponding challenger rule base, which places them into production for a small percentage of the orders processed by the scoring system  (e.g. a 5% sample). This is done to make sure that the merchant does not introduce unexpected consequences into the production environment.","In order to judge the efficacy of the test rules, it is desirable to measure the frequency and accuracy of the rule firings. Frequency is determined by the number of rule firings. Accuracy is determined by examining fraud detection and false positive rates for each rule. Once a desired level of frequency and accuracy are reached, a rule may be moved to the challenger rule base for further testing.","Once moved into the challenger rule base, a rule will accept, reject, outsort, or request additional customer information via web page on a small percentage of orders it processes through the scoring system , eliminating the need to test the entire data feed being handled. Again, it is important to measure the effectiveness of the system after placing one or more rules into a challenger rule base ","A valuable report for learning the efficacy of a challenger rule base is the frequency of firing of a rule when data is flowing through it. This report tells the merchant how often a rule is actively operating to manage an order.","If after moving a rule to a challenger rule base, it is determined that the rule is not performing as desired, it may be moved back to its test rule base for further modification.","To obtain adequate confidence in a challenger rule base, it is desirable to operate such rules for a more extended period of time, from several weeks to several months. Once satisfied, the merchant can the promote challenger rules into the champion rule base ","Using eFalcon Scores","A primary output of the eFalcon system  is the fraud score that measures the likelihood that each order is fraudulent. In one embodiment, the merchant may create a rule that sets a threshold, or \u201ccutoff score,\u201d above which all orders are rejected. The merchant might then create a different rule, with a lower threshold score, \u201coutsort score,\u201d for which all orders receiving scores above that threshold and less than the first are flagged for further investigation. For example, these rules may be defined as follows:\n\n","In another embodiment, such orders can be automatically sent to the Order Management Workstation, to be tracked and handled via human intervention. These powerful tools put decision-making ability into the merchant's hands. By defining rules, the merchant can modify the basic system to meet the specific product, customer, and business requirements of the merchant's organization.","In using the eFalcon system, the determination of the cutoff score above which orders are investigated results from a cost-benefit analysis based on the fraud risk score and possibly other factors. The cost is the human resources required to investigate false-positive orders, and the benefit is the detection of genuine frauds and the prevention of fraud losses. An order should be investigated only when the expected benefit exceeds the expected cost. A further discussion of this cost-benefit analysis is set forth below.","An optimal strategy to improving the cost-benefit analysis is to investigate the riskiest accounts first. This strategy maximizes the number of frauds caught per customer contacted. Investigation should proceed down the list, through successively less risky accounts, and continue until the incremental cost of detecting the next fraud outweighs the expected fraud savings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0228","num":"0354"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0229","num":"0355"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"Working on orders assigned high scores is one way the merchant can use the system  to manage fraud risk. Alternative strategies can be developed to optimize different business objectives or incorporate previously unavailable information. The rules the merchant creates via the PMW  let the merchant incorporate expert opinion concerning high-risk activity, such as zip codes associated with known fraud rings, when designing the merchant's fraud prevention policies. For example, suppose the merchant's fraud expert determines that a fraud ring is operating somewhere in Chicago. The merchant can create rules that outsort all orders originating from zip codes in the areas that pose the highest risk.","With the system , the merchant's fraud analysts can add their knowledge of these conditions to the system as rules that create the most effective responses to high-risk situations. In this way, the system  provides an expert system capability combined with the system's statistical scoring models . The result is more flexible and powerful fraud detection that is adaptive to abnormalities.","Selecting Score Thresholds","Assessing Internet fraud risk is not a one-dimensional exercise. There are several categories or classes of risk. There are two types of risk classes that are often used synonymously, product risk and transaction risk, that should be separated and distinguished from each other. Product risk is the risk associated with the type of goods or services that the Internet merchant sells. Some products and services, by their very nature, are inherently more risky than others. For example, items that are easily convertible to cash, popular and desirable to be stolen, or are frequently disputed by cardholders have a high product risk. Assessing product risk is best accomplished by evaluating the Internet merchants market segment, historical risk performance, and business policies and practices.","Transaction risk is the risk inherent in each individual Internet transaction or order. Although a merchant may choose to do business in a high-risk product segment, the majority of their Internet orders are going to be legitimate. For example, what is the risk of fulfilling an order for one CD burner as compared to the risk of fulfilling an order for eight DVD players? Assessing transaction risk is best accomplished utilizing the data available in the order and the robust predictions of the scoring system . Assessing each risk category requires a different risk management strategy and has fundamentally different business decisions. Distinguishing between product and transaction risk is not always easy. However, the more one is able to distinguish between the two risk classes the better one will be able to be at designing risk management policies that are appropriate to the individual situation.","Internet based commerce may be categorized into the following the high level segmentations in Table 8.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0236","num":"0362"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00009","num":"00009"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 8"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Internet Commerce Segments"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Segment",{},{}]},{"entry":["Abbreviation","Segment","Internet Examples"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["VH","Very High Risk Segment","Online Gift Certificates"]},{"entry":["H","High Risk Segment","Digital Images or \u201cArt\u201d"]},{"entry":["M","Medium Risk Segment","Music, CD's, DVD's"]},{"entry":["ML","Medium to Low Risk","Books, Toys"]},{"entry":[{},"Segment"]},{"entry":["L","Low Risk Segment","Movies, Clothing"]},{"entry":["VL","Very Low Risk Segment","Online Newspapers"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Although these high level segmentations are useful they are generalized, and are only intended to provide a high level indication of the relative risk, as each merchant's specific processes and procedures will significantly impact their actual fraud losses.","The scoring system  takes into consideration unique product differences when it assigns the risk assessment, or probability, to a scoring request. Therefore the decision of what score thresholds to implement at the merchant site should be derived as a component of the merchant's cost structure. The selection of a score threshold is not a component of product risk or market segment, rather it is a component of the merchant's costs, such as cost of goods sold, cost for intervention, etc.","There are three potential score thresholds to consider. These are:","1) the automatic decline threshold (\u201ccutoff score\u201d)","2) the request additional information threshold (\u201cdisplay score\u201d), and","3) the order outsort threshold (\u201coutsort score\u201d).","In selecting these thresholds, the resulting performance of the system is measured with a number of metrics. The metrics used to evaluate the performance of each fraud policy include the following:\n\n","The transaction detection rate (TDR) represents the number of correctly identified fraudulent orders expressed as a percentage of all actual fraudulent orders. For instance, if there are 100 fraudulent orders and a policy correctly identifies 72 of them, the TDR is 72 percent. The transaction false-positive rate (TFPR), represents the number of orders incorrectly identified as fraudulent for each order correctly detected to be fraudulent by the rule or scoring model. A TFPR of 10:1, for example, means that for each fraudulent order detected, 10 legitimate orders are flagged as fraudulent. The dollar detection rate (DDR) is a percentage, defined as the ratio of the value of the fraudulent orders detected (in dollars) to the total dollar value of the potential fraud that would have been lost without the eFalcon system  in operation. For instance, if a person attempts to charge $2,000 to an account over several orders, and the system  identifies the account as fraudulent in time to prevent $1,000 of those charges, then the DDR is 50 percent. The DDR shows not merely whether a statistical model  and fraud policies catches fraud, but how fast.","What follows are some examples and formula for determining an appropriate score threshold for a merchant to intervene on an Internet order.","Table 9 is used to determine how to select the appropriate score thresholds for a merchant given these table values.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0247","num":"0376"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00010","num":"00010"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 9"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Score Thresholds"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},"Percent of",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Percent of","Percent of","Total Orders",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Fraudulent","Legitimate","with Scores",{},{}]},{"entry":["Score","Orders","Orders","above",{},{}]},{"entry":["Threshold","Detected","Misclassified","Threshold","DDR","TFPR"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["790","27.70","0.37","0.49","32.63","3.00"]},{"entry":["600","44.60","1.18","1.37","45.02","6.00"]},{"entry":["410","52.16","3.29","3.50","50.55","14.00"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Using the merchant's product net margin, the merchant can calculate an estimate of the score threshold where the break even exists for automatic declines.

important to a successful Internet fraud prevention program. The scoring calculations performed by the scoring system  rely on historical transaction data to achieve optimum performance. If limited data is available, fraud policies can boost the accuracy of a merchant's fraud-risk assessment. To obtain improved accuracy, it is desirable for the merchant to evaluate the fraud policies that are expressed by the rules, and ensure integration of these policies into the merchant's order system.","Evaluating the Performance of a Merchant's Fraud Policies","After creating rules encapsulating the merchant's policies via the PMW , the merchant should continuously monitored the fraud-detection performance of those policies. The merchant can then adjust them to increase fraud detection, reduce redundancy or reduce the volume of outsorted orders to be evaluated by the merchant's fraud analysts via the OMW  or otherwise. More specifically, the merchant should measure and evaluate the performance of the merchant's fraud policies on a weekly basis, and realign the priorities in the queue of all outsorted orders, so that they are evaluated as quickly as possible, beginning with those having the highest fraud-risk scores.","Unfortunately, when effective rules are poorly integrated into the merchant's system, the result can be reduced operational inefficiency and increased fraud losses. Effective integration of eFalcon fraud policies is based on:\n\n","After the merchant measure the performance of an fraud policy or rule, the merchant compares it to the scoring system  scores to determine the proper integration point and prioritize outsorted orders generated by the merchant's fraud policies against those generated by the scoring system .","For example, if a rule has a TFPR of 20:1 and a 5% DDR, on the surface it appears the rule is highly successful. The next step, however, is critical to the integration. If the merchant discover that all or a substantial portion of the fraud cases detected by the rule are in high scoring bands, the rule is not supplementing the scoring system , it is duplicating it. This results in an increased volume of ineffective cases on the rules' false positives and excessive outsorted orders and operational inefficiency.","If on the other hand, the fraud cases identified by the rule are not scored highly by the scoring system , the rule is supplemental. The key is to evaluate the scoring system  scores on the rule-identified orders in addition to the evaluating pure rule performance. This additional analysis results in integrated supplemental rules instead of volume increasing duplicate rules. For example, assume the sample 20:1 and 5% rule described above identifies fraudulent orders of which the scoring system  identifies 50 percent in the 900+ score band and 30 percent in the 800 to 900 score band. The rule would be best used, if at all, to identify fraud cases for those orders scoring below the  band. If, however, only 10 percent of the cases are identified by the scoring system  in the 900+ score band and 5 percent in the 800 to 900 score band, the rule would be best used to identify fraud for those orders scoring above 800, since the scoring system  is not readily identifying such orders as fraudulent.","Table 14 presents the integration issues.

The OMW  also allows the merchant to specify the reason for the decision, such as non-sufficient funds (NSF) or an anonymous email address.","If a representative wants to accept an order immediately, without reviewing the data (for example, if the order is placed by a known good customer), an Accept Order option processes the order with no further action required.","In addition to review functions, the OMW enables supervisors or other authorized personnel to create queues, add new users to the OMW, and perform other administrative tasks.","The OMW may be installed on the same machine as the PMW , or on a separate machine, as illustrated in .","Defining Queues","Queues are tools that group orders according to like characteristics (for example, orders over $2,000) and direct those orders to specific representatives for review. The OWM  gives authorized users the ability to define and create queues according to user-specified criteria. This queue definition feature gives the merchant the ability to control and direct workflow.","Through the use of queues, administrators select the type of orders that go to each representative, making the most efficient use of available resources. If no queues are specifically defined, default queues determine the sequence in which orders are presented. Once a queue is defined, it may be assigned to one, multiple, or all representatives.","OMW Security","Access to the OMW  is controlled by user logon IDs and, optionally, by user passwords. Each user is linked with a group. The group determines which OMW orders are available to that user. Typically, administrators have access to all OMW options, but the options available to representatives are restricted. If a user does not have access to an option, it does not appear on that user's menu list.","OMW Access Privileges","User IDs and passwords (if used) regulate access to the OMW. The OMW options that a user can use depend on the group (access level) assigned to the user's ID. There are four groups for the OMW.","Group Level 1: Review orders, update customer data, assign an order status, accept orders, select a queue, search for customers and orders, reply to letters, change user's own password, and use the tools options.","Group Level 2: Review orders, update customer data, assign an order status, accept orders, select a queue, search for customers and orders. Maintain user information (add and delete OMW users), change user passwords, define queues and assign queues to users, view queue statistics, reply to letters, and use the tools options.","Admin Group: Do all OMW menu functions.","Security Group: Maintain user information (add and delete OMW users), change user password, maintain window display lists, and use the tools options.","Order Review Procedures","Customer service representatives who are users of the OMW  follow certain procedures when reviewing orders and taking action based on the information. The procedures include the following:\n\n","a) Reviewing an Order","When the rule engine  analyzes order data, if the activity meets predefined criteria as defined by its rule bases, the rule engine  routes the order to the OMW . Orders go into queues set up by a supervisor or other authorized user. The queues then present the orders to representatives for review.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0309","num":"0470"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"600"},"The user can select certain orders to view, and display windows that contain customer and merchant data (email address, contact name, phone number, and so on), and detailed order information. The user may also enter comments about the status of the order, conversations with the customer, or the like. A letter log window displays a history of any letters sent or received pertaining to order. Chargeback and retrieval information is also available to the user, along with any negative file related data.","The user can also send email to the customer (since the email address is included in the order information), a fax, or a printed letter. These communications may be drafted from scratch, or may be based on templated form letters.","After reviewing the information, the user can assign an order status to the order to indicate the results of his investigation and record actions taken or recommended. The user may also accept the order with an Accept Order function. The user may also place negative information about the customer in one or more of the negative files. An order actions window allows users to view a history of activity on the order, and to update the information pertaining to the customer or order at any time. The user may also search for customers or orders based on any indexed order field.","If the user has access to multiple queues, then any of these queues can be selected for processing. As queues are processed by the user or others, the user may request to rebuild the queue to see only orders not yet handled.","The OMW provides data sorting and filtering tools that the user can use in a variety of ways. These include ascending and descending sorts on any field name available for display. Filters can likewise be set on any field to further limit the data displayed in a user's queue. Multi-field sorts and fields may also be defined, using complex mathematical or Boolean operations. All field types can be evaluated with the pre-defined comparisons, greater than >, less than <, equal to =, not equal to <>, greater than or equal to >=, or less than or equal to <=. In addition, text fields can be used with the LIKE operator to find wildcards (matching data) within text strings. Numeric and date comparison values can have a specific value. For example, a ship date field can be compared to NOWO plus 7 days to identify orders which are to ship within 7 days.","b) Assigning a Status to an Order","More specifically, after the user reviews the order information and make a decision, the user can select actions and assign a status to an order.  illustrates an Order Status window  use to assign or change a status, and to record information about the order. The Order Status window  allows the merchant to record the results of its investigation, specify the type of risk encountered, and indicate actions requested or taken. Each site determines its own risk categories and actions. The merchant can also use the Order Status window  to add information to negative files, or to forward the order to another representative. In this window, the user can select a status  to apply to the order, classify the type of risk , add comments , and check off which actions  have been taken. The statuses available include:","Accept Order: Accept the order and remove it from the open order queues.","Add to Negative File: Add the customer's name or other information to the negative file list. When selected, a window appears that allows the user to record the types of negative information discovered. The user may include a reason the negative information is being added, along with an expiration date after which the customer's data is removed from the negative file.","Forward: Put this order in another user's queue. (The order does not return to the original representative.)","Hold Shipment: Do not send the shipment until the date specified. A calender is provided to select the date. The held order is removed from its current queues. When the date is reached, the order reappears in the working queues for handling.","Reject Order: Reject the order and remove it from the order queues.","Defining Queues","A Queue Editor gives authorized users the tools to create customized work queues. Queues may be defined to group orders by score, order status, or a variety of other options. For example, a queue called High Dollar Amount may collect orders with totals that exceed $500.00. Then, as the rule engine  and OMW  analyze order data, all orders that meet the requirement go to that queue.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0324","num":"0485"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","802","804"]},"a) The Queue Section","Existing Queues\u2014A list of the current queues.","Created Area\u2014The person who created the queue, the date the queue was created, the last person who modified the queue, and the date the queue was last modified.","New\u2014Create a new queue.","Save As\u2014Copy the selected queue.","Modify\u2014Make changes to the selected queue.","Delete\u2014Delete the selected queue. A queue can only be deleted if no representatives are assigned to the queue.","Save\u2014Save the queue.","Cancel\u2014Erase the new or changed queue data.","Exit\u2014Return to the OMW main window.","b) The Editor Section","Criteria and Order By Fields\u2014Criteria allows selection of fields for the queue definition. Order By allows sorting orders within a queue by specific field values.","Current Queue Definition\u2014The existing queue definition for the selected queue.","Insert\u2014Inserts the statement into the Current Queue Definition area. This button is active only when there are entries in the queue component fields.","Delete\u2014Delete the highlighted statement in the Current Queue Definition field. This button is active only when the statement is highlighted. Deletes only the highlighted text.","Edit\u2014Edit the statement in the Current Queue Definition area. This button is active only when a statement is highlighted.","Replace\u2014Replace the current queue definition with the definition in the component fields. This button is active only after selection of the Edit button.","Move Up\u2014When there are multiple statements in the Current Queue definition area, move the highlighted statement up one line. This button is active only when a statement is highlighted.","Move Down\u2014When there are multiple statements in the Current Queue definition area, move the highlighted statement down one line. This button is active only when a statement is highlighted.","Verify\u2014Confirm that the queue definition is accurate.","Show SQL\u2014Show the Structured Query Language (SQL) statements used by the OMW to select orders for the queue.  illustrates an example SQL statement.","c) Building Queue Definitions","An order must meet the conditions of the queue definition to be added to a queue. Queues are defined with logical statements having the basic format:","Field Name-Operator-Constant-Connector (optional)","The following list describes the queue components.","Field Name: This list box contains customer and order data fields to use in a queue definition. Each field name has a prefix, which is set off from the field by a period. The prefix represents the name of the table that stores the field in the database. For example, the field CUS.BILLCOUNTRY is the customer's city as it appears in the billing address, and it is stored in a Customer Data Table.  illustrates an example of this list box  for selecting a field.","Operator: The operator is the mathematical operation the OMW  uses to compare the field values of an order. The operators are: >, <, =, >=, <=, <>, and LIKE. LIKE finds entries where the data is like the constant data. A list box is provided for selecting the operator.","Constant: The constant is an alphabetic or numeric value. Unlike the other queue components, the constant value is specified directly in the field, for example a specific zip code or currency amount. The field name determines whether the constant field accepts alphabetic characters, numeric characters, or both.","Connector\u2014The optional connector links statements to form compound statements. The connectors are AND, NOT, AND_NOT, OR, and OR_NOT.","For example, a queue called High Dollar Amount may be defined by the queue definition statement","ORDMASTER.TOTAL>500.","In this definition, the field name is ORDMASTER.TOTAL (total amount of the order), the operator is >(greater than), and the constant is 500 (five hundred dollars). In this example, the queue will contain only orders with totals over $500.00.","The Connector field link multiple queue statements together. For examplee, a queue called High Scoring New Orders may have the queue definition","ORDERMASTER.CAS_STA=0 AND ORDMASTER.SCOR>900.","In this definition, an order must meet both criteria; the order must have a status of 0 (a new order) and receive a score greater than 900. For compound statements, the position of statements in the definition determines the priority. In other words, the OMW acts on the first statement in the definition, then the second statement, and so on.","After building a queue definition, the Queue Editor checked the definition to be sure that it is formatted correctly, and that the fields in the definition exist in the database. After the Queue Editor checks the definition, it displays a message that indicates whether the queue definition is valid, and Whether any orders meet the queue definition.","d) Maintaining Queues","A user may create a new queue from scratch, or if there is an existing one that closely matches the queue the user wants to create, the user can copy the existing queue and make changes. The user may can also change and delete queues.","The user may use an Order By option to sort orders within a queue. When the Queue Editor  window first appears, the OMW defaults to Criteria mode  for the current queue definition. In this mode, the user defines the queue parameters, as discussed above. When the mode is switched to Order By, as illustrated in , the Editor  displays the fields used to prioritize orders within the queue. The Field Name  displays the sort fields, and the operator allows sorting orders in either ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) succession. In this example, the orders will be presented by oldest order first, since the Field Name ORDMASTER.ORDERDT for order date is selected, along with the operator DESC for descending. If the user does not select a sequence, the default sequence is descending order by score.","e) Assigning Queues to Users","Referring to , the Assign Queues to Users window  allows an authorized user to assign one or more order queues to each user. If desired, the user can customize their own work flow by assigning queues that contain specific types of orders. For example, one representative may be assigned to review all held orders, another review all callbacks. Once the queues are assigned, a representative receives orders only from those queues. The Assign Queues to Users window  the queues currently assigned to a user, and the queues available for assignment. The sections and buttons in the Assign Queues to Users window are:","User : A list of all OMW users.","Available Queues : Queues not assigned to the listed user.","Assigned Queues : Queues assigned to the listed user","Add: Move the highlighted selection in the Available Queues list to the Assigned Queues. This button is active only when an available queue is highlighted.","Remove: Move the highlighted selection in the Assigned Queues list to the Available Queues. This button is active only when an assigned queue is highlighted.","Move Up: When there are multiple queues in the Assigned Queue list, move the highlighted queue up one line. This button is active only when an assigned queue is highlighted.","Move Down: When there are multiple queues in the Assigned Queue list, move the highlighted queue down one line. This button is active only when an assigned queue is highlighted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0373","num":"0534"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":"1300"},"As will be understood by those familiar with the art, the invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof.
