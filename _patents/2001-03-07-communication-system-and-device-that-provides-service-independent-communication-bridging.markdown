Field of the Invention","The invention is related to the field of communications, and in particular, to communication systems and devices that provide communication bridges under the control of a bridge agent.","2. Description of the Prior Art","A communication device transfers user communications between users. The communication device has a control system and a communication fabric. The communication fabric routes the user communications. The control system processes control information related to the communications to control the communication fabric.","A communication device provides a communication bridge by copying the user communications that are transferred to another user and transferring the copy to a third party. For example, consider that a communication device transfers user communications between User A and User B. The communication device can provide a communication bridge by transferring a copy of the user communications to an agent C. A communication device also provides a communication bridge by transferring third party communications to the users along with the user communications. In the above example, the communication device can provide a communication bridge by transferring agent C communications to User A and User B along with the user communications.","One example of communication bridging occurs when an operator must interrupt an on-going user communication to provide information to a user. For example, an operator may interrupt a voice communication to inform a user of an emergency. Another example of communication bridging occurs when a law enforcement agency directs a communication system to transfer a copy of user communications to them. For example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) may require a communication system to provide the FBI with a voice tap\u2014a live copy of user voice communications without the knowledge of the users. A tap is a passive one-way bridge, and the term \u201cbridge\u201d includes taps.","At present, bridge control protocols for communication devices are specific to the device manufacturer and are usually proprietary. Unfortunately, communication systems are increasingly comprised of different communication devices from diverse manufacturers. Thus, the communication system must have a complex bridge control system because the diverse array of communication devices use different bridge control protocols, such as SGCP, MGCP, or others.","In the computer field, peripheral devices, such as printers and modems, are connected to a computer. The computer is configured with an operating system and device drivers. The device drivers provide a software interface between the operating system and the peripheral devices. The peripheral devices must be able to interpret the instructions from the device drivers. Typically, the peripheral device manufacturer provides software device drivers that are compatible with their peripheral devices and also with commercial operating systems. In some cases, a peripheral device may automatically transfer their software driver to a common registry for use by any system that needs to control the peripheral device. Unfortunately, this device driver technology has not been effectively applied to provide better control of communication bridging.","The invention helps solve the above problems with communication systems, devices, and methods to implement bridges. The invention uses software applications to interface between a bridge agent and various communication devices. Advantageously, the software applications allow the bridge agent to use a common bridge request format that greatly simplifies bridge agent design and operation. The software applications translate the common bridge requests into various bridge commands that are customized to the various communication devices. Thus, the bridge agent uses a common request format, but the communication devices may retain their own proprietary command formats.","Some examples of the invention include a communication system and method of operation. A first communication device automatically transfers a first software application to the bridge agent in response to an operational control channel between the first communication device and the bridge agent. The bridge agent executes the first software application to translate a first bridge request into a first bridge command. The bridge agent transfers the first bridge command to the first communication device. The first communication device receives the first bridge command through a first physical port dedicated to bridge control. The first communication device processes the first bridge command to implement a first bridge.","The bridge agent executes a second software application to translate a second bridge request into a second bridge command. The bridge agent transfers the second bridge command from the bridge agent to a second communication device. The second communication device receives the second bridge command through a second physical port dedicated to bridge control. The second communication device processes the second bridge command to implement a second bridge.","The first bridge may copy all user communications transferred from a first user to a link and transfer the copies to the bridge agent. The first bridge may copy all user communications transferred from a link to a first user and transfer the copies to the bridge agent. The first bridge may transfer agent communications from the bridge agent to a first user. The first communication device and the second communication device may be from different manufacturers. The first bridge request and the second bridge request may have the same format, but the first bridge command and the second bridge command may have different formats.","Some examples of the invention include a communication device and method of operation. The communication device has a physical port dedicated to a bridge agent. The communication device has a bridge control coupled to the physical port and configured to automatically transfer a software application to the bridge agent in response to an operational control channel between the physical port and the bridge agent. The bridge control is configured to receive and process a bridge command to generate control signals. The communication device has a communication fabric configured to implement a bridge in response to the control signals.","System Configuration\u2014",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","103","110","101","110","121","124","102","110","122","123","103","110","141","144"]},"The links may include switches, routers, protocol converters, or other communication devices.

Communication control processes the request to transfer corresponding control signals to the communication fabric. The communications fabric configures itself to provide the communication service in response to the control signals. User A sends a second communication to the communication fabric in the communication device. The communication fabric routes the second communication to user B. Because the bridge agent has not taken down the bridge, the communication fabric also transfers a copy of the second communication to the bridge agent.","The bridge agent then transfers a command to bridge control to take down the bridge. Bridge control processes the command to transfer corresponding control signals to the communication fabric. The communication fabric configures itself to take down the bridge. Subsequently, user A sends a third communication to the communication fabric in the communication device. The communication fabric routes the third communication to user B. Since the bridge is down, the communication fabric does not transfer a copy of the third communication to the bridge agent.","On , user A sends a fourth communication to the communication fabric in the communication device. The communication fabric routes the fourth communication to user B. Since the bridge is still down, the communication fabric does not transfer a copy of the fourth communication to the bridge agent.","The bridge agent then transfers a command to bridge control. Bridge control processes the command to transfer corresponding control signals to the communication fabric. The communication fabric configures itself to implement the desired bridge\u2014in this case to bridge agent communications from the bridge agent to user B. The bridge agent transfers a fifth communication to the communication fabric. In response to the control signals, the communication fabric transfers the fifth communication to user B.","The bridge agent transfers another command to bridge control. Bridge control processes the command to transfer corresponding control signals to the communication fabric. The communications fabric configures itself to implement the desired bridge\u2014in this case to bridge all user communications between users A and B to the bridge agent and to bridge agent communications from the bridge agent to users A and B. The bridge agent transfers a sixth communication to the communication fabric. In response to the control signals, the communication fabric transfers the sixth communication to both users A and B. User A sends a seventh communication to the communication fabric. The communication fabric routes the seventh communication to user B. The communication fabric also transfers a copy of the seventh communication to the bridge agent. User B sends an eighth communication to the communication fabric. The communication fabric routes the eighth communication to user A. The communication fabric also transfers a copy of the eighth communication to the bridge agent.","The communication system could provide required copies of user communications to law enforcement agencies. For example, the FBI may operate the bridge agent to tap user communications where probable cause exists for surveillance. The FBI may have the communication system operate some components of the bridge agent.","The communication system could provide an operator center with an interface to interrupt user communications. For example, an operator may desire to communicate with users in a busy line verification or interrupt operation. This typically occurs when users are busy communicating with one another and the immediate attention of one of the users is required to respond to an emergency.
