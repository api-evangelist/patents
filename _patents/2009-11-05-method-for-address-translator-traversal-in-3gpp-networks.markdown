title: Method for address translator traversal in 3GPP networks
abstract: In response to an ACTIVATE PACKET DATA PROTOCOL (PDP) CONTEXT REQUEST message from a host, including a global reachability request option that requests a global IP address and a global port to be allocated to the host, a serving gateway transmits a CREATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message to an Internet gateway device. The CREATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message includes the global reachability request option. In response to a CREATE PDP CONTEXT RESPONSE message from the Internet gateway, where the CREATE PDP CONTEXT RESPONSE message includes a global reachability response option specifying therein a global IP address and a global port allocated to the host, the serving gateway transmits an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message to the host, where the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message includes the global reachability response option. As a result, the host does not need to establish a separate connection session to the Internet gateway device to acquire the same.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE DESCRIPTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the invention relate generally to the field of network computing; and more particularly, to network address translator traversal.","Network operators frequently apply address translation to separate the local Internet protocol (IP) addresses they use inside their networks from the global IP addresses at which the networks are reachable from an external network such as the Internet. One of the various purposes is to keep their local IP address structure independent of the provider assigning their global IP addresses, to conceal their internal network topology from the rest of the Internet for security reasons, or to conserve global IP addresses by sharing a single global IP address among multiple local addresses. In particular, the latter purpose is of growing importance, where the imminent run-out of unallocated global IP version 4 (IPv4) address puts a pressure on network operators to use these addresses economically.","In order to accomplish the purposes identified above, address translators perform two functions. First, they rewrite addresses in packets en route, swapping local IP addresses with the corresponding global IP addresses or vice versa. This enables provider independent and network topology concealment. Second, address translators multiplex multiple local addresses onto a single global address. This enables conservation of global addresses. To enable de-multiplexing of packets received at a shared global address back onto the right local address, address translators store address mappings as connection-specific disambiguation state, and they use the connection initiator's port number in received packets as indexes into this state. To ensure uniqueness of this port number across all connections handled by an address translator, the port number may have to be translated. The mapping between the resulting local and global port numbers is then stored as a part of the corresponding disambiguation state.","Address translation requires awareness in applications that expect to be contacted by remote peers. Such applications must refer their peers to a combination of global address and global port number at which they are reachable by those peers, since in the presence of an address translator, their local address and global port number may be unreachable by the peers. The applications must hence have a means through which they can discover a global address and global port number. This is commonly referred to as address translator traversal. Conventional systems for address translator traversal require applications to inquire of infrastructure what a packet's source address and global port number look like after translation.","The conventional address translator traversal methods cause extra signaling, which may reduce the effective network bandwidth; reduce uptime of battery-powered hosts; and increase application start-up latencies. This signaling overhead can be large because: (a) it must be done for every application, and (b) it not only occurs during the beginning of a communication session, but also periodically for refresh purposes. The existing address translator traversal methods typically exchange multiple message pairs in order to determine the type of address translator through which they are reachable. The address translator traversal is typically performed by individual applications even if multiple applications reside on the same host.","Techniques for performing a network address translator traversal for a host of a third generation partnership project (3GPP) network to acquire a global Internet protocol (IP) address and a global port using existing 3GPP protocols are described herein. According to one aspect of the invention, in response to an ACTIVATE PACKET DATA PROTOCOL (PDP) CONTEXT REQUEST message from a host, including a global reachability request option that requests a global IP address and a global port to be allocated to the host, a serving gateway transmits a CREATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message to an Internet gateway device. The CREATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message includes the global reachability request option. In response to a CREATE PDP CONTEXT RESPONSE message from the Internet gateway, where the CREATE PDP CONTEXT RESPONSE message includes a global reachability response option specifying therein a global IP address and a global port allocated to the host, the serving gateway transmits an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message to the host, where the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message includes the global reachability response option. As a result, the host does not need to establish a separate connection session to the Internet gateway device to acquire the same.","According to another aspect of the invention, a serving gateway device receives a MODIFY PACKET DATA PROTOCOL (PDP) CONTEXT REQUEST message from a host, where the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message includes a global reachability extension request option that requests an additional global port to be allocated to the host. In response to the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, the serving gateway transmits an UPDATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message to the Internet gateway device, where the UPDATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message includes the global reachability extension request option from the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message. Subsequently, the serving gateway receives an UPDATE PDP CONTEXT RESPONSE message from the Internet gateway, where the UPDATE PDP CONTEXT RESPONSE message includes a global reachability extension response option specifying therein an additional global port allocated to the host. In response to the UPDATE PDP CONTEXT RESPONSE message, a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message is transmitted from the serving gateway device to the host, where the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message includes the global reachability extension response option from the UPDATE PDP CONTEXT RESPONSE message. As a result, the host does not need to establish a separate connection session to the Internet gateway device in order to acquire an additional global port to be associated with the host.","According to another aspect of the invention, a serving gateway device receives a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message from a host, where the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message includes a global reachability deallocation request option that  requests deallocation of a global port associated with the host. In response to the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, a UPDATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message is transmitted from the serving gateway device to the Internet gateway device, where the UPDATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message includes the global reachability deallocation request option from the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message. Subsequently, the serving gateway receives a UPDATE PDP CONTEXT RESPONSE message from the Internet gateway, where the UPDATE PDP CONTEXT RESPONSE message includes a global reachability deallocation response option indicating a status of the deallocation of the global port. In response to the UPDATE PDP CONTEXT RESPONSE message, a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message is transmitted from the serving gateway device to the host, where the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message includes the global reachability deallocation response option from the UPDATE PDP CONTEXT RESPONSE message. As a result, the host does not need to establish a separate connection session to the Internet gateway device in order to deallocate a global port associated with the host.","Other features of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description which follows.","In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth. However, it is understood that embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known circuits, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure the understanding of this description.","References in the specification to \u201cone embodiment,\u201d \u201can embodiment,\u201d \u201can example embodiment,\u201d etc., indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it is submitted that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to affect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.","In the following description and claims, the terms \u201ccoupled\u201d and \u201cconnected,\u201d along with their derivatives, may be used. It should be understood that these terms are not intended as synonyms for each other. \u201cCoupled\u201d is used to indicate that two or more elements, which may or may not be in direct physical or electrical contact with each other, co-operate or interact with each other. \u201cConnected\u201d is used to indicate the establishment of communication between two or more elements that are coupled with each other.","According to some embodiments of the invention, a mechanism is provided to mitigate certain problems described above. Like existing methods for address translator traversal, embodiments of the invention enable applications to discover a global IP address (also simply referred to as a global address) and a global port number (also simply referred to as a global port) through which they can be reached from remote peers. As mentioned above, the signaling overhead of the conventional address translator traversal can be relatively large because: (a) it must be done for every application, and (b) it not only occurs during the beginning of a communication session, but also periodically for refresh purposes. The embodiments of the invention reduce the above signaling overhead because it piggybacks onto an existing protocol, i.e., the PDP context establishment and modification protocol. Specifically, embodiments of the invention utilize a piggyback technique to the packet data protocol (PDP) context activation procedure and\/or PDP context modification procedure, which third generation partnership project (3GPP) networks require to enable a host for IP-based communications. Thus, embodiments of the invention reduce the extra signaling of dedicated address translator traversal.","According to one embodiment, the PDP context activation procedure is augmented to set up the IP connectivity for hosts, with address translator traversal functionality. Similar to existing methods for address translator traversal, embodiments of the invention enable applications to establish a global reachability in the presence of address translators. According to one embodiment, the address translator traversal is performed as a part of a host's network attachment procedure rather than during an application startup. The results may be subsequently made available by a host to one or more interested applications (e.g., applications running within the host). According to one embodiment, a host can discover a range of global port numbers in combination with their global address rather than only a single global port number. This is necessary because the results of address translator traversal are for use by multiple applications instead of a single application.","Embodiments of the invention extend the PDP context activation and modification procedures with one or more new message options. The new message options enable a host to indicate the 3GPP network to either inform the host that address translation is not used, or to push the requested information to the host. The new message options may be implemented as new information elements (e.g., a designated option or options) or as new parameters for an existing option such as a protocol configuration option defined in the 3GPP specification.","The PDP context activation procedure is a two-way handshake process between a host and the Internet gateway that connects a 3GPP network to the Internet. The handshake is carried out via the host's current serving gateway, which serves as a relay between the host and the Internet gateway. An Internet gateway is also referred to as a gateway general packet radio service (GPRS) support node (GGSN) and a serving gateway is also referred to as serving GPRS support node (SGSN).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["101","101","104","102","101","101","102","102","103","102","105"]},"The Internet gateway  approves, modifies, or declines the parameters requested by the host  and allocates resources accordingly at operations . The Internet gateway  then sends, via transaction , a Create PDP Context Response message to the serving gateway . The parameters granted to the host  may be included in the Create PDP Context Response message as an option. The serving gateway  relays, via transaction , to host  in a form of an Activate PDP Context Accept message.","Further detailed information concerning the transactions as shown in  can be found in the 3GPP specification such as 3GPP Technical Specification 29.060, June 2009, entitled \u201c3Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Core Network and Terminals; General Packet Radio Service (GPRS); GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) Across the Gn and Gp Interface (Release 8)\u201d and 3GPP Technical Specification 24.008, June 2009, entitled \u201c3Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Core Network and Terminals; Mobile Radio Interface layer 3 Specification; Core Network Protocols; Stage 3 (Release 8).\u201d The disclosure of the above identified 3GPP specifications are incorporated by reference herein it its entirety.","According to some embodiments of the invention, new options are defined and utilized in the messages exchanged during the PDP context activation procedure described above. In one embodiment, a Global Reachability Information Request option is introduced to indicate a host's interest in a global IP address and a global port (e.g., a global transport control protocol or TCP port) number range. A Global Reachability Information Response option is introduced to return such information back to the host. According to one embodiment, the Global Reachability Information Request option may be used in the Activate PDP Context Request and Create PDP Context Request messages described above. Similarly, the Global Reachability Information Response option may be used in the Create PDP Context Response and Activate PDP Context Accept messages described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["101","101","201","102","101","101","101","101"]},"After authentication, the serving gateway  generates a Create PDP Context Request message based on the parameters from the Activate PDP Context Request message. In one embodiment, the Create PDP Context Request message includes the Global Reachability Information Request option extracted from the Activate PDP Context Request message. The Create PDP Context Request message is then transmitted from serving gateway  to an Internet gateway  associated with the serving gateway  via transaction .","The Internet gateway  approves, modifies, or declines the parameters requested by the host  and allocates resources accordingly at operations . In addition, the Internet gateway  further allocates a global IP address and a list of global ports (e.g., a range of global port numbers) for host . The Internet gateway  then sends, via transaction , a Create PDP Context Response message to the serving gateway . The parameters granted to the host  may be included in the Create PDP Context Response message as an option. In addition, according to one embodiment, the Create PDP Context Response message includes a Global Reachability Information Response option including the global address and global ports allocated to host . If the corresponding 3GPP network does not use address translation, according to one embodiment, the global address returned in the Global Reachability Information Response option equals to a local address of host  and the global port number range includes the full set of global port numbers.","The serving gateway  relays, via transaction , to host  in a form of an Activate PDP Context Accept message. Host  further provides an interface (e.g., application programming interface or API) to one or more applications hosted by host  to discover the global address and global port number range obtained from the Internet gateway , and through which they can reserve and deallocate global ports as needed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","102","301"]},"In response to the Activate PDP Context Request, at block , the serving gateway generates a Create PDP Context Request including the Global Reachability Information Request from the Activate PDP Context Request, and sends the Create PDP Context Request to an Internet gateway associated with the serving gateway. At block , the serving gateway receives a Create PDP Context Response from the Internet gateway, including a Global Reachability Information Response option having a global address and one or more ports allocated by the Internet gateway. At block , the serving gateway generates an Activate PDP Context Accept including the Global Reachability Information Response option from the Create PDP Context Response, and sends the Activate PDP Context Accept to the host. As a result, the host does not have to initiate a separate connection session in order to obtain the same information. Specifically, the host does not need to pursue additional address translator traversal signaling transactions with the serving gateway and\/or Internet gateway.","The number of global ports assigned to a host is at the discretion of the Internet gateway. Since the Internet gateway can at best use heuristics to estimate the number of global ports that a host may require, a host may at times require more global ports than it was assigned by the Internet gateway during the initial PDP context activation procedure. Likewise, a host may have been assigned more global ports than it actually needs. According to certain embodiments, a PDP context modification procedure defined by the above 3GPP specifications is extended to enable both the assignment of an additional global port to a host, and the deallocation of an unused global port from the host.","The PDP context modification procedure is used in the 3GPP networks to change certain parameters negotiated during the initial PDP context activation procedure Like PDP context activation, PDP context modification is a two-way handshake between a host and the Internet gateway, enabling the same use of option pairs for negotiation between the host and the Internet gateway. According to one embodiment, two additional options are introduced to be used with the PDP context modification procedure. First, a pair of Global Reachability Extension Request option and Global Reachability Extension Response option is defined to enable, respectively, a host to request an additional global port, and an Internet gateway to return the additional global port if possible. Second, a pair of Global Reachability Deallocation Request option and a Global Reachability Deallocation Response option is defined to enable, respectively, a host to return an unused global port, and the Internet gateway to confirm the deallocation of the unused port to the host.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["401","101","102","102","103","402","403","103","103","102","404","102","101","405"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["501","101","102"]},"Serving gateway  in turn generates and sends an Update PDP Context Request message to the Internet gateway  via transaction .

The PDP context activation unit  is configured to perform the extended PDP context activation procedure including handling global reachability information requests as described above. The PDP context modification unit  is configured to perform the extended PDP context modification procedure including modifying global reachability information as described above.","Referring back to , in the case that the network element  is a router (or is implementing routing functionality), the control plane  typically determines how data (e.g., packets) is to be routed (e.g., the next hop for the data and the outgoing port for that data), and the data plane (e.g., lines cards -) is in charge of forwarding that data. For example, the control plane  typically includes one or more routing protocols (e.g., Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), Interior Gateway Protocol(s) (IGP) (e.g., Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS), etc.), Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP), etc.) that communicate with other network elements to exchange routes and select those routes based on one or more routing metrics.","Routes and adjacencies are stored in one or more routing structures (e.g., Routing Information Base (RIB), Label Information Base (LIB), one or more adjacency structures, etc.) on the control plane (e.g., database ). The control plane  programs the data plane (e.g., line cards -) with information (e.g., adjacency and route information) based on the routing structure(s). For example, the control plane  programs the adjacency and route information into one or more forwarding structures (e.g., Forwarding Information Base (FIB), Label Forwarding Information Base (LFIB), and one or more adjacency structures) on the data plane. The data plane uses these forwarding and adjacency structures when forwarding traffic.","Each of the routing protocols downloads route entries to a main routing information base (RIB) based on certain route metrics (the metrics can be different for different routing protocols). Each of the routing protocols can store the route entries, including the route entries which are not downloaded to the main RIB, in a local RIB (e.g., an OSPF local RIB). A RIB module that manages the main RIB selects routes from the routes downloaded by the routing protocols (based on a set of metrics) and downloads those selected routes (sometimes referred to as active route entries) to the data plane. The RIB module can also cause routes to be redistributed between routing protocols. For layer 2 forwarding, the network element  can store one or more bridging tables that are used to forward data based on the layer 2 information in this data.","For the purpose of illustration only, only one control card and two line cards are shown in . Typically, a network element includes a set of one or more line cards, a set of one or more control cards, and optionally a set of one or more service cards (sometimes referred to as resource cards). These cards are coupled together through one or more mechanisms (e.g., a first full mesh coupling the line cards and a second full mesh coupling all of the cards). The set of line cards make up the data plane, while the set of control cards provide the control plane and exchange packets with external network element through the line cards. The set of service cards can provide specialized processing (e.g., Layer 4 to Layer 7 services (e.g., firewall, IPsec, IDS, P2P), VoIP Session Border Controller, Mobile Wireless Gateways (GGSN, Evolved Packet System (EPS) Gateway), etc.). By way of example, a service card may be used to terminate IPsec tunnels and execute the attendant authentication and encryption algorithms. As used herein, a network element (e.g., a router, switch, bridge, etc.) is a piece of networking equipment, including hardware and software, that communicatively interconnects other equipment on the network (e.g., other network elements, end stations, etc.). Some network elements are \u201cmultiple services network elements\u201d that provide support for multiple networking functions (e.g., routing, bridging, switching, Layer 2 aggregation, session border control, Quality of Service, and\/or subscriber management), and\/or provide support for multiple application services (e.g., data, voice, and video).","Subscriber end stations (e.g., servers, workstations, laptops, palm tops, mobile phones, smart phones, multimedia phones, Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) phones, portable media players, global positioning system (GPS) units, gaming systems, set-top boxes, etc.) access content\/services provided over the Internet and\/or content\/services provided on virtual private networks (VPNs) overlaid on the Internet. The content and\/or services are typically provided by one or more end stations (e.g., server end stations) belonging to a service or content provider or end stations participating in a peer to peer service, and may include public Web pages (free content, store fronts, search services, etc.), private Web pages (e.g., username\/password accessed Web pages providing email services, etc.), corporate networks over VPNs, etc. Typically, subscriber end stations are coupled (e.g., through customer premise equipment coupled to an access network (wired or wirelessly)) to edge network elements, which are coupled (e.g., through one or more core network elements) to other edge network elements, which are coupled to other end stations (e.g., server end stations).","Note that network element  is described for the purpose of illustration only. More or fewer components may be implemented dependent upon a specific application. For example, although a single control card is shown, multiple control cards may be implemented, for example, for the purpose of redundancy. Similarly, multiple line cards may also be implemented on each of the ingress and egress interfaces. Also note that some or all of the components as shown in  may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of both.","Some portions of the preceding detailed descriptions have been presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory.

The operations are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated.
