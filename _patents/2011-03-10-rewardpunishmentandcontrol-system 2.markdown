{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This disclosure generally relates to a web-based system for encouraging users to perform desirable activities and discouraging users from performing undesirable activities.","There are certain activities that a person may not want to perform and yet are beneficial to the person. Conversely, there are certain activities that a person may wish to perform and yet are harmful to the person. For example, a person may not want to exercise on a regular basis because it is time consuming and physically demanding, and yet, regular exercise, in general, helps improve the person's physical as well as mental conditions. As another example, a person may wish to smoke, and yet, smoking is harmful to the person's physical health and may cause various diseases.","Sometimes, a person may be encouraged to perform a beneficial activity or discouraged from performing a harmful activity. Such examples may often be found in a parent-child relationship. The parent may wish to encourage the child to study and complete his homework before watching television or playing games. The parent may also wish to discourage the child from smoking, drinking alcohol, and staying out late.","There are times when a first person (e.g., a parent) may wish to encourage a second person (e.g., a child) to perform a desirable activity (e.g., study, exercise). The encouragement may be necessary because the second person does not want to perform the desirable activity even though it may be beneficial to the second person. Similarly, there are times when a first person may wish to discourage a second person from performing an undesirable activity (e.g., drinking alcohol, speeding, smoking)). The discouragement may be necessary because the second person wants to perform the undesirable activity even though it may be harmful to the second person. For clarification purposes, in this disclosure, the first person (i.e., the person who encourages or discourages) is referred to as a \u201ccontroller\u201d; and the second person (i.e., the person being encouraged or discouraged) is referred to as an \u201cactor\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","110","120"]},"In particular embodiments, a controller  may be associated with and use any number of clients  (e.g., clients A, B) to access the web-based application hosted on server . Similarly, in particular embodiments, an actor  may be associated with and use any number of clients  (e.g., clients C, D) to access the web-based application hosted on server . For example, when actor  is at home, actor  may use a desktop computer to access server . But when actor  is out (e.g., at a park or a movie theater), actor  may use a smart phone to access server .","In particular embodiments, each client , and more specifically, each client  used by actor  (e.g., clients C, D), may include one or more types of sensors for detecting various types of information, such as, for example and without limitation, Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates (e.g., detected by a GPS sensor), motion (e.g., detected by an accelerometer), orientation (e.g., detected by a gyroscope), bar code (e.g., detected by a bar code reader or a camera with supporting software), image recognition, facial recognition (e.g., detected by a camera with supporting software), temperature (e.g., detected by a thermometer), humidity, light, calorie burned, body fat, audio volume (e.g., detected by a microphone), breathing, heart or pulse rate (e.g., detected by a heart rate monitor), or blood alcohol content (e.g., detected by a breathalyzer). Different clients  may include different types of sensors, and this disclosure contemplates any suitable types of sensors. In particular embodiments, the information detected by specific sensors may be analyzed to infer what actor  does or where actor  is at a given time or over a period of time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIGS. 2A, 2B, and 2C","FIG. 2A","FIG. 1","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2C","FIG. 1"],"b":["120","120","110","120","120"]},"In particular embodiments, a controller (e.g., a parent) may access a web-based application hosted on the server using a controller client, as illustrated in STEP  of . In particular embodiments, the web-based application may have a unique Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) or more specifically, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Each user of the web-based application may access the application through a web browser executing on a client device (e.g., by inputting the URL of the web-based application in the web browser). In particular embodiments, the web-based application may provide a user interface in the form of a set of web pages, which may be displayed in a web browser. Through these web pages, a user may interact with the web-based application. In particular embodiments, each user of the web-based application (e.g., the controller and the actor) may register with the web-based application to obtain a user account, and each user account may be associated with a username and a password. When accessing the web-based application, each user may log into his account using his username and password.","In particular embodiments, the controller may specify an activity, a reward or a punishment associated with the activity, and an actor (e.g., a child) associated with the activity, as illustrated in STEP  of . The activity may be a desirable activity that the controller wishes the actor to perform, or an undesirable activity that the controller wants to prevent the actor from performing. If the activity is a desirable activity, then a reward may be associated with performing the activity. In addition or alternatively, a punishment may be associated with not performing the activity. Similarly, if the activity is an undesirable activity, then a reward may be associated with not performing the activity. In addition or alternatively, a punishment may be associated with performing the activity. Thus, an activity may be associated with a reward or a punishment or both. The actor is the person who should perform the desired activity or refrain from performing the undesired activity. The actor may receive the reward or the punishment depending on whether he performs the activity.","In particular embodiments, if a reward is specified for the activity, the controller may specify the condition (hereafter referred to as \u201creward condition\u201d) that should be satisfied before the actor receives the reward. Similarly, if a punishment is specified for the activity, the controller may specify the condition (hereafter referred to as \u201cpunishment condition\u201d) that should be satisfied before the actor receives the punishment. The reward or punishment condition may include any number of requirements. For example, for a school study activity, one reward requirement may be the minimum number of hours the actor must study each weekday (e.g., 3 hours); another reward requirement may be the hour of the day before which the actor must complete his homework each weekday (e.g., before 8:00 pm); and a third requirement may be the duration of the activity (e.g., a semester). In particular embodiments, the controller may specify how many of the requirements need to be met before the condition is considered satisfied (e.g., all requirements, or 80% of the requirements, or all critical requirements). In particular embodiments, there may be multiple levels of reward or punishment associated with the activity. For example, if 100% of the requirements are met, the actor may receive a bigger reward. However, if only 80% of the requirements are met, the actor may receive a smaller reward.","In particular embodiments, when specifying an activity, the controller may specify any suitable activity and associate any suitable reward or punishment and reward or punishment condition with the activity. For example, a reward may be a specific amount of money, a gift item (e.g., a game of a gaming system such as an XBOX), an entertainment event (e.g., a trip to an amusement park), or a number of points that may be accumulated over time in connection with multiple activities and redeemed for bigger reward prices. In addition, a reward may include a bonus for extra performance. This disclosure contemplates any applicable reward or punishment methods.","In particular embodiments, there may be a predefined set of activities with associated rewards or punishments provided by the web-based application. In particular embodiments, the predefined set of activities with the associated rewards or punishments may be specified by the controllers, the actors, the application hosted on the server for managing the reward\/punishment system, or a third party (e.g., game vendor, educational material vendor, game developer, e-commerce vendor, and so on). The controller may select any activity from this predefined set. In addition, the controller may customize a predefined activity by modifying any aspect of the predefined activity (e.g., the reward or punishment associated with the activity, or reward condition, or the punishment condition).","In particular embodiments, once the controller has provided the information associated with the activity, which may include the activity to be performed or not performed, the reward or punishment associated with the activity, the reward or punishment condition, and the actor to perform or not perform the activity, the web-based application may store the activity information in a storage accessible to the server, and thus to the web-based application, as illustrated in STEP  of . The activity information may be stored in connection with the controller's user account so that the controller may review and modify any part of the activity information at any time by logging into his account. In addition, in particular embodiments, the actor identified with the activity may be granted permission to review the activity information.","In particular embodiments, the actor identified with the activity may be notified about the activity, as illustrated in STEP  of  and STEP  of . For example, an email or an instant message may be sent to the actor, notifying the actor that there is an activity with which he is identified. The actor may then log into his own account to review more detailed information about the activity. In particular embodiments, the actor may receive information such as what specific activity is to be performed or not performed, what reward or punishment is associated with the activity, what reward or punishment condition needs to be satisfied. In some cases (e.g., as specified by the controller), the actual reward or punishment associated with the activity may be hidden from the actor so that it becomes a \u201csurprise\u201d reward or punishment. In other cases (e.g., again as specified by the controller), there may be a list of rewards or punishments associated with the activity from which the actor may select a specific reward or punishment if the actor decides to accept the activity.","Upon reviewing the activity information, in particular embodiments, the actor may have three choices in response. As the first choice, the actor may reject the activity, as illustrated in STEP  of  and STEP  of . This indicates that the actor refuses to get involved with the activity. In particular embodiments, the controller may be notified that the actor has rejected the activity, as illustrated in STEP  of  and STEP  of . The controller has various options at this point. For example, the controller may specify a different activity in connection with the same actor, modify the current activity (e.g., reward or punishment, reward or punishment condition), have a discussion with the actor, or do nothing.","As the second choice, the actor may accept the activity, as illustrated in STEP  of  and STEP  of . This indicates that the actor agrees to perform or not perform the activity and accepts all the criteria (e.g., reward or punishment, reward or punishment condition) associated with the activity. In particular embodiments, by accepting the activity, the actor and the controller have entered into an agreement that the actor agrees to perform or not perform the activity as specified by the controller and take the associated punishment, if any, if the punishment condition is met; and the controller agrees to deliver the associated reward, if any, if the actor satisfies the reward condition. In particular embodiments, the controller may be notified that the actor has accepted the activity, as illustrated in STEP  of  and STEP  of .","In particular embodiments, as the actor performs or not performs the activity (e.g., exercise, study, or not smoke), as specified by the controller, one or more actor clients may collection information about the activity performance, as illustrated in STEP  of . As described above, the actor may be associated with any number of client devices, and each actor client may include different types of sensors for detecting various types of information. These sensors may collect the relevant information with respect to the activity performance. In particular embodiments, each actor client may transmit the collected sensor data to the server for processing, as illustrated in STEP  of  and STEP  of .","For example, suppose the activity, as specified by the controller, is that the actor exercises at least one hour per day. In this case, the actor may carry an actor client, when exercising, that has sensors for measuring the heart rate, speed, calories burned, or other suitable physical conditions of the actor. The actor client may send the collected sensor data to the server so that the sensor data may be processed to determine whether the actor has exercised each day and for how long. For example, when the actor exercises, the actor's hear rate naturally increases. Thus, from the heart rate sensor data, the server may determine whether the actor's hear rate increases significantly during a period of time each day and for long.","As another example, suppose the activity, as specified by the controller, is that the actor studies at least two hours per day. In this case, the actor client (e.g., a computer) that the actor uses to study may have a timer or a tracking sensor that collects information such as how long the actor uses the computer each day and what actives the actors performs with the computer (e.g., writing a school paper, researching on a school assignment). The computer may send the collected sensor data to the server so that the sensor data may be processed to determine whether the actor has studied each day and for how long.","As a third example, suppose the activity, as specified by the controller, is that the actor refrains from smoking. In this case, the actor may carry a smoke detector (e.g., incorporated as a part of the actor client). If the actor smokes, the smoke detector may detect the smoke and send an alert to the server so that the server is notified whenever the actor smokes. As a fourth example, suppose the activity, as specified by the controller, is that the actor refrains from staying out late at night (e.g., after 10:00 pm). In this case, the actor may carry a GPS device (e.g., incorporated as a part of the actor's mobile phone). The GPS device may track the actor's location at any given time. If the GPS coordinates indicate that the actor is outside of the home late at night, the mobile phone may send an alter to the server.","In particular embodiments, the actor may be associated with multiple actor clients. For example, when the actor exercises, the actor may carry one actor client on one day and another actor client on another day. In particular embodiments, each actor client sends the sensor data it has collected to the server for processing. The server may aggregate all the sensor data collected by the multiple actor clients associated with the actor, as illustrated in STEP  of . As a result, the actor is not restricted to use only one actor client at all times, but has the freedom of using any available or convenient actor client in connection with the activity.","In particular embodiments, based on the aggregated sensor data received from one or more actor clients, the server may determine whether the reward or punishment condition, as specified by the controller, has been satisfied, as illustrated in STEP  of . In the above \u201cdaily exercise\u201d example, suppose that the controller has specified that the actor receives a reward if the actor exercises at least one hour per day for a month. In this case, the server may analyze the sensor data relating to the actor's physical conditions (e.g., heart rate, speed, calories burned) collected by the actor clients for a month. If the aggregated sensor data indicate that the actor has indeed exercised each day for at least an hour during the month, then the reward condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the reward condition is not satisfied. In the above \u201csmoking\u201d example, suppose that the controller has specified that the actor receives a reward if the actor refrains from smoking for a month or a punishment is the actor smokes more than 3 times during the month. In this case, the server may collect the smoking alerts received from the actor clients during a month. If no smoking alert has been received during the month, then the reward condition is satisfied. If more than 3 smoking alerts have been received during the month, then the punishment condition is satisfied.","In particular embodiments, while the actor is performing or refraining from performing the activity, the actor and the controller may monitor the actor's progress in real time. In particular embodiments, the server receives and collects sensor data relating to the actor's performing or refraining from performing the activity from the actor clients. At any given time, the server may analyze the sensor data thus far collected to determine the current status or process of the actor's performance with respect to the activity. The controller and the actor may each log into his own account to view the actor's progress whenever needed. For example, the progress may be represented as a progress bar, a chart, or other suitable representations.","In particular embodiments, if there is a reward associated with the activity but the actor has not satisfied the reward condition, or if there is a punishment associated with the activity but the actor has not satisfied the condition (STEP  of \u2014\u201cNO\u201d), the server may notify the controller and the actor (e.g., through the controller clients and actor clients respectively) that the reward or punishment condition has not bee satisfied, as illustrated in STEP  of . On the other hand, in particular embodiments, if there is a reward associated with the activity and the actor has satisfied the reward condition, or if there is a punishment associated with the activity and the actor has satisfied the condition (STEP  of \u2014\u201cYES\u201d), the server may notify the controller and the actor (e.g., through the controller clients and actor clients respectively) that the reward or punishment condition has been satisfied, as illustrated in STEP  of  and STEP  of  and STEP  of .","When the reward or punishment condition has been satisfied, in particular embodiments, the server may deliver the reward or punishment to the actor automatically, as specified by the controller. Alternatively, in particular embodiments, the controller may have specified that a controller authorization needs to be obtained before the reward or punishment is delivered to the actor. In this case, the server may request an authorization from the controller regarding the reward or punishment. In particular embodiments, the controller may authorize the reward or punishment using a controller client (e.g., by logging into his account and submit the authorization), as illustrated in STEP  of  and STEP  of .","In particular embodiments, once the authorization has been received, the server may deliver the reward or punishment to the actor, as illustrated in STEP  of . The method of delivery may depend on the nature of the reward or punishment. For example, with a point system, if the reward is a number of points, the server may credit the actor's account with the appreciate number of points. Conversely, if the punishment is a number of points, the server may deduct the actor's account with the appreciate number of points. As another example, if the reward is a number of hours that the actor may play computer games, the server may credit the number of hours to the actor's account. Conversely, if the punishment is that the actor cannot play video games for a week, the information may be stored in the actor's account.","In particular embodiments, the one or more actor clients may collect sensor data relating to the actor's taking the reward or punishment, as illustrated in STEP  of  and transmit the collected sensor data to the server, as illustrated in STEP  of  and STEP  of . In particular embodiments, the server may analyze the sensor data to determine whether the actor has completely consumed the reward to taken the punishment.","In the above \u201cvideo game\u201d example, suppose that the actor has earned a reward of 10 hours of computer game playing time. The actor client (e.g., a game console) may monitor the amount of time the actor actually plays with the game console and send the collected timing data to the server. The server may track the total amount of time the actor has played using the console. When the actor has played 10 hours of video games on the console, the server may notify the controller and the actor that the actor has used up all the reward time. At this point, the controller may choose to, for example, take the game control away from the actor until the actor earns more playing time. Alternatively, the game control may be locked up so that the actor cannot play any more games until he earns more playing time as reward. Conversely, suppose that the actor has received a punishment that the actor cannot play vide games for a week. The game console may monitor the time the actor plays on the console and send an alert to the server each time the actor attempts to play video games on the console. The server may notify the controller and the actor that the actor has violated the punishment rule. In addition, the game console may be locked up for a week so that the actor does not have access to it during the week. Thus, in particular embodiments, the actor clients may collect sensor data relating to the actor's taking the reward or punishment, when appropriate, and transmit the collected sensor data to the server. The server may aggregate and analyze the sensor data received from the actor clients to determine whether the actor takes the reward or punishment according to the terms specified by the controller. In particular embodiments, when the actor has consumed the available reward, the actor clients may be set to prevent the actor from consuming any more reward until the actor earns more reward.","In particular embodiments, while the actor is taking his reward or punishment, the actor and the controller may monitor the actor's progress in real time. In particular embodiments, the server receives and collects sensor data relating to the actor's taking the reward or punishment from the actor clients. At any given time, the server may analyze the sensor data thus far collected to determine the current status or process of the actor's taking the reward or punishment. The controller and the actor may each log into his own account to view the actor's progress whenever needed. For example, the progress may be represented as a progress bar, a chart, or other suitable representations.","In particular embodiments, after the actor has accepted the activity and while the actor is performing or refraining from performing the activity, the actor may wish to modify the terms of the activity, which may include the activity itself, the reward or punishment, the reward or punishment condition, or the duration of the activity. For example, the actor may find it too difficult to satisfy the reward condition while performing the activity and consequently, may wish to modify the reward condition. In particular embodiments, the actor may propose the modification to the controller (e.g., by communicating the modification to the controller through the server). In particular embodiments, the actor and the controller may negotiate the specific terms of the activity with the help of the server, similar to the negotiation process described below. If the actor and the controller are able to come to an agreement, the actor may resume performing or refraining from performing the activity. In this case, the modified terms of the activity may take effect, replacing the original terms of the activity.","As the third choice, upon receiving the activity information, the actor may propose a modification to one or more parts of the activity, as illustrated in STEP  of  and STEP  of . The modification may be with respect to any part of the activity setting, such as the activity itself, the actual reward or punishment, the reward or punishment condition, or the duration of the activity. In particular embodiments, the server may notify the controller of the actor's proposed modification, as illustrated in STEP  of  and STEP  of .","Upon receiving the proposed modification from the actor, in particular embodiments, the controller has two choices, as illustrated in STEP  of . The controller may accept the proposed modification as it is (STEP  of \u2014\u201cYES\u201d) or not accept the proposed modification (STEP  of \u2014\u201cNO\u201d). If the controller accepts the proposed modification (STEP  of \u2014\u201cYES\u201d), this indicates that the controller agrees to the changes suggested by the actor (e.g., to the activity, the reward or punishment, or the reward or punishment condition). In particular embodiments, by accepting the modification proposed by the actor, the actor and the controller have entered into an agreement that the actor agrees to perform or not perform the activity and take the associated punishment, if any, if the punishment condition is met; and the controller agrees to deliver the associated reward, if any, if the actor satisfies the reward condition. The terms of the agreement incorporate the modification proposed by the actor. In particular embodiments, the controller may submit his acceptance to the modification to the sever, as illustrated in STEP  of . The server may in turn notify the actor that the controller has accepted his proposed modification, as illustrated in STEP  of  and STEP  of . In particular embodiments, once an agreement has been established between the controller and the actor regarding the activity, the actor may begin performing or refraining from performing the specified activity, as the process continues with STEP  of  and STEP  of  and STEP  of , all of which are described above.","On the other hand, if the controller does not accept the proposed modification from the actor (STEP  of \u2014\u201cNO\u201d), the controller may indicate his rejection to the actor's modification and take no more action with respect to this specific activity, or alternatively, the controller may propose a further modification in response to the actor's modification proposal, as illustrated in STEP  of , and submit the further modification to the server, as illustrated in STEP  of . In particular embodiments, the server may notify the actor about the further modification proposed by the controller, as illustrated in STEP  of  and STEP  of . At this point, the actor again has three choices. The actor may: (1) accept the activity with all the modifications thus far, (2) reject the activity, or (3) propose yet further modification to the activity. In particular embodiments, the negotiation between the controller and the actor with respect to the specific terms of the activity may continue until either party gives the final acceptance or rejection.","In particular embodiments, the controller and the actor may communicate with each other (e.g., proposing an activity, proposing a modification to the activity, accepting or rejecting the activity) via their respective client devices and the server. In particular embodiments, the controller and the actor may log into their respective accounts and communicate with each other and manage their activities and rewards or punishments through their user accounts (e.g., using the web-based user interface provided by the service).","In particular embodiments, the reward\/punishment-and-control system described above may be incorporated with other types of services or systems. In particular embodiments, activities to be performed by an actor may be incorporated in the actor's electronic calendar so that the actor may receive reminders to perform the activity.","In particular embodiments, the controller or actor may link his account with the reward\/punishment-and-control system with his social-networking account to share information with his social connections. A social network, in general, is a social structure made up of entities, such as individuals or organizations, that are connected by one or more types of interdependency or relationships, such as friendship, kinship, common interest, financial exchange, dislike, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge, or prestige. In more recent years, social networks have taken advantage of the Internet. There are social-networking systems existing on the Internet in the form of social-networking websites. Such social-networking websites enable their members, who are commonly referred to as website users, to perform various social activities. For example, the social-networking website operated by Facebook, Inc. at www.facebook.com enables its users to communicate with their friends via emails, instant messages, or blog postings, organize social events, share photos, receive news of their friends or interesting events, play games, etc. In particular embodiments, a reward\/punishment-and-control system may partner up with a social-networking system so that their users' accounts at the two systems may be linked. The social-networking system may implement some functions in support of the reward\/punishment-and-control system.","In particular embodiments, the controller (e.g., a parent) may share success stories on how to encourage his child to study with other parents he knows from the social-network system. Other users of the social-networking system may rate (e.g., like or dislike or a star rating) or comment (e.g., blogs or tweets) on the activates, the rewards or punishments, or the reward or punishment conditions. In particular embodiments, the controller and actor may communicate with other controllers and actors who are also members of the social-networking system via social-networking functions provided by, for example, the social-networking website implementing the social-networking system. Such communications may include, but not limited to, sharing or exchanging ideas (e.g., ideas on rewards or punishments), rating or commenting on the activates, the rewards or punishments, or the reward or punishment conditions. In particular embodiments, the controllers and the actors may compare their activities, rewards, and\/or punishments with other users of the reward\/punishment-and-control system and\/or the social-networking system.","In particular embodiments, the reward\/punishment-and-control system and\/or the social-networking system may enable its users to play online games with other users. User may create teams for play these games. The controller and actors may join specific teams as team members and contribute to these teams. For example, an actor's reward may be a number of points added to the score of the team to which the actor belongs. Conversely, the actor's punishment may be a number of points subtracted from the score of the team to which the actor belongs. For example, the controllers and actors may join a team for \u201cUS vs. Japan for walking distance competition\u201d (e.g., the distance may be measured using pedometers), or participate in \u201cMath quiz for 5th grader competition\u201d if such games already exist. As another example, the controllers and actors may create new groups or competitions and let others join the teams to participate.","Particular embodiments may be implemented in a network environment.  illustrates an example network environment . Network environment  includes a network  coupling one or more servers  and one or more clients  to each other. In particular embodiments, network  is an intranet, an extranet, a virtual private network (VPN), a local area network (LAN), a wireless LAN (WLAN), a wide area network (WAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a portion of the Internet, or another network  or a combination of two or more such networks .
