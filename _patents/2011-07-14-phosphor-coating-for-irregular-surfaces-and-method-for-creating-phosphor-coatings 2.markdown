title: Phosphor coating for irregular surfaces and method for creating phosphor coatings
abstract: Microstructured, irregular surfaces pose special challenges but coatings of the invention can uniformly coat irregular and microstructured surfaces with one or more thin layers of phosphor. Preferred embodiment coatings are used in microcavity plasma devices and the substrate is, for example, a device electrode with a patterned and microstructured dielectric surface. A method for forming a thin encapsulated phosphor coating of the invention applies a uniform paste of metal or polymer layer to the substrate. In another embodiment, a low temperature melting point metal is deposited on the substrate. Polymer particles are deposited on a metal layer, or a mixture of a phosphor particles and a solvent are deposited onto the uniform glass, metal or polymer layer. Sequential soft and hard baking with temperatures controlled to drive off the solvent will then soften or melt the lowest melting point constituents of the glass, metal or polymer layer, partially or fully embed the phosphor particles into glass, polymer, or metal layers, which partially or fully encapsulate the phosphor particles and/or serve to anchor the particles to a surface.

No. 61\/368,955, which was filed on Jul. 29, 2010.","This invention was made with government support under Contract No. FA9550-07-1-0003 awarded by United States Air Force Office of Scientific Research. The government has certain rights in the invention.","Fields of the invention include phosphors and devices that incorporate phosphors. Preferred applications of the invention are to light-emitting devices and particularly to microcavity plasma devices (also referred to as microplasma devices or microdischarge devices) having microstructured or inclined surfaces that are difficult to coat uniformly with phosphor.","Phosphors are compounds that exhibit a sustained glow (phosphorescence) in response to the absorption of an energized particle, such as an electron or a photon. The sustained glow results from the ability of a phosphor material to store energy for a period of time before re-emitting it. Phosphors are a fundamental component in countless display devices, light sources, and other devices, including safety equipment and novelty items. For example, phosphors are indispensable in producing white light or light of various colors from displays and lighting sources. There are a large number of phosphor compounds that have well established color responses and persistence, i.e., the duration of glow after excitation. Phosphors are chosen for particular applications based upon color response (emission spectrum) and persistence.","Phosphor coatings have been studied widely, and are applied in different thicknesses on the surfaces of various materials. Phosphor films have been applied to glass and other surfaces for many years. Several past efforts have mixed phosphor materials with glass or plastic, but the formation methods and resulting layers have limited application. A few patents have provided processes for preparing layers of phosphors embedded in materials such as glass. One example is U.S. Pat. No. 2,857,541 which describes a method for producing a thin layer of phosphor-embedded glass by mixing powdered glass and phosphor with an electrolyte and water to form a slurry. From the resulting green plaque, layers having a minimal thickness on the order of 2 mm are realized. Such a formation method and the resultant phosphor-embedded glass slab are not amenable to uniformly coating phosphor onto microstructured and irregular surfaces.","Roohollah S. Targhatr, et al., \u201cRealization of Flexible Plasma Display Panels on PET Substrates,\u201d Proceedings of the IEEE, VOL. 93, NO. 7, July 2005, proposes a flexible plasma display that has a top polyethylene terephtalate (PET) substrate with phosphor grains that are blast-embedded into the PET substrate. The blasting of phosphor particles embeds the phosphor particles into PET craters. In a variation, vertical etching is used to form craters on the top substrate via a photo-chemical reaction which yields a vertical and sharp etching of squares, and the particles are then deposited into the craters. The top PET layer with phosphor acts to convert vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation into visible light.","Any process for preparing thin phosphor films of precisely controlled thickness and efficient in generating light, should account for several factors. If the purpose of the phosphor is to convert short wavelength (ultraviolet) radiation into visible light, it is important to distinguish phosphor layers photoexcited by VUV radiation (wavelengths less than approximately 200 nm) from phosphors intended to be illuminated by longer-wavelength ultraviolet light (200-400 nm, in the so-called UV A,B, and C regions). The reason for the distinction is that VUV photons are strongly absorbed by virtually all materials in which one might embed a phosphor. Consequently, it is preferable that phosphors intended for illumination by VUV light are exposed directly to the incoming radiation. Inserting most materials between the phosphor and the VUV source will result in some or most of the VUV photons being absorbed by said material and, thus, never reaching the phosphor. On the other hand, if it is intended that longer wavelength (\u03bb\u2267250 nm) photons excite the phosphor, one has greater freedom in inserting a thin layer of one or more materials between the UV source and the phosphor because a greater variety of materials transmit efficiently in this range of wavelengths. In summary, the use of binders, glasses, or other materials to encapsulate or partially shield the phosphor is undesirable if the phosphor is to be \u201cdriven\u201d by VUV photons. However, even if the intent is to illuminate the phosphor with photons having wavelengths above 200 nm, it is desirable to minimize the thickness of any encapsulating materials because the absorption (and reflection) of light is not zero for even the best materials.","Another consideration important to forming phosphor layers is that phosphors are generally large molecules that can be damaged if the method of depositing the layers is overly aggressive physically or chemically. Therefore, the blast embedding of phosphors into a surface is not desirable, and experience has shown that phosphor particle sizes in the 1-10 \u03bcm range are preferable.","Microcavity plasma devices and arrays have been developed and advanced by researchers at the University of Illinois, including inventors of this application. Devices and arrays have been fabricated in different materials, such as ceramics and semiconductors. Arrays of microcavity devices have been fabricated in thin metal and metal oxide sheets. Advantageously, microcavity plasma devices confine the plasma in cavities having microscopic dimensions and require no ballast, reflector or heavy metal housing. Microcavities in such devices can have different cross-sectional shapes, but generally confine plasma in a cavity having a characteristic dimension in the range of about 5 \u03bcm to 500 \u03bcm.","Applying uniform layers of phosphors to the surfaces of microcavity devices or other irregular surfaces is often challenging. Arrays of microcavities, in particular, often have inclined or spatially modulated surfaces with considerable microstructure that can include steps or gratings, not to mention the microcavities themselves. Applying a phosphor film to the interior surface of fluorescent light tubes has been a part of the manufacturing process for years but the surface to be coated is reasonably smooth and no effort is made to encapsulate the phosphor particles. Furthermore, the phosphor layer formation process often involves water which, if not removed completely from the phosphor in subsequent processing (baking, de-gassing), will adversely impact the performance and lifetime of the lamp.","The present invention addresses the need for a method to uniformly coat irregular and microstructured surfaces with one or more thin layers of phosphor. In addition, the individual phosphor particles can be coated by, or partially or wholly encapsulated (in a glass or other material), thereby protecting the phosphor from the microplasma or vice-versa.","Methods of the invention can provide a thin (sub-200 \u03bcm) layer of phosphor that is fully or partially embedded in glass. Methods of the present invention can form thin layers of phosphors in glass, but provide the capability to do so on three dimensional (stereoscopic) structures having a high degree of surface relief, including microstructured and inclined surfaces. The thickness of the layers is typically no greater than 20 \u03bcm and the method of the invention is s capable of coating complex structures (such as wire meshes and grids) and disparate materials (including nanoporous aluminum oxide and glass).","A preferred embodiment of the present invention is a thin encapsulated phosphor coating on a substrate. The coating typically includes a glass, metal or polymer film having a substantially uniform thickness of \u02dc1-\u02dc20 \u03bcm and phosphor particles having diameters in the range of \u02dc1 to \u02dc10 \u03bcm. The phosphor particles are at least partially encapsulated by the glass, metal or polymer film. Microstructured, irregular surfaces pose special challenges but coatings of the invention can uniformly coat irregular and microstructured surfaces with one or more thin layers of phosphor. Preferred embodiment coatings are used in microcavity plasma devices and the substrate is, for example, a device electrode with a patterned and microstructured dielectric surface.","A method for forming a thin encapsulated phosphor coating of the invention applies a uniform paste of glass or polymer layer to the substrate. In another embodiment, a low temperature melting point metal is deposited on the substrate. Polymer particles are deposited on a metal layer, or a mixture of a phosphor particles and a solvent are deposited onto the uniform glass or polymer layer. Sequential soft and hard baking with temperatures controlled to drive off the solvent will then soften or melt the lowest melting point constituents of the glass or polymer layer, partially or fully embed the phosphor particles into glass, polymer, or metal layers, which partially or fully encapsulate the phosphor particles and\/or serve to anchor the particles to a surface.","Above mentioned prior methods have provided phosphor coating methods suitable for coating regular, flat horizontal surfaces typically with thick phosphor layers. The '541 patent mentioned above, for example, provides a formation method and resultant phosphor-embedded glass slab that are not amenable to uniformly coating phosphor in a thin layer onto microstructured and irregular surfaces. Microstructured, irregular surface pose special challenges. The present invention provides methods to uniformly coat such irregular and microstructured surfaces with one or more thin layers of phosphor. In addition, the individual phosphor particles can be coated by, or encapsulated in, glass or polymer, thereby protecting the phosphor from the microplasma or vice-versa. Another preferred embodiment of the invention provides a thin layer of a low melting point metal (such as In) into which phosphor particles may be anchored. The phosphor particles anchored in metal can also be partially or fully embedded in think glass or polymer.","Methods of the invention are capable, for example, of forming thin layers of phosphors partially or fully encapsulated in glass or polymer on three dimensional (stereoscopic) structures having a high degree of surface relief, including microstructured and inclined surfaces. Preferred methods and resultant coatings can be very thin, e.g., a typical thickness is no greater than 20 \u03bcm, and preferably no greater than \u02dc5 \u03bcm in preferred embodiments, with partially or fully encapsulated phosphor particles having diameters in the range of \u02dc1-7 \u03bcm. The method of the invention is capable of coating complex structures (such as wire meshes and grids) and materials with irregular surfaces (including nanoporous aluminum oxide and nanoporous titanium oxide).","Applying uniform layers of phosphors to the surfaces of microcavity devices or other irregular surfaces is challenging, but is readily accomplished with phosphor coatings and coating methods of the invention. Arrays of microcavities, in particular, often have inclined or spatially modulated surfaces with considerable microstructure which can include steps or gratings, not to mention the microcavities themselves. The invention provides phosphor particles enclosed in a thin glass or polymer layer that can be applied onto virtually any underlying substrate having a microstructured and\/or irregular surface. Phosphor layers as thin as 1-10 \u03bcm in thickness can be deposited uniformly on a variety of substrates through a combination of solution deposition and baking processes. In preferred embodiment methods of forming a phosphor coating, a thin layer of glass paste or polymer is deposited onto the surface of interest, followed by deposition of phosphor or a phosphor paste. Sequential baking steps are conducted at temperatures controlled such that the underlying glass (or polymer) is softened, resulting in the partial or complete embedding and, therefore, encapsulation of phosphor particles in the underlying glass or polymer film. Rather than pre-mixing the glass or polymer and phosphor, this sequential process deposits separately the constituents of the desired layer and then embeds the phosphor particles while maintaining the integrity of the phosphor particles and the resultant glass or polymer layer that partially or fully encapsulates the particles. Such an approach is well-suited to irregular surfaces because the microstructures and irregular features (including cavities) are first covered by a conformal glass or polymer film. Unimpeded by the presence of phosphor particles, the glass or polymer paste is able to flow into cavities, trenches and other features to yield a uniform film. Paste, as defined herein, means that the glass or polymer has a viscosity that permits flow during deposition to form a uniform film on surfaces that are inclined or irregular. Viscosities in the range of 10 to 10000 centipoise (cps) interval are preferred, and viscosities in the range of 500-1000 centipoise are most preferred.","Temperature and the viscosity of the glass paste or polymer are controlled so as to ensure that inclined surfaces are also coated uniformly (i.e., without dripping or thickening at the base of an inclined surface). Subsequently, the phosphor is introduced with the glass or polymer film in place. Therefore, this invention decouples the introduction of phosphor into the glass (or polymer) from the process of applying a glass layer in a conformal manner to an irregular surface. Preferred formation methods of the invention use spin coating and baking steps that are inexpensive and readily integrated into a manufacturing environment. A thin glass or polymer layer, including embedded phosphor particles of the invention, can now be formed as a coating on various substrates, such as aluminum or nanoporous alumina (AlO), which, in the past, have posed challenges to forming phosphor layers of uniform thickness and particularly if the surface was irregular, tilted, or microstructured.","The invention also provides microcavity plasma devices, and arrays of microcavity plasma devices, that include a thin glass or polymer layer having fully or partially encapsulated phosphors that are positioned to be excited by VUV or UV emissions from the microcavity plasma device or array of microcavity plasma devices. Particular preferred embodiments include a thin glass layer, which has been demonstrated experimentally to provide excellent structural benefits in addition to protection of the phosphor from the plasma. In preferred embodiments in which the intention is to photoexcite phosphors with longer wavelength (UV A-C) light, the phosphor particles are fully encapsulated in a thin glass layer that protects the phosphor from damage by the plasma produced in the microcavity plasma device(s). Conversely, the plasma is protected from outgassing by the phosphor. Testing of exemplary experimental arrays of microcavity devices of the invention has shown substantial improvement of their optical properties as compared to those for similar devices having phosphors that are exposed directly to plasma. Another preferred embodiment of the invention concerns the excitation of phosphors with VUV light. In this instance, it is advantageous to not fully encapsulate the phosphor particles because the coating itself may absorb a substantial fraction of the VUV photons. Rather, the invention provides a thin layer of a low melting temperature metal which is able to anchor the phosphor particles and, if desired, serve as an additional electrode. A subsequent layer of glass to partially encapsulate the phosphor may also be used.","Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be discussed with respect to the drawings. The drawings include schematic representations that will be understood by artisans in view of the general knowledge in the art and the description that follows. Features may be exaggerated in the drawings for emphasis, and features may not be to scale. Artisans will recognize broader aspects of the invention from the description of the preferred embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A-1R","FIG. 1"],"b":"10","sub":["2","3 "]},"In a first process of , a substrate  is provided in .  entails applying a thin film of glass paste  to the surface of the substrate . Layer thicknesses between 1 and 20 \u03bcm have been demonstrated experimentally, with a typical preferred thickness of 5 \u03bcm. Partially or completely encapsulated phosphor particles have diameters in the range of \u02dc1 to \u02dc10 \u03bcm. The film of glass or polymer paste can be applied by any of several processes, including dipping or spraying but depositing layers of uniform thickness within cavities, trenches, or other structures in the surface (not shown in ) requires control over the paste viscosity which will typically lie in the 10 to 10000 centipoise (cps) interval. Most of the experimental results to date have been obtained with glass paste viscosities of 500-1000 centipoise.","Dipping or spraying is effective for various glass pastes but the specific paste adopted for tests to date is a mixture of BO, MgO, ZnO, TiO, AlO, SiOand BiO. The latter serves a function similar to that for PbO but allows for a lead-free seal to be made to the substrate. After a film of glass paste having the desired thickness has been applied to the substrate surface, the film  and substrate  are \u201csoft baked\u201d in air or Nat 150\u00b0 C. The baking serves to adhere the film  to the substrate and the time period for this baking step was about one hour.","The next step in the process, in , is to apply, atop the glass paste film, a layer of phosphor  having a nominal thickness (depending on the intended application) of 20 \u03bcm. Typical phosphors used in experiments to date have an average particle size of 5 \u03bcm and are combined with a solvent. A typical solvent in tests to date was a mixture of Butyl Carbitol Acetate, \u03b1-Terpineol, and ethyl cellulose or polyvinyl butyral as a binder. The latter component is determined by the identity of the glass paste and its thickness. This phosphor\/solvent mixture can also applied by a screen printing, dipping or spraying procedure, both of which are inexpensive and amenable to the processing of large surface areas (>m).","Suitable example phosphors and those typically employed in experiments conducted to date include (Y,Gd)BO:Eu (red), Eu:YO(red), LaPO:Ce,Tb (green), ZnSiO:Mn (green), and BAM (BaMgAlO:Eu or BaMgAlO:Eu) for blue. The desired thickness of the phosphor\/solvent mixture is dependent upon the wavelength of the ultraviolet light with which the phosphors are excited. In a lamp, for example, based on Xe gas in which the predominant emitter is Xe(which produces peak emission at \u03bb\u2248172 nm), it is desirable to maintain the phosphor film thickness below 10 \u03bcm because of the phosphor absorption coefficient in this wavelength region. When photoexciting the phosphor at longer UV wavelengths (such as 300 nm or 350 nm), the phosphor layer can generally be made thicker so as to efficiently absorb most or all of the incoming UV radiation. To produce a thicker phosphor layer, the deposition process can be repeated.","After applying the phosphor\/solvent layer, the substrate  and films ,  are, again, soft-baked. Example suitable soft bake conditions used in experiments were 150\u00b0 C. for about one hour in air or N. The soft-bake is followed by a \u201chard bake\u201d ramp procedure. The hard baking ramp procedure involves slowly ramping the temperature to a higher temperature that can vaporize the organic solvents contained in both films on the substrate. An example suitable temperature in experiments for the solvents used was approximately 250\u00b0 C. for approximately one hour. After this one hour period, the temperature is increased again to a value that can soften or melt the lowest melting point constituents of the glass or polymer layer , thereby resulting in the partial or complete embedding and, therefore, encapsulation of phosphor particles in the glass or polymer layer , as seen in  to form a partially or completely embedded polymer layer . In tests to date, a typical hard bake was in the 450-550\u00b0 C. interval (typically 480-500\u00b0 C.) and the temperature was again maintained for approximately one hour. Increasing the baking temperature and\/or the baking time during the partial or complete embedding baking step significantly beyond the temperature and time necessary to soften or melt the lowest melting point constituents of the glass or polymer layer  is preferably avoided because this will likely degrade the phosphor. The high melting point constituents of the glass or polymer layer (such as AlO) are, of course, not melted during the hard baking process. Rather, the function of such particles is to provide mechanical support for the phosphor particles and to discourage their lateral movement. The entire time required by the formation process can be 8-12 hours, depending upon the surface area of the substrate.","Excess phosphor particles , also shown in , are typically left on the surface of the glass or polymer encapsulated phosphor layer  that results from the formation process. In , any excess phosphor particles are easily removed from the surface of the glass or polymer encapsulated phosphor layer by directing a stream of gas across the surface. Alternatively, the excess phosphor particles  can be overcoated, such as with an additional thin film  of glass or polymer, another dielectric (such as TiO), or a polymer. The thickness of such an overcoating layer  (if desired) is preferably no more than a few micrometers.","The encapsulated phosphor layer  resulting from this procedure is much more mechanically robust compared to phosphor films typically applied to the interior of fluorescent lamps, for example. The loss of phosphor in such devices which are coated by conventional means is often significant and deleterious to lamp performance. The method of the present invention yields uniform films of glass or polymer-encapsulated phosphor particles, even if the surface of the substrate  is steeply inclined, includes inclined features, includes surface irregularities, and\/or is punctuated with cavities and\/or trenches.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIGS. 1F-1K","FIG. 1A-1E","FIG. 1F","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1C","FIGS. 1A-1E","FIGS. 1A-1E","FIG. 1I"],"b":["10","12","10","14","14","10","10","14","16","18","20"],"sub":["2","3","2","3","2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIGS. 1L-1R","FIG. 1M","FIGS. 1Q and 1R","FIG. 1R","FIG. 1Q","FIG. 1N","FIG. 1O","FIG. 1P","FIG. 1M","FIG. 1P","FIG. 1"],"b":["12","10","16","16","18","19","19","12","18"],"sup":"2 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2E","FIGS. 1A-1E","FIGS. 2A-2E","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2C","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1C","FIGS. 1D and 1E"],"b":["10","10","10","11","11","10","12","12","18"],"i":["a","a ","a ","b","a "]},"For those photonic devices (such as lamps) requiring the conversion of UV light into the visible, preferred arrays of microcavity plasma devices of the invention (such as in ) are an improvement upon metal and metal oxide arrays of microcavity plasma devices such as those disclosed in Eden et al., U.S. Published Patent Application No. 20070170866, entitled \u201cArrays of Microcavity Plasma Devices with Dielectric Encapsulated Electrodes,\u201d which was published on Jul. 26, 2007; and in Eden et al., US.

This can be achieved with the processes already described using polymers and glasses to partially embed the phosphors. Phosphor particles can also be anchored to a metal layer and be left partially exposed by an even thinner glass or polymer layer or left anchored by the metal layer itself.  illustrate a process for anchoring phosphors to a metal layer. The process is similar to the previously described processes, and like reference numbers are used in . In the process of , a thin metal layer  is first deposited onto the substrate  prior to deposition of a glass\/polymer layer , soft baking and deposition of phosphor particles. The thin metal layer includes metal (or a metal mixture) having a low melting point (e.g., <400\u00b0 C.), such as In, Tl, Pb, Sn, or Zn.

The cavities can be shaped according to commercial wire mesh that is available in different shapes, or can be formed by any of a number microfabrication processes from a solid foil. Anodization creates the metal oxide, and then the glass and phosphor are deposited according to the methods discussed above with respect to .","Experiments show that the thin encapsulated (or partially encapsulated) phosphor layers form as uniform films over the entire electrode mesh , , including within the microcavities . A scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of a solid (as opposed to wire) aluminum mesh completely covered by a phosphor\/glass layer is shown as . In this example, the mesh was first anodized to grow nanoporous alumina from the metal. After anodization, the phosphor-embedded glass layer was formed over the mesh by methods of the present invention. The mesh of  may serve as one of the electrodes in a microplasma array structure. In this case, a second electrode is required which may be a second mesh or, for example, a continuous metal sheet that has been anodized. By placing the second electrode in close proximity (<1 mm) to the mesh of , applying an appropriate time-varying voltage between the two electrodes and filling the entire region between and within the electrodes with the desired gas or vapor, an array of microplasmas will be realized.","Experiments have shown that the thin glass encapsulated phosphor layers are uniform in thickness and also robust. That is, the phosphor particles are attached firmly to the surface and partially or completely encapsulated in a thin glass layer. Furthermore, the constituents of the glass paste (such as AlO) having a melting point well above the highest temperature employed in the high temperature baking process are not melted. Rather, as described previously, such to particles serve to stabilize the position of a phosphor particle on an inclined or vertically-oriented surface. This provides a phosphor coating that is able to remain stable on an inclined or vertical surface. As best illustrated by the cross-sectional SEM images of , many of the phosphor particles (such as the particle identified by the dashed curves in ) are completely encapsulated in a thin layer of glass. This is advantageous for protecting the phosphor particles from the plasma but the thin encapsulated phosphor layers of the invention will find other applications as well. As discussed earlier, fully encapsulating phosphor particles with glass or polymer is not advantageous from an optical perspective if the incoming light (such as VUV photons) is unable to pass through the glass layer. In such an instance, partial encapsulation () is preferable. The SEM images in  show enlarged views of a portion of an aluminum screen having square microcavities. The screen was partially anodized so as to produce a nanoporous alumina layer within which remains an aluminum core. , in particular, illustrates the uniform coverage of a phosphor-embedded glass layer on the screen, even over those areas where the surface to be covered is vertical. As discussed above, preformed screens and microfabrication techniques provide a wide variety of microcavity shapes and  illustrate one example.","The encapsulation of phosphors in a thin layer provides other benefits apart from the protection of the phosphor. Phosphors are problematic from a vacuum and chemical standpoint. As a result of outgassing, phosphors can poison the gas in a microcavity plasma device or a conventional lamp. Partially or fully encapsulating phosphor particles in glass or polymer mitigates this difficulty. The magnified view in  shows the surface of the glass surface to be irregular with phosphor particles embedded partially or fully in the glass layer. In an experimental array, a thin encapsulated phosphor layer included green luminescent phosphor particles. The phosphors were excited by ultraviolet radiation and provided a uniform green luminescence.","While the thin encapsulated phosphor layers have been illustrated with respect to preferred embodiment arrays of microcavity plasma that are based upon thin metal\/metal oxide sheets, the layers are generally applicable to almost any application in which phosphors find use. In addition, the thin encapsulated phosphor layers are of value in other types of microcavity plasma devices, such as those formed from semiconductors and ceramic materials.","As an example, U.S. Pat.

A microspray nozzle  deposits the glass\/polymer as in , and the subsequent steps form the partially embedded glass\/polymer and phosphor layer  as in . In this example embodiment, the glass\/polymer and phosphor layer  is formed on a thin (top) layer of silicon nitride that protects device electrodes  formed from a Au\/Ni bilayer. A thick layer of polyimide  and an additional (bottom) layer of silicon nitride provide additional isolation of the electrodes  from a p-type silicon substrate  that also acts as an electrode to generate a plasma in a microcavity  formed in the silicon substrate .

Additionally, the layer  can be overcoated with a thin glass or transparent dielectric layer to completely encapsulate phosphor particles as discussed above. Preferably, the layer  is formed to have a thicker portion at the bottom of the pyramidal microcavity . This helps to make emission more to uniform because the electric field in and around the plasma is weaker at the bottom of the inverted pyramid microcavity .

In the specific structure of , only the red-coated  and green-coated  meshes serve as electrodes for the microcavity lamp, and the blue-coated screen  serves as a spacer to obtain the proper separation between the two electrodes  and . It is not necessary to electrically \u201cdrive\u201d the blue phosphor-coated mesh directly, and it is not critical which color screen serves as the middle spacer layer. The phosphor in whichever screen forms the middle spacer layer  will also be excited to luminescence by plasma generated in microcavities of the electrode layers  and . However, one may electrically drive any two or all of the screens in , if desired. Also, the electrical bias between each of the screens may be varied at will. The primary reason for coating screens in one of the primary colors, as opposed to coating all three with the same white phosphor, is that independent control of the primary colors allows for continuously varying correlated color temperature (CCT) of the lamp from a \u201ccool white\u201d to a \u201cwarm\u201d (red rich) white.","The  lamp can produce double-sided emissions when it is packaged with a transparent material , such as glass or polymeric packaging. The package  can be made of separate or single layers of glass or another material (such as a polymeric package wrap similar to that used in the food industry), and in the example the \u201cwhite\u201d phosphor  (a mixture of red, green, and blue phosphors) is also optionally applied to the separate top and bottom packaging windows. Preferred packaging and formation processes, including roll to roll processing, for completing arrays after the electrode and spacer layers are formed, are disclosed, for example, in Eden et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,385,350, entitled \u201cArrays of Microcavity Plasma Devices with Dielectric Encapsulated Electrodes.\u201d As disclosed in the '350 patent, selective oxidation of the electrodes  and  (and  as well, if desired) can create addressable arrays.","The white phosphor  on the separate top and bottom packaging layers  in  can be the same or different thickness on the top and bottom, e.g., typically 5 \u03bcm on top and 20 \u03bcm at the bottom. In the example device of , the middle spacer screen  preferably includes a thicker phosphor layer, e.g. 10 \u03bcm, while the phosphor coatings on the top and bottom electrodes are thinner, e.g., 5-7 \u03bcm. The spacer layer  can be made of a thinner metal mesh and metal oxide, and that permits a substantially thicker phosphor while maintaining a similar overall thickness to the electrode layers  and . In this way, the middle layer  that is further from the transparent material  will contribute a similar emission intensity as that generated by the top and bottom electrodes  and . Another motivation for a thicker phosphor layer on screen  is that the efficiency (quantum efficiency) for blue phosphor is lower than that for either red or green phosphors. Example overall thicknesses of the layers  and  are about 130 \u03bcm.","When separate top and bottom packaging layers are used, ends of the array of can be sealed with a sealing agent , which may be glass frit or another suitable material. A plasma medium (gas, vapor, or a combination thereof) is enclosed in the array, and plasma is formed in microcavities  that extend the full height created by the three layers , , and  when time-varying (AC, RF, bipolar or pulsed DC, etc.) potential is applied between the electrodes ,  and  to excite the gaseous or vapor medium to create a microplasma in each is microcavity . The device operates at pressures not normally obtainable in macroscopic discharges, and the plasma medium can be produced and readily contained, for example, at pressures up to 1 atmosphere and beyond. This makes the array robust, and permits very thin packaging layers to be used when the difference between the internal pressure in the lamp and 1 atmosphere is small.","Additional embodiments that are similar to the  embodiment are shown in  and are labeled with reference numbers introduced in . In , multiple spacer layers  with thin encapsulated phosphors separate the electrodes  and  from each other and from the packaging layer . The microcavities  can be extended in length in this case as compared to . An additional pattern of glass encapsulated phosphor  is formed in individual microcavities , and the pattern can include different color, glass-encapsulated phosphors in different microcavities, for example, to form a color pixel. Although the thickness of phosphor layer  appears in  to be thicker than that elsewhere, this need not be so. For lamp applications, the thickness of phosphor layer  at the rear of the lamp (bottom of ) may be larger than at the front of the lamp in order to promote the extraction of light from the front of the lamp. In , one or both of the electrode layers  and  is formed externally to the packaging layers  and the phosphor coating on screen  may be a single color (e.g., primary color) or a mixture of colors. Also, the electrodes  and  need not be anodized as suggested by . Whether internal or external to the lamp packaging, the electrodes may be anodized but may also be a polymer covered (or coated) mesh or, simply, a patterned metal electrode.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIGS. 12A-12C","FIGS. 2D and 2E","FIGS. 11A and 11B","FIGS. 12A and 12B","FIGS. 2A and 2D","FIG. 12C","FIGS. 2B and 2E","FIGS. 12A and 12C","FIGS. 11A and 11B","FIG. 12B","FIG. 4A and 4B","FIGS. 11A-11C"],"b":["10","10","10","72","74","28"],"i":"a "},"While specific embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it should be understood that other modifications, substitutions and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.
