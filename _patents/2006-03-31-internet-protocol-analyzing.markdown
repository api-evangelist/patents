Users of the communications devices, network administrators, and\/or third parties may desire to record these communications. Currently, networks are configured to provide a recorder to passively record such communications. While such a solution may accommodate some recording needs, many networks lack the ability to facilitate recording of communications between endpoints across a wide area network.","Included are methods for facilitating routing of control data associated with a communication to a plurality of recorders. One such method, among others, includes receiving control data related to a communication and routing the received control data to at least one recorder via a layer 3 protocol.","Also included are embodiments of a Internet protocol (IP) analyzer configured to facilitate recording of at least one communication. One embodiment of an IP analyzer includes logic configured to receive control data related to a communication and logic configured to route, via a layer 2 protocol, the received control data to a recorder.","Additionally included are embodiments of a system for routing communication data to a plurality of recorders. One embodiment of a system includes an Internet Protocol (IP) analyzer coupled to a plurality of recorders, the IP analyzer configured to select at least one load balancer that is configured to receive communication data related to the communication and route control data to the selected at least one load balancer.","Other systems, methods, features, and advantages of this disclosure will be or become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages be included within this description and be within the scope of the present disclosure.","Included in this description are systems and methods that may be configured for recording communications utilizing call control forwarding, intelligent call control distribution, and\/or other functions. In at least one nonlimiting example, a network can be configured where the point of interception of control data is remote from a desired recorder. In such a configuration, the recorder may not be supplied with mirrored control data. A component, such as an Internet Protocol (IP) analyzer may be configured to forward received control data, such as across a TCP\/IP connection. Other embodiments can provide an IP analyzer that is configured to determine which recorder (or recorder group) is configured to record for a predetermined gateway or endpoint. The IP analyzer can also be configured to only forward control data to recorders that are configured to receive communication data related to a particular communication.","Load Balancer",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["100","102","102","100","104","104","102"],"i":["a","f","a","a "]},"As a nonlimiting example, system designers can analyze network traffic through ports or Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) by using a System Port Analyzer (SPAN) to send a copy of the communication traffic (mirrored data) to another port on the switch that has been connected to a Remote Monitoring (RMON) probe.

Still other embodiments include using redundant recorders to smooth the load of data (e.g., receiving roughly equal amounts of data at each recorder) even when no recorder has failed. This can provide an increased use of available resources and ensure that all recorders are functional. In such a configuration, no one recorder is the \u201cfail-over recorder,\u201d as any and\/or all of the recorders can provide the desired fail-over protection. This can provide more redundant capacity into the network and provide greater performance since normal operational traffic is spread evenly across the available resources.","One should also note that in at least one embodiment call data can be preserved when a call is transferred from a first recorder to a second recorder.
