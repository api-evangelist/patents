title: Managing graphical user interface (GUI) objects in a testing environment
abstract: A method, a system and a computer program product for managing graphical user interface (GUI) objects in a testing environment. GUI objects in the testing environment are uniquely identified and the GUI objects have corresponding test objects. The uniquely identified GUI objects in the test environment are sorted in response to the pre-defined hierarchy of properties belonging to the set of properties and the pre-defined hierarchy of properties includes at least one spatial property.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The field of the invention generally relates to software functional testing. Software functional testing relates to the functional testing of a graphical user interface (GUI) coupled to an underlying software application. Software quality assurance (QA) is an important part in the software development lifecycle due to its contribution to ensure software quality before the software is delivered to the end users. Many QA engineers typically need to click or input on the GUI objects (sometimes also referred to as \u2018GUI widgets\u2019) and in some cases even text based interfaces, in the testing environment, manually and repeatedly.","In a GUI objects testing environment for functional testing, a typical workflow has two phases. The first phase is to create test objects such as test scripts (typically, in appropriate computer programming languages) by recording or development. The second phase is to playback those test objects in an end-user environment. Of the two, the first phase is relatively important, wherein the main task is to collect, manage and store information on which the GUI objects are to be tested and their related logic, which GUI object and logic will be played back, to help a runtime engine determine which and when GUI objects may need to invoke what logic, including but not limited to, clicks, double-clicks etc. To enable the management of the GUI objects, defining a set of stable identification properties correctly and uniquely is desirable.","Embodiments of the invention are directed to a method, a system and a computer program product for managing GUI objects in a testing environment. Accordingly, embodiments of the invention uniquely identify the GUI objects in the testing environment, wherein the GUI objects have corresponding test objects having at least one spatial property selected from a set of properties, and sort the uniquely identified GUI objects in the test environment in response to a pre-defined hierarchy of properties belonging to the set of properties, the pre-defined hierarchy of properties including at least one spatial property.","Embodiments of the invention are directed to a method, a system and a computer program product for managing GUI objects in a testing environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","102","104","106","112","116","114","110","108","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["120","122","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","102","200","102","201","102","102","201","201","102","102","102","201"]},"It will also be understood to a person ordinarily skilled in the art that a co-ordinate system is not limited to the Cartesian co-ordinate system. Any appropriate co-ordinate system including but not limited to a polar co-ordinate system can be used. If a three dimensional view of the list is desired, a 3-dimensional co-ordinate system can possibly be used, wherein the 3-dimensional co-ordinate system may include, but is not be limited to, a spherical co-ordinate system or a cylindrical co-ordinate system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["202","214"]},"The GUI objects have corresponding test objects having at least one spatial property selected from a set of properties. The set of properties includes at least one spatial property. The set of properties, apart from at least one spatial property, may include a name property, a class property, an enabled property, a disabled property, a visible property, and a state property, and any combination thereof. It should be also noted that even though the exemplary weights setting GUI  includes an edit box interface, other interfaces can also be used. These methods include but are not limited to a checkbox interface, a dropdown list interface, a button interface, a tab interface, a tree interface and a radial button interface. The assigning of weights, in an exemplary mode, is performed using a cursor pointing device, which may be a mouse.","The exemplary weights setting GUI  include a two column table, wherein the first column is titled as property and is shown as . For each property listed in the first column of property , there is a corresponding weight assigned using the weights setting GUI  and those weights are listed under the second column titled weight .","As an example, the property \u201c.class\u201d is depicted as  and its corresponding exemplary weight  is assigned a value of \u201c50\u201d. Similarly, the property \u201c.X\u201d is depicted by  and has a corresponding weight  with a value \u201c30\u201d. The property \u201c.Y\u201d is depicted as  and has a corresponding weight  with a value of \u201c20\u201d. The property \u201c.disabled\u201d is depicted as  and has a corresponding weight  with a value of \u201c0\u201d. Only four properties, viz. \u201c.class\u201d, \u201c.X\u201d, \u201c.Y\u201d, and \u201c.disabled\u201d are shown, however, it will be understood by a person ordinarily skilled in the art that more or less properties can possibly be included. \u201c.X\u201d and \u201c.Y\u201d are two spatial properties. It is possible to simply have only \u201c.X\u201d as a spatial property.","Using the assigned weights, a pre-defined hierarchy of the properties is developed. As an example, property with the highest weight is top node of the pre-defined hierarchy. Based on the values of weights of , ,  and , which correspond to the weights of the properties .class , .X , .Y  and .disabled , the highest value is 50 for the .class  property. The next highest value of weight is for the property .X . Then is the property .Y  and the last one with zero value is .disabled . Thus, the pre-defined hierarchy used to sort the GUI objects is identified as [\u201c.Class\u201d\u2192\u201c. X\u201d\u2192\u201c.Y\u201d]. For the purposes of this description, the pre-defined hierarchy [\u201c.Class\u201d\u2192\u201c. X\u201d\u2192\u201c.Y\u201d] is termed as hierarchy1.
