{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to streaming media. More specifically, the present invention relates to methods and apparatus for customizing user experience in a streaming media environment.","Before the era of cable TV, the three major television networks controlled what was on TV. Even counting the availability of programming on UHF channels, the selection of shows programming was very limited. Back then, consumers desiring to view shows outside the mainstream would often lamented that \u201cthere was nothing good on TV.\u201d In the era of satellite and cable TV, hundreds of different channels of programming are now available to the consumer. These channels, however, are specifically selected by the providers from thousands of available channels. Accordingly, for a consumer desiring to view shows outside the mainstream, such consumers still feel that \u201cthere is nothing good on TV.\u201d","The inventors of the present invention believe that current satellite and cable TV user interface environments often do not provide consumers with a positive user experience. As an example, the consumer may search for a particular show and become excited to find that that show is currently playing on a particular channel. The consumer then quickly tunes to that particular channel, only to see a message that they are unauthorized to view the channel, that they are not subscribed to that channel, or the like. The consumer thus becomes disappointed. Because of this, and the high price of subscription services, it is believed that consumers grow to dislike cable and satellite TV providers. This statement is backed-up with numerous surveys in the industry regarding consumer satisfaction.","With the advent of on-demand video services, consumers can now view television shows, pay-per-view events, and recently released movies. Such on-demand video services typically rely upon a cable TV or satellite TV set-top box and a billing arrangement with the TV provider. The inventors of the present invention believe that a problem with these services, is that the consumer is assumed to already know what specific show they want to watch. Specifically, there is no third party selecting television programming (e.g. sets of shows) for the consumer. Although some services now use recommendation engines to suggest other shows the consumer may wish to view, typically these engines merely suggest to the user more of what the user is already watching.","In light of the above, what is desired are methods and apparatus that enable users to customize their television viewing experience, without the drawbacks discussed above.","The present invention relates to streaming media. More specifically, the present invention relates to methods and apparatus for customizing user experience in a streaming media environment.","In various embodiments of the present invention, a streaming player (SP) receives video data from a computer network and outputs the video data to user display device. Initially, the SP presents the user a home page having a channel listing of programming channels they can view. If they wish to add additional programming to their channel listing, they can browse through a \u201cChannel store.\u201d In the present patent application the term \u201cchannel\u201d or \u201cprogramming channel\u201d typically refers to a software application written by a data (e.g. audio, video, game, screen saver, utility) provider, as will be described below. For sake of convenience, the data described below refers to \u201cvideo\u201d data, but it should be understood that embodiments cover many other types of data.","Various embodiments disclose processes whereby selections of video programming channels are determined for a user. More specifically, a streaming player (SP) associated with a user may provide a hardware identifier (electronic serial number) and\/or software identifier (firmware version number) to an application server. Based upon these identifiers, the application server may determine a hardware\/software configuration for the SP. Additionally, the application server may identify demographic data (including geographic data) for users associated with the SP (e.g. the owner). Based upon the hardware\/software\/demographic data, the application server determines video programming channels that are appropriate\/available for the user's SP.","In various embodiments, once the user is presented with video programming channels that are appropriate, the user may add the video programming channel to their home page (channel listing). Subsequently, in various embodiments, when the user navigates to their home page, the user can view a channel listing and select an icon associated with the video programming channel. In response, the application server provides the SP with the URL, pointer, or the like to the network server, the SP receives video data from the video source, and then the SP plays the video to the user.","In various embodiments, video programming (e.g. application) providers may specify video programming channels, images\/text or the like to describe their video programming channels such as a title of the application programming channel, a short textual description, a long textual description, screenshots of the channel, pricing information (e.g. free, pay per view, subscription, etc.) In various embodiments, the providers may also specify criteria (e.g. hardware\/software\/demographic) specifying which users may potentially add or subscribe to their video\/application programming channels. These types of metadata submitted along with a software package is provided to the application server. Upon approval by the application server, the video programming channel is initiated.","According to one aspect of the invention, a method for a computer system comprising a processor and a memory, wherein the computer system is programmed to perform the method is disclosed. A hardware-implemented method includes receiving, with the computer system, an identifier associated with a client streaming player, and determining, with the computer system, one or more attributes associated with the identifier from a data structure stored within the memory, in response to the identifier. A process includes determining, with the computer system, available channels from a plurality of channels that are to be made available to the client streaming player in response to the one or more attributes, wherein the plurality of channels comprises a first channel and a second channel, and wherein the available channels comprise the first channel, but not the second channel, and determining, with the computer system, a first plurality of channel metadata associated with the available channels, including a first graphical identifier associated with the first channel. A hardware specific methodology may include providing, with the computer system, the first plurality of channel metadata associated with the available channels, including the first graphical identifier to the client streaming player, receiving, with the computer system, a user selection of the first graphical identifier indicating a user request to associate the client streaming player to the first channel, and providing, with the computer system, an indicator of a server network address associated with the first channel to the client streaming player.","According to another aspect of the invention, a computer system for providing feeds to a client streaming player is disclosed. An apparatus may include a memory configured to store associations between client streaming player indicators and one or more attributes, a plurality of channels comprising a first channel and a second channel. A device may include a processor coupled to the memory, wherein the processor is programmed to receive an identifier associated with a client streaming player, wherein the processor is programmed to determine one or more attributes associated with the identifier from the memory, wherein the processor is programmed to determine a first channel that is available to the client streaming player and a second channel that is not available to the client steaming player in response to the one or more attributes, wherein the processor is programmed to determine a first plurality of metadata including an indicator of a graphical icon associated with the first channel, wherein the processor is programmed to provide the first plurality of metadata including the indicator of the graphical icon to the client streaming player, wherein the processor is programmed to receive a user selection of the graphical icon from the client streaming player, and wherein the processor is programmed to provide an indicator of a source associated with the first channel to the client streaming player, in response to the user selection of the graphical icon.","According to yet another aspect of the invention, a method for a computer system comprising a processor and a memory, wherein the computer system is programmed to perform the method is described. A compute-implemented methodology may include providing, with the computer system, an identifier associated with the computer system to an application server, wherein one or more attributes are associated with the identifier within the application server, and receiving, with the computer system, a first plurality of metadata associated with available channels, including a first graphical identifier from the application server, wherein the available channels are determined from a plurality of channels in response to the one or more attributes, and wherein the available channels includes a first channel, but not a second channel, and wherein the first channel is associated with the first graphical identifier. A hardware process may include displaying, with the computer system, a graphical user interface to a display comprising the first graphical identifier, and receiving, with the computer system, a user selection of the first graphical identifier displayed on the display indicating a user request to associate the computer system with the first channel. Computer-implemented steps may include providing, with the computer system, the user selection of the first graphical to the application server, and receiving, with the computer system, an indicator of a server network address associated with the first channel from the application server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A-D","FIGS. 1A-D"]},"Initially, an application client is coupled to a user display device, step . In various embodiments, the application client device is a streaming media player having a processor, memory, computer network interface, or the like, as described further below. In some embodiments, a streaming player known as the Roku XD, HD, SD currently marketed by Roku, Inc. may be used, and in other embodiments, other types of streaming players are also contemplated.","The streaming player is then coupled to a computer network, such as the Internet, step . In various embodiments, the device may be coupled via a network cable, or wirelessly, e.g. 802.11a, b, g, n, or other wireless communications protocol to a router, gateway, or the like.","Upon powering up of the SP or exiting a hibernation state, the SP is programmed to provide hardware identifying information to an application server, step . In various embodiments, the identifying information may include a serial number of the SP, a firmware revision number, an indicator of a model number, a combination of these numbers, or the like. In other embodiments, it is contemplated that other information may also be provided, such as the name of the user associated with the SP, the network address of the SP, ISP of the SP, user-specified settings of the SP, software or other data stored on the SP, and the like.","Next, the application server receives the identifying information and determines a hardware\/software configuration associated with the SP, step . In various embodiments, the configuration may include an indication of specific hardware, such as the existence of an HD monitor, a graphics accelerator, a USB or other interface, a Bluetooth or other wireless interface, memory requirements, one or more hardware buttons, or the like; an indication of how memory there is, the type of the processor, the speed of the processor, the operating temperature of the SP, or the like; etc. Additionally, the configuration may include an indication of specific software parameters, such as the version of the SP operating system, whether any application software has been loaded upon the SP and any version numbers, an IP address of the SP, a Quality of Service flag, an ISP associated with the SP, programming channels subscribed to by the user, programming channels associated with the user's SP, and the like. In various embodiments, the hardware\/software configuration may be retrieved from one or more database tables within a database, whereas in other embodiments, any other data construct may be used to retrieve such data.","In some embodiments, specific hardware\/software identifying information may not be provided, such as firmware version, hardware version, or the like. In such cases, the application server may assume a default or basic hardware\/software configuration, or the like. For example, if hardware versions include: A no USB, A with USB, B without USB, and C with USB, the default version may be A no USB; if the firmware versions include: 1.4, 2.4, and 3.0, the default version may be the lowest firmware version: 1.4, or the like.","In some embodiments, a SP serial identifier (number) is the minimum data required by the application server from the SP to uniquely identify the SP. Additionally, in some embodiments a firmware identifier is also required. In such cases, the identifiers may provided by packaging it along with some or all http requests sent to the application server.","Additionally, in various embodiments, the application server may also determiner demographic data associated with the SP, step . Such demographic data may include a name, zip code, street address, city, ISP, marital status, children, income, user interests, which channels are watched, the viewing duration, programs watched, time of day a program is watched, primary written\/spoken language, and the like.","In various embodiments, based upon the hardware\/software configuration for the SP and\/or demographic data associated with the SP (collectively the user data), a list of available and published programming channels may be determined, step . More specifically, based upon such user data, a list of programming channels that the user may decide to associate with their SP are determined. In various embodiments, the list of programming channels may also include channels that are currently associated with the user's SP. As an example, if a user is currently associated with programming channels A and B, and it is determined that the user is also qualified (based upon the hardware\/software\/demographic data) to receive programming channel C, then in this step, programming channels associated with the user's SP may include A, B and C.","In various embodiments, the user data may be used to query a database, or other data construct, to determine the available, published channels to the user. In other embodiments, the database, or the like, may be queried to return a list of all published channels. Next, the user data is used as filters to determine the available channels from the superset list of all channels.","In the different embodiments described above, any number of criteria may be used to determine the list of available, published channels to the user. For example, some criteria may be based upon SP hardware considerations, such as the display processor type, display processor speed, amount of memory, the type of interfaces (e.g. Bluetooth, USB); software considerations, such as what codecs are installed (e.g. H.264, WMV), the firmware number, whether helper applications are installed (e.g. Shockwave\u2122 or Flash\u2122 from Adobe), whether a particular Digital Rights Management library is installed (e.g. Play Reader from Microsoft or Widevine from Google), whether a particular software application is installed (e.g. on-line and local games, Acrobat\u2122 Viewer from Adobe), or the like. Other examples are described herein.","In various embodiments, as will be discussed below, video\/application providers register their programming channels by providing metadata along with software code packages. With the metadata, the video\/application providers may specify desired user hardware\/software\/demographic criteria required before the programming channel is available to the user, descriptions of their programming channels, images, pricing information, and the like.","Based upon the list of available channels, some or all of the metadata associated with each identified programming channels are determined, step . In various embodiments, the indicators may be pointers to graphical image files and\/or text files, URLs to files, descriptions, screenshots, pricing information, or the like.","In various embodiments, the available channel metadata are sent to the SP, step , to be rendered and displayed as one or more graphical user interfaces to the user on the user's display, step . In some examples, the metadata may include image data which the SP directly renders as images, and some other examples, the metadata may include URLs that point to image data which the SP again renders as images. In various embodiments, the SP may present the images\/text data for the available channels in any suitable graphical user interface. For example, the available channels may be displayed in a matrix\/array; in a three-dimensional pile of images; or the like.","In response to the graphical user interface, the user may use a remote control, or the like, to navigate within the graphical user interface and select one or more channels to add to their channel listings, step . In various embodiments, SP may provide this functionality if the complete graphical user interface has been downloaded to the SP from the application server. In other embodiments, as a user navigates in first portion of the graphical user interface, the SP may receive metadata for a second portion of a graphical user interface from the application server. Accordingly, the graphical user interface may be provided to the user in any number of ways.","As illustrated in , SP sends the user selection back to the application server, step , and then application server adds or stores the programming channel associated with the user selection into the database or data structure, step .","Subsequently, when the user desires to view their programming channels, the SP may again provide identifying information (SP configuration, demographic information, etc.) to the application server, step . In response, the application server determines the programming channels available to the user's SP, step , and provides them to the user on the user display, step . These steps in may be performed in a manner similar to the steps above, for example, the application server may use the identifying information to query a data base or data structure; the application server may determine metadata of associated channels, e.g. images\/text\/image identifiers; the application server may transfer the metadata to the SP; the SP receives the metadata and renders and displays images\/text to the user; and the like.","In various embodiments, the user may make a selection of a programming channel to view by navigating in the rendered graphical user interface, and selecting an icon\/text, step . In response, the SP relays the selection back to the application server, step . In various embodiments, the application server receives the selection, and executes or calls computer code provided by a provider of the programming channel, step . The software code then provides a pointer, video location, URL or the like to a source of video data, application data, or the like, which is then relayed back to the SP, step . Subsequently, the SP receives video\/application data located at the pointer, video location, URL, or the like from the source of data, step  and displays the video\/application data to the user on the user display, step . Subsequently, addition interaction between the SP the application server and the source of data may occur, such as user search of a database (e.g. Netflix, Youtube), or other user input of data, or the like, and response from the application server and\/or the source of data.","In some embodiments of the present invention, a user may be linked to a first SP having an older hardware\/software configuration, and to a second SP having a newer hardware\/software configuration. In such cases, the application server may provide different available programming channels to the user based demographic data of the user and upon which SP the user is currently using. In other embodiments, the application server may provide the available programming channels to the user based upon the newest hardware\/software configuration (second SP) associated with the user. In such cases, if a programming channel cannot be operated upon an older SP (first SP), a message may indicate this non-functionality to the user on the first SP.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},"Initially, a video\/application provider may determine URLs, or network addresses of sources of video\/application data programming channel, step . Next, the video\/application provider may determine whether there are any special hardware\/software configurations they require for a SP to properly play-back the video data\/execute the application data, step . For example, the video\/application provider may require a specific video codec, a specific peripheral device, a certain amount of memory, a certain controller, a USB port, HD display, or the like. Other examples of specific hardware\/software options were given above.","In various embodiments, the video\/application provider may also determine whether there are any demographic considerations they require for the SP to receive the video data, step . For example, the video\/application provider may want to limit the geography where their programming channel can be played (e.g. a Sunnyvale, Calif. car dealership video channel may be limited to the San Francisco Bay area); they may want to limit the availability based upon marital status (e.g. a singles channel available to only single users); they may want to limit the availability based upon income (e.g. a luxury home channel available to only users making more than $250,000\/yr); they may be contractually or legally restricted to only provide programming data based upon geographic data (e.g. an Illinois legal advice channel being only available to Illinois residents, a sports channel may only have rights to distribute live sports inside or outside a home market, etc.); they may want to target certain households (e.g. a coupon channel available only to households with two working parents); they may want to create a channel with a minimum for viewers (e.g. 21 years or older, specific TV parental guidelines, specific Movie rating); and the like.","The inventors of the present invention believe that video\/application providers may surprisingly benefit by limiting the dissemination of their programming to only targeted users. This is contrary to the current thinking about videos, e.g. YouTube, where videos are deemed \u201csuccessful\u201d only if they are viewed by many people. In contrast, it is believed that benefits to having restrictions on availability of video programming channels based upon demographic\/geographic data include: helping reduce the load upon the video\/application provider's servers, preserving and maintaining the reputation of the video\/application provider, being able to offer advertisers viewers of a particular market segment, and the like. In view of the present patent disclosure, one of ordinary skill in the art would be able to determine many other similar criteria that may be used to determine availability of a programming channel to a user.","Turning to , the video\/application providers may specify URLs, images, pointers, or other graphical\/textual data descriptions of their programming channel, or the like, step . In various embodiments, menus, sub-menus, query interfaces, and the like are also specified by the video\/application providers, step . As mentioned above, the graphical user interface provided by the video\/application provider along with menus, search bars, etc. may be implemented using API's provided by a SDK provided by the application server, or the like. Such API calls, as well as the URLs or pointers to sources of video programming, the hardware\/software criteria, demographic criteria, image sources, and the like, may be specified in the form of a programming channel software package written by the video\/application provider. That programming channel software package (channel application) is then uploaded to the application server as a programming channel, step .","In response to the software package, the application server may publish a version of the programming channel, step . In various embodiments, multiple versions of a programming channel may be enabled at the same time. The different versions may support different hardware and or software configurations. As examples of this, there may be a standard definition version for SPs having only SD support, a high definition version for SPs supporting HD video; one version of a game for SPs having a graphics accelerator, and another version of the game for SPs without a graphics accelerator; or the like. Subsequently, the application server may then use the provided criteria to determine which programming channels and which versions of the published programming channel are available to the SP, as described above, in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["400","410","420","430","410","440","450","440","460","470","420","450","460","430","480","490"]},"In various embodiments, application server  includes one or more data stores, e.g. a database. The data stores may include data such as video programming software packages (including the network locations of video programming sources ), hardware\/software capabilities of different versions of streaming player , customer data (e.g. demographic, geographic, ISP, customer identifiable data, or the like.), or the like. In various embodiments, application server  generates and may output customized user interfaces for different streaming players . The user interfaces provide the user a selection of video programming channels that are currently available to the user, depending upon the hardware\/software\/demographic criteria, as described above.","In various embodiments, application server  receives user input from client device  and processes the input. In some cases, the user input may include navigation commands within the user interfaces, may include selection of one or more video programming sources to view, may include search terms, and the like.","In various embodiments, application client  displays user interfaces to a user on display . In response, a user utilizes user inputs device  (e.g. IR\/RF remote control) to enter data, to make user selections from the user interfaces, or the like. In various embodiments, the user interfaces may be based upon data from application server , from video programming sources , and the like. Application programming interfaces (APIs) may be specified by application server  to enable proper generation of the user interfaces (e.g. via the video programming software packages), and to enable application client  to communicate with application server , or the like.","In various embodiments, video programming sources  may include server  and video storage . Network addresses of video sources  may be maintained in application server  (via video programming software packages) and provided to application client . Upon request of streaming player , video sources  may stream or otherwise output video data to streaming player . In some embodiments, application server  may provide or support one or more user interfaces, such as login user interfaces, search user interfaces of application client , or the like.
