{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy, and thus, the invention herein may be manufactured, used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates generally to quantum gates. In particular, the invention relates to shifting the quantum state of a photon along a path using weak measurement based on switchable introduction of a shutter.","Because quantum interference differs fundamentally from the interference phenomena of classical physics, this phenomenon has remained a continuing topic for discussion and debate since the early days of quantum theory. The essence of this difference is embodied in the two-slit experiment. From both the classical and Schr\u00f6dinger wave perspectives, the resulting two slit interference pattern is easily described in terms of the overlapping contributions of the wave which have passed through each slit. The wave perspective also explains the disappearance of the interference pattern when one of the slits is closed.","However, interference experiments using low intensity electron or photon beams in which only one particle at a time passes through a two-slit apparatus have shown that the accumulated effect when both slits are open is an interference pattern like that produced by higher intensity ensembles and that the pattern disappears when one slit is closed, as described by A. Tonomura et al. in \u201cDemonstration of single electron buildup of an interference pattern\u201d, 57 117-20 (1989).","Conventional quantum switches for altering quantum state yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, various exemplary embodiments provide quantum dynamical non-locality device is provided for establishing a photon traveling along a path in a binary state.","In various exemplary embodiments, the device includes twin Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), a shutter and a detector. The twin MZI includes first and second right-isosceles triangle prisms, corresponding first and second trombone mirrors, and corresponding first and second spacers. The prisms join at a beam-splitter interface. The mirrors reflect the photon by an offset substantially perpendicular to photon's travel direction. The spacers are respectively disposed between their respective prisms and mirrors to produce corresponding spatial gaps.","In various exemplary embodiments, the path through the prisms includes traversing spacers and gaps. The detector detects a quantum state of the photon after passing the prisms and the mirrors. The shutter switches to one of disposed within and removed therefrom the first gap. The shutter shifts said quantum state of the photon.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","In accordance with a presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, the components, process steps, and\/or data structures may be implemented using various types of operating systems, computing platforms, computer programs, and\/or general purpose machines. In addition, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that devices of a less general purpose nature, such as hardwired devices, or the like, may also be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the inventive concepts disclosed herewith. General purpose machines include devices that execute instruction code. A hardwired device may constitute an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or a floating point gate array (FPGA) or other related component.","This disclosure describes exemplary embodiments of a quantum dynamical non-locality device called the Optical Dynamical Non-Locality Induction Bit (ODNIB). The exemplary ODNIB constitutes a small monolithic twin consecutive Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) in which: (i) weak measurements of a pre- and post-selected photon current are used to establish and maintain a 0\/1 binary state in the first MZI; and (ii) the effect induced by non-local exchanges of modular momentum in the second MZI are used to change the binary state of the first MZI. The ODNIB operates with either single photon currents or classically intense coherent light.","Theories of modular momentum, dynamical non-locality, weak measurements, and weak values are briefly summarized in the following paragraphs. A description of the device and its operation are subsequently presented. Applications of such devices include providing a quantum gate employed to solve cryptographic problems. In such an application, the second MZI operates to control the first MZI.","The peculiar behavior of vanishing single-slit interference necessitates an answer to the question \u201chow does a particle passing through one slit sense if the other slit is open or closed?\u201d when interference is considered from the perspective of a single quantum particle. This single particle behavior has been explained theoretically in terms of a non-local exchange of modular momentum by Y. Aharonov et al. in \u201cModular Variables in Quantum Theory\u201d, 2 213-19 (1969) and \u201cDeterministic Quantum Interference Experiments\u201d, 3 443-48 (1970).","Despite ongoing research in quantum mechanics, there have been no direct experimental observations of this exchange to support this explanation. This is due to the fact that the conditions required to observe it are precisely those that make the associated modular variable completely uncertain and unobservable. Recently, an experimental methodology has been suggested that uses weak measurements performed on pre- and post-selected ensembles of particles could be exploited in order to observe an effect induced by a non-local exchange of modular momentum. This methodology has been illustrated by a \u201cgedanken\u201d experiment using a twin consecutive MZI to duplicate relevant aspects of the two-slit interference experiment, as described by J. Tollaksen et al., in \u201cQuantum interference experiments, modular variables and weak measurements\u201d, 12 013023 (2010).","Researchers at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division performed an optical twin MZI weak value experiment similar to that described in the above \u201cgedanken\u201d experiment. This experiment yielded measured weak values that were consistent with the associated theoretical predictions concerning the effect induced by a non-local exchange of modular momentum, as reported by S. Spence et al. in \u201cExperimental Evidence for a Dynamical Non-Locality Induced Effect in Quantum Interference Using Weak Values\u201d, arXiv:1010.3289v1 (2010), accepted for publication in ., electronically available at http:\/\/arxiv.org\/PS_cache\/arxiv\/pdf\/1010\/1010.3289v1.pdf.","Theory","Modular Momentum and Dynamical Non-Locality:","Consider a quantum particle propagating in the positive \u03b3-direction perpendicular to the plane of two symmetric slits that are separated by a distance l in the x-direction.

(Conventionally, zero and one denote spin states \u201cdown\u201d and \u201cup\u201d, respectively.)","An edge MZI can be constructed with only a single input port. In practice, there are two input ports, such that the input port not depicted would have a quantum vacuum ket state |vac entering that MZI. The vacuum state is a non-zero fluctuation of the quantized radiation field without a photon associated with that field. Some aspects of the quantum random-walk can be studied with the twin MZI because of its two-step depth structure (i.e., without width) of the quantum random-walk. The input light-wave can be a continuous quantum state such as the quantum coherent state or a quantum squeezed state.","For example,  illustrates a simplified twin Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) structure in a plan diagram . Upper photons  and a lower vacuum state  enter a first beam-splitter (BS)  by respective paths R and L. Second and third beam-splitters (BS, BS) ,  are disposed further downstream. The photons  proceed to one of first and second mirrors (M, M) ,  and reflect to the second beam-splitter (BS) . For purposes of explanation, the vacuum state  is reflected by the third mirror (M) . From the beam-splitter , the photons  continue to fourth mirror (M)  and are reflected to the third beam-splitter (BS)  from which they exit.","To recap, the beam-splitters are labeled BS , BS , and BS . The mirrors are labeled M , M , M , and M . The paths followed by the light (as photons ) are labeled using the traditional \u201cright\u201d (R) and \u201cleft\u201d (L) notation R, R, . . . , R, L, L, . . . , L.","The photon paths oriented diagonally downward (towards the right) are denoted by R, R, R, R, R and R. The photon paths oriented diagonally upward (towards the right) are denoted by L, L, L, L, L and L. The beam-splitters , ,  have a plate configuration with a 45\u00b0 angle of incidence for incoming light, which can be used in a cube-style beam-splitter as described subsequently.","These principles can be extended to geometries for a monolithic (single-piece) multiple MZI. The objectives of a quantum optics experiment may be compromised, if instabilities occur in the path of the photons within the experimental apparatus. These instabilities can be a result of thermal gradients and fluctuations, as well as vibrations. The quantum optics experimental community has so far used active stabilization at most for keeping optical elements fixed relative to each other.","The optical elements, such as mirrors, lenses, and beam-splitters are typically held in separate opto-mechanical mounts. Outside of this community, researchers and device developers are migrating toward more monolithic constructions. To provide for several experiments that utilize MZI components joined to each other as shown in  as a plan view diagram  for a twin MZI monolith.

The input photon  travels along path R through the third spacer  and the first prism , striking the interface  at a first intersection BS. Similarly, the vacuum state  travels along path L through the fourth spacer  and the second prism , also striking the interface  at the first intersection BS.","In a more generalized description, the MZI can be composed of a complimentary pair of right-isosceles triangular prisms, and several trombone reflector units. The triangular prisms  and  are configurable to physically join together along associated hypotenuse surfaces that form a beam-splitter interface , thereby producing a square beam-splitter having a square cross-section with four outer side surfaces. Each reflector unit , ,  and  forms a right-isosceles mirror that rigidly faces a corresponding surface of the four outer side surfaces of the square beam-splitter. The MZI may preferably further include a spacer disposed between the corresponding surface and the each reflector unit.","The photons  can travel either horizontally along path R to the second mirror  to be offset and return along path L to a second intersection BS, or else vertically along path L to the first mirror  and return along path R also to the second intersection BS. Thus, ideally this is a vacuum state (distinct from that at ) that proceeds horizontally along path L to the third mirror  to be offset and return along path R to a third intersection BS. The photons  can proceed vertically along path R to the fourth mirror  and return along path L also to the third intersection BS. The vacuum state implies the wave part of the wave\/particle duality in quantum mechanics.","The photons  can then pass either horizontally through the second prism  and the second spacer  to exit along path R towards a horizontal detector , or else vertically through the first prism  and the first spacer  to exit along path L towards a vertical detector . The paths R, R, L and L each traverse through an access space between their respective mirrors  (M),  (M),  (M),  (M) and the prisms ,  separated by the respective spacers , , , . The access spaces provide a region in which an experimenter can dispose a sample or other object into the optical beam path.","In brief,  is a schematic of the ODNIB's monolithic twin MZI. The second diagram  incorporates analogous notation as the first diagram  so that one can observe how the simplified twin MZI of  maps into the ODNIB. The combination of optical elements BS, BS, M, and M comprise the first MZI and the combination BS, BS, M, and M comprise the second MZI. The photon current enters along path R (defining the pre-selected state of L) and exits along paths R and L.","The first MZI is phase-tuned so that the photon exiting BS is along R only and the location of the first and second mirrors  and  (M and M respectively) are offset along the direction of L and R. These offsets enable either of the gaps to facilitate active or passive phase tuning of weak interactions by an inserted optical window device (not shown) that when rotated causes small transverse beam shifts along the direction of L.","The photon detector , being capable of measuring the image exiting R, performs the weak measurements. These measurements are used to read the binary value via the spatial position of the average intensity of the photon beam along the line of the beam profile movement. The location of the photon detector and a phase tuned second MZI defines the L post-selected state |\u03c8 of the photon.","The second MZI can be phase-tuned in a similar manner as the first MZI, in which the gaps for the third and fourth mirrors  and  (M and M respectively) define the possible locations for a phase-tuning optical window device. The phase-tuning requirement of the second MZI requires that by temporarily blocking the path R provided by the spacer , any photon from path R will travel to the path R and reach the detector .","Artisans of ordinary skill will recognize that the optical windows used in phase-tuning the first and second MZIs will be slightly rotated and that the required gap can easily be determined from the required glass rotations, glass thickness, Snell's law, and so forth. Also, artisans of ordinary skill will recognize that the optical windows used in causing small transverse beam shifts along the direction of L in the first MZI will be rotated and that the required gap can easily be determined. Moreover, such artisans will recognize that there are equivalent devices that may be substituted for the optical windows to perform the same functions.","A small electronically controlled shutter  can be inserted and removed in the spatial \u201cgap\u201d along R between the mirror  and the prism . In the absence of the shutter  in the gap, there is no exchange of modular momentum, and the first MZI is in and remains in the \u201c1\u201d binary state. With the shutter  being in the gap, there is a non-local exchange of modular momentum between the shutter  and the current photons in the second MZI. This induces the binary state of the first MZI to change to and remain in the \u201c0\u201d binary state.","When the shutter  is removed from the gap, the first MZI returns to and remains in the \u201c1\u201d state. Artisans of ordinary skill will recognize that the shutter  can be physically inserted and removed, or alternatively be replaced by a switchable shutter that can be activated and deactivated.","The offset distance of mirror  (M) by spacer  for an inserted weak interaction device at which the weakness of the interaction is varied for the weak measurement of the photon spatial mode projection operator as:\n\n22|,\u2003\u2003(32)\n\nlocated in path L and an implicit weak measurement of the spatial mode projection operator:\n\n22|,\u2003\u2003(33)\n\nlocated in path R.\n","Let (N)and (N)be the weak values of {circumflex over (N)}and {circumflex over (N)}when there is no shutter  in the R gap, respectively, and (N)and (N)be their weak values when there is a shutter  in the gap. Without the shutter  in the gap, the binary state of the first MZI is defined by the weak value difference (N)>(N)=0.","In this case, (N)corresponds to no changes in the average location at the detector , whereas (N)corresponds to the maximum changes with changes in the weak interactions as measured by the detector . Conducting measurements for the correct projection operator, necessitates either a detector  or else a it radians phase-shift in the second MZI to make the measurements at the detector .","When there is a shutter  in the R gap, the first MZI's binary state is (N)=(N)and corresponds to lesser changes in average locations at the detector  due to changes in the weak interactions (and similarly greater changes at the detector ). Thus, a \u201c1\u201d to a \u201c0\u201d state change in the first MZI corresponds to the degree of changes of the average intensity location at the detector  for (N).","To show that these weak value differences define the binary state of the first MZI, is necessary to calculate their values using eqn.
