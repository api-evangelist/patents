{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/499,636, filed Jun. 21, 2011, titled \u201cSYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR MATCHING VENUES AND ATTRACTIONS,\u201d the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein and made a part of this specification.","1. Field","This disclosure relates to information systems technology and to technology for estimating demand for attractions.","2. Description of Related Art","Places of interest, such as amusement parks, museums, convention centers, zoos, campuses, theaters, clubs, concert halls, performing arts centers, hospitals, retail stores, and shopping malls, often host attractions or talent that draw an audience. A talent or attraction that has widespread popularity, such as, for example, well-known or popular artists, performers, exhibits, restaurants, shops, products, services, productions, shows, and rides, can generate a predictable return on investment for venue operators. An operator that fills its venue with lesser-known attractions or talent may face greater risk of audience indifference and financial failure. The relative scarcity of attractions and talent with widespread popularity may cause venue operators to take a risk on an unproven item. Existing techniques for matching venues with attractions and\/or talent suffer from various drawbacks.","Example embodiments described herein have several features, no single one of which is indispensible or solely responsible for their desirable attributes. Without limiting the scope of the claims, some of the advantageous features of some embodiments will now be summarized.","Certain embodiments disclosed herein provide devices, systems, and methods of using location-based virtual audience feedback to estimate interest in an attraction or talent at one or more venues. Certain embodiments provide devices, systems, and methods of using location-based virtual audience feedback and\/or other audience data to estimate interest in a plurality of attractions or other items of interest at a particular venue.","Advantageously, the location-based virtual audience feedback may allow audience members that have not been measured by traditional metrics, such as surveys, to express their interest in and demand for an attraction, product, or service. Thus, the systems and methods described herein may advantageously detect demand from the grassroots without needing to pass through a filter of record labels, media executives, or the like. In this way, the systems and methods disclosed herein can help attractions that have not been recognized by traditional channels to achieve success based on direct feedback and indications of interest from individual consumers.","A provider of a good or service determines how to allocate or distribute the good or service by predicting or guessing where there will be demand for the good or service. Information about actual demand for many goods and services may be incomplete or nonexistent, thereby causing the provider to rely on geographic, demographic, technographic, psychographic, and\/or other market segmentation data to make an informed guess about the level of demand in a particular region. In some cases, the provider may use opinions or popular beliefs about a region to guess the level of demand. Market segmentation data, opinions, and popular beliefs can have widely varying accuracy and can form an imperfect picture of the actual demand for the good or service. Further, such data, opinions, popular beliefs, and other widely-available information may provide little or no insight into demand for certain goods and services, particularly goods and services that are new or not widely known.","Access to pertinent and timely information about actual demand for a good or service has traditionally been rare. Providers seeking such information have used tools such as opinion polls, surveys, and market sampling to collect data reflecting actual demand. The cost of using these and other market research tools that are provider-driven can be prohibitively high, particularly when the good or service in question does not already have widespread popularity. In addition, it may be difficult for such tools to identify rapid changes in interest for a good or service, which might cause a provider to miss a substantial market opportunity. Such difficulties can also affect an operator of a venue that seeks to match the venue with suitable goods, services, or other attractions.","A venue operator often seeks to place attractions at its venue that draw an audience and make the venue profitable and\/or successful. The operator of a mall seeks to place retail stores in the mall that will strongly draw shoppers from the region surrounding the mall. A hospital operator brings in doctors and medical equipment that will provide medical care demanded by the population in a target area. A concert hall operator brings in performers that are popular in the area where the concert hall is located. A venue operator might be unable to judge the demand for an attraction that is not widely known, even though concentrations of interest in the attraction might exist in the immediate vicinity of the venue.","In some embodiments, a demand prediction system is configured to receive indications of interest in one or more attractions directly or indirectly from consumers. The system can use the indications of interest, information about the geographic location of the consumers, and other collected data to predict the actual demand for an attraction. The system can be configured to generate a demand prediction for an attraction within a defined geographical region or within other defined parameters (such as, for example, within a defined market segment). In certain embodiments, a demand prediction system is configured to generate a demand prediction for multiple attractions within a defined market segment, for an attraction within multiple defined market segments, and\/or for multiple attractions within multiple defined market segments.","Some embodiments provide a system for predicting demand for a good, service, or other attraction in a market segment based on direct or indirect indications of interest generated by consumers. For example, a demand prediction system can be configured to predict the size of an audience for an attraction if the attraction were to be hosted at a particular venue. The system can include or be connected to sources of attraction information and venue information. The term \u201cattraction\u201d is used in its broad and ordinary sense and includes, without limitation, persons (such as, for example, artists, performers, entertainers, and professionals); exhibits (such as, for example, art collections, artifacts, rare items, and product displays); businesses (such as, for example, retailers and service providers); shows (such as, for example, dramatic presentations, musical performances, comedy routines, and variety shows); acts; goods; services; other items that draw interest from consumers; and combinations of items. The term \u201cconsumer\u201d is used in its broad and ordinary sense and includes, without limitation, a prospective purchaser of a good or service, a potential member of an audience, or any other person within a market segment, including a person who does not need to pay money to consume an item of interest. The term \u201cvenue\u201d is used in its broad and ordinary sense and includes, without limitation, a plot of land, a building, a development, a hall, a theater, a sport facility, a music facility, or another geographic location.","A demand prediction system can receive indications of interest for an attraction from consumers. The demand prediction system can be configured to receive other consumer data, including, for example, location information for individual consumers, a participation metric based on a rate of consumer participation in past events, and a social influence metric based on how actions of consumers influence others and\/or how consumers are influenced by others. The demand prediction system can use the indications of interest and other consumer data to predict the demand for the attraction if it were to be matched with the venue. The demand prediction can be sent to an operator of the attraction or to an operator of the venue.","As indicated above, the methods and systems described herein provide a general mechanism for matching consumer demand to any type of attraction. The embodiments disclosed herein are not limited to any particular type of attraction. However, to provide concrete examples of how the systems and methods may be used, particular illustrative examples of the use of the systems and methods in particular industries will now be described. A person of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the inventions are not limited to these examples.","For example, some embodiments provide a system for matching a venue with one or more performers. The system can include a database that stores information about venues for holding performances, performers that perform acts of entertainment, and fans of the performers. The system can include a computer that has access to the database and that is configured to receive indications of interest from fans. Each indication of interest can be an action taken by a fan that shows that the fan is interested in a specific performer. The system can determine, based upon the indications of interest, interest metrics representing individual fans' degree of interest in specific performers. The system determines distances between geographic locations of fans and venues. The system can determine participation metrics representing each fan's rate of participation in past performances. In some embodiments, the system is configured to determine social influence metrics that represent the likelihood that a fan will be influenced by the actions of others.","The system can calculate likelihoods that specific fans will attend the performance by a specific performer at a specific venue. The calculation can take into account the interest metrics, distances, participation metrics, and social influence metrics gathered by the system. The system can calculate an estimate of the attendance at a performance by a performer at a specific venue by summing the likelihoods that specific fans will attend the performance. The system can use the estimate of attendance to match a venue with the performer.","In some embodiments, the system includes a fan feedback subsystem configured to record the fan actions that constitute indications of interest. The fan feedback subsystem can include a user interface element operable by the fans to indicate interest in a particular performer. The user interface element can be configured to be operated repeatedly. A value of an interest metric can be based on the number of times that the user interface element is operated. The number of times and interval when a fan can operate the user interface element can be limited by one or more thresholds. The interest metrics, distances, participation metrics, and social influence metrics can be weighted according to their relative importance in calculating the likelihoods of attendance.","The interest metrics can be based at least in part on indications of how recently an indication of interest occurred. The interest metrics can be used to calculate estimated attendance at performances by performers that are similar to specific performers for whom fans have made previous indications of interest.","Some embodiments provide a system for calculating a total participation estimate for one or more attractions at a venue. The system can include a data store the stores data associated with members of the perspective audience for the one or more attractions and a computing device in communication with the data store. The computing device can be configured to receive data directly or indirectly from members of the perspective audience. The data received from members of the audience can include, for example, for each individual member of the perspective audience, an attraction interest metric based on actions taken by an audience member indicating interest in a particular attraction and a location metric based on the geographic location of the audience member. The computing device can be configured to calculate an individual participation expectation value for each individual member of the perspective audience. The individual participation expectation value can be calculated at least partially from the attraction interest metric of the audience member and the distance between the geographic location of the audience member and the venue. The computing device can be configured to calculate the total participation estimate for at least one of the one or more attractions if the at least one of the one or more attractions were to be placed at the venue by summing the individual participation expectation values of the perspective audience members.","The computing device can be configured to receive the attraction interest metric by tracking a number of times when a member of the perspective audience operates a user interface element configured to register interest in an attraction.","The computing device can be configured to receive the attraction interest metric by tracking a number of times when a member of the prospective audience searches for an attraction using the World Wide Web. The computing device can be configured to receive the attraction interest metric by receiving information about the interests of a member of the prospective audience.","The computing device can be configured to receive the location metric by obtaining geographical location information automatically from an electronic device used by the audience member. The computing device can be configured to receive the location metric by receiving Global Positioning System data. The computing device can be configured to receive the location metric by logging an IP address of an electronic device used by the audience member.","Certain embodiments provide a computer-implemented method for estimating participation in one or more attractions at a venue. The method can include receiving data directly or indirectly from members of the perspective audience for the one or more attractions. The data can include, for each individual member of the perspective audience, an attraction interest metric based on actions taken by an audience member indicating interest in a particular attraction and one or more additional metrics, the one or more additional metrics including a social influence metric based on how actions of the audience member influence other members of the perspective audience. The method can include calculating an individual participation expectation value for each individual member of the perspective audience. The individual participation expectation value can be calculated at least partially from the attraction interest metric of the audience member and social influence metrics of members of the perspective audience. The method can include calculating a total participation estimate for at least one of the one or more attractions if the at least one of the one or more attractions were to be placed at the venue by summing the individual participation expectation values of the prospective audience members.","The one or more additional metrics can include a participation metric based on a rate of audience member participation in past attractions. The one or more additional metrics can include a location metric based on a geographic location of the audience member. The individual participation expectation value is calculated at least partially from the participation metric, the location metric, and the location of the venue. The attraction interest metric can be based on a number of times when a member of the perspective audience operates a user interface element configured to register interest in an attraction.","Some embodiments provide a system for generating a demand prediction for an event. The system can include a database that stores information about an attraction, venues that are capable of hosting the attraction, and consumers who may have interest in the attraction. A computer that has access to the database can be configured to receive indications of interest from at least some of the consumers. Each indication of interest can be generated by an action performed by an interested consumer using an electronic device configured to send indications of interest to the computer. Each indication of interest indicates that the interested consumer may have interest in the attraction or interest in a category of attractions to which the attraction belongs. In certain embodiments, the computer is configured to receive location information that identifies a location corresponding to each interested consumer. Interest metrics representing a level of interest in the attraction for each interested consumer can be determined. The interest metrics can be based at least partially on the received indications of interest. Likelihoods that specific consumers would attend an event at a specific venue featuring the attraction can be calculated. The calculation can take into account the interest metrics, the location information, a location of the specific venue, other information, or a combination of information. The computer is configured to calculate a demand prediction for the event by summing the likelihoods that specific consumers would attend the event.","The computer can be configured to receive indications of interest by receiving a notification when the at least one of the consumers uses an electronic device to search for an attraction. Other activities, including, for example, visiting an attraction profile page, operating a user interface element adapted to express consumer interest in an attraction, or connecting with a person associated with an attraction on a social network, can also trigger notifications to the computer that the consumer may have interest in the attraction.","In some embodiments, the computer is configured to determine social influence metrics representing likelihoods that consumers will be influenced by actions of others and account for the social influence metrics in calculating the likelihoods that specific consumers would attend the event. The computer can be configured to determine participation metrics representing a rate of participation in past events for each interested consumer and account for the participation metrics in calculating the likelihoods that specific consumers would attend the event.","In certain embodiments, the computer is configured to estimate the profitability of the event, based at least partially on the demand prediction for the event. The computer can be configured to provide information about one or more events that are estimated to be most profitable to an agent for the attraction. The computer can be configured to identify one or more geographical regions where the demand prediction is highest and match the attraction with a proposed venue within each of the one or more geographical regions. In some embodiments, the proposed venue would result in an event with the highest estimated profitability compared to other venues within the geographical region of the proposed venue.","Certain embodiments provide a computer-implemented method of calculating a demand prediction for an event. The method can include receiving indications of interest from consumers, wherein each indication of interest is generated by an action performed by an interested consumer using an electronic device, and wherein each indication of interest shows that the interested consumer may have interest in an attraction or interest in a category of attractions to which the attraction belongs. Location information that identifies a location corresponding to each interested consumer is received. The method can include determining interest metrics representing a level of interest in the attraction for each interested consumer, wherein the interest metrics are based at least partially on the received indications of interest. Likelihoods that specific consumers would attend an event at a specific venue featuring the attraction are calculated. The calculation can take into account the interest metrics, the location information, a location of the specific venue, other factors, or a combination of factors. A demand prediction for the event can be calculated by summing the likelihoods that specific consumers would attend the event.","The method can include identifying one or more geographical regions where there is a concentration of interest in the attraction, based on one or more demand predictions. The attraction can be matched with a proposed venue within each of the one or more geographical regions. The proposed venue can be selected such that the projected profitability of the event at the proposed venue is greater than or equal to the projected profitability of an event featuring the same attraction at another venue within the same geographical region as the proposed venue.","The method can include determining social influence metrics representing likelihoods that consumers will be influenced by actions of others and accounting for the social influence metrics in calculating the likelihoods that specific consumers would attend the event. In some embodiments, the method includes determining participation metrics representing a rate of participation in past events for each interested consumer and accounting for the participation metrics in calculating the likelihoods that specific consumers would attend the event.","In certain embodiments, the method includes weighting the interest metrics and the location information according to their relative importance in calculating the likelihoods that specific consumers would attend the event. The interest metrics can be based in part on how recently the indications of interest occurred, on a number of times that a consumer operates a user interface element configured to register interest in the attraction, on other factors, or on a combination of factors.","Although certain preferred embodiments and examples are disclosed herein, inventive subject matter extends beyond the examples in the specifically disclosed embodiments to other alternative embodiments and\/or uses, and to modifications and equivalents thereof.

Logistic regression can be used to pick the best weights to match what actually occurs, given a set of x values that are known.","Techniques for selecting the set of x values to use will now be discussed. In some embodiments, an iterative procedure is used to select the best set of x values from a large set of possible x values. The x values are selected to do the best job of predicting probabilities while minimizing model complexity. In some embodiments, a model of attendance is formulated by starting with relatively few x values that provide a good fit to observed data. Additional x values are added until new values do not provide enough improvement to justify their inclusion in the model.","In certain embodiments, the set of x values includes one or more values provided by the user, such as, for example, age or gender. The set of x values can also include one or more event-dependent values, such as, for example, the distance between the consumer and the venue or a feature of the consumer that is particular to the attraction. The set of x values can include one or more values that can be computed based on the interaction of consumers with a website, such as, for example, the number of times that a consumer has \u201ckicked\u201d or virtually indicated interest in the artist within a recent time period (such as, for example, within the preceding 90 days). The set of x values can include one or more values derived from the interaction of a consumer with his or her social network. There are many ways by which values can be derived from social network events. For example, an x value can be assigned if the consumer has connected with an artist on a social network or has added the artist to a list of hobbies or personal preferences. Additionally, the effect of the consumer's social network on behavior can be considered. A consumer that frequently follows another person by repeating the actions of the other person can be identified as influenced by that person. Information about the activities of influential persons can be used to better estimate the actions of a consumer.","Different models of participation can be used for an individual consumer depending on the type of information available for the consumer. For a consumer who does not have much history from which to derive x values or who has not shared social network details, a different model may better determine the probability of attendance than for a consumer who has a wealth of data available. For this reason, different models can be trained for different groups of users. Consumers for whom little data is available can be modeled using a simple model that does not include some or all of the x values available for other consumers.","A. Attendance Model","In some embodiments, attendance at an event can be modeled as a Bernoulli distributed random variable, where the probability of attendance is p:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["Y","i"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":"{","mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mn":"1"},{"msub":{"mi":["p","i"]}}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"0"},{"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","msub":{"mi":["p","i"]}}}]}]}}}}}},"The probability of attendance can be modeled as a function of user features.

As shown in , a user  can be influential for some users , , but not influential for other users .","1. Kick History","In some embodiments, each user of a website, application, or mobile application that sends kicks to the demand prediction system has a budget of M kick actions that can be taken per day. Each kick of an artist (or other attraction) is a request for the artist to perform in an event near the user. Kick events can be tracked in different ways. For example, ways of tracking kicks include tracking (1) the total kicks made by a user and (2) the kicks made by a user in a recent window. As used herein, Krepresents the number of all kicks made by the user, and K*represents the number of kicks made in the time window. The number of kicks of artist ais K, and likewise, the number of kicks of the artist in the recent window is K*.","There are many ways in which the kick history can be incorporated into the model. A model selection strategy can be used to limit the number of variables using kick data that are included. In the expressions set forth herein, the indicator function I(X) is 1 when statement X is true, and 0 otherwise.

Profitability can account for some or all types of benefits that can result from a proposed event, including, for example, revenue, non-monetary benefits, goodwill, marketing, indirect benefits, competitive benefits, other benefits, or a combination of benefits.","An example of matching will now be described in the context of a venue that plans to sell tickets for a proposed event. The number of tickets sold to the event will depend at least in part on the local demand for the attraction or group of attractions that headline the event. In this context, the local demand is the popularity of the group of attractions among the consumers residing in a geographical region surrounding the venue. The geographical region can be sufficiently large to encompass those consumers who can travel to the venue within a reasonable time, such as, for example, within about 10 minutes, within about 30 minutes, within about an hour, within about two hours, or within another reasonable period. The reasonableness of travel time can depend on many factors, such as, for example, the size of the venue hosting the event, the uniqueness of the event, the availability of other events in the geographical region, the locations of other venues, and so forth. A reasonable travel time for attending live music night at a bar would be less than the reasonable travel time for attending the Super Bowl. Alternatively, the geographical region considered can include the entire world, for example, if the distance between the consumer residence and the venue is a parameter used to filter out consumers who would likely not attend due to unreasonable travel times in predicting the probability of attendance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0181","num":"0193"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["602","604"]},"The horizontal axis  of the plot corresponds to the predicted number of ticket sales for the event. A vertical line  intersecting the horizontal axis  shows the maximum capacity of the venue. A horizontal line  parallel to the horizontal axis  shows a range of potential profits for the event. A vertical line intersecting the horizontal line  represents an example break-even point  for the event. The position of the break even point  can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as, for example, one or more non-revenue components of profitability described previously, the cost of operating the venue, the cost of the attraction, the cost of running the event, the cost of marketing the event, and so forth. Events where the predicted number of ticket sales falls in a loss region  (for example, the number of ticket sales is less than the break even point ) are considered unprofitable and may not result in a match between the venue and the attraction. Events where the predicted number of ticket sales falls in a profit region  (for example, the number of ticket sales is greater than or equal to the break even point ) are considered profitable and may result in a match between the venue and the attraction or a proposed event. Where several events would be profitable over the same time period, the matching system can be configured to select only those events with the highest profitability. For example, the matching system con be configured to select events where the predicted ticket sales are closest to or furthest above the venue capacity , events where the break even point is lowest, and\/or events where the revenue from predicted ticket sales exceeding the break even point is highest.","In some embodiments, the matching system is configured to match an attraction with a venue that has a capacity that is slightly or somewhat lower than the ticket sales prediction for an event. The matching system can be configured to determine a match threshold  where the demand for tickets will slightly or substantially exceed the supply of tickets by multiplying the venue capacity by a number greater than 1 (such as, for example, a number greater than or equal to about 1.05, greater than or equal to about 1.1, between about 1.01 and 1.5, between about 1.01 and 1.2, between about 1.1 and 1.5, or between any of the numbers listed) or by adding a predetermined value (such as, for example, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, or a number between 5 and 1000 inclusive) to the venue capacity. The matching system can be configured to preferentially match attractions with venues where the projected ticket sales meet or exceed the match threshold . For example, if a band is predicted to sell 100 tickets to consumers within a small geographical area that has multiple venues, then the matching system can be configured to match the band with one or more venues in the area that have a capacity of about 90 guests.","In some embodiments, the matching system places a restriction on the number of times that an attraction, such as, for example, a band, appears within a geographic region. The restriction can configured to prevent or lessen the risk of overexposing a marketplace, particularly when a demand prediction model does not account for the possibility that a fan attending an event one night will be less likely to attend the event the following night. In certain embodiments, the matching system employs a model that does not count consumers who have recently participated in an event identical or similar to a proposed event.","V.
