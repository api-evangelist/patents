{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Performance Monitor ()"],"p":["This invention relates to speech recognition systems, and more particularly, relates to large-scale speech recognition systems.","Automatic speech recognition (ASK) systems provide means for human beings to interface with communication equipment, computers and other machines in a mode of communication which is most natural and convenient to humans. One known approach to automatic speech recognition of isolated words involves the following: periodically sampling a bandpass filtered (BPF) audio speech input signal; monitoring the sampled signals for power level to determine the beginning and the termination (endpoints) of the isolated words; creating from the sampled signals frames of data and then processing the data to convert them to processed frames of parametric values which are more suitable for speech processing; storing a plurality of templates (each template is a plurality of previously created processed frames of parametric values representing a word, which when taken together form the reference vocabulary of the automatic speech recognizer); and comparing the processed frames of speech with the templates in accordance with a predetermined algorithm to find the best time alignment path or match between a given template and the spoken word.","ASR techniques commonly use grammars. A grammar is a representation of the language or phrases expected to be used or spoken in a given context. In one sense, then, ASR grammars typically constrain the speech recognizer to a vocabulary that is a subset of the universe of potentially-spoken words; and grammars may include subgrammars. An ASR grammar rule can then be used to represent the set of \u201cphrases\u201d or combinations of words from one or more grammars or subgrammars that may be expected in a given context. \u201cGrammar\u201d may also refer generally to a statistical language model (where a model represents phrases), such as those used in language understanding systems.","ASR systems have greatly improved in recent years as better algorithms and acoustic models are developed, and as more computer power can be brought to bear on the task. An ASR system running on an inexpensive home or office computer with a good microphone can take free-form dictation, as long as it has been pre-trained for the speaker's voice. Over the phone, and with no speaker training, a speech recognition system needs to be given a set of speech grammars that tell it what words and phrases it should expect. With these constraints a surprisingly large set possible utterances can be recognized (e.g., a particular mutual fund name out of thousands). Recognition over mobile phones in noisy environments does require more tightly pruned and carefully crafted speech grammars, however. Today there are many commercial uses of ASR in dozens of languages, and in areas as disparate as voice portals, finance, banking, telecommunications, and brokerages.","Advances are also being made in speech synthesis, or text-to-speech (TTS). Many TTS systems still sound like \u201crobots\u201d and can be hard to listen to or even at times incomprehensible. However, waveform concatenation speech synthesis is frequently deployed where speech is not completely generated from scratch, but is assembled from libraries of pre-recorded waveforms.","In a standard speech recognition\/synthesis system, a database of utterances is maintained for administering a predetermined service. In one example of operation, a user may utilize a telecommunication network to communicate utterances to the system. In response to such communication, the utterances are recognized utilizing speech recognition, and processing takes place utilizing the recognized utterances. Thereafter, synthesized speech is outputted in accordance with the processing. In one particular application, a user may verbally communicate a street address to the speech recognition system, and driving directions may be returned utilizing synthesized speech.","A system, method and computer program product for determining an address of an entity based on a user location are disclosed. An utterance representative of an entity is initially received from a user. The entity associated with the utterance is then recognized using a speech recognition process. Next, a location associated with the user is determined. A query is performed to identify a plurality of locations associated with the entity. Based on the results of the query and the location of the user, it is ascertained which of the locations associated with the entity are in proximity to the location of the user.","In an embodiment of the present invention, the user may then informed about the locations associated with the entity ascertained to be in proximity to the location of the user. In such an embodiment, the user may be audibly informed via a speech recognition portal about the locations associated with the entity ascertained to be in proximity to the location of the user. As another option, the user may be informed via an electronic message transmitted utilizing a network about the locations associated with the entity ascertained to be in proximity to the location of the user.","In one aspect of the present invention, the location of the user may be the current location of the user. In another aspect, the utterances representative of the entity may include utterances representative of criteria of the user so that the locations associated with the entity ascertained to be in proximity to the location of the user satisfy the criteria of the user. In such an aspect, the criteria of the user may include at least one of: a location associated with the entity currently holding a sale and a currently open location associated with the entity.","In an embodiment of the present invention directions from the location of the user to at least one of the locations associated with the entity ascertained to be in proximity to the location of the user may be generated and delivered to the user. In such an embodiment, the user may be permitted to select which of the locations associated with the user (e.g., work, home, street address) that the user wishes to receive directions from. In another embodiment, communication may be facilitated between the user and at least one of the locations associated with the entity ascertained to be closest to the location of the user. In a further embodiment, promotions may be offered to the user. In such an embodiment, the promotions offered to the user may be associated with one or more entities determined to be proximal to the location of the user.","In one embodiment, it may also be determined which of the identified locations is closed to the location associated with the user. In a further embodiment, a ranking may be performed on the identified locations of the ascertained to be in proximity to the location associated with the user to rank the identified locations from closest to furthest from the location associated with the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["150","150"]},"The present platform of  provides an end-to-end solution that manages a presentation layer , application logic , information access services , and telecom infrastructure .

Moreover, the static database to be initially queried may be populated with grammars that are most prevalently used. By way of example, a static database with just New York streets may be queried in response to a request from New York. As such, one can choose to include certain highly used grammars as static grammars (thus reducing network traffic), while other databases with lesser used grammars may be accessible through various other network protocols.","Further, by storing the same grammar in more than one node in such a distributed architecture, a control flow of the grammar search algorithm could point to a redundant storage area if required. As such, a fail-over mechanism is provided. By way of example, in operation , it may be determined whether the grammars may be retrieved from a first one of the databases during a first attempt. Upon the failure of the first attempt, the grammars may be retrieved from a second one of the databases, and so on.

Such statistical data may include traffic counts such as traffic along the streets and along intersecting streets.","The traffic count information may be given per intersection. One proposed scheme to extract probabilities on a street-to-street basis will now be set forth.

One exemplary method of normalization is represented by Equation #3.\n\nNormalization Traffic(street)=log()\u2003\u2003Equation #3\n","Such normalized values may then be used to categorize each of the streets in terms of prevelancy of use. Preferably, this is done separately for each city. Each category is assigned a constant scalar associated with the popularity of the street. By way of example, the constant scalars 1, 2 and 3 maybe assigned to normalized aggregations 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001, respectively.

As another option, the user may verbally identify a location using an identifying utterance such as, for example, \u201chome\u201d to indicate the home of the user or \u201cwork\u201d to indicate the workplace of the user. In such a situation, the home and\/or workplace addresses of the user may be previously stored in a database in a record associated with the user so that a search process can be performed to retrieve the user's address from the database. Note: that in such a situation, the user does not actually have to be at the location associated with the user at the time of the session with the speech recognition portal. As another option, the location of the user may be obtained by connecting (via a network connection for example) to a global positioning system (GPS) device of the user\u2014such as a wireless phone or PDA held in the hand of the user that includes a GPS system for determining the position of the user. This way, the user does not have to be prompted to provide information about his or her location.","With continuing reference to , a query is performed in operation  to obtain information that identifies a plurality of locations associated with the entity. Based on the results of the query and the location of the user, it is then ascertained in operation  which of the locations associated with the entity is in proximity to the location of the user. This query may be conducted using a database of addresses. Thus, in the illustrative example where the user is searching for the nearest McDonald's restaurant, a database that stores information (including address information) about plurality of business (including McDonald's restaurants) may be searched to find address information regarding the various McDonald's restaurants stored in the database. The locations of the McDonald's restaurants retrieved from the database are then compared to user's location to determine which of the McDonald's restaurants is closest to the user's location. As another option, instead of or as well as searching a database, a network, such as the Internet, may be searched using an Internet search engine to obtain information about various McDonald's locations. With a search engine, it may not be necessary for a provider of the process  set forth in  to maintain their own database of business addresses.","In an embodiment of the present invention, the user may then informed about the locations associated with the entity ascertained to be in proximity to the location of the user. In such an embodiment, the user may be audibly informed via a speech recognition portal (also known as a \u201cvoice portal\u201d or \u201cvortal\u201d) about the locations associated with the entity ascertained to be in proximity to the location of the user. As another option, the user may be informed via an electronic message transmitted utilizing a network about the locations associated with the entity ascertained to be in proximity to the location of the user. The electronic message may be transmitted to a WAP enabled device of the user such as, for example, a WAP enabled wireless telephone or personal digital assistant (PDA).","In another aspect, the utterances representative of the entity may include utterances representative of criteria of the user so that the locations associated with the entity ascertained to be in proximity to the location of the user satisfy the criteria of the user. In such an aspect, the criteria of the user may include for example a location associated with the entity currently holding a sale (or other similar type of event) and\/or a currently open location associated with the entity. Continuing with the illustrative scenario involving McDonald's restaurants, the user may provide (through his or her utterances) the criteria that the restaurant be open for business at the current time (e.g., \u201ctell me where the closest McDonald's that is open right now is located\u201d). Then the database can be searched for information relating to the operating hours of each McDonald's restaurant and then use this information to ascertain which of the currently open McDonald's are in proximity to the user. Thus, based on the criteria, the entity that is physically closest to the location of the user may not be the one that is ascertained to be closest to the user is it fails to meet the user's criteria. In an embodiment of the present invention, directions (such as driving or walking directions) from the location of the user to at least one of the locations associated with the entity ascertained to be in proximity to the location of the user may be generated and delivered to the user.","In another embodiment, communication may be facilitated between the user and at least one of the locations associated with the entity ascertained to be in proximity the location of the user. In a further embodiment, promotions may be offered to the user. For example, once it has been ascertained which location associated with the entity is closest to the location of the user, the user may be prompted as to whether the user would like to contact this location. If the user indicates affirmatively, a call may then automatically be made by the system to connect the user to the location of the entity so that the user can speak with a representative of the entity. An exemplary scenario of this aspect is if the user is looking for the closest restaurant of a restaurant chain and the user desires to make a reservation with that restaurant, the user can use this feature to have a call automatically placed with the restaurant so that the user can make the reservation.","In such an embodiment, the promotions offered to the user may be associated with one or more entities determined to be proximal to the location of the user. Examples of promotions can include: providing a code to the user to disclose to the entity so that the user can take advantage of the promotion. This code can be provided aurally via an electronic message to the user's phone or PDA for example.","In one embodiment, it may also be determined which of the identified locations is closed to the location associated with the user. In a further embodiment, a ranking may be performed on the identified locations of the ascertained to be in proximity to the location associated with the user to rank the identified locations from closest to furthest from the location associated with the user.","The speech recognition system of the present invention may provide a plurality of voice portal applications that can be personalized based on a caller's location, delivered to any device and customized via an open development platform.

Object oriented programming (OOP) has become increasingly used to develop complex applications. As OOP moves toward the mainstream of software design and development, various software solutions require adaptation to make use of the benefits of OOP. A need exists for these principles of OOP to be applied to a messaging interface of an electronic messaging system such that a set of OOP classes and objects for the messaging interface can be provided.","OOP is a process of developing computer software using objects, including the steps of analyzing the problem, designing the system, and constructing the program. An object is a software package that contains both data and a collection of related structures and procedures. Since it contains both data and a collection of structures and procedures, it can be visualized as a self-sufficient component that does not require other additional structures, procedures or data to perform its specific task. OOP, therefore, views a computer program as a collection of largely autonomous components, called objects, each of which is responsible for a specific task. This concept of packaging data, structures, and procedures together in one component or module is called encapsulation.","In general, OOP components are reusable software modules which present an interface that conforms to an object model and which are accessed at run-time through a component integration architecture. A component integration architecture is a set of architecture mechanisms which allow software modules in different process spaces to utilize each others capabilities or functions. This is generally done by assuming a common component object model on which to build the architecture. It is worthwhile to differentiate between an object and a class of objects at this point. An object is a single instance of the class of objects, which is often just called a class. A class of objects can be viewed as a blueprint, from which many objects can be formed.","OOP allows the programmer to create an object that is a part of another object. For example, the object representing a piston engine is said to have a composition-relationship with the object representing a piston. In reality, a piston engine comprises a piston, valves and many other components; the fact that a piston is an element of a piston engine can be logically and semantically represented in OOP by two objects.","OOP also allows creation of an object that \u201cdepends from\u201d another object. If there are two objects, one representing a piston engine and the other representing a piston engine wherein the piston is made of ceramic, then the relationship between the two objects is not that of composition. A ceramic piston engine does not make up a piston engine. Rather it is merely one kind of piston engine that has one more limitation than the piston engine; its piston is made of ceramic. In this case, the object representing the ceramic piston engine is called a derived object, and it inherits all of the aspects of the object representing the piston engine and adds further limitation or detail to it. The object representing the ceramic piston engine \u201cdepends from\u201d the object representing the piston engine. The relationship between these objects is called inheritance.","When the object or class representing the ceramic piston engine inherits all of the aspects of the objects representing the piston engine, it inherits the thermal characteristics of a standard piston defined in the piston engine class. However, the ceramic piston engine object overrides these ceramic specific thermal characteristics, which are typically different from those associated with a metal piston. It skips over the original and uses new functions related to ceramic pistons. Different kinds of piston engines have different characteristics, but may have the same underlying functions associated with it (e.g., how many pistons in the engine, ignition sequences, lubrication, etc.). To access each of these functions in any piston engine object, a programmer would call the same functions with the same names, but each type of piston engine may have different\/overriding implementations of functions behind the same name. This ability to hide different implementations of a function behind the same name is called polymorphism and it greatly simplifies communication among objects.","With the concepts of composition-relationship, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, an object can represent just about anything in the real world. In fact, one's logical perception of the reality is the only limit on determining the kinds of things that can become objects in object-oriented software. Some typical categories are as follows:\n\n","With this enormous capability of an object to represent just about any logically separable matters, OOP allows the software developer to design and implement a computer program that is a model of some aspects of reality, whether that reality is a physical entity, a process, a system, or a composition of matter. Since the object can represent anything, the software developer can create an object which can be used as a component in a larger software project in the future.","If 90% of a new OOP software program consists of proven, existing components made from preexisting reusable objects, then only the remaining 10% of the new software project has to be written and tested from scratch. Since 90% already came from an inventory of extensively tested reusable objects, the potential domain from which an error could originate is 10% of the program. As a result, OOP enables software developers to build objects out of other, previously built objects.","This process closely resembles complex machinery being built out of assemblies and sub-assemblies. OOP technology, therefore, makes software engineering more like hardware engineering in that software is built from existing components, which are available to the developer as objects. All this adds up to an improved quality of the software as well as an increased speed of its development.","Programming languages are beginning to fully support the OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and composition-relationship. With the advent of the C++ language, many commercial software developers have embraced OOP. C++ is an OOP language that offers a fast, machine-executable code. Furthermore, C++ is suitable for both commercial-application and systems-programming projects. For now, C++ appears to be the most popular choice among many OOP programmers, but there is a host of other OOP languages, such as Smalltalk, Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), and Eiffel. Additionally, OOP capabilities are being added to more traditional popular computer programming languages such as Pascal.","The benefits of object classes can be summarized, as follows:\n\n","Polymorphism and multiple inheritance make it possible for different programmers to mix and match characteristics of many different classes and create specialized objects that can still work with related objects in predictable ways.\n\n","Class libraries are very flexible. As programs grow more complex, more programmers are forced to reinvent basic solutions to basic problems over and over again. A relatively new extension of the class library concept is to have a framework of class libraries. This framework is more complex and consists of significant collections of collaborating classes that capture both the small scale patterns and major mechanisms that implement the common requirements and design in a specific application domain. They were first developed to free application programmers from the chores involved in displaying menus, windows, dialog boxes, and other standard user interface elements for personal computers.","Frameworks also represent a change in the way programmers think about the interaction between the code they write and code written by others. In the early days of procedural programming, the programmer called libraries provided by the operating system to perform certain tasks, but basically the program executed down the page from start to finish, and the programmer was solely responsible for the flow of control. This was appropriate for printing out paychecks, calculating a mathematical table, or solving other problems with a program that executed in just one way.","The development of graphical user interfaces began to turn this procedural programming arrangement inside out. These interfaces allow the user, rather than program logic, to drive the program and decide when certain actions should be performed. Today, most personal computer software accomplishes this by means of an event loop which monitors the mouse, keyboard, and other sources of external events and calls the appropriate parts of the programmer's code according to actions that the user performs. The programmer no longer determines the order in which events occur. Instead, a program is divided into separate pieces that are called at unpredictable times and in an unpredictable order. By relinquishing control in this way to users, the developer creates a program that is much easier to use. Nevertheless, individual pieces of the program written by the developer still call libraries provided by the operating system to accomplish certain tasks, and the programmer must still determine the flow of control within each piece after it's called by the event loop. Application code still \u201csits on top of\u201d the system.","Even event loop programs require programmers to write a lot of code that should not need to be written separately for every application. The concept of an application framework carries the event loop concept further. Instead of dealing with all the nuts and bolts of constructing basic menus, windows, and dialog boxes and then making these things all work together, programmers using application frameworks start with working application code and basic user interface elements in place. Subsequently, they build from there by replacing some of the generic capabilities of the framework with the specific capabilities of the intended application.","Application frameworks reduce the total amount of code that a programmer has to write from scratch. However, because the framework is really a generic application that displays windows, supports copy and paste, and so on, the programmer can also relinquish control to a greater degree than event loop programs permit. The framework code takes care of almost all event handling and flow of control, and the programmer's code is called only when the framework needs it (e.g., to create or manipulate a proprietary data structure).","A programmer writing a framework program not only relinquishes control to the user (as is also true for event loop programs), but also relinquishes the detailed flow of control within the program to the framework. This approach allows the creation of more complex systems that work together in interesting ways, as opposed to isolated programs, having custom code, being created over and over again for similar problems.","Thus, as is explained above, a framework basically is a collection of cooperating classes that make up a reusable design solution for a given problem domain. It typically includes objects that provide default behavior (e.g., for menus and windows), and programmers use it by inheriting some of that default behavior and overriding other behavior so that the framework calls application code at the appropriate times.","There are three main differences between frameworks and class libraries:\n\n","Thus, through the development of frameworks for solutions to various problems and programming tasks, significant reductions in the design and development effort for software can be achieved. A preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to implement documents on the Internet together with a general-purpose secure communication protocol for a transport medium between the client and the server. HTTP or other protocols could be readily substituted for HTML without undue experimentation. Information on these products is available in T. Berners Lee, D. Connoly, \u201cRFC 1866: Hypertext Markup Language \u20142.0\u201d (November 1995); and R. Fielding, H, Frystyk, T. Berners-Lee, J. Gettys and J. C. Mogul, \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol\u2014HTTP\/1.1: HTTP Working Group Internet Draft\u201d (May 2, 1996). HTML is a simple data format used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains. HTML has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879; 1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).","To date, Web development tools have been limited in their ability to create dynamic Web applications which span from client to server and interoperate with existing computing resources. Until recently, HTML has been the dominant technology used in development of Web-based solutions. However, HTML has proven to be inadequate in the following areas:\n\n","Sun Microsystems's Java language solves many of the client-side problems by:\n\n","With Java, developers can create robust User Interface (UI) components. Custom \u201cwidgets\u201d (e.g., real-time stock tickers, animated icons, etc.) can be created, and client-side performance is improved. Unlike HTML, Java supports the notion of client-side validation, offloading appropriate processing onto the client for improved performance. Dynamic, real-time Web pages can be created. Using the above-mentioned custom UI components, dynamic Web pages can also be created.","Sun's Java language has emerged as an industry-recognized language for \u201cprogramming the Internet.\u201d Sun defines Java as: \u201ca simple, object-oriented, distributed, interpreted, robust, secure, architecture-neutral, portable, high-performance, multithreaded, dynamic, buzzword-compliant, general-purpose programming language. Java supports programming for the Internet in the form of platform-independent Java applets.\u201d Java applets are small, specialized applications that comply with Sun's Java Application Programming Interface (API) allowing developers to add \u201cinteractive content\u201d to Web documents (e.g., simple animations, page adornments, basic games, etc.). Applets execute within a Java-compatible browser (e.g., Netscape Navigator) by copying code from the server to client. From a language standpoint, Java's core feature set is based on C++. Sun's Java literature states that Java is basically, \u201cC++ with extensions from Objective C for more dynamic method resolution.\u201d","Another technology that provides similar function to JAVA is provided by Microsoft and ActiveX Technologies, to give developers and Web designers wherewithal to build dynamic content for the Internet and personal computers. ActiveX includes tools for developing animation, 3-D virtual reality, video and other multimedia content. The tools use Internet standards, work on multiple platforms, and are being supported by over 100 companies. The group's building blocks are called ActiveX Controls, small, fast components that enable developers to embed parts of software in hypertext markup language (HTML) pages. ActiveX Controls work with a variety of programming languages including Microsoft Visual C++, Borland Delphi, Microsoft Visual Basic programming system and, in the future, Microsoft's development tool for Java, code named \u201cJakarta.\u201dActiveX Technologies also includes ActiveX Server Framework, allowing developers to create server applications. One of ordinary skill in the art readily recognizes that ActiveX could be substituted for JAVA without undue experimentation to practice the invention.","Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) is a basic communication language or protocol of the Internet. It can also be used as a communications protocol in the private networks called intranet and in extranet. When you are set up with direct access to the Internet, your computer is provided with a copy of the TCP\/IP program just as every other computer that you may send messages to or get information from also has a copy of TCP\/IP.","TCP\/IP is a two-layering program. The higher layer, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), manages the assembling of a message or file into smaller packet that are transmitted over the Internet and received by a TCP layer that reassembles the packets into the original message. The lower layer, Internet Protocol (IP), handles the address part of each packet so that it gets to the right destination. Each gateway computer on the network checks this address to see where to forward the message. Even though some packets from the same message are routed differently than others, they'll be reassembled at the destination.","TCP\/IP uses a client\/server model of communication in which a computer user (a client) requests and is provided a service (such as sending a Web page) by another computer (a server) in the network. TCP\/IP communication is primarily point-to-point, meaning each communication is from one point (or host computer) in the network to another point or host computer. TCP\/IP and the higher-level applications that use it are collectively said to be \u201cstateless\u201dbecause each client request is considered a new request unrelated to any previous one (unlike ordinary phone conversations that require a dedicated connection for the call duration). Being stateless frees network paths so that everyone can use them continuously. (Note that the TCP layer itself is not stateless as far as any one message is concerned. Its connection remains in place until all packets in a message have been received.).","Many Internet users are familiar with the even higher layer application protocols that use TCP\/IP to get to the Internet. These include the World Wide Web's Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Telnet which lets you logon to remote computers, and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). These and other protocols are often packaged together with TCP\/IP as a \u201csuite.\u201d","Personal computer users usually get to the Internet through the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) or the Point-to-Point Protocol. These protocols encapsulate the IP packets so that they can be sent over a dial-up phone connection to an access provider's modem.","Protocols related to TCP\/IP include the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is used instead of TCP for special purposes. Other protocols are used by network host computers for exchanging router information. These include the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), the Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP), and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).","Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX)is a networking protocol from Novell that interconnects networks that use Novell's NetWare clients and servers. IPX is a datagram or packet protocol. IPX works at the network layer of communication protocols and is connectionless (that is, it doesn't require that a connection be maintained during an exchange of packets as, for example, a regular voice phone call does).","Packet acknowledgment is managed by another Novell protocol, the Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX). Other related Novell NetWare protocols are: the Routing Information Protocol (RIP), the Service Advertising Protocol (SAP), and the NetWare Link Services Protocol (NLSP).","A virtual private network (VPN) is a private data network that makes use of the public telecommunication infrastructure, maintaining privacy through the use of a tunneling protocol and security procedures. A virtual private network can be contrasted with a system of owned or leased lines that can only be used by one company. The idea of the VPN is to give the company the same capabilities at much lower cost by using the shared public infrastructure rather than a private one. Phone companies have provided secure shared resources for voice messages. A virtual private network makes it possible to have the same secure sharing of public resources for data.","Using a virtual private network involves encryption data before sending it through the public network and decrypting it at the receiving end. An additional level of security involves encrypting not only the data but also the originating and receiving network addresses. Microsoft, 3Com, and several other companies have developed the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPP) and Microsoft has extended Windows NT to support it. VPN software is typically installed as part of a company's firewall server.","Wireless refers to a communications, monitoring, or control system in which electromagnetic radiation spectrum or acoustic waves carry a signal through atmospheric space rather than along a wire. In most wireless systems, radio frequency (RF) or infrared transmission (IR) waves are used. Some monitoring devices, such as intrusion alarms, employ acoustic waves at frequencies above the range of human hearing.","Early experimenters in electromagnetic physics dreamed of building a so-called wireless telegraph. The first wireless telegraph transmitters went on the air in the early years of the 20th century. Later, as amplitude modulation (AM) made it possible to transmit voices and music via wireless, the medium came to be called radio. With the advent of television, fax, data communication, and the effective use of a larger portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, the original term has been brought to life again.","Common examples of wireless equipment in use today include the Global Positioning System, cellular telephone phones and pagers, cordless computer accessories (for example, the cordless mouse), home-entertainment-system control boxes, remote garage-door openers, two-way radios, and baby monitors. An increasing number of companies and organizations are using wireless LAN. Wireless transceivers are available for connection to portable and notebook computers, allowing Internet access in selected cities without the need to locate a telephone jack. Eventually, it will be possible to link any computer to the Internet via satellite, no matter where in the world the computer might be located.","Bluetooth is a computing and telecommunications industry specification that describes how mobile phones, computers, and personal digital assistants (PDA's) can easily interconnect with each other and with home and business phones and computers using a short-range wireless connection. Each device is equipped with a microchip transceiver that transmits and receives in a previously unused frequency band of 2.45 GHz that is available globally (with some variation of bandwidth in different countries). In addition to data, up to three voice channels are available. Each device has a unique 48-bit address from the IEEE 802 standard. Connections can be point-to-point or multipoint. The maximum range is 10 meters. Data can be presently be exchanged at a rate of 1 megabit per second (up to 2 Mbps in the second generation of the technology). A frequency hop scheme allows devices to communicate even in areas with a great deal of electromagnetic interference. Built-in encryption and verification is provided.","Encryption is the conversion of data into a form, called a ciphertext, that cannot be easily understood by unauthorized people. Decryption is the process of converting encrypted data back into its original form, so it can be understood.","The use of encryption\/decryption is as old as the art of communication. In wartime, a cipher, often incorrectly called a \u201ccode,\u201d can be employed to keep the enemy from obtaining the contents of transmissions (technically, a code is a means of representing a signal without the intent of keeping it secret; examples are Morse code and ASCII.). Simple ciphers include the substitution of letters for numbers, the rotation of letters in the alphabet, and the \u201cscrambling\u201d of voice signals by inverting the sideband frequencies. More complex ciphers work according to sophisticated computer algorithm that rearrange the data bits in digital signals.","In order to easily recover the contents of an encrypted signal, the correct decryption key is required. The key is an algorithm that \u201cundoes\u201d the work of the encryption algorithm. Alternatively, a computer can be used in an attempt to \u201cbreak\u201d the cipher. The more complex the encryption algorithm, the more difficult it becomes to eavesdrop on the communications without access to the key.","Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) is an Internet encryption and authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman. The RSA algorithm is a commonly used encryption and authentication algorithm and is included as part of the Web browser from Netscape and Microsoft. It's also part of Lotus Notes, Intuit's Quicken, and many other products. The encryption system is owned by RSA Security.","The RSA algorithm involves multiplying two large prime numbers (a prime number is a number divisible only by that number and 1) and through additional operations deriving a set of two numbers that constitutes the public key and another set that is the private key. Once the keys have been developed, the original prime numbers are no longer important and can be discarded. Both the public and the private keys are needed for encryption\/decryption but only the owner of a private key ever needs to know it. Using the RSA system, the private key never needs to be sent across the Internet.","The private key is used to decrypt text that has been encrypted with the public key. Thus, if I send you a message, I can find out your public key (but not your private key) from a central administrator and encrypt a message to you using your public key. When you receive it, you decrypt it with your private key. In addition to encrypting messages (which ensures privacy), you can authenticate yourself to me (so I know that it is really you who sent the message) by using your private key to encrypt a digital certificate. When I receive it, I can use your public key to decrypt it.","SMS (Short Message Service) is a service for sending messages of up to 160 characters to mobile phones that use Global System for Mobile (GSM) communication. GSM and SMS service is primarily available in Europe. SMS is similar to paging. However, SMS messages do not require the mobile phone to be active and within range and will be held for a number of days until the phone is active and within range. SMS messages are transmitted within the same cell or to anyone with roaming service capability. They can also be sent to digital phones from a Web site equipped with PC Link or from one digital phone to another.","On the public switched telephone network (PSTN), Signaling System 7 (SS7) is a system that puts the information required to set up and manage telephone calls in a separate network rather than within the same network that the telephone call is made on. Signaling information is in the form of digital packet. SS7 uses what is called out of band signaling, meaning that signaling (control) information travels on a separate, dedicated 56 or 64 Kbps channel rather than within the same channel as the telephone call. Historically, the signaling for a telephone call has used the same voice circuit that the telephone call traveled on (this is known as in band signaling). Using SS7, telephone calls can be set up more efficiently and with greater security. Special services such as call forwarding and wireless roaming service are easier to add and manage. SS7 is now an international telecommunications standard.","Speech or voice recognition is the ability of a machine or program to recognize and carry out voice commands or take dictation. In general, speech recognition involves the ability to match a voice pattern against a provided or acquired vocabulary. Usually, a limited vocabulary is provided with a product and the user can record additional words. More sophisticated software has the ability to accept natural speech (meaning speech as we usually speak it rather than carefully-spoken speech).","A tag is a generic term for a language element descriptor. The set of tags for a document or other unit of information is sometimes referred to as markup, a term that dates to pre-computer days when writers and copy editors marked up document elements with copy editing symbols or shorthand.","An Internet search engine typically has three parts: 1) a spider (also called a \u201ccrawler\u201d or a \u201cbot\u201d) that goes to every page or representative pages on every Web site that wants to be searchable and reads it, using hypertext links on each page to discover and read a site's other pages; 2) a program that creates a huge index (sometimes called a \u201ccatalog\u201d) from the pages that have been read; and 3) a program that receives your search request, compares it to the entries in the index, and returns results to you.","An alternative to using a search engine is to explore a structured directory of topics. Yahoo, which also lets you use its search engine, is a widely-used directory on the Web. A number of Web portal sites offer both the search engine and directory approaches to finding information.","Different Search Engine Approaches\u2014Major search engines such as Yahoo, AltaVista, Lycos, and Google index the content of a large portion of the Web and provide results that can run for pages\u2014and consequently overwhelm the user. Specialized content search engines are selective about what part of the Web is crawled and indexed. For example, TechTarget sites for products such as the AS\/400 (http:\/\/www.search400.com) and Windows NT (http:\/\/www.searchnt.com) selectively index only the best sites about these products and provide a shorter but more focused list of results. Ask Jeeves (http:\/\/www.askjeeves.com) provides a general search of the Web but allows you to enter a search request in natural language, such as \u201cWhat's the weather in Seattle today?\u201d Special tools such as WebFerret (from http:H\/www.softferret.com) let you use a number of search engines at the same time and compile results for you in a single list. Individual Web sites, especially larger corporate sites, may use a search engine to index and retrieve the content of just their own site. Some of the major search engine companies license or sell their search engines for use on individual sites.","Major search engines on the Web include: AltaVista (http:\/\/www.altavista.com), Excite (http:\/\/www.excite.com), Google (http:\/\/www.google.com), Hotbot (http:\/\/www.hotbot.com), Infoseek (http:\/\/www.infoseek.com), Lycos (http:\/\/www.lycos.com), and WebCrawler (http:\/\/www.webcrawler.com). Most if not all of the major search engines attempt to index a representative portion of the entire content of the World Wide Web, using various criteria for determining which are the most important sites to crawl and index. Most search engines also accept submissions from Web site owners. Once a site's pages have been indexed, the search engine will return periodically to the site to update the index. Some search engines give special weighting to: words in the title, in subject descriptions and keywords listed in HTML META tags, to the first words on a page, and to the frequent recurrence (up to a limit) of a word on a page. Because each of the search engines uses a somewhat different indexing and retrieval scheme (which is likely to be treated as proprietary information) and because each search engine can change its scheme at any time, we haven't tried to describe these here.","While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation.
