Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to the utilization of a telephony device to trigger a given event. More specifically, the present invention relates to a system and method for utilizing the information exchanged during the initialization of a telephony connection request to effectuate the execution of a desired task.","2. Description of the Prior Art","Many telecommunication networks were originally built to transmit voice traffic from a first fixed point to a second fixed point. Advances in technology now provide users the ability to utilize telecommunication networks to transmit voice, data, and video from one mobile device to one or more mobile devices.","Despite these advances, most users continue to pay usage charges for many functions performed using a telephony device. Whether it be a per minute connection charge or a flat rate unlimited data fee, most users pay fees to perform nearly all functions of the modern telecommunication network. However, in order for a telephony connection to be initiated a small amount of data must be transmitted from the originating source to the destination. This information, in the form of a call request, is often transmitted by a telephone service provider free of charge. This call request often comprises information such as the originating telephony device identification and destination node identification.","Despite the fact that most telephone service providers transmit call request information without subjecting users to traditional usage charge, the prior art lacks a method and system for utilizing this call request information in order to provide enhanced functionality to telephony users.","The present invention relates to a system and method for utilizing the information exchanged during the initiation phase of a conventional telephone connection request in order to identify and provide users with enhanced services. According to an embodiment of the present invention, a content delivery system and methods are enabled to receive a connection request from a telephony device. As with a conventionally placed telephone call, the connection request includes information that identifies the user and\/or telephony device, that placed the phone call (the originating number) and the dialed phone number the signaling number).","During the initiation phase (i.e., the period wherein the connection request is transmitted by the telephony device and prior to establishment of the requested connection), the content delivery system extracts information related to the connection request, and \u201crejects\u201d the connection request (i.e., actively rejects the connection request or passively allows the telephony device to cancel the request). As a result, no connection is established.","The extracted information (i.e., the originating number, the signaling number, or both) is associated with and identifies one or more tasks to be executed (the desired task(s)). The content delivery system utilizes the connection request information to identify the one or more desired tasks and delivers content associated with the desired task(s) to the user.","According to embodiments of the present invention, the connection request transmitted by the telephony device operates as a request for the execution of a desired task. Advantageously, by extracting the connection request information and terminating\/rejecting the connection request during the initiation phase of the call (i.e., prior to completion of the call), no usage charge is assessed to the account of the initiating telephony device. In this regard, the user may dial a particular signaling number in order to submit a request for the completion of a desired task, the connection request is terminated\/rejected, the desired task is identified and the content associated with the desired task is delivered to the user according to one or more delivery methods of the present invention (i.e., an electronic mail, a post office mailing, a web posting, a telephonic communication, a short message service (SMS) message, a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) push, etc.).","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the methods and systems allow a user to leverage the \u201cfree\u201d or \u201cno cost\u201d portion associated with a conventional request to establish a telephone connection (i.e., the initiation phase during which a call is placed but terminated prior to completion) by providing the user with the ability to submit a request for the execution of a desired task. In response to the submission of the desired task request, the systems and methods of the present invention provide the user with the content associated with the desired task.","It is to be understood that the attached drawings are for purposes of illustrating the concepts of the invention and may not be to scale.","The present invention relates to a method and a system for delivering content to or on behalf of a user of a telephony device (herein referred to as the Content Delivery System ). The \u201cuser\u201d includes any person, system, machine, computer, and\/or network that utilizes and\/or causes a telephony device to access, connect to, communicate with, and\/or interact with the content delivery system of the present invention. The \u201cTelephony Device\u201d includes any communications device, machine, system, computer, etc., configured to initiate and\/or establish a telephone connection via a conventional telecommunications network. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the telephony device may be a wireless communications device or a wired communications device (i.e., a land-line unit). Exemplary telephony devices suitable for use in accordance with the present invention include, but are not limited to, a conventional land-line telephone and mobile phone (i.e., a cell phone) One having ordinary skill in the art will further appreciate that the telecommunications network may be a wireless network, a wired network, a Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) network, or a combination thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102"]},"The Content Delivery System  is a computer-based system, accessible by one or more Telephony Devices , which includes but is not limited to the following components: a Connection Request Information Extraction Module (CRIEM) , a Connection Rejection Module (CRM) , a Desired Task identification Module (DTIM) , and a Delivery Module (DM) . The term \u201ccomputer\u201d or \u201ccomputing device\u201d is intended to include any data processing device, such as a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a mainframe computer, a personal digital assistant, a server, a handheld device, or any other device able to process data.","One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the components of the Content Delivery System  may be located on a single computer, as shown in , or on more than one communicatively connected computers. Furthermore, each of the components of the Content Delivery System  may be comprised of one or more computer-executable software application(s) in combination with one or more computing devices. The term \u201ccommunicatively connected\u201d is intended to include any type of connection, whether wired or wireless, in which data may be communicated. The term \u201ccommunicatively connected\u201d is intended to include a connection between devices and\/or programs within a single computer or between devices and\/or programs on separate computers.","Although  illustrates the components of the Content Delivery System  as separate modules, one having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the modules (-) may be combined and\/or integrated on one or more devices.","The Content Delivery System  and modules - thereof are described herein with reference . According to an embodiment of the present invention, a user seeking the performance of a \u201cdesired task\u201d utilizes a Telephony Device  to generate a \u201cconnection request\u201d . The term \u201cdesired task\u201d is intended to include, but is not limited to, one or more jobs, events, requests for information, operations, and activities that the user wishes to have performed, executed, implemented, or acted on. The performance of the desired task results in the delivery of content to or on behalf of the user, as described in detail below. Exemplary desired tasks include, but are not limited to: 1) the request for the return of any information, such as flight status or sports scores; 2) the placement of a purchase order; 3) the initiation of an interactive game; 4) the activation of a system (e.g., a security system or operation of an automatic garage door system); and 5) the updating of data in a database or on a Website; etc.","The term \u201cconnection request\u201d is intended to include, but is not limited to, a request to establish a telephone connection with a destination resource (i.e., a destination telephony device). The connection request  transmitted by the Telephony Device  comprises \u201cconnection request information\u201d, including but not limited to, an \u201coriginating number\u201d and a \u201csignaling number.\u201d The term \u201coriginating number\u201d is intended to include, but is not limited to, a telephone number associated with and capable of identifying the telephony device and\/or the user that submitted the connection request . The term \u201csignaling number\u201d is intended to include, but is not limited to a telephone number associated with and capable of identifying one or more desired tasks.","One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the originating numbers and the signaling numbers may be comprised of any arrangement of numeric, alphabet characters, and\/or symbols (e.g., # and *) suitable for use in a conventional telephone communications network.","As shown in , in step , the connection request  is transmitted by the Telephony Device  and received by the Connection Request Information Extraction Module . In step , the Connection Request information Extraction Module  extracts at least a portion of the connection request information from the connection request. The extracted connection request information, which may be all or a portion of the connection request information, is communicated by the Connection Request Information Extraction Module  to the Desired Task identification Module  for performance of step , described below. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the extracted information may be provided directly to the Desired Task identification Module  or via the Connection Rejection Module , as shown in .","One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the Connection Request Information Extraction Module  may be configured to perform the extraction according to known methods and systems suitable for use in accordance with the present invention, including but not limited to the use of an Automatic Number Identification method\/system (ANI) (i.e., for extraction of the originating number) and\/or a Dialed Number identification Service (DNIS) for extraction of the signaling number).","In step , the Connection Rejection Module  receives and \u201crejects\u201d the connection request . One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the connection request  may be rejected according to any suitable method and\/or system known in the art. For example, if the Connection Rejection Module  is executing a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), the Connection Rejection Module  may reject the connection request  by transmitting a BUSY message through the use of SIP. Alternatively, the Connection Rejection Module  may passively reject the connection request  by simply not seizing or recognizing the connection request . By not seizing the connection request , the user may be presented with continuous \u201cringing,\u201d thereby providing the user with a cue that the connection will not be connected. Accordingly, the user may take the necessary steps to terminate the connection request .","By rejecting the connection request , the Connection Rejection Module  terminates the call initiated by the Telephony Device . As a result, no telephone connection is established between the originating number (the Telephony Device ) and the signaling number. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that step  and step  may be performed in any order relative to one another, and may be performed in series or in parallel with one another.","The time period from transmission of the connection request by the telephony device (i.e., placement of the call) to rejection of request in step  is referred to as the \u201cinitiation phase\u201d of the call. Advantageously, in conventional telephone systems, telephone service providers typically provide the initiation phase of a call at no charge. This \u201cfree\u201d period is leveraged by the systems and methods of the present invention, in that a request for the execution of a desired task may be submitted by a user free of charge. Accordingly, given that the connection request  is rejected prior to establishment of the call, in most cases, the Telephony Device  that initiated the connection request is not charged a usage fee for submitting the desired task.","Following, or in parallel with, the rejection of the call request at step , the identity of the desired task is determined by the Desired Task Identification Module , at step . The Desired Task Identification Module  identifies the desired task based the extracted connection request information. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the Desired Task Identification Module  is communicatively connected to a database configured to store information relating to the identity of a desired task, such as, for example, a plurality of \u201cprofiles\u201d and \u201cassociations\u201d, described below.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a \u201cprofile\u201d may be established and stored in the database which links one or more desired tasks to a particular user and\/or Telephony Device . An \u201cassociation\u201d may be established and stored in the database which links or relates one or more desired tasks to an originating number, a signaling number, and\/or a combination of both.","For example, a user, referred to as John Doe, may establish a \u201cprofile\u201d which provides that when he submits a connection request from either of his Telephony Devices : 1) his mobile phone (originating number (123 555-1234) and\/or 2) his home phone (originating number 123-555-1234) to any of the signaling numbers associated with the Content Delivery System  of the present invention, he wishes to have the current price of ten pre-selected stocks (herein the \u201cJohn Doe, portfolio\u201d) sent to him via an electronic mail communication. Upon extraction of originating number 123-555-1234 from a connection request , the Desired Task Identification Module  links said number to the John Doe profile and identifies the desired task associated with that profile (i.e., return the current stock price for the John Doe portfolio).","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the Desired Task identification Module  may be configured to identify the one or more desired tasks through the use of a hash table, or like data structure, wherein the hash table is configured to store profiles, associations, or other information associated with the identity of a desired task.","With reference to Table 1 below, the following section provides a number of examples of the identification of the desired task based on the extracted connect request information. In these examples, the originating number and the signaling number are expressed according to the following standard convention: (Area. Code) Prefix-Line Number. As shown in Table 1, three separate connection requests (Connection Request Nos. 1-3) are received by the Connection Request. Information Extraction Module  of the present invention. For Connection Request No. 1, the Connection Request Information Extraction Module  extracts the time of the call [3:00:00], the originating number [(999) 555-1234)] and the signaling number [(999) 555-4321)]. Using the extracted information, the Connection Request Information Extraction Module  queries the database, determines the associations related to the combination of the extracted originating number and the extracted signaling number, and identifies the desired task(s) (i.e., return of the current time and temperature in Newark, N.J.).","In the second example, the Connection Request Information Extraction Module  extracts the time of the call (3:00:30) and the signaling number [(999) ABC-4444)]. In this example, the signaling number [(999) ABC-4444] is associated with a particular desired task, which enables the Desired Task Identification Module  to determine that the user is seeking the current flight status of ABC Airline Flight Number 4444. As demonstrated by this example, the numbers comprising the signaling number may be selected in a manner in which the numbers themselves have a logical relationship to the underlying task. As shown here, the \u201cprefix\u201d portion of the signaling number \u201cABC\u201d represents the name of the airline and the \u201cline number\u201d portion of the signaling number represents the flight number.","In the third example, the Connection Request Information Extraction Module  extracts the tune of the call (3:01 00) the originating number [(900) 555-7777] and the signaling number [(999) 555 8888]. In this example, the Desired Task identification Module  identifies a profile related to the originating number, wherein the profile indicates that a connection request transmitted with this particular originating number to this particular signaling number relates to a desired task defined as the return of the current sports scores for all professional teams within a certain geographic radius of the territory covered by area code \u201c900\u201d. Advantageously, the profile may be pre-established by a user to define any number and type of desired tasks to be triggered by the one or more originating numbers controlled by that user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Extracted Connection Request",{}]},{"entry":[{},"Information"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Connection","Time of","Originating","Signaling",{}]},{"entry":["Request No.","Call","Number","Number","Desired Task(s)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["1","03:00:00","(999) 555-1234","(999) 555-4321","Return current time and"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"temperature in Newark,"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"New Jersey"]},{"entry":["2","03:00:30","N\/A","(999) ABC-4444","Return current status of"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"ABC Airlines Flight"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"4444"]},{"entry":["3","03:01:00","(900) 555-7777","(999) 555-8888","Return sports score"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"update for most local"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"sports team in"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"geographic proximity to"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"area code (900)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Following identification of the one or more desired tasks, in step , the Delivery Module  generates, retrieves, obtains, accesses, and\/or determines the \u201ccontent\u201d  associated with the desired task and delivers the content  to the user. The \u201ccontent\u201d may include, but is not limited to, any information that is associated with the desired task. With reference to the first example described above in regard to Table 1, the content associated with the desired task is the temperature reading for Newark, N.J. at the time and date the connection request is received.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the Delivery Module  may be communicatively connected to one or more Resources  configured to store, generate, serve, transmit, supply or provide the content  associated with the desired task to the Delivery Module . Exemplary Resources  suitable for use in accordance with the present invention include any known provider of information (both electronic-based and otherwise), such as, websites, databases, computer-readable media, books, etc. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the Delivery Module  may deliver the content  to the user in any suitable method, modes, systems, or processes of communications, including but not limited to, electronic mail, web-based posting or other web-based communication (collectively, an \u201cInternet-based communication\u201d), a short message service (SMS) communication, a text message communication, a postal mail communication, personal delivery, and a return telephone communication. It is further noted that the content  need not necessarily be delivered to the Telephony Device  from which the connection request  originated. Instead, the content  may be delivered directly to: 1) the user (e.g., the delivery of a food (the content) to the user's home address); 2) any device other than the Telephony Device  that transmitted the connection request , including a device associated, with the user the user's electronic mail address); and for 3) a deuce associated with another user (e.g., a phone of a \u201cbuddy\u201d of the ser). Delivery locations such as the user's address information, associated device information, and the user's \u201cbuddy\u201d information may be stored as part of the user's profile.","With reference to the second example described above in regard to Table 1, the Delivery Module  may contact the ABC airline website (the Resource ) and deliver the status of flight 4444 to the user's telephony device  via a short message service (SMS) message.","The Delivery Module  may deliver the content  via a \u201cfree\u201d service, such as the transmission of a communication (e.g., an electronic mail communication, a conventional postal mail communication, or a telephonic communication), or a paid service, such as transmitting a SMS communication, where a telephone service providers charges for the transmission of the SMS message. Additional desired task may include, but are not limited to, requests for information from a remote data network (e.g., flight status, stock quote, sports score), initiation of an interactive game, or placement of a purchase order. It is important to note that even though the triggering of a desired task may be free, a use may still be charged fees for delivery of the associated content. For example, a telephony device may call a signaling number that triggers the desired task of receiving an SMS message that contains the local weather. In this example, a telephony device that is charged for each SMS message received will be charged a fee as a result of the desired task. In contrast, a telephony device may call a signaling number that triggers the desired task of receiving an e-mail that contains the local weather. In this example, the act of receiving the e-mail containing the local weather does not result in the accrual of a fee.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the desired task and\/or associated content may be location-specific, such that the physical location of the Telephony Device  initiating the connection request  is considered in defining the task and or content Location-specific services ma be provided by adding, integrating, incorporating, or including Global Positioning System (GPS) or other positioning information into the connection request information. For example, the current location of the Telephony Device  (i.e., location information) may be determined by a GPS-based application operating on the Telephony Device  and added to the connection request information. Alternately, the location information may be obtained from a Resource  by using connection request information. The location information may be extracted and used to identify the desired task and related content. For example, a Telephony Device  located in Newark, N.J. may initiate a connection request to a signaling number of (999-555-5555), which is associated with the general task of \u201creturning the local weather,\u201d Next, the Desired Task identification Module  may examine the location information to determine the location for which the weather information is desired. Alternatively, the location of the user and\/or Telephony Device  may be encoded as part of the originating number and\/or the signaling number.","The Content Delivery System  of the present invention may include computer-based application\/programs (i.e., software), hardware components, and\/or a combination of both, configured to operate on a server residing in a telecommunications network. The Content Delivery System  may be established, in whole or in part, on a network node of the telecommunications network, such as, for example, a server, which may be associated with a telephone service provider.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the Content Delivery System  may be configured to receive multiple connection requests  from numerous different origins, including any number of different telephone networks. Furthermore, the Content Delivery System  may be configured to receive connection requests  from traditional telephone networks (wired and wireless) as well as VOIP networks.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the Content Delivery System  may be configured as a network node communicatively connected to a portion of an existing telephone network (herein, a telephone network computer). The Content Delivery System  may direct and\/or control the operation and functionality of the telephone network computer and provide the telephone network computer with guidelines, instructions, and commands concerning incoming connection requests . This information may include the destination for which a connection request  should be transferred, as a well the way in which such information is transferred. For example, the Content Delivery System  may instruct the telephone network computer to transmit certain connection requests  to the Content Delivery System  for further processing, or instruct the telephone network computer to transfer, reject\/drop, or connect a connection request. Communication with and configuration of the telephone network computer may be performed through a web-based interface or via another computer in the telecommunications network.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the Content Delivery System  may be configured to deliver particular content based solely on the signaling number, in a manner which is independent of the originating number. For example, the methods and systems of the present invention may be configured to dispatch an SMS message containing the current stock price of Google in response to every connection request received including a particular signaling number.","As discussed above, the Content Delivery System  may be implemented as a software program, application, or applet operating on the Telephony Device . The Telephony Device  may include a graphical user interface (GUI) whereby a user may initiate a connection request via an interaction with the GUI (i.e., \u201cclicking\u201d a button on the GUI to input a command). The GUI and associated \u201clinks\u201d may be associated with signaling numbers according to the present invention such that an interaction with the GUI results in the transmission of one or more connection requests  including a signaling number. According to this embodiment, the user of the Telephony Device  does not need to \u201cdial\u201d a signaling number, but instead may use the GUI to effectuate the initiation of a connection request for processing by the Content Delivery System . Advantageously, the GUI presents the user with information to allow the user to select a desired task, without the user having to determine the signaling number associated with the desired task.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the Content Delivery System  may upload or download a list of signaling numbers for storage on access by the Telephony Device . The signaling numbers may be stored in the Telephony Device  in any suitable manner, including, but not limited to, by pre-programming by a telephony device manufacturer, a dynamic update or upload from the Content Delivery System , manual input by the user of the Telephony Device .","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the methods and systems of the present invention may be implemented using a combination of \u201cdevice-side\u201d elements and related functionality and \u201cnetwork-side\u201d elements and related functionality, as shown in . The device-side elements comprise a Telephony Device  including a Signaling Client  and a Telephony Device Applet . The network-side elements may be implemented using a single computer or server under the control of a single entity, or a network of computers or servers under the control of multiple entities. The network-side elements comprise a Telephony Server , an Application Server  and a Signaling Server .","One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the embodiments of the content delivery systems and methods described below with reference to  may be implemented and embodied by the modules and functionality of the Content Delivery System  described in conjunction with .","With reference to , as indicated above, the device side (i.e., Telephony Device ) comprising the Signaling Client  and the Telephony Device Applet . The Signaling Client  is a software application\/program which enables functionality of the Content Delivery System . The Signaling Client  may be configured as a passive (i.e., a thin client) or an active or sophisticated device (i.e., a fat client). If the Telephony Device  is a programmable device (e.g. a mobile phone or a programmable SIP phone), the Signaling Client  may be implemented as an application operable on any suitable platform, such as Java ME (Mobile Edition), Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless (BREW), Symbian or Windows Mobile. According to embodiments of the present invention, the Signaling Client  may be installed by the Telephony Device  manufacturer, by the mobile network operator, or by the user through an appropriate provisioning or installation process.","The Signaling Client  may be provided information by network-side entities about the signaling numbers. This information may be pre-configured in the Signaling Client  when it is installed, or it may be a part of a runtime-executable program or application. The signaling numbers may be provided dynamically or periodically updated (either on demand by the Signaling Client  or \u201cpushed\u201d to the Signaling Client  by the one or more network-side entities). Any one or more suitable methods of providing the signaling numbers may be used to the Signaling Client  may be implemented. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that other suitable methods may be used to maintain the set of signaling numbers on the Signaling Client . Preferably, the set of signaling numbers may be maintained in persistent storage (e.g. flash memory) on the Telephony Device  to enable that data to persist in the Telephony Device  even after it is powered down and restarted.","If it is running on a programmable device, the Signaling Client  may interact with the phone network using a telephony Application Programming Interface (API) available in the Telephony Device . The telephony API is provided by the programming environment supported in the Telephony Device \u2014e.g. Java ME (Mobile Edition), Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless (BREW), Symbian or Windows Mobile in mobile phones. The Signaling Client  uses this API to place calls, to be notified of incoming calls, and to cancel calls (both incoming and outgoing). The Signaling Client  may be configured to manipulate, manage, control, and\/or intemperate with the signaling numbers, such that calls to and from other telephone numbers (i.e., non-signaling numbers) are processed according to the normal functionality systems, and processes of the Telephony Device .","According to an embodiment of the present invention, wherein the Telephony Device  is a programmable device, it may comprise a Telephony Device Applet , as shown in . One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that if the Telephony Device  is a non-programmable device, such as an ordinary analog phone, the Telephony Device Applet  is absent. In a programmable device (like a mobile phone or a programmable SIP phone) the Telephony Device Applet  is implemented as an application operating on a suitable platform like Java ME (Mobile Edition, BREW, Symbian or Windows Mobile that is available on Telephony Device .","The Telephony Device Applet  may be installed by the device manufacturer, by the mobile network operator, or by the end user through an appropriate provisioning or installation process. The Telephony Device Applet  may also be implemented as a behavior of the Signaling Client , and may be dynamically installed and activated by the Signaling Client .","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the Telephony Device Applet  may be created by the same administrative authority as the Signaling Client , and use the Signaling Client  for signaling. Multiple Telephony Device Applets  created by independent administrative authorities may run side by side, using the Signaling. Client  for signaling.","The Telephony Device Applet  is responsible for presenting a graphical user interface (GUI) to the user, presenting appropriate data to the user, managing the display etc. The Telephony Device Applet  utilizes the Signaling Client  to send connection requests, e.g., by invoking methods of an API or some equivalent communication method in the device. The Telephony Device Applet  is notified of the arrival of a connection request from the server-side by the Signaling Client  via the invocation of one or more methods of an API or some equivalent communication method in the Telephony Device .","The Telephony Device Applet  is configured to identify the appropriate signaling number associated with a desired task. According to embodiments of the present invention, the signaling number-desired task associations may be pre-configured in the Telephony Device Applet  when it is installed, provided to the Telephony Device Applet  when it starts to run, and\/or provided dynamically or periodically updated (either on demand by the Telephony Device Applet  or pushed to Telephony Device Applet  by one or more network-side entities.","As provided above, the network-side of the content delivery environment of the present invention comprises the Telephony Server , the Application Server  and the Signaling Server . The Telephony Server  comprises a network-side computer-based element that receives the \u201cphysical\u201d telecommunications communications of the methods and systems of the present invention from the conventional telephone network. The Telephony Server  may be physically interconnected to the telephone network (e.g., via a connection involving the termination of an SS7 signaling link), or it may be a \u201clogical\u201d link over an Internet Protocol (IP) or equivalent data network). The Telephony Server  may also be integrated in the systems and methods of the present invention by being implemented inside existing telephony signaling, equipment. The Telephony Server  may be implemented on either the \u201ccalling\u201d or \u201ccalled\u201d side of the telephone network. Furthermore, the Telephony Server  may be implemented by the operator of the signaling service, outside of a phone network. The Telephony Server  may be implemented on a single computer, or equivalently on a collection of computers interconnected by a communication network, e.g. for redundancy, fail-over, fault-tolerance and scaling etc.","The Telephony Server  is configured to place and receive connection requests and calls from multiple telephony devices on the telephone network, and may span multiple phone networks. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the Telephony Server  is implemented as a VOW protocol application server (e.g., a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) application server), a Parlay\/OSA application server, an IN(Intelligent Network)\/WIN(Wireless Intelligent Network) application, or as a server implemented using any other equivalent telecommunications equipment programming API.","The Telephony Server  is configured to receive connection requests for incoming calls directed to at least a portion of the signaling numbers. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the signaling numbers that the Telephony Server  is adapted to receive are provisioned when the Telephony Server  is interconnected to the telephone network to allow the telephone network to appropriately route or deliver such incoming calls to the Telephony Server .","For example, the Signaling Server  administrator may set up an account for the Telephony Server  administrator. The Signaling Server  provides an administrative interface (e.g., a web-based interface) that enables the Telephony Server  administrator to maintain the set of numbers that the Telephony Server  is responsible for (i.e., the signaling numbers). The Telephony Server  administrator uses the interface to add, review, update and delete signaling numbers handled by the Telephony Server . The Telephony Server  administrator may also use the interface to specify how the Signaling Server  communicates with the Telephony Server . For example, the administrator may specify a URL to which the Signaling Server  may send directives for processing by the Telephony Server . One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the Telephony Server  may be configured to support other known methods of communication with the Signaling Server .","The Telephony Server  may be implemented as a single server, or as a collection of servers, optionally within multiple administrative domains. The Telephony Server  may handle incoming calls for all or for only a subset of the signaling numbers. In an exemplary embodiment, the phone network notifies the Telephony Server  of an incoming call. For example, in a SIP implementation, the incoming connection request\/call is noted by the arrival of an INVITE message in the SIP protocol. The Telephony Server  notifies the Signaling Server  of the connection request and provides the Signaling Server  with the connection request information. For example, this may be done by sending an HTTP protocol message to the Signaling Server . The Telephony Server  may use other known methods to notify the Signaling Server  of the connection request.","The Telephony Server  rejects the connection request prior to completion thereof thus incurring no charge to the caller. For example, in a SIP implementation, the Telephony Server  may reject the connection request by sending a BUSY message in the SIP protocol. Other methods of rejecting the call may be implemented, allowing the connection request to continue to ring till it is cancelled by the Telephony Device , or by transferring the connection request to a different server that in turn prevents completion of the call.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the Telephony Server  is configured to transfer incoming connection requests, under directive from the Signaling Server . For example, the Signaling Server  may ask the Telephony Server  to transfer the connection request to a different entity, such as a media server enabled to play an announcement, or present data in audible form. The transfer directive comprises information such as the phone number to transfer the connection request to, and other information that may be useful for the Telephony Server . For example, in a SIP implementation, the Telephony Server  may transfer the connection request by executing a REDIRECT using the SIP protocol, or other like methods for transferring the connection request.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the Telephony Server  is configured to place calls with a called party pursuant to directives received from the Signaling Server . The Telephony Server  may receive the directive from a Signaling Server  as a HTTP protocol message or other suitable method of communication. The directive may comprise the signaling number, the originating number, and related information that may be useful for the Telephony Server . The Telephony Server  is configured to reject any calls that it places, under directives from the Signaling Server . The directive to cancel a call may be delivered along with the directive to place a call (e.g., a request to connect to signaling number 12345 including a directive to reject or terminate the call after 5 seconds if it was not already rejected\/cancelled.)","According to embodiments of the present invention, the network-side of the content delivery environment comprises the Application Server , a computer configured to execute applications according to the content delivery methods and systems of the present invention. The Application Server  may be implemented using standard programming languages, such as, for example, C, Java, PHP, Ruby as configured for a server environment. The Application Server  may interface with one or more Signaling Servers , including those that do not reside in the same administrative domain. For example, the Application Server  may be operated by a weather reporting service, while the Signaling Service  may be operated by a separate signaling service operator. The Application Server  is also configured to communicate with the Telephony Device Applet .","The Signaling Server  is a network-side element configured to receive and process \u201clogical\u201d connection requests, connection request information, and\/or instructions from the Telephony Server , according to the content delivery systems and methods of the present invention. The Signaling Server  processes the connection request information, interacts with the Application Server  to infuse application-specific logic and actions, and\/or if instructed by the Application Server  to do so, the Signaling Server  instructs the Telephony Server  to reject\/place\/transfer\/cancel calls to the Telephony Device  and to deliver content thereto. The Signaling Server  may also be configured to transmit other data (e.g. connection request information such as the signaling number(s), etc.) to the Telephony Device .","The Signaling Server  may be hardware\/software combination implemented using conventional programming\/platforms supported in a typical computer\/server environment, such as C, Java, PHP, Ruby, etc. The Signaling Server  may be communicatively connected to and interface with one or more Telephony Servers , Application Servers , and\/or Signaling Clients  from one or multiple networks or administrative domains. The Signaling Server  tray be implemented on a single physical computer, or on a networked collection of computers to allow for redundancy, fail-over, fault-tolerance and scaling.","The Signaling Server  administrator may be authorized to set up an account for every Telephony Server  and Application Server  administrator to allow the administrators to interact with the content delivery system of the present invention. In so doing, the Signal Server  administrator provides the Telephony Server  and the Application Server administrators with information needed to configure the Telephony Server  and Application Server  to communicate with the Signaling Server , such as, for example, URLs and\/or descriptions of the program interface, authentication credentials, etc.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the Signaling Server  is configured to receive connection request information from a Telephony Server  in any suitable communication format (e.g., an HTTP protocol message). As provided above, the connection request information may comprise the originating number, the signaling number, and other related information. Upon receipt of the connection request information from a Telephony Server , the Signaling Server  creates an instance of the applet described in the Applet Descriptor, unless one already exists for that connection request and\/or desired task. An \u201cinstance\u201d is a data structure that contains the runtime data needed to maintain state and to perform the desired task. Importantly, multiple instances of applets using the same Applet Descriptor may exist at the same time, each representing a separate connection request interaction.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the Signaling Server  may send instructions or directives to the Telephony Server  to transfer the connection, place a call to\/from a signaling number, or reject\/cancel the connection request. The Signaling Server  is configured to maintain a list of signaling numbers and related associations. The Signaling Server  may provide an administrative interface that allows one or more Telephony Server  administrators to maintain the review, modify, access, and\/or change the signaling numbers for which the Telephony Server  maintains responsibility.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the Signaling Server  is responsible for transmitting the one or more signaling numbers to the Signaling Client . For example, this information may be conveyed to the Signaling Client  as part of the installation process or at the time the Signaling Client  is initially launched. This information may be conveyed to the Signaling Client  when it runs for the first time. The signaling numbers and related information may be conveyed dynamically to the Signaling Client  and periodically updated by the Signaling Server . The signaling numbers may be transmitted to the Signaling Client  via a SMS communication as the payload of the message, via the use of a message that directs the Signaling Client  to establish a data connection to fetch the relevant data, other conventional data transmission methods, or a combination thereof.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the Signaling Server may publish a set of signaling numbers, either directly or via a third party. In this embodiment, users may load these available signaling numbers into their phone contact lists. Furthermore, users may use other facilities to automatically install the signaling numbers into their phone contact lists, which is particularly beneficial for non-programmable Telephony Devices  or Telephony Devices  with no Signaling Client  installed.","The Application Server  administrator creates \u201cApplet Descriptors\u201d and uploads them to the Signaling Server . The term \u201cApplet Descriptor\u201d is intended to include, but is not limited to, a software application capable of execution within another software program. The Applet Descriptor may be configured as a script for the Signaling Server , executed on behalf of the Application Server . The Applet Descriptors allow the Signaling Server  to infuse Application Server-specific information and\/or behavior into the connection request information and\/or creation of Application Descriptors that deliver enhanced value to the user.","The Applet Descriptor comprises the originating number, the signaling number, a telephony action code comprising instructions to the Telephony Server  regarding handling of the connection request (i.e. CANCEL, COMPLETE-CANCEL, etc.), information related to the desired task, and\/or information related to the content associated with the desired task (i.e., information that identifies the appropriate Resource associated with the content to be delivered to the user). The telephony action code specifies what to do with the incoming call (carrying the connection request). And the application action usually specifies a URL pointing at a Resource  controlled by the Application Server  administrator (where the Application Server  can execute arbitrary program code of its choosing.) The Application Server  sends a responsive document or instructions referred to as a Signaling Descriptor to the Signaling Server  comprising instructions regarding the steps to be taken.","The following is an exemplary Applet Descriptor:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<applet id=\u201d1\u201d name=\u201dsimpleDataGetter\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<catchSignal"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2009calledPattern=\u201d16005551212\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2009appAction=\u201dgetData\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2009telephonyAction=\u201dCANCEL\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2009appURL=\u201dhttp:\/\/appserver\/sendMessage\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2009appData=\u201dCALLER,CALLED,appAction\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<sendSignal"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2009callerPattern=\u201d16005551212\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2009appAction=\u201dsendData\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/applet>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{},"b":["312","308","308","312","310","310","310","310","312"]},"The Application Server  responds to receipt of the desired task (i.e., the access of appURL) via a Signaling Descriptor.

In such an embodiment, the Signaling Client  is configured to store information from previous interactions with the network-side elements, thereby allowing for future communications to utilize historical information. For example, the Signaling Client  may receive information that it may not be capable of processing at a given time, however by maintaining an active state, the applet may access the information or request a retransmission once processing can begin. The ability to maintain a state may also be used in order to perform desired tasks that require a series of interactions between the Signaling Client  and the network-side elements. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the state of the Telephony Device  may be maintained whether the Telephony Device  is an \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d state.

Furthermore, the Application Server  generates Signaling Descriptors that describe and define the interaction from the Application Server  to the Signaling Server . According to an embodiment of the present invention, the Signaling Server  may be configured to support the use of \u201csymbolic signaling numbers (SSN)\u201d to convey information related to the connection request. According to this shortened numbering convention, the same amount of information as would be conveyed using the full originating number and the signaling number may be conveyed using a \u201csymbolic\u201d or shortened identifier. For example, instead of transmitting the originating number \u201c123-555-1234\u201d and the signaling number \u201c987-555-9876\u201d through use of SSN, a shortened identifier of \u201c\/1234\/1\u201d may be assigned to the connection request and processed according to the content delivery systems and methods of the present invention. The Signaling Server  may be configured to properly decipher the SSN message. For example, the \u201c\/1234\/1\u201d identifier may be associated with the desired task of \u201creturn content related to a first pre-set task associated with originating number 123-555-1234\u201d. As described above, the desired task associations may be stored in a hash table or like data structure. Therefore, through use of SSN, the Signaling Server  may process a given connection request without transmitting a complete originating number\/signaling number pair.

For example, wherein the application is a conventional Tic Tac Toe game, the content delivery system and methods of the present invention do not care about the specific signaling number used to request a particular game move, as long as the content delivery systems and methods are able to unambiguously determine what game move the user is requesting.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the Signaling Server  may be configured to support such applications via Managed Signaling Numbers (MSN). Managed Signaling Numbers may be selected from a pool of signaling numbers that are supported by connected Telephony Servers , but not explicitly referenced in any Applet Descriptors, and are also not explicitly publicized (i.e., not public signaling numbers). The Applet Descriptors for such applications contain only symbolic signaling numbers. The Signaling Server  dynamically determines which signaling number from its pool of Managed Signaling Numbers to allocate to a particular connection request. Importantly, only the originating numbers need to be allocated when the Apple Descriptor is activated. Also, different phone numbers can be used for different Signaling Clients . Other phone numbers for subsequent interaction, if any, in an applet may be committed after the signaling sequence starts i.e., when the Signaling Server instantiates the applet. (Note that this will require communication with the Signaling Client  to bring its shared context up to date.) Also, phone numbers need to be committed only for the duration of the signaling interaction. Subsequently, the signaling number may be returned to the pool of available Managed Signaling Numbers for re-use.","The use of the Managed Signaling Numbers method provides the Signaling Server  with increased flexibility, functionality, and benefits, including, but not limited to: signaling load reduction; load balancing, user privacy, and protection against distributed denial of service attacks; as described in detail in the following paragraphs.","Signaling Load Reduction: According to art embodiment of the present invention, the Signaling Server  may use knowledge of the location of devices with Signaling Clients  to select signaling numbers from the MSN pool that are \u201cclose\u201d to the Telephony Device  from the network perspective. For example, through a separate communication, channel, the Signaling Server  may discover that a Signaling Client  is roaming on a different phone network (i.e., the visited network), and may switch to using a signaling number associated with Telephony Servers  in the visited network. Similarly, through a separate communication channel, the Signaling Server  may discover that a Signaling Client  is in a particular part of a mobile network operator's phone network, and may switch to using a signaling number associated with Telephony Servers  in the proximity. As such, this technique may be used to minimize the load on the backbone telecommunications network.","Load Balancing: According to an embodiment of the present invention, the Signaling Server  uses knowledge of the \u201cload\u201d in the telecommunications network to balance the signaling load from the network perspective. For example, through information that it maintains or through a separate communication channel, the Signaling Server  may determine that some Telephony Servers  are over-loaded, while others are idle, and may switch to using signaling numbers associated with lightly-loaded Telephony Servers . As such, this technique may be used to balance the load on the telecomm signaling network and avoid overload and hotspots.","User Privacy: Since the signaling numbers associated with different applications and desired tasks may change using the Managed Signaling Numbers method, and may be different for different Signaling Clients , a remote entity is prevented from tracking and analyzing the signaling numbers to infer what applications a user is using.","Protection against Distributed Denial of Service Attacks: Since the signaling numbers associated with different applications may change using the Managed Signaling Numbers method, and may be different for different Signaling Client , a remote entity is restricted from easily conducting a distributed denial-of-service attack against a particular application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0119"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["306","410","306","420","306","314","430","306","440","306","310","304","312"]},"In step , the Telephony Device Applet  updates its internal state a well as the user interface (identified as \u201cUI\u201d in the Figures) that is presented to the user, if needed.
