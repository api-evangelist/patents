The term \u201cwild type Fve\u201d should be understood to be synonymous with \u201cnative\u201d Fve; furthermore, the term \u201cnFve\u201d is sometimes used to refer to native Fve.","Preferably, \u201cnative\u201d Fve has an amino acid sequence set out as as GenBank accession numbers: S69147 immunomodulatory protein FIP-fve\u2014golden needle mushroom gi|7438667|pir\u2225S69147[7438667] and P80412 IMMUNOMODULATORY PROTEIN FIP-FVE gi|729544|sp|P80412|FVE_FLAVE[729544]. A polypeptide and nucleic acid sequence of \u201cnative\u201d or \u201cwild type\u201d Fve is also shown in Appendix A, and the term \u201cnative FIP\u201d preferably refers to a polypeptide or nucleic acid, as the case may be, having such sequence. Methods of isolating the \u201cnative\u201d Fve gene and protein from are known in the art, and are also set out in the Examples.","A \u201cnative\u201d Fve may comprise a methionine residue at the N terminus; however, a native Fve may include versions which lack the initial methionine. The nucleic acid sequence which encodes such a native Fve may therefore comprise or not comprise an initial ATG codon.","As noted above, we have identified certain previously unknown properties of native Fve, including immunomodulatory and stimulatory properties, and one aspect of the invention is directed to such new uses of native Fve nucleic acid and native Fve polypeptide. These are disclosed in further detail below. ","It should be understood, therefore, that the invention preferably does not include wild-type or native Fve protein; however, it does encompass the uses of this in immunomodulation, enhancing immune response and in allergy and cancer treatment. Furthermore, we disclose a fusion protein comprising gluthathione S transferase (GST) and native Fve; such a fusion protein is shown in the Examples to have the beneficial properties of native Fve itself. The sequence of GST-Fve is shown in Appendix A. Therefore, the invention includes this GST-Fve fusion protein (also referred to as rGST-Fve and GST-Fve (wild type)), and nucleic acids encoding it.","We further disclose a nucleic acid sequence encoding native Fve, termed here a \u201cnative Fve nucleic acid sequence\u201d. The Examples describe the cloning and isolation of a cDNA encoding native Fve protein. The sequence of this is set out as \u201cFve (Wild type)\u201d in Appendix A. Preferably such a sequence is in isolated form.","Fve Polypeptides","Additionally, we have identified various fragments, homologues, variants and derivatives of \u201cnative Fve\u201d, which are previously unknown. Such fragments, homologues, variants and derivatives are referred to here as \u201cFve polypeptides\u201d (as contrasted with \u201cnative Fve polypeptides\u201d). We disclose such Fve polypeptides, and their uses.","It will be apparent that the terms \u201cFve\u201d and \u201cFve polypeptide\u201d, as they is used in this document, preferably exclude the wild type or native Fve protein or gene encoding this, and includes only molecules derived from native Fve, being fragments, homologues, variants and derivatives of native Eve (i.e., Fve polypeptides).","The Fve polypeptides are preferably are at least as biologically active as native Fve. However, they may have 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or more of the biological activity of native Fve, for example as assayed by any of the tests set out below. As used herein \u201cbiologically active\u201d refers to a sequence having a similar structural function (but not necessarily to the same degree), and\/or similar regulatory function (but  not necessarily to the same degree), and\/or similar biochemical function (but not necessarily to the same degree) of the naturally occurring sequence.","\u201cFve polypeptides\u201d preferably comprise at least one biological activity of native Fve. By \u201cbiological activity\u201d in relation to Fve, we refer to at least one of the following activities: up-regulation of expression of Th1 cytokines, preferably IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, down-regulation of expression of Th2 cytokines, preferably IL-4 and IL-13, hemagglutination activity, cell aggregation activity, lymphocyte aggregation activity, lymphoproliferation activity, up-regulation of expression of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, but not IL-4 in CD3 T cells, interaction with T and NK cells, adjuvant activity, stimulation of CD3 CD16 CD56 natural killer (NK) T cells, and up-regulation of expression of allergen specific IgG2a antibody. Further biological activities preferably comprised by Fve polypeptides as described here include prevention of systemic anaphylactic reactions and\/or decreased footpad edema, preferably as assayed using the Arthus reaction (Ko et al, 1995). In particular, Fve polypeptides preferably comprise at least some of useful properties, preferably medically or therapeutically useful properties, of native Fve.","Assays for each of these activities are set out in the Examples, and preferably, whether a Fve polypeptide comprises a \u201cbiological activity\u201d of Fve is to be assessed according to the relevant assay set out in the Examples.","Preferably, Fve polypeptides comprise at least one or more of the biological activities for the relevant use, preferably use as an immunomodulator, or for upregulating immune response. Preferably, they comprise at least one or more of the biological activities which enable use as a cancer therapy or allergy therapy.","Preferably, Fve polypeptides comprise two or more biological activities of native Fve, preferably substantially all the biological activities of native Fve.","We show in the Examples that the sequence RGT at positions 27-29 of the native Fve polypeptide sequence plays a crucial role in the biological activity of native Fve. In  particular, the RGT is shown to mediate the ability of native Fve to cause lymphocyte aggregation and adhesion. This sequence is also shown to mediate lymphoproliferation, and stimulation of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b3 secretion in T cells, preferably CD3 T cells.","Accordingly, in preferred embodiments, the Fve polypeptides comprise at least one, two or all three of the RGT residues (or a functional variant such as RGD) at or about a position corresponding to position 28 of the native Fve polypeptide. By functional variant of RGT, we mean any change in the residues of RGT (or a sequence surrounding it) which does not substantially abolish its function, preferably its function in mediating the activities set out above. Preferably, the Fve polypeptide comprises between 2 to 50, more preferably between 2 to 40, more preferably between 2 to 30, most preferably between 2 to 20 residues of amino acid sequence flanking the glycine residue corresponding to position 28 of native Fve. More preferably, the Fve polypeptide comprises the sequence RGT or the sequence RGD.","However, we show that mutations of R at position 27, as well as mutations of T at position 29, have advantageous effects, in that they independently increase activity of a Fve polypeptide comprising either or both of these mutations. Furthermore, each of the mutations, or in combination, have the potential to increase the solubility of the Fve polypeptide comprising it or them. One, each or both of R27 and T29 may therefore be independently mutated advantageously, by substitution or deletion.","In preferred embodiments, the or each of R27 and T29 are mutated by substitution. The R27 and\/or T29 may be substituted by any other residue, but preferably a neutral residue such as G or A. We therefore disclose Fve polypeptides in which R at position 27 is changed to another residue, for example, Fve polypeptides in which R27 is mutated to A, i.e., a Fve polypeptide comprising R27A. We therefore disclose Fve polypeptides in which T at position 29 is changed to another residue, for example, Fve polypeptides in which T29 is mutated to A, i.e., a Fve polypeptide comprising T29A. ","Combinations are also possible; hence we disclose Fve polypeptides in which R at position 27 and T at position 29 are independently changed to one or more other residues. For example, we disclose Fve polypeptides in which R27 is mutated to A, and T29 is mutated to A, i.e., a Fve polypeptide comprising R27A and T29A. As noted above, the polypeptide may comprise between 2 to 50, 40, 30 or preferably 20 residues of amino acid flanking the glycine residue at position 28 of native Fve.","Fve polypeptides may comprise fragments of native Fve. For example, Fve D6-18, Fve D19-33, Fve D34-46, Fve D47-60, Fve D61-72, Fve D73-84, Eve D85-97, Fve D98-106, Fve D107-115, Fve D61-97, and Fvep55-100. Fusion proteins comprising these deletion fragments and GST are also disclosed. Fve polypeptides may comprise substitutions, including FveR27A, FveG28A and FveT29A. Further examples of Fve polypeptides are shown in Appendix B, each of which includes at least a portion of the RGT sequence (preferably the whole of the RGT sequence) discussed above. Preferably, the length of such a fragment is 9 amino acid residues or more, e.g., fragment numbers 34-403.","Fve polypeptides may comprise fusion proteins, particularly fusion proteins between an allergen and a Fve polypeptide as defined here. Such allergen-immunomodulator combinations include Blo t 5-Fve(two-in-one chimeric wild type), Blo t 5-FveR27A (two-in-one chimeric mutant), Blo t 5-FveT29A (two-in-one chimeric mutant), Der p 2-FveR27A (two-in-one chimeric mutant), Der p 2-FveT29A (two-in-one chimeric mutant) and Blo t 5-Der p 2-FveR27A (three-in-one chimeric mutant).","Fragments, homologues, variants and derivatives of each of these Fve polypeptides are also included.","The Fve polypeptides may be made by biochemical methods, for example, protein digestion of native Eve, or preferably by recombinant DNA methods as known in the art. Accordingly, it will be understood that Eve polypeptides specifically include recombinant  Fve polypeptides. For example, we disclose in the Examples successful production in of biologically active recombinant Fve polypeptide.","The Fve polypeptides disclosed also include homologous sequences obtained from any source, for example related viral\/bacterial proteins, cellular homologues and synthetic peptides, as well as variants or derivatives thereof. Thus polypeptides also include those encoding homologues of Fve from other species including other microorganisms. Furthermore, homologues from higher animals such as mammals (e.g. mice, rats or rabbits), especially primates, more especially humans are also included.","Homologues","In the context of this document, a \u201chomologous\u201d sequence is taken to include an amino acid sequence which is at least 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90% identical, preferably at least 95 or 98% identical at the amino acid level over at least 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110 or 114 amino acids with the sequence of native Fve shown as \u201cFve (Wild type)\u201d in Appendix A. In particular, homology should typically be considered with respect to those regions of the sequence known to be essential for protein function rather than non-essential neighbouring sequences. This is especially important when considering homologous sequences from distantly related organisms.","Although homology can also be considered in terms of similarity (i.e. amino acid residues having similar chemical properties\/functions), in the context of the present document it is preferred to express homology in terms of sequence identity.","Homology comparisons can be conducted by eye, or more usually, with the aid of readily available sequence comparison programs. These publicly and commercially available computer programs can calculate % homology between two or more sequences.","% homology may be calculated over contiguous sequences, i.e. one sequence is aligned with the other sequence and each amino acid in one sequence directly compared with the corresponding amino acid in the other sequence, one residue at a time. This is  called an \u201cungapped\u201d alignment. Typically, such ungapped alignments are performed only over a relatively short number of residues (for example less than 50 contiguous amino acids).","Although this is a very simple and consistent method, it fails to take into consideration that, for example, in an otherwise identical pair of sequences, one insertion or deletion will cause the following amino acid residues to be put out of alignment, thus potentially resulting in a large reduction in % homology when a global alignment is performed. Consequently, most sequence comparison methods are designed to produce optimal alignments that take into consideration possible insertions and deletions without penalising unduly the overall homology score. This is achieved by inserting \u201cgaps\u201d in the sequence alignment to try to maximise local homology.","However, these more complex methods assign \u201cgap penalties\u201d to each gap that occurs in the alignment so that, for the same number of identical amino acids, a sequence alignment with as few gaps as possible\u2014reflecting higher relatedness between the two compared sequences\u2014will achieve a higher score than one with many gaps. \u201cAffine gap costs\u201d are typically used that charge a relatively high cost for the existence of a gap and a smaller penalty for each subsequent residue in the gap. This is the most commonly used gap scoring system. High gap penalties will of course produce optimised alignments with fewer gaps. Most alignment programs allow the gap penalties to be modified. However, it is preferred to use the default values when using such software for sequence comparisons. For example when using the GCG Wisconsin Bestfit package (see below) the default gap penalty for amino acid sequences is \u221212 for a gap and \u22124 for each extension.","Calculation of maximum % homology therefore firstly requires the production of an optimal alignment, taking into consideration gap penalties. A suitable computer program for carrying out such an alignment is the GCG Wisconsin Bestfit package (University of Wisconsin, U.S.A; Devereux et al., 1984, Nucleic Acids Research 12:387). Examples of other software than can perform sequence comparisons include, but are not limited to, the BLAST package (see Ausubel et al., 1999 ibid\u2014Chapter 18), FASTA  (Atschul et al., 1990, J. Mol. Biol., 403-410) and the GENEWORKS suite of comparison tools. Both BLAST and FASTA are available for offline and online searching (see Ausubel et al., 1999 ibid, pages 7-58 to 7-60). However it is preferred to use the GCG Bestfit program.","Although the final % homology can be measured in terms of identity, the alignment process itself is typically not based on an all-or-nothing pair comparison. Instead, a scaled similarity score matrix is generally used that assigns scores to each pairwise comparison based on chemical similarity or evolutionary distance. An example of such a matrix commonly used is the BLOSUM62 matrix\u2014the default matrix for the BLAST suite of programs. GCG Wisconsin programs generally use either the public default values or a custom symbol comparison table if supplied (see user manual for further details). It is preferred to use the public default values for the GCG package, or in the case of other software, the default matrix, such as BLOSUM62.","Advantageously, the BLAST algorithm is employed, with parameters set to default values. The BLAST algorithm is described in detail at http:\/\/www.ncbi.nih.gov\/BLAST\/blast_help.html, which is incorporated herein by reference. The search parameters are defined as follows, can be advantageously set to the defined default parameters.","Advantageously, \u201csubstantial identity\u201d when assessed by BLAST equates to sequences which match with an EXPECT value of at least about 7, preferably at least about 9 and most preferably 10 or more. The default threshold for EXPECT in BLAST searching is usually 10.","BLAST (basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is the heuristic search algorithm employed by the programs blastp, blastn, blastx, tblastn, and tblastx; these programs ascribe significance to their findings using the statistical methods of Karlin and Altschul (Karlin and Altschul 1990, 87:2264-68; Karlin and Altschul, 1993, 90:5873-7; see  http:\/\/www.ncbi.nih.gov\/BLAST\/blast_help.html) with a few enhancements. The BLAST programs are tailored for sequence similarity searching, for example to identify homologues to a query sequence. For a discussion of basic issues in similarity searching of sequence databases, see Altschul et al (1994) Nature Genetics 6:119-129.","The five BLAST programs available at http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov perform the following tasks: blastp\u2014compares air amino acid query sequence against a protein sequence database; blastn\u2014compares a nucleotide query sequence against a nucleotide sequence database; blastx\u2014compares the six-frame conceptual translation products of a nucleotide query sequence (both strands) against a protein sequence database; tblastn\u2014compares a protein query sequence against a nucleotide sequence database dynamically translated in all six reading frames (both strands); tblastx\u2014compares the six-frame translations of a nucleotide query sequence against the six-frame translations of a nucleotide sequence database.","BLAST uses the following search parameters:","HISTOGRAM\u2014Display a histogram of scores for each search; default is yes. (See parameter H in the BLAST Manual).","DESCRIPTIONS\u2014Restricts the number of short descriptions of matching sequences reported to the number specified; default limit is 100 descriptions. (See parameter V in the manual page).","EXPECT\u2014The statistical significance threshold for reporting matches against database sequences; the default value is 10, such that 10 matches are expected to be found merely by chance, according to the stochastic model of Karlin and Altschul (1990). If the statistical significance ascribed to a match is greater than the EXPECT threshold, the match will not be reported. Lower EXPECT thresholds are more stringent, leading to fewer chance matches being reported. Fractional values are acceptable. (See parameter E in the BLAST Manual). ","CUTOFF\u2014Cutoff score for reporting high-scoring segment pairs. The default value is calculated from the EXPECT value (see above). HSPs are reported for a database sequence only if the statistical significance ascribed to them is at least as high as would be ascribed to a lone HSP having a score equal to the CUTOFF value. Higher CUTOFF values are more stringent, leading to fewer chance matches being reported. (See parameter S in the BLAST Manual). Typically, significance thresholds can be more intuitively managed using EXPECT.","ALIGNMENTS\u2014Restricts database sequences to the number specified for which high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs) are reported; the default limit is 50. If more database sequences than this happen to satisfy the statistical significance threshold for reporting (see EXPECT and CUTOFF below), only the matches ascribed the greatest statistical significance are reported, (See parameter B in the BLAST Manual).","MATRIX\u2014Specify an alternate scoring matrix for BLASTP, BLASTX, TBLASTN and TBLASTX. The default matrix is BLOSUM62 (Henikoff & Henikoff, 1992). The valid alternative choices include: PAM40, PAM120, PAM250 and IDENTITY. No alternate scoring matrices are available for BLASTN; specifying the MATRIX directive in BLASTN requests returns an error response.","STRAND\u2014Restrict a TBLASTN search to just the top or bottom strand of the database sequences; or restrict a BLASTN, BLASTX or TBLASTX search to just reading frames on the top or bottom strand of the query sequence.","FILTER\u2014Mask off segments of the query sequence that have low compositional complexity, as determined by the SEG program of Wootton & Federhen (1993) Computers and Chemistry 17:149-163, or segments consisting of short-periodicity internal repeats, as determined by the XNU program of Claverie & States (1993) Computers and Chemistry 17:191-201, or, for BLASTN, by the DUST program of Tatusov and Lipman (see http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Filtering can eliminate statistically significant but biologically uninteresting reports from the blast output (e.g., hits against common acidic-,  basic- or proline-rich regions), leaving the more biologically interesting regions of the query sequence available for specific matching against database sequences.","Low complexity sequence found by a filter program is substituted using the letter \u201cN\u201d in nucleotide sequence (e.g., \u201cNNNNNNNNNNNNN\u201d) (SEQ ID NO: 1) and the letter \u201cX\u201d in protein sequences (e.g., \u201cXXXXXXXXX\u201d) (SEQ ID NO: 2).","Filtering is only applied to the query sequence (or its translation products), not to database sequences. Default filtering is DUST for BLASTN, SEG for other programs.","It is not unusual for nothing at all to be masked by SEG, XNU, or both, when applied to sequences in SWISS-PROT, so filtering should not be expected to always yield an effect. Furthermore, in some cases, sequences are masked in their entirety, indicating that the statistical significance of any matches reported against the unfiltered query sequence should be suspect.","NCBI-gi\u2014Causes NCBI gi identifiers to be shown in the output, in addition to the accession and\/or locus name.","Most preferably, sequence comparisons are conducted using the simple BLAST search algorithm provided at http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/BLAST. In some embodiments, no gap penalties are used when determining sequence identity.","Once the software has produced an optimal alignment, it is possible to calculate % homology, preferably % sequence identity. The software typically does this as part of the sequence comparison and generates a numerical result.","Variants and Derivatives","The terms \u201cvariant\u201d or \u201cderivative\u201d in relation to the amino acid sequences disclosed here includes any substitution of, variation of, modification of, replacement of, deletion of or addition of one (or more) amino acids from or to the sequence providing the  resultant amino acid sequence retains substantially the same activity as the unmodified sequence. Preferably, the modified sequence has at least one biological activity as the unmodified sequence, preferably all the biological activities of the unmodified sequence. Preferably, the \u201cvariant\u201d or \u201cderivative\u201d has at least one biological activity of native Fve, as described above.","Polypeptides having the amino acid sequence shown in the description and Examples, or fragments or homologues thereof may be modified for use in the methods and compositions described here. Typically, modifications are made that maintain the biological activity of the sequence. Amino acid substitutions may be made, for example from 1, 2 or 3 to 10, 20 or 30 substitutions provided that the modified sequence retains the biological activity of the unmodified sequence. Alternatively, modifications may be made to deliberately inactivate one or more functional domains of the polypeptides described here. Functional domains of native Fve include the a helix at the N terminus, any of the six \u03b2 helices, as well as the \u201cloop-like\u201d structures at the N and C termini. Preferably, the functional domain of native Fve comprises the N-terminus helix and the loop\/strand, which are essential for protein dimerization.","Amino acid substitutions may include the use of non-naturally occurring analogues, for example to increase blood plasma half-life of a therapeutically administered polypeptide.","Conservative substitutions may be made, for example according to the Table below. Amino acids in the same block in the second column and preferably in the same line in the third column may be substituted for each other: ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0199","num":"0198"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["ALIPHATIC","Non-polar","G A P"]},{"entry":[{},{},"I L V"]},{"entry":[{},"Polar - uncharged","C S T M"]},{"entry":[{},{},"N Q"]},{"entry":[{},"Polar - charged","D E"]},{"entry":[{},{},"K R"]},{"entry":["AROMATIC",{},"H F W Y"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Polypeptides also include fragments of the full length sequence of native Fve, or any of the Fve polypeptides disclosed here. Preferably fragments comprise at least one epitope. Methods of identifying epitopes are well known in the art. Fragments will typically comprise at least 6 amino acids, more preferably at least 10, 20, 30, 50 or 100 amino acids.","Fve polypeptides, fragments, homologues, variants and derivatives, are typically made by recombinant means, for example as described below in the Examples. However they may also be made by synthetic means using techniques well known to skilled persons such as solid phase synthesis. The proteins may also be produced as fusion proteins, for example to aid in extraction and purification. Examples of fusion protein partners include glutathione-S-transferase (GST), 6\u00d7His (SEQ ID NO: 488), GAL4 (DNA binding and\/or transcriptional activation domains) and \u03b2-galactosidase. It may also be convenient to include a proteolytic cleavage site between the fusion protein partner and the protein sequence of interest to allow removal of fusion protein sequences. Preferably the fusion protein will not hinder the function of the protein of interest sequence. Proteins may also be obtained by purification of cell extracts from animal cells.","The Fve polypeptides, variants, homologues, fragments and derivatives disclosed here may be in a substantially isolated form. It will be understood that such polypeptides may be mixed with carriers or diluents which will not interfere with the intended purpose of the protein and still be regarded as substantially isolated. A Fve variant, homologue, fragment or derivative may also be in a substantially purified form, in which case it will  generally comprise the protein in a preparation in which more than 90%, e.g. 95%, 98% or 99% of the protein in the preparation is a protein.","The Fve polypeptides, variants, homologues, fragments and derivatives disclosed here may be labelled with a revealing label. The revealing label may be any suitable label which allows the polypeptide, etc to be detected. Suitable labels include radioisotopes, e.g. I, enzymes, antibodies, polynucleotides and linkers such as biotin. Labelled polypeptides may be used in diagnostic procedures such as immunoassays to determine the amount of a polypeptide in a sample. Polypeptides or labelled polypeptides may also be used in serological or cell-mediated immune assays for the detection of immune reactivity to said polypeptides in animals and humans using standard protocols.","A Fve polypeptide, variant, homologue, fragment or derivative disclosed here, optionally labelled, my also be fixed to a solid phase, for example the surface of an immunoassay well or dipstick. Such labelled and\/or immobilised polypeptides may be packaged into kits in a suitable container along with suitable reagents, controls, instructions and the like. Such polypeptides and kits may be used in methods of detection of antibodies to the polypeptides or their allelic or species variants by immunoassay.","Immunoassay methods are well known in the art and will generally comprise: (a) providing a polypeptide comprising an epitope bindable by an antibody against said protein; (b) incubating a biological sample with said polypeptide under conditions which allow for the formation of an antibody-antigen complex; and (c) determining whether antibody-antigen complex comprising said polypeptide is formed.","The Fve polypeptides, variants, homologues, fragments and derivatives disclosed here may be used in in vitro or in vivo cell culture systems to study the role of their corresponding genes and homologues thereof in cell function, including their function in disease. For example, truncated or modified polypeptides may be introduced into a cell to disrupt the normal functions which occur in the cell. The polypeptides may be introduced into the cell by in situ expression of the polypeptide from a recombinant expression vector  (see below). The expression vector optionally carries an inducible promoter to control the expression of the polypeptide.","The use of appropriate host cells, such as insect cells or mammalian cells, is expected to provide for such post-translational modifications (e.g. myristolation, glycosylation, truncation, lapidation and tyrosine, serine or threonine phosphorylation) as may be needed to confer optimal biological activity on recombinant expression products. Such cell culture systems in which the Fve polypeptides, variants, homologues, fragments and derivatives disclosed here are expressed maybe used in assay systems to identify candidate substances which interfere with or enhance the functions of the polypeptides in the cell.","Immunomodulator-Antigen Combinations and Conjugates","We show throughout this document (for the first time) that Fve has immunomodulatory properties, and in particular can act to potentiate an immune response. The adjuvant property of Fve may be exploited by administering Fve polypeptide or nucleic acid (or a fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof, or a host cell or vector comprising such) as described below, along with a molecule to which an immune response is desired.","The Fve polypeptide, etc may be administered to an individual either in combination, sequentially or simultaneously or in succession with the molecule to which an immune response is desired. We therefore provide for the first time a combination of a Fve polypeptide, etc with an antigenic molecule.","Where the Fve polypeptide, etc and the molecule are administered in combination, this may be achieved by administering a mixture of the Fve polypeptide, etc and the molecule. We therefore provide a simple combination of the Fve polypeptide, etc and the molecule, preferably as a kit. The kit may comprise the Fve polypeptide, etc and the  molecule to which an immune response is desired in separate containers, and may optionally comprise instructions to administer these simultaneously, sequentially, etc.","The molecule to which an immune response is desired may comprise an allergen. These are set out in further detail in the following section.","The molecule to which an immune response is desired may comprise a tumour associated antigen.

Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of these antigens are known in the art, and the skilled person will know how to produce tumour associated antigens, including those set out above. We therefore disclose combinations, preferably in the form of kits, comprising an Fve polypeptide or nucleic acid (or a fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof, or a host cell or vector comprising such), together with a tumour associated antigen, for example as set out above.","The molecule to which an immune response is desired may comprise a viral antigen. In preferred embodiments, the viral antigen comprises a protein from an oncogenic virus; such viruses are known in the art. Preferably the oncogenic viral antigen comprises E6 and E7 from HPV; core Ag and E2 from HCV; core and surface antigens from HBV; LMP-1, LMP-2, EBNA-2, EBNA-3 from EBV; or Tax from HTLV-1.","In a further embodiment, the viral antigen comprises an antigen, preferably a protein, more preferably an antigenic protein or fragment thereof from an infectious virus. Such immunomodulator-viral antigen conjugates may be used to treat or prevent a viral infectious disease, i.e., the cognate disease. For example, an immunomodulator-HSV antigen conjugate, for example, a Fve polypeptide-HSV antigen conjugate, may be used to treat or prevent Herpes Simplex Virus infection. Other preferred viral antigens include those from Adenovirus, Parainfluenza 3 virus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV),  Herpes simplex virus, HSV, Respiratory syncytial virus, RSV, and Influenza A, Flu A. These viruses, and the diseases they cause, are well known in the art, and methods for making and purifying antigens from such viruses are also well known. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,313,927 (Fridlender) discloses detailed protocols for preparation of rubella and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen.","Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of these viral antigens are known in the art, and the skilled person will know how to produce viral antigen antigens, including these set out above. We therefore disclose combinations, preferably in the form of kits, comprising an Fve polypeptide or nucleic acid (or a fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof, or a host cell or vector comprising such), together with a viral antigen, for example as set out above.","In preferred embodiments, we provide administration of the Fve polypeptide, etc and the molecule to which an immune response is desired, in which there is some degree of association between the Fve polypeptide, etc and the molecule in question.","We therefore disclose for the first time an an agent which comprises an immunomodulator coupled, fused, mixed, combined, or otherwise joined to an allergen. Such a construct is referred to as a \u201cimmunomodulator-allergen conjugate\u201d in this document. In particular, we disclose the use of Fve adjuvanted allergen vaccines, as explained in further detail in Examples 13 and 14.","The coupling, etc between the immunomodulator and the allergen may be permanent or transient, and may involve covalent or non-covalent interactions (including ionic interactions, hydrophobic forces, Van der Waals interactions, etc). The exact mode of coupling is not important, so long as the immunomodulator-allergen conjugate. Accordingly, where reference is made to \u201ccomprising\u201d, \u201cconjugation\u201d, \u201ccoupling\u201d, etc, these references should be taken to include any form of interaction between the immunomodulator and the allergen. ","Thus, the immunodulator may be a polypeptide which is provided as a fusion protein with the allergen, for example as shown in Example 13 for Fve\/Allergen. An expression vector may be constructed by standard recombinant DNA technology to include a nucleotide sequence capable of expressing a immunodulator, such that a fusion protein is expressed comprising the allergen of interest fused to the immunodulator. The expression vector is transfected or transformed into a suitable host for large scale production of fusion protein, by means known in the art. Purification of the fusion protein may also be carried out by known means. Alternatively, or in addition, and as discussed above, the allergen may be physically associated with the immunomodulator, and attached to it by chemical conjugation. Thus, Example 14 below describes the use of allergen physically conjugated to Fve.","In preferred embodiments, the immunomodulator-allergen conjugate is capable of at least one of the following, preferably two or more, more preferably all: increase the number of human PBMC, to stimulate the proliferation of human lymphocytes, to polarize human CD8 T cells, and to increase the production of IFN-\u03b3 (Th1 response) and IL-10 (Tr response). Preferablly, the immunomodulator-allergen conjugate is capable of inducing both Th1 and Tr immune responses. Preferably, the Th1 response inhibits the development of Th2 cells via IFN-\u03b3, more preferably it is capable of inducing a life-long (or substantially long lasting) protective Th1 memory immune response. Allergen specific Tr cells may in turn dampen the anti-allergic Th1 immune response, ensuring a well-balanced protective but nonpathological TH1 response. Allergen-Fve fusion proteins meet these criteria since they induce cytokine IL-10, and these are therefore preferred.","Where the conjugate comprises Fve, the Fve portion of the conjugate may comprise the whole molecule, or fragments of it. It may for example comprise the native Fve, or any Fve polypeptide as disclosed above. The allergen portion may comprise any allergen, whether proteinaceous or not. Advantageously, proteinaceous allergens are conjugated to the immunomodulator portion by means of covalent bonds, for example, amide bonds (for example, as a fusion protein). ","The allergen may comprise for example the whole or a portion of Blo t 5 or Der p 2 allergen. In highly preferred embodiments, the immunomodulator-allergen conjugate comprises Bt5-Fve, Bt5-FveR27 or GST-Dp2-FveR27. Examples of other allergens suitable for use in the immunomodulator-allergen conjugate described here are provided below.","Furthermore, protein-protein conjugation also provides a convenient and alternative choice to develop allergen vaccine. Any suitable means of conjugation, for example, chemical conjugation maybe used to couple the immunomodulator and the allergen. Cross-linkers, for example, heterobifunctional cross linkers are known in the art, and may be used. Furthermore, other conjugation agents, for example, poly-lactic acid (PLA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) may also be employed.","Allergens","In general, the allergen from which an immunomodulator-allergen conjugate may be constructed may come from any source, for example, a source known to induce allergenic responses in humans. For example, the allergen may comprise a tree pollen allergen, a grass pollen allergen, a weed pollen allergen, a feline antigen, or a fungal allergen. Thus, the allergen may comprise a tree pollen allergen, for example Bet v 1 and Bet v 2 from birch tree. It may comprise a grass pollen allergen, for example, Phl p 1 and Phl p 2 from timothy grass. It may comprise a weed pollen allergen, for example, antigen E from ragweed. It may comprise a major feline antigen, for example, Fel d 1.

Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of these viral antigens are known in the art, and the skilled person will know how to produce viral antigen-immunomodulator conjugates from any of these allergens using such sequences.","We also provide an agent (for example a polypeptide) comprising a first portion comprising at least a portion of Fve and a second portion comprising at least a portion of a viral antigen, preferably coupled together. The viral antigen may be selected from the group consisting of antigens from Adenovirus, Parainfluenza 3 virus, Herpes simplex virus, HSV, Respiratory syncytial virus, RSV, and Influenza A, Flu A.","The viral antigen may comprise any portion of the native viral antigen, for example, a portion of the HCV core antigen. We have established that a deletion of the HCV core antigen, particularly a deletion of 23 amino acids from residues 141 to 163 of the core antigen leads to an increase in efficiency of protein production. Accordingly, we provide an agent comprising an immunodulator coupled, etc to a viral antigen, which viral antigen comprises such a deleted core antigen (here referred to as \u201cCore23\u201d), e.g., the fusion protein HCV Core23-FveT29A.","In particular, we find that the polypeptides HCV Core23-FveT29A and HPV E7-FveT29A (the sequences of which are shown in Appendix A) are particularly useful as Immunomodulator-Viral Antigen conjugates. ","The coupling, etc between the immunomodulator and the tumour associated antigen, and the viral antigen, may be as described above for the immunomodulator-allergen conjugate.","Fve Nucleic Acids","We provide for a nucleic acid encoding a Fve polypeptide, which we refer to as a \u201cFve nucleic acid\u201d. We also provide nucleic acids encoding variants, homologues, derivatives and fragments of native Fve, as well as fragments, homologues, derivatives and variants of Eve nucleic acids.","Preferably, the Fve nucleic acid is derived from a natural or native Fve sequence, for example, the nucleic sequence shown as \u201cFve (Wild type)\u201d in Appendix A. In a preferred embodiment, the Fve nucleic acid is a recombinant fragment of native Fve nucleic acid, or any fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof.

In addition, \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d refers to triple-stranded regions comprising RNA or DNA or both RNA and DNA. The term polynucleotide also includes DNAs or RNAs containing one or more modified bases and DNAs or RNAs with backbones modified for stability or for other reasons. \u201cModified\u201d bases include, for example, tritylated bases and unusual bases such as inosine. A variety of modifications has been made to DNA and RNA; thus, \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d embraces chemically, enzymatically or metabolically modified forms of polynucleotides as typically found in nature, as well as the chemical forms of DNA and RNA characteristic of viruses and cells. \u201cPolynucleotide\u201d also embraces relatively short polynucleotides, often referred to as oligonucleotides.","It will be understood by a skilled person that numerous different polynucleotides and nucleic acids can encode the same polypeptide as a result of the degeneracy of the genetic code. In addition, it is to be understood that skilled persons may, using routine techniques, make nucleotide substitutions that do not affect the polypeptide sequence encoded by the polynucleotides described here to reflect the codon usage of any particular host organism in which the polypeptides are to be expressed.","Fve nucleic acids, variants, fragments, derivatives and homologues may comprise DNA or RNA. They may be single-stranded or double-stranded. They may also be polynucleotides which include within them synthetic or modified nucleotides. A number of different types of modification to oligonucleotides are known in the art. These include methylphosphonate and phosphorothioate backbones, addition of acridine or polylysine chains at the 3\u2032 and\/or 5\u2032 ends of the molecule. For the purposes of this document, it is to be understood that the polynucleotides may be modified by any method available in the art. Such modifications may be carried out in order to enhance the in vivo activity or life span of polynucleotides of interest. ","The terms \u201cvariant\u201d, \u201chomologue\u201d or \u201cderivative\u201d in relation to a nucleotide sequence include any substitution of, variation of, modification of, replacement of, deletion of or addition of one (or more) nucleic acid from or to the sequence.

A preferred sequence comparison program is the GCG Wisconsin Bestfit program described above. The default scoring matrix has a match value of 10 for each identical nucleotide and \u22129 for each mismatch. The default gap creation penalty is \u221250 and the default gap extension penalty is \u22123 for each nucleotide.","We further describe nucleotide sequences that are capable of hybridising selectively to the sequences presented herein, or any variant, fragment or derivative thereof, or to the complement of any of the above. Nucleotide sequences are preferably at least 15 nucleotides in length, more preferably at least 20, 30, 40 or 50 nucleotides in length.","The term \u201chybridization\u201d as used herein shall include \u201cthe process by which a strand of nucleic acid joins with a complementary strand through base pairing\u201d as well as the process of amplification as carried out in polymerase chain reaction technologies.","Polynucleotides capable of selectively hybridising to the nucleotide sequences presented herein, or to their complement, will be generally at least 70%, preferably at least 80 or 90% and more preferably at least 95% or 98% homologous to the corresponding nucleotide sequences presented herein over a region of at least 20, preferably at least 25 or 30, for instance at least 40, 60 or 100 or more contiguous nucleotides. ","The term \u201cselectively hybridizable\u201d means that the polynucleotide used as a probe is used under conditions where a target polynucleotide is found to hybridize to the probe at a level significantly above background. The background hybridization may occur because of other polynucleotides present, for example, in the cDNA or genomic DNA library being screening. In this event, background implies a level of signal generated by interaction between the probe and a non-specific DNA member of the library which is less than 10 fold, preferably less than 100 fold as intense as the specific interaction observed with the target DNA. The intensity of interaction may be measured, for example, by radiolabelling the probe, e.g. with P.","Hybridization conditions are based on the melting temperature (Tm) of the nucleic acid binding complex, as taught in Berger and Kimmel (1987, Guide to Molecular Cloning Techniques, Methods in Enzymology, Vol 152, Academic Press, San Diego Calif.), and confer a defined \u201cstringency\u201d as explained below.","Maximum stringency typically occurs at about Tm-5\u00b0 C. (5\u00b0 C. below the Tm of the probe); high stringency at about 5\u00b0 C. to 10\u00b0 C. below Tm; intermediate stringency at about 10\u00b0 C. to 20\u00b0 C. below Tm; and low stringency at about 20\u00b0 C. to 25\u00b0 C. below Tm. As will be understood by those of skill in the art, a maximum stringency hybridization can be used to identify or detect identical polynucleotide sequences while an intermediate (or low) stringency hybridization can be used to identify or detect similar or related polynucleotide sequences.","In a preferred aspect, we provide nucleotide sequences that can hybridise to the Fve nucleic acids, fragments, variants, homologues or derivatives dislosed here under stringent conditions (e.g. 65\u00b0 C. and 0.1\u00d7SSC {1\u00d7SSC=0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M NaCitrate pH 7.0).","Where the polynucleotide is double-stranded, both strands of the duplex, either individually or in combination, are encompassed by the methods and compositions described here. Where the polynucleotide is single-stranded, it is to be understood that the complementary sequence of that polynucleotide is also included. ","Polynucleotides which are not 100% homologous to the Fve sequences disclosed here but which are also included can be obtained in a number of ways. Other variants of the sequences may be obtained for example by probing DNA libraries made from a range of individuals, for example individuals from different populations. For example, Fve homologues may be identified from other individuals, or other species. Further recombinant Fve nucleic acids and polypeptides may be produced by identifying corresponding positions in the homologues, and synthesising or producing the molecule as described elsewhere in this document. Furthermore, the collagen region, neck region and carbohydrate binding domain in such homologues may be identified, for example, by sequence gazing or computer assisted comparisons, and selected for combination into or production of a recombinant Fve which has one or more biological activities of native Fve.","In addition, other viral\/bacterial, or cellular homologues of Fve particularly cellular homologues found in mammalian cells (e.g. rat, mouse, bovine and primate cells), may be obtained and such homologues and fragments thereof in general will be capable of selectively hybridising to Fve. Such homologues may be used to design non-human Fve nucleic acids, fragments, variants and homologues. Mutagenesis may be carried out by means known in the art to produce further variety.","Sequences of Fve homologues may be obtained by probing cDNA libraries made from or genomic DNA libraries from other animal or non-animal species, particularly microbial or fungal species, and probing such libraries with probes comprising all or part of any of the Fve nucleic acids, fragments, variants and homologues, or other fragments of Fve under conditions of medium to high stringency.","Similar considerations apply to obtaining species homologues and allelic variants of the polypeptide or nucleotide sequences disclosed here.","Variants and strain\/species homologues may also be obtained using degenerate PCR which will use primers designed to target sequences within the variants and homologues encoding conserved amino acid sequences within the sequences of the Fve  nucleic acids. Conserved sequences can be predicted, for example, by aligning the amino acid sequences from several variants\/homologues. Sequence alignments can be performed using computer software known in the art. For example the GCG Wisconsin PileUp program is widely used.","The primers used in degenerate PCR will contain one or more degenerate positions and will be used at stringency conditions lower than those used for cloning sequences with single sequence primers against known sequences. It will be appreciated by the skilled person that overall nucleotide homology between sequences from distantly related organisms is likely to be very low and thus in these situations degenerate PCR may be the method of choice rather than screening libraries with labelled fragments the Fve sequences.","In addition, homologous sequences may be identified by searching nucleotide and\/or protein databases using search algorithms such as the BLAST suite of programs.","Alternatively, such polynucleotides may be obtained by site directed mutagenesis of characterised sequences, for example, Fve nucleic acids, or variants, homologues, derivatives or fragments thereof This may be useful where for example silent codon changes are required to sequences to optimise codon preferences for a particular host cell in which the polynucleotide sequences are being expressed. Other sequence changes may be desired in order to introduce restriction enzyme recognition sites, or to alter the property or function of the polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotides.","The polynucleotides described here may be used to produce a primer, e.g. a PCR primer, a primer for an alternative amplification reaction, a probe e.g. labelled with a revealing label by conventional means using radioactive or non-radioactive labels, or the polynucleotides may be cloned into vectors. Such primers, probes and other fragments will be at least 8, 9, 10, or 15, preferably at least 20, for example at least 25, 30 or 40 nucleotides in length, and are also encompassed by the term \u201cpolynucleotides\u201d as used herein. ","Polynucleotides such as a DNA polynucleotides and probes may be produced recombinantly, synthetically, or by any means available to those of skill in the art They may also be cloned by standard techniques.","In general, primers will be produced by synthetic means, involving a step wise manufacture of the desired nucleic acid sequence one nucleotide at a time. Techniques for accomplishing this using automated techniques are readily available in the art","Longer polynucleotides will generally be produced using recombinant means, for example using a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) cloning techniques. This will involve making a pair of primers (e.g. of about 15 to 30 nucleotides) flanking a region of the lipid targeting sequence which it is desired to clone, bringing the primers into contact with mRNA or cDNA obtained from an animal or human cell, performing a polymerase chain reaction under conditions which bring about amplification of the desired region, isolating the amplified fragment (e.g. by purifying the reaction mixture on an agarose gel) and recovering the amplified DNA. The primers may be designed to contain suitable restriction enzyme recognition sites so that the amplified DNA can be cloned into a suitable cloning vector","Polynucleotides or primers may carry a revealing label. Suitable labels include radioisotopes such as P or S, enzyme labels, or other protein labels such as biotin. Such labels may be added to polynucleotides or primers and may be detected using by techniques known per se. Polynucleotides or primers or fragments thereof labelled or unlabeled may be used by a person skilled in the art in nucleic acid-based tests for detecting or sequencing polynucleotides in the human or animal body.","Such tests for detecting generally comprise bringing a biological sample containing DNA or RNA into contact with a probe comprising a polynucleotide or primer under hybridising conditions and detecting any duplex formed between the probe and nucleic acid in the sample. Such detection may be achieved using techniques such as PCR or by immobilising the probe on a solid support, removing nucleic acid in the sample which is  not hybridised to the probe, and then detecting nucleic acid which has hybridised to the probe. Alternatively, the sample nucleic acid may be immobilised on a solid support, and the amount of probe bound to such a support can be detected. Suitable assay methods of this and other formats can be found in for example WO89\/03891 and WO90\/13667.","Tests for sequencing nucleotides, for example, the Fve nucleic acids, involve bringing a biological sample containing target DNA or RNA into contact with a probe comprising a polynucleotide or primer under hybridising conditions and determining the sequence by, for example the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method (see Sambrook et al.).","Such a method generally comprises elongating, in the presence of suitable reagents, the primer by synthesis of a strand complementary to the target DNA or RNA and selectively terminating the elongation reaction at one or more of an A, C, G or T\/U residue; allowing strand elongation and termination reaction to occur; separating out according to size the elongated products to determine the sequence of the nucleotides at which selective termination has occurred. Suitable reagents include a DNA polymerase enzyme, the deoxynucleotides dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP, a buffer and ATP. Dideoxynucleotides are used for selective termination.","Protein Expression and Purification","Host cells comprising polynucleotides may be used to express polypeptides, such as Fve polypeptides, fragments, homologues, variants or derivatives thereof. Host cells may be cultured under suitable conditions which allow expression of the proteins. Expression of the polypeptides may be constitutive such that they are continually produced, or inducible, requiring a stimulus to initiate expression. In the case of inducible expression, protein production can be initiated when required by, for example, addition of an inducer substance to the culture medium, for example dexamethasone or IPTG. ","Polypeptides can be extracted from host cells by a variety of techniques known in the art, including enzymatic, chemical and\/or osmotic lysis and physical disruption.","Polypeptides may also be produced recombinantly in an in vitro cell-free system, such as the TnT\u2122 (Promega) rabbit reticulocyte system.","Fve Nucleic Acid Molecules","We disclose a nucleic molecule that: a) has a strand that encodes an Fve polypeptide disclosed here, b) has a strand that is complementary with a strand as described in a) above; or c) has a strand that hybridises with a molecule as described in a) or b) above.","Unless the context indicates otherwise, such nucleic acid molecules, which are included within the term \u201cFve nucleic acid molecule\u201d may have one or more of the following characteristics:","1) They may be DNA or RNA (including variants of naturally occurring DNA or RNA structures, which have non-naturally occurring bases and\/or non-naturally occurring backbones).","2) They may be single-stranded or double-stranded (or in some cases higher stranded, e.g. triple-stranded).","3) They may be provided in recombinant form i.e. covalently linked to a heterologous 5\u2032 and\/or 3\u2032 flanking sequence to provide a chimeric molecule (e.g. a vector) that does not occur in nature.","4) They may be provided with or without 5\u2032 and\/or 3\u2032 flanking sequences that normally occur in nature. ","5) They may be provided in substantially pure form, e.g. by using probes to isolate cloned molecules having a desired target sequence or by using chemical synthesis techniques. Thus they may be provided in a form that is substantially free from contaminating proteins and\/or from other nucleic acids.","6) They may be provided with introns (e.g. as a full-length gene) or without introns (e.g. as DNA).","7) They may be provided in linear or non-linear (e.g. circular) form.","These Fve molecules include not only molecules with classical DNA or RNA structures, but also variants with modified (non-phosphodiester) backbones\u2014e.g. morpholino derivatives and peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), which contain an N-(2-aminoethyl)glycine-based pseudopeptide backbone. (See Nielsen, P. E., Annual Review of Biophysics & Biomolecular Structure, 24:167-83 (1995)). Nucleic acid variants with modified backbones can have increased stability relative to unmodified nucleic acids and are particularly useful where hybridisation is desired over a relatively long period (e.g. in antisense therapy).","Nucleic acid molecules and uses thereof are discussed in further detail below:","a) Coding Nucleic Acid Molecules","The Fve polypeptides can be coded for by a large variety of nucleic acid molecules, taking into account the well-known degeneracy of the genetic code.

These methods include topical application of the nucleic acid in an appropriate vehicle, for example in solution in a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, such as phosphate buffered saline (PBS). They also include particle bombardment (which is sometimes known as \u201cgene gun\u201d technology and is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,371,015). Here inert particles, such as gold beads coated with a nucleic acid, can be accelerated at speeds sufficient to enable them to penetrate cells. They can be used for example to penetrate the skin of a patient and may be administered by means of discharge under high pressure from a projecting device. Other physical methods of administering the Fve nucleic acid directly to a recipient include ultrasound, electrical stimulation (including iontophoresis) and microseeding (see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5,697,901). Alternatively, the Fve nucleic acid molecules may simply be injected at appropriate site (e.g. muscle). They may be incorporated in or on a carrier (which may be a lipid-based carrier, such as a liposome).","Fve nucleic acid molecules may be introduced into host cells (optionally in the form of vectors) to enable the expression of polypeptides. Alternatively, cell-free expression systems may be used. By using an appropriate expression system the Fve polypeptides can be produced in a desired form. For example, the Fve polypeptides can be produced by micro-organisms such as bacteria or yeast, by cultured insect cells (which may be baculovirus-infected), by mammalian cells (such as CHO cells) or by transgenic animals that, for instance, secrete the Fve proteins in milk (see e.g. international patent application WO88\/00239). Where glycosylation is desired, eukaryotic (e.g. mammalian or insect) expression systems are preferred.","Whatever means is used to obtain expression, transcriptional and translational control sequences will normally be present and will be operatively linked to a sequence encoding a polypeptide to be expressed. These control sequences may be heterologous to  the sequence encoding the Fve polypeptide or may be found associated with it in vivo. Promoter, operator and\/or enhancer sequences may, for example, be provided, as may polyadenylation sites, splice sites, stop and start codons, upstream and downstream regulatory regions, etc. If desired, a constitutive promoter may be provided. Alternatively, a regulatable promoter may be provided to enable transcription to be controlled by administration of a regulator. The promoter (if present) may be tissue-specific or non tissue-specific.","Polypeptides comprising N-terminal methionine may be produced using certain expression systems, whilst in others the mature polypeptide may lack this residue. Fve polypeptides may initially be expressed so as to include signal sequences. Different signal sequences may be provided for different expression systems. Alternatively, signal sequences may be absent, if not needed.","Once expressed, Fve polypeptides may be purified by a wide variety of techniques. Purification techniques may be used under reducing conditions (in order prevent disulphide bond formation) or non-reducing conditions. Available purification techniques include, for example, electrophoretic techniques, such as SDS PAGE (see e.g. Hunkapiller et al, 91:227 (1983), which discloses \u201cIsolation of microgram quantities of proteins from polyacrylamide gels for amino acid sequence analysis.\u201d); affinity techniques (e.g. immunoaffinity chromatography); HPLC; gel filtration; ion-exchange chromatography, isoelectric focussing; etc. If desired, combinations of different purification steps may be used and\/or individual purification steps may be repeated.","In summary, techniques for cloning, expressing and purifying polypeptides are well known to the skilled person. Various such techniques are disclosed in standard text-books, such as in Sambrook et al [2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1989)]; in Old & Primrose [5th Edition, Blackwell Scientific Publications (1994)]; and in Stryer [4th Edition, W H Freeman and Company (1995)]. ","b) Complementary Nucleic Acid Molecules","We also describe nucleic acid strands complementary thereto, whether or not the coding and complementary strands are associated in a duplex. Thus, for example, mRNA and cDNA molecules are included.","c) Hybridising Nucleic Acid Molecules","Nucleic acid molecules that can hybridise to one or more of the Fve nucleic acid molecules discussed above are also disclosed. Such nucleic acid molecules are referred to herein as \u201chybridising\u201d nucleic acid molecules. Desirably hybridising molecules are at least 10 nucleotides in length and preferably are at least 20, at least 50, at least 100, or at least 200 nucleotides in length.","A hybridising nucleic acid molecule may have a high degree of sequence identity along its length with a nucleic acid molecule within the scope of b) or a) above (e.g. at least 50%, at least 75% or at least 90% sequence identity), although this is not essential. The greater the degree of sequence identity that a given single stranded nucleic acid molecule has with a strand of a nucleic acid molecule, the greater the likelihood that it will hybridise to the complement of said strand.","Most preferably, hybridising nucleic acid molecules hybridise to either DNA strand of a Fve nucleic acid, for example a sequence shown in Appendix A, or to an RNA equivalent thereof, or to a strand that is complementary to either of the aforesaid strands.","Hybridising nucleic acid molecules can be useful as probes or primers, for example.","Probes can be used to purify and\/or to identify Fve nucleic acids. They may be used in diagnosis. For example, probes may be used to determine whether or not an organism such as a fungus has a wild-type gene encoding a Fve polypeptide described here, or whether or not one or more deletions, insertions and\/or replacements of bases relative to  the wild-type sequence are present. It may therefore be used to identify organisms that do not express Fve polypeptides or that express Fve polypeptides having reduced activity (including inactive polypeptides).","Primers are useful in synthesising nucleic acids or parts thereof based upon a template to which a probe hybridises. They can be used in techniques such as PCR to provide large numbers of nucleic acid molecules.","Hybridising molecules also include antisense strands. These hybridise with \u201csense\u201d strands so as to inhibit transcription and\/or translation. An antisense strand can be synthesised based upon knowledge of a sense strand and base pairing rules. It may be exactly complementary with a sense strand, although it should be noted that exact complementarity is not always essential. It may also be produced by genetic engineering, whereby a part of a DNA molecule is provided in an antisense orientation relative to a promoter and is then used to transcribe RNA molecules. Large numbers of antisense molecules can be provided (e.g. by cloning, by transcription, by PCR, by reverse PCR, etc.","Hybridising molecules include ribozymes. Ribozymes can also be used to regulate expression by binding to and cleaving RNA molecules that include particular target sequences recognised by the ribozymes. Ribozymes can be regarded as special types of antisense molecule. They are discussed, for example, by Haselhoff and Gerlach (Nature (1988) 334:585-91).","Antisense molecules may be DNA or RNA molecules. They may be used in antisense therapy to prevent or reduce undesired expression or activity. Antisense molecules may be administered directly to a patient (e.g. by injection). Alternatively, they may be synthesised in situ via a vector that has been administered to a patient.","In addition to the uses described above, the Fve nucleic acid molecules disclosed here (of whatever nature) may be used in screening. Screening can be done to identify moieties that bind to said nucleic acid molecules (e.g. to identify hybridising molecules). It  can also be done to identify moieties that affect transcription or translation from said nucleic acid molecules.","It can be used to analyse expression, including analysing expression levels or expression patterns (e.g. by analysing mRNA or cDNA), etc. It can be used to identify particular nucleic acid molecules in a sample. This is useful for in identifying biological material from a given source (e.g. from a human or non-human animal). For example, a reference nucleic acid molecule (or part of it) can be digested with restriction enzymes and the resultant nucleic acid fragments can be run on a gel. This can provide a restriction fragment pattern or \u201cfingerprint\u201d that can be compared with a sample. If the comparison provides a match that is unlikely to have occurred by chance, a conclusion can be reached that the sample and the reference molecule are likely to have originated from a common source. By performing statistical analysis a specific degree of confidence that such a conclusion is correct can be provided.","We also describe a library having a Fve nucleic acid molecule described here, as well as an array comprising such an Fve nucleic acid molecule (which may be a library). Preferably the array is a regular array. The array may have a predetermined pattern. It may have a grid-like pattern. The discussion provided herein in respect of libraries and arrays comprising a polypeptide described here applies to libraries and arrays comprising the corresponding nucleic acid molecule.","One or more Fve nucleic acid molecules may be immobilised upon a surface (e.g. the surface of a bead or a chip). The surface may, for example, be silicon surface, glass, quartz, a membrane, etc. Techniques for immobilising nucleic acid molecules upon a surface are known and are disclosed, for example, in EP-A-0487104, WO96\/04404, WO90\/02205, WO96\/12014, WO98\/44151. In some cases they may include a step of nucleic acid amplification, which may involve PCR. Immobilisation is not however essential. For example nucleic acids may be provided in wells or other containment means (e.g. in a fluid environment). ","The Fve nucleic acids may be used in various ways. For example, sequence information can be used in predicting structure and\/or function, in homology or identity studies, etc.","Vectors","As indicated above the nucleic acid molecules described here may be provided in the form of vectors.","Vectors comprising such nucleic acid include plasmids, phasmids, cosmids, viruses (including bacteriophages), YACs, PACs, etc. They will usually include an origin of replication and may include one or more selectable markers e.g. drug resistance markers and\/or markers enabling growth on a particular medium. A vector may include a marker that is inactivated when a nucleic acid molecule, such as the ones described here, is inserted into the vector. Here a further marker may be provided that is different from the marker that is inactivated (e.g. it encodes a different type of drug resistance).","Vectors may include one or more regions necessary for transcription of RNA encoding a polypeptide. Such vectors are often referred to as expression vectors. They will usually contain a promoter and may contain additional regulatory regions\u2014e.g. operator sequences, enhancer sequences, etc. Translation can be provided by a host cell or by a cell free expression system.","Vectors need not be used for expression. They may be provided for maintaining a given nucleic acid sequence, for replicating that sequence, for manipulating, it or for transferring it between different locations (e.g. between different organisms).","Large nucleic acid molecules may be incorporated into high capacity vectors (e.g. cosmids, phasmids, YACs or PACs). Smaller nucleic acid molecules may be incorporated into a wide variety of vectors. ","Fve polynucleotides, for example those described here, can be incorporated into a recombinant replicable vector. The vector may be used to replicate the nucleic acid in a compatible host cell. Thus in a further embodiment, we provide a method of making polynucleotides by introducing a polynucleotide into a replicable vector, introducing the vector into a compatible host cell, and growing the host cell under conditions which bring about replication of the vector. The vector may be recovered from the host cell. Suitable host cells include bacteria such as , yeast, mammalian cell lines and other eukaryotic cell lines, for example insect Sf9 cells.","Preferably, a polynucleotide in a vector is operably linked to a control sequence that is capable of providing for the expression of the coding sequence by the host cell, i.e. the vector is an expression vector. The term \u201coperably linked\u201d means that the components described are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. A regulatory sequence \u201coperably linked\u201d to a coding sequence is ligated in such a way that expression of the coding sequence is achieved under condition compatible with the control sequences.","The control sequences may be modified, for example by the addition of further transcriptional regulatory elements to make the level of transcription directed by the control sequences more responsive to transcriptional modulators.","Vectors may be transformed or transfected into a suitable host cell as described below to provide for expression of a protein. This process may comprise culturing a host cell transformed with an expression vector as described above under conditions to provide for expression by the vector of a coding sequence encoding the protein, and optionally recovering the expressed protein. Vectors will be chosen that are compatible with the host cell used.","The vectors may be for example, plasmid or virus vectors provided with an origin of replication, optionally a promoter for the expression of the said polynucleotide and optionally a regulator of the promoter. The vectors may contain one or more selectable  marker genes, for example an ampicillin resistance gene in the case of a bacterial plasmid or a neomycin resistance gene for a mammalian vector. Vectors may be used, for example, to transfect or transform a host cell.","Control sequences operably linked to sequences encoding the polypeptide include promoters\/enhancers and other expression regulation signals. These control sequences may be selected to be compatible with the host cell for which the expression vector is designed to be used in. The term promoter is well-known in the art and encompasses nucleic acid regions ranging in size and complexity from minimal promoters to promoters including upstream elements and enhancers.","The promoter is typically selected from promoters which are functional in mammalian cells, although prokaryotic promoters and promoters functional in other eukaryotic cells, such as insect cells, may be used. The promoter is typically derived from promoter sequences of viral or eukaryotic genes. For example, it may be a promoter derived from the genome of a cell in which expression is to occur. With respect to eukaryotic promoters, they may be promoters that function in a ubiquitous manner (such as promoters of \u03b1-actin, \u03b2-actin, tubulin) or, alternatively, a tissue-specific manner (such as promoters of the genes for pyruvate kinase). They may also be promoters that respond to specific stimuli, for example promoters that bind steroid hormone receptors. Viral promoters may also be used, for example the Moloney murine leukaemia virus long terminal repeat (MMLV LTR) promoter, the rous sarcoma virus (RSV) LTR promoter or the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) IE promoter.","It may also be advantageous for the promoters to be inducible so that the levels of expression of the heterologous gene can be regulated during the life-time of the cell. Inducible means that the levels of expression obtained using the promoter can be regulated.","In addition, any of these promoters may be modified by the addition of further regulatory sequences, for example enhancer sequences. Chimeric promoters may also be  used comprising sequence elements from two or more different promoters described above.","Polynucleotides may also be inserted into the vectors described above in an antisense orientation to provide for the production of antisense RNA. Antisense RNA or other antisense polynucleotides may also be produced by synthetic means. Such antisense polynucleotides may be used in a method of controlling the levels of RNAs transcribed from genes comprising any one of the polynucleotides described here.","Host Cells","Vectors and polynucleotides or nucleic acids comprising or encoding Fve nucleic acids, fragments, homologues, variants or derivatives thereof may be introduced into host cells for the purpose of replicating the vectors\/polynucleotides and\/or expressing the polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotides. Although the polypeptides may be produced using prokaryotic cells as host cells, it is preferred to use eukaryotic cells, for example yeast, insect or mammalian cells, in particular mammalian cells.","Vectors\/polynucleotides may be introduced into suitable host cells using a variety of techniques known in the art, such as transfection, transformation and electroporation. Where vectors\/polynucleotides are to be administered to animals, several techniques are known in the art, for example infection with recombinant viral vectors such as retroviruses, herpes simplex viruses and adenoviruses, direct injection of nucleic acids and biolistic transformation.","We therefore further disclose cells comprising Fve nucleic acid molecules or vectors. These may for example be used for expression, as described herein.","A cell capable of expressing a Fve polypeptide described here can be cultured and used to provide the Fve polypeptide, which can then be purified. ","Alternatively, the cell may be used in therapy for the same purposes as the Fve polypeptide. For example, cells may be provided from a patient (e.g. via a biopsy), transfected with a nucleic acid molecule or vector and, if desired, cultured in vitro, prior to being returned to the patient (e.g. by injection). The cells can then produce the Fve polypeptide in vivo. Preferably the cells comprise a regulatable promoter enabling transcription to be controlled via administration of one or more regulator molecules. If desired, the promoter may be tissue specific.","Expression is not however essential since the cells may be provided simply for maintaining a given nucleic acid sequence, for replicating the sequence, for manipulating it, etc.","Such cells may be provided in any appropriate form. For example, they may be provided in isolated form, in culture, in stored form, etc. Storage may, for example, involve cryopreservation, buffering, sterile conditions, etc. Such cells may be provided by gene cloning techniques, by stem cell technology or by any other means. They may be part of a tissue or an organ, which may itself be provided in any of the forms discussed above. The cell, tissue or organ may be stored and used later for implantation, if desired. Techniques for providing tissues or organs, include stem cell technology, the provision of cells tissues or organs from transgenic animals, retroviral and non-retroviral techniques for introducing nucleic acids, etc.","In some case cells may be provided together with other material to aid the structure or function or of an implant. For example scaffolds may be provided to hold cells in position, to provide mechanical strength, etc. These may be in the form of matrixes of biodegradable or non-biodegradable material. WO95\/01810 describes various materials that can be used for this purpose. ","Animals","We also disclose transgenic animals, preferably non-human transgenic animals. Such animals may be useful for producing the particular Fve polypeptides described here (e.g. via secretion in milk, as described herein). Alternatively, they may be useful as test animals for analysing the effect(s) of such Fve polypeptides.","Techniques for producing transgenic animals are well known and are described e.g. in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,870,009 and 4,873,191. For example, a nucleic acid encoding a Fve polypeptide of interest may be microinjected into a pronucleus of a fertilised oocyte. The oocyte may then be allowed to develop in a pseudopregnant female foster animal. The animal resulting from development of the oocyte can be tested (e.g. with antibodies) to determine whether or not it expresses the particular polypeptide. Alternatively, it can be tested with a probe to determine if it has a transgene (even if there is no expression).","A transgenic animal can be used as a founder animal, which may be bred from in order to produce further transgenic animals. Two transgenic animals may be crossed. For example, in some cases transgenic animals may be haploid for a given gene and it may be desired to try to provide a diploid offspring via crossing.","A transgenic animal may be cloned, e.g. by using the procedures set out in WO97\/07668 and WO97\/07699 (see also Nature 385:810-813 (1997)). Thus a quiescent cell can be provided and combined with an oocyte from which the nucleus has been removed combined. This can be achieved using electrical discharges. The resultant cell can be allowed to develop in culture and can then be transferred to a pseudopregnant female.","Analytical Tools and Systems","We disclose a moiety comprising a Fve polypeptide, a Fve nucleic acid, a vector comprising Fve, a cell expressing Fve, an Fve binding agent, a moiety  identified\/identifiable by a screen as described here, when used as an analytical tool or when present in a system suitable for analysis, especially high throughput analysis.","Such an analytical tool or system is useful for a plethora of different purposes. These include diagnosis, forensic science, screening, the identification or characterisation of individuals or populations, preventative medicine, etc.","Libraries comprising such a Fve moiety may be used for the above purposes. A library will generally comprise a plurality of heterologous moieties. Preferred libraries comprise at least 100, at least 10,000, at least 1,000,000, or at least 1,000,000,000 heterologous moieties. Desirably a moiety is provided at a predetermined position within a library. In some cases a plurality of moieties may be present within a library at predetermined positions. A predetermined position may be assigned spatial co-ordinates. These may be stored or processed in a computer in order to assist in analysis.","We further disclose an array comprising such a Fve moiety (whether or not the array is also a library). Preferably the array is a regular array. The array may have a predetermined pattern. It may have a grid-like pattern Preferred arrays comprise at least 100, at least 10,000, at least 1,000,000, or at least 1,000,000,000 components.","A library or array may include naturally occurring moieties, non-naturally occurring moieties, or a mixture of naturally occurring and non-naturally occurring moieties. The moieties may provided in solution, on beads, on chips (see e.g. Fodor (1993) Nature 364:555-556), on bacteria (see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409), on spores (see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409), on phage (see e.g. Scott and Smith (1990) Science 249:386-90 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409), etc.","Such Fve moieties may be immobilised upon a surface, if desired. For example, one or more nucleic acid molecules may be immobilised upon a surface (e.g. the surface of a bead or a chip). The surface may, for example, be silicon, glass, quartz, a membrane, etc. Techniques for immobilising nucleic acid molecules upon a surface are known and are  disclosed, for example, in EP-A-0487104, WO96\/04404, WO90\/02205, WO96\/12014, WO98\/44151. In some cases they may include a step of nucleic acid amplification, and may involve PCR.","Immobilisation is not however essential, even if moieties are to be used in high throughput analysis. For example, they may be provided in wells, channels, grooves or other containment means.","Whether or not present in a library, an array or in immobilised or non-immobilised form, it is often desirable to locate the position of one or more moieties being analysed or being used in analysis. This can be done by assigning it spatial co-ordinates, which may be provided, stored or processed or provided by a computer. In some cases the location may be determined by a sensor (e.g. a CCD device), which may be operatively linked with a computer.","DNA Vaccines","Any of the Fve nucleic acids disclosed here may be administered to an individual in the form of a DNA vaccine. DNA vaccines are known in the art, and are described in detail in, for example, WO03012117, WO03007986, etc.","The Fve may be administered to an individual in the form of a DNA vaccine. A DNA encoding the Fve, for example, a Fve nucleic acid as disclosed here, may be in any form, for example in the form of a cloned plasmid DNA or a synthetic oligonucleotide. The DNA may be delivered together with a cytokine, for example, IL-2, and\/or other co-stimulatory molecules. The cytokines and\/or co-stimulatory molecules may themselves be delivered in the form of plasmid or oligonucleotide DNA.","The response to a DNA vaccine has been shown to be increased by the presence of immunostimulatory DNA sequences (ISS). These can take the form of hexameric motifs containing methylated CpG, according to the formula: 5\u2032 purine-purine-CG-pyrimidine-pyrimidine-3\u2032. The DNA vaccines may incorporate these or other ISSs, in the DNA encoding the Fve, in the DNA encoding the cytokine or other co-stimulatory molecules, or in both. A review of the advantages of DNA vaccination is provided by Tighe et al (1998, Immunology Today, 19(2), 89-97).","Antibodies","We also provide monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to polypeptides or fragments thereof Thus, we further provide a process for the production of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to an Fve polypeptide, fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof","If polyclonal antibodies are desired, a selected mammal (e.g., mouse, rabbit, goat, horse, etc.) is immunised with an immunogenic polypeptide bearing an epitope(s) from a polypeptide. Serum from the immunised animal is collected and treated according to known procedures. If serum containing polyclonal antibodies to an epitope from a polypeptide contains antibodies to other antigens, the polyclonal antibodies can be purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. Techniques for producing and processing polyclonal antisera are known in the art. In order that such antibodies may be made, we also provide polypeptides or fragments thereof haptenised to another polypeptide for use as immunogens in animals or humans.","Monoclonal antibodies directed against epitopes in the polypeptides can also be readily produced by one skilled in the art. The general methodology for making monoclonal antibodies by hybridomas is well known. Immortal antibody-producing cell lines can be created by cell fusion, and also by other techniques such as direct transformation of B lymphocytes with oncogenic DNA, or transfection with Epstein-Barr virus. Panels of monoclonal antibodies produced against epitopes in the polypeptides can be screened for various properties; i.e., for isotype and epitope affinity. ","An alternative technique involves screening phage display libraries where, for example the phage express scFv fragments on the surface of their coat with a large variety of complementarity determining regions (CDRs). This technique is well known in the art.","Antibodies, both monoclonal and polyclonal, which are directed against epitopes from polypeptides are particularly useful in diagnosis, and those which are neutralising are useful in passive immunotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies, in particular, may be used to raise anti-idiotype antibodies. Anti-idiotype antibodies are immunoglobulins which carry an \u201cinternal image\u201d of the antigen of the agent against which protection is desired.","Techniques for raising anti-idiotype antibodies are known in the art. These anti-idiotype antibodies may also be useful in therapy.","For the purposes of this document, the term \u201cantibody\u201d, unless specified to the contrary, includes fragments of whole antibodies which retain their binding activity for a target antigen. Such fragments include Fv, F(ab\u2032) and F(ab\u2032)fragments, as well as single chain antibodies (scFv). Furthermore, the antibodies and fragments thereof may be humanised antibodies, for example as described in BP-A-239400.","Antibodies may be used in method of detecting polypeptides present in biological samples by a method which comprises: (a) providing an antibody, (b) incubating a biological sample with said antibody under conditions which allow for the formation of an antibody-antigen complex; and (c) determining whether antibody-antigen complex comprising said antibody is formed.","Suitable samples include extracts tissues such as brain, breast, ovary, lung, colon, pancreas, testes, liver, muscle and bone tissues or from neoplastic growths derived from such tissues.","Antibodies may be bound to a solid support and\/or packaged into kits in a suitable container along with suitable reagents, controls, instructions and the like. ","Assays","We disclose assays that are suitable for identifying substances which bind to Fve polypeptides, or fragments, homologues, variants or derivatives thereof","In general, such binding assays involve exposing a Fve polypeptide, nucleic acid, or a fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof to a candidate molecule and detecting an interaction or binding between the Fve polypeptide, nucleic acid, or a fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof and the candidate molecule. The binding assay may be conducted in vitro, or in vivo.","We disclose assays for identifying substances which are capable of potentiating the activities of Fve polypeptide. Activities of Fve have been described in detail above. Such compounds may be employed as agonists of Fve polypeptide, and may for example be co-administered to an individual to enhance any desired effect.","In general, an assay to identify such substances or compounds involves providing a cell or organism, exposing the cell or organism to a Fve polypeptide, nucleic acid, or a fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof, exposing the cell to a candidate molecule, and detecting an effect associated with Fve. Any Fve polypeptide mediated effect or funciton, as disclosed in this document, particularly the Examples, may be detected.","In particular, the Fve polypeptide mediated effect is preferably chosen from the group consisting of: up-regulation of expression of Th1 cytokines, preferably IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, down-regulation of expression of Th2 cytokines, preferably IL-4 and IL-13, hemagglutination activity, cell aggregation activity, lymphocyte aggregation activity, lymphoproliferation activity, up-regulation of expression of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, but not IL-4 in CD3 T cells, interaction with T and NK cells, adjuvant activity, stimulation of CD3 CD16 CD56 natural killer (NK) T cells, up-regulation of expression of allergen  specific IgG2a antibody, prevention of systemic anaphylactic reactions and\/or descreased footpad edema, prefereably as assayed using the Arthus reaction (Ko et al, 1995).","In order to identify agonists, an additive or preferably synergistic effect is detected. Thus, while Fve polypeptide on its own is, for example, capable of reducing a level or number, or down-regulation of expression of a molecule, the assays identify molecules which further reduce the level, number or further down-regulate the expression of a molecule. Thus, preferably, the candidate molecule in conjunction with the Fve polypeptide, nucleic acid, or a fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof, down-regulates the expression of, or reduces the level or number, by more than 10%, more than 20%, more than 30%, more than 40%, more than 50%, more than 60%, more than 70%, more than 80%, more than 90%, or more compared to an Fve polypeptide on its own. Thus, for example, a candidate molecule suitable for use as an agonist is one which is capable of enhancing by 10% more the up-regulation of expression of Th1 cytokines, preferably IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, achieved by Fve polypeptide on its own.","Conversely, assays to identify antagonists involve the detection of a reduction in Fve polypeptide mediated effect. Preferably, the down-regulation of expression or reduction in number or level achieved by Fve polypeptide is reduced in the presence of a suitable candidate molecule. Preferably, the reduction is at least 10%, preferably at least 20%, preferably at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, preferably at least 50%, preferably at least 60%, preferably at least 70%, preferably at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, or more compared to an Fve polypeptide on its own. Thus, for example, a candidate molecule suitable for use as an antagonist is one which is capable of reducing by 10% more the up-regulation of expression of Th1 cytokines, preferably IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, achieved by Fve polypeptide on its own.","As an illustration, if N1 is the expression of Th1 cytokines, in an untreated organism or cell, and N2 the expression in an organism or cell exposed to Fve polypeptide, nucleic acid, or a fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof, the expression of Th1 cytoldnes is increased by R=(N2\u2212N1)\/N1\u00d7100%. Agonists increase R, by a factor x,  where x is greater than 1 (e.g., x=1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 etc); while antagonists decrease R, by a factor x, where x is less than 1 (e.g., x=0.9, 0.9, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1 etc).","For example, an organism may be exposed to a Fve polypeptide, nucleic acid, or a fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof and a candidate molecule, and any of the biological activities as set out above, or any combination, detected. Preferred candidate molecules are those which provide an additive or synergistic effect in combination with Fve.","Also disclosed are assays to identify antagonists of Fve polypeptide. Such assays involve detecting a reduced effect on exposure of a cell or organism to an Fve polypeptide, nucleic acid, or a fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof in conjunction with a candidate molecule.","In a preferred embodiment, the assays are conducted on whole organisms rather than cells. Preferably, the organism is one which suffers from a disease as disclosed in this document, or exhibits one or more symptoms of such a disease.","Candidate Molecules","Suitable candidate molecules for use in the above assays include peptides, especially of from about 5 to 30 or 10 to 25 amino acids in size. Peptides from panels of peptides comprising random sequences or sequences which have been varied consistently to provide a maximally diverse panel of peptides may be used.","Suitable candidate molecules also include antibody products (for example, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, single chain antibodies, chimeric antibodies and CDR-grafted antibodies). Furthermore, combinatorial libraries, peptide and peptide mimetics, defined chemical entities, oligonucleotides, and natural product libraries may be screened for activity. The candidate molecules may be used in an initial screen in batches  of, for example 10 types of molecules per reaction, and the molecules of those batches which show enhancement or reduction of a Fve polypeptide mediated effect tested individually.","Libraries","Libraries of candidate molecules, such as libraries of polypeptides or nucleic acids, maybe employed in the methods and compositions described here. Such libraries are exposed a cell or organism in the presence of a Fve polypeptide, nucleic acid, or a fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof, and an Fve polypeptide mediated effect detected and assayed as described above.","Selection protocols for isolating desired members of large libraries are known in the art, as typified by phage display techniques. Such systems, in which diverse peptide sequences are displayed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage (Scott and Smith (1990 supra), have proven useful for creating libraries of antibody fragments (and the nucleotide sequences that encoding them) for the in vitro selection and amplification of specific antibody fragments that bind a target antigen. The nucleotide sequences encoding the Vand Vregions are linked to gene fragments which encode leader signals that direct them to the periplasmic space of and as a result the resultant antibody fragments are displayed on the surface of the bacteriophage, typically as fusions to bacteriophage coat proteins (e.g., pIII or pVIII). Alternatively, antibody fragments are displayed externally on lambda phage capsids (phagebodies). An advantage of phage-based display systems is that, because they are biological systems, selected library members can be amplified simply by growing the phage containing the selected library member in bacterial cells. Furthermore, since the nucleotide sequence that encodes the polypeptide library member is contained on a phage or phagemid vector, sequencing, expression and subsequent genetic manipulation is relatively straightforward.","Methods for the construction of bacteriophage antibody display libraries and lambda phage expression libraries are well known in the art (McCafferty et al. (1990)  supra; Kang et al. (1991) 88: 4363; Clackson et al. (1991) 352: 624; Lowman et al. (1991) 30: 10832; Burton et al. (1991) 88: 10134; Hoogenboom et al. (1991) Nucleic Acids Res., 19: 4133; Chang et al. (1991) 147: 3610; Breitling et al. (1991) 104: 147; Marks et al. (1991) supra; Barbas et al. (1992) supra; Hawkins and Winter (1992) 22: 867; Marks et al., 1992, 267: 16007; Lerner et al. (1992) 258: 1313, incorporated herein by reference). Such techniques may be modified if necessary for the expression generally of polypeptide libraries.","One particularly advantageous approach has been the use of scFv phage-libraries (Bird, R. E., et al. (1988) 242: 423-6, Huston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U.S.A., 85: 5879-5883; Chaudhary et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U.S.A., 87: 1066-1070; McCafferty et al. (1990) supra; Clackson et al. (1991) supra; Marks et al. (1991) supra; Chiswell et al. (1992) Trends Biotech., 10: 80; Marks et al. (1992) supra). Various embodiments of scFv libraries displayed on bacteriophage coat proteins have been described. Refinements of phage display approaches are also known, for example as described in WO96\/06213 and WO92\/01047 (Medical Research Council et al.) and WO97\/08320 (Morphosys, supra), which are incorporated herein by reference.","Alternative library selection technologies include bacteriophage lambda expression systems, which may be screened directly as bacteriophage plaques or as colonies of lysogens, both as previously described (Huse et al. (1989) 246: 1275; Caton and Koprowski (1990) 87; Mullinax et al. (1990) 87: 8095; Persson et al. (1991) 88: 2432) and are of use. These expression systems may be used to screen a large number of different members of a library, in the order of about 10or even more. Other screening systems rely, for example, on direct chemical synthesis of library members. One early method involves the synthesis of peptides on a set of pins or rods, such as described in WO84\/03564. A similar method involving peptide synthesis on beads, which forms a peptide library in which each bead is an individual library member, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,211 and a related method is described in WO92\/00091. A significant improvement  of the bead-based methods involves tagging each bead with a unique identifier tag, such as an oligonucleotide, so as to facilitate identification of the amino acid sequence of each library member. These improved bead-based methods are described in WO93\/06121.","Another chemical synthesis method involves the synthesis of arrays of peptides (or peptidomimetics) on a surface in a manner that places each distinct library member (e.g., unique peptide sequence) at a discrete, predefined location in the array. The identity of each library member is determined by its spatial location in the array. The locations in the array where binding interactions between a predetermined molecule (e.g.; a receptor) and reactive library members occur is determined, thereby identifying the sequences of the reactive library members on the basis of spatial location. These methods are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,854; WO90\/15070 and WO92\/10092; Fodor et al. (1991) 251: 767; Dower and Fodor (1991) 26: 271.","Other systems for generating libraries of polypeptides or nucleotides involve the use of cell-free enzymatic machinery for the in vitro synthesis of the library members. In one method, RNA molecules are selected by alternate rounds of selection against a target ligand and PCR amplification (Tuerk and Gold (1990) 249: 505; Ellington and Szostak (1990) 346: 818). A similar technique may be used to identify DNA sequences which bind a predetermined human transcription factor (Thiesen and Bach (1990) 18: 3203; Beaudry and Joyce (1992) 257: 635; WO92\/05258 and WO92\/14843). In a similar way, in vitro translation can be used to synthesise polypeptides as a method for generating large libraries. These methods which generally comprise stabilised polysome complexes, are described further in WO88\/08453, WO90\/05785, WO90\/07003, WO91\/02076, WO91\/05058, and WO92\/02536. Alternative display systems which are not phage-based, such as those disclosed in WO95\/22625 and WO95\/11922 (Affymax) use the polysomes to display polypeptides for selection. These and all the foregoing documents also are incorporated herein by reference. ","Combinatorial Libraries","Libraries, in particular, libraries of candidate molecules, may suitably be in the form of combinatorial libraries (also known as combinatorial chemical libraries).","A \u201ccombinatorial library\u201d, as the term is used in this document, is a collection of multiple species of chemical compounds that consist of randomly selected subunits. Combinatorial libraries may be screened for molecules which are capable of potentiating, enhancing, reducing or minimising the a Fve polypeptide mediated effect when exposed to a cell or organism.","Various combinatorial libraries of chemical compounds are currently available, including libraries active against proteolytic and non-proteolytic enzymes, libraries of agonists and antagonists of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), libraries active against non-GPCR targets (e.g., integrins, ion channels, domain interactions, nuclear receptors, and transcription factors) and libraries of whole-cell oncology and anti-infective targets, among others. A comprehensive review of combinatorial libraries, in particular their construction and uses is provided in Dolle and Nelson (1999), , Vol 1 No 4, 235-282. Reference is also made to (edited by Shmuel Cabilly, Totowa, N.J.: Humana Press, c1998. ; v. 87).","Further references describing chemical combinatorial libraries, their production and use include those available from the URL http:\/\/www.netsci.org\/Science\/Combichem\/, including The Chemical Generation of Molecular Diversity.

DeWitt, Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research, Division of Warner-Lambert Company (Published November, 1995); and The Impact of High Throughput Organic Synthesis on R&D in Bio-Based Industries, John P. Devlin (published March, 1996).","Techniques in combinatorial chemistry are gaining wide acceptance among modern methods for the generation of new pharmaceutical leads (Gallop, M. A. et al., 1994, J. Med. Chem. 37:1233-1251; Gordon, E. M. et al., 1994, J. Med. Chem. 37:1385-1401.). One combinatorial approach in use is based on a strategy involving the synthesis of libraries containing a different structure on each particle of the solid phase support, interaction of the library with a soluble receptor, identification of the \u2018bead\u2019 which interacts with the macromolecular target, and determination of the structure carried by the identified \u2018bead\u2019 (Lam, K. S. et al., 1991, Nature 354:82-84). An alternative to this  approach is the sequential release of defined aliquots of the compounds from the solid support, with subsequent determination of activity in solution, identification of the particle from which the active compound was released, and elucidation of its structure by direct sequencing (Salmon, S. E. et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:11708-11712), or by reading its code (Kerr, J. M. et al., 1993, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 115:2529-2531; Nikolaiev, V. et al., 1993, Pept. Res. 6:161-170; Ohlmeyer, M. H. J. et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:10922-10926).","Soluble random combinatorial libraries may be synthesized using a simple principle for the generation of equimolar mixtures of peptides which was first described by Furka (Furka, A. et al., 1988, Xth International Symposium on Medicinal Chemistry, Budapest 1988; Furka, A. et al., 1988, 14th International Congress of Biochemistry, Prague 1988; Furka, A. et al., 1991, Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 37:487-493). The construction of soluble libraries for iterative screening has also been described (Houghten, R. A. et al. 1991, Nature 354:84-86). K. S. Lam disclosed the novel and unexpectedly powerful technique of using insoluble random combinatorial libraries. Lam synthesized random combinatorial libraries on solid phase supports, so that each support had a test compound of uniform molecular structure, and screened the libraries without prior removal of the test compounds from the support by solid phase binding protocols (Lam, K. S. et al., 1991, Nature 354:82-84).","Thus, a library of candidate molecules may be a synthetic combinatorial library (e.g., a combinatorial chemical library), a cellular extract, a bodily fluid (e.g., urine, blood, tears, sweat, or saliva), or other mixture of synthetic or natural products (e.g., a library of small molecules or a fermentation mixture).","A library of molecules may include, for example, amino acids, oligopeptides, polypeptides, proteins, or fragments of peptides or proteins; nucleic acids (e.g., antisense; DNA; RNA; or peptide nucleic acids, PNA); aptamers; or carbohydrates or polysaccharides. Each member of the library can be singular or can be a part of a mixture (e.g., a compressed library). The library may contain purified compounds or can be \u201cdirty\u201d (i.e., containing a significant quantity of impurities). Commercially available libraries (e.g., from Affymetrix, ArQule, Neose Technologies, Sarco, Ciddco, Oxford Asymmetry, Maybridge, Aldrich, Panlabs, Pharmacopoeia, Sigma, or Tripose) may also be used with the methods described here.","In addition to libraries as described above, special libraries called diversity files can be used to assess the specificity, reliability, or reproducibility of the new methods. Diversity files contain a large number of compounds (e.g., 1000 or more small molecules) representative of many classes of compounds that could potentially result in nonspecific detection in an assay. Diversity files are commercially available or can also be assembled from individual compounds commercially available from the vendors listed above.","Candidate Substances","Suitable candidate substances include peptides, especially of from about 5 to 30 or 10 to 25 amino acids in size, based on the sequence of the polypeptides described in the Examples, or variants of such peptides in which one or more residues have been substituted. Peptides from panels of peptides comprising random sequences or sequences which have been varied consistently to provide a maximally diverse panel of peptides may be used.","Suitable candidate substances also include antibody products (for example, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, single chain antibodies, chimeric antibodies and CDR-grafted antibodies) which are specific for a polypeptide. Furthermore, combinatorial libraries, peptide and peptide mimetics, defined chemical entities, oligonucleotides, and natural product libraries may be screened for activity as inhibitors of binding of a polypeptide to the cell division cycle machinery, for example mitotic\/meiotic apparatus (such as microtubules). The candidate substances may be used in an initial screen in batches of, for example 10 substances per reaction, and the substances of those batches which show inhibition tested individually. Candidate substances which show activity in in vitro screens such as those described below can then be tested in whole cell systems, such  as mammalian cells which will be exposed to the inhibitor and tested for inhibition of any of the stages of the cell cycle.","Polypeptide Binding Assays","One type of assay for identifying substances that bind to a polypeptide involves contacting a polypeptide, which is immobilised on a solid support, with a non-immobilised candidate substance determining whether and\/or to what extent the polypeptide and candidate substance bind to each other. Alternatively, the candidate substance may be immobilised and the polypeptide non-immobilised. This may be used to detect substances capable of binding to Fve polypeptides, or fragments, homologues, variants or derivatives thereof","In a preferred assay method, the polypeptide is immobilised on beads such as agarose beads. Typically this is achieved by expressing the Fve polypeptide, or a fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof as a GST-fusion protein in bacteria, yeast or higher eukaryotic cell lines and purifying the GST-fusion protein from crude cell extracts using glutathione-agarose beads (Smith and Johnson, 1988). As a control, binding of the candidate substance, which is not a GST-fusion protein, to the immobilised polypeptide is determined in the absence of the polypeptide. The binding of the candidate substance to the immobilised polypeptide is then determined. This type of assay is known in the art as a GST pulldown assay. Again, the candidate substance may be immobilised and the polypeptide non-immobilised.","It is also possible to perform this type of assay using different affinity purification systems for immobilising one of the components, for example Ni-NTA agarose and histidine-tagged components.","Binding of the Fve polypeptide, or a fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof to the candidate substance may be determined by a variety of methods well-known in the art. For example, the non-immobilised component may be labeled (with for  example, a radioactive label, an epitope tag or an enzyme-antibody conjugate). Alternatively, binding may be determined by immunological detection techniques. For example, the reaction mixture can be Western blotted and the blot probed with an antibody that detects the non-immobilised component. ELISA techniques may also be used.","Candidate substances are typically added to a final concentration of from 1 to 1000 nmol\/ml, more preferably from 1 to 100 nmol\/ml. In the case of antibodies, the final concentration used is typically from 100 to 500 \u03bcg\/ml, more preferably from 200 to 300 \u03bcg\/ml.","Fve Diseases","As disclosed elsewhere in this document, Fve polypeptides, nucleic acids, and fragments, homologues, variants and derivatives thereof, host cells, vectors, DNA vaccines, etc, are suitable for treating or preventing various diseases (here referred to as \u201cFve diseases\u201d). They may be be administered in an amount in the range of 1 microgram to 1 gramme to an average human patient or individual to be vaccinated. It is preferred to use a smaller dose in the ragne of 1 microgram to 1 milligram for each administration, however.","The Fve polypeptides, etc may be adminisstered togeher, either simultaneously or separately with compounds such as cytokines and\/or or growth factors, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), Interleukin 12 (IL-12), GM-CSF or the like in order to strenghthen the immune response. The Fve polypeptides, etc can be used in a vaccine or a therapeutic composition either alone or in combination with other materials, for example, in the form of a lipopeptide conjugate which is known to induce a high-affinity cytotoxic T cell responses (Deres, 1989, Nature 342).","In particular, Fve diseases include allergies and cancer, described in further detail below. ","Cancer","Fve polypeptides, nucleic acids, and fragments, homologues, variants and derivatives thereof, are suitable for treating or preventing cancer.","The terms \u201ccancer\u201d and \u201ccancerous\u201d refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer, small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, glial cell tumors such as glioblastoma and neurofibromatosis, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney cancer, renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma and various types of head and neck cancer. Further examples are solid tumor cancer including colon cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer and prostrate cancer, hematopoietic malignancies including leukemias and lymphomas, Hodgkin's disease, aplastic anemia, skin cancer and familiar adenomatous polyposis.

For example, drugs such as such as adriamycin, daunomycin, cis-platinum, etoposide, taxol, taxotere and alkaloids, such as vincristine, and antimetabolites such as methotrexate. The term \u201ccytotoxic agent\u201d as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and\/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes (e.g. I, Y, Pr), chemotherapeutic agents, and toxins such as enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, or fragments thereof. ","Also, the term includes oncogene product\/tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as the bicyclic ansamycins disclosed in WO 94\/22867; 1,2-bis(arylamino) benzoic acid derivatives disclosed in EP 600832; 6,7-diamino-phthalazin-1-one derivatives disclosed in EP 600831; 4,5-bis(arylamino)-phthalimide derivatives as disclosed in EP 516598; or peptides which inhibit binding of a tyrosine kinase to a SH2-containing substrate protein (see WO 94\/07913, for example).

There are undesirable side effects with long-term steroid therapy. We demonstrate that Fve polypeptide, nucleic acid, or a fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof (as well as DNA vaccines, host cells and transgenic organisms comprising any of these) may be used to alleviate the symptoms of allergy, or to treat allergy. The term \u201callergy\u201d as used here, refers to any allergic reactions such as allergic contact hypersensitivity.","In general, the allergy may be to an allergen from any source, for example, a source known to induce allergenic responses in humans. For example, the allergy may be to a tree pollen allergen, a grass pollen allergen, a weed pollen allergen, a feline antigen, or a fungal allergen. Thus, the allergy may be to a tree pollen allergen, for example Bet v 1 and Bet v 2 from birch tree. The allergy may be to a grass pollen allergen, for example, Phl p 1 and  Phl p 2 from timothy grass. It may be to a weed pollen allergen, for example, antigen E from ragweed. It may be to an animal allergen, for example, a canine or feline antigen. Specifically, it may be to a major feline antigen, for example, Fel d 1. The allergy may be to a fungal allergen, for example a major fungal allergen, for example, Asp f1, Asp f2, and Asp f3 from ","In preferred embodiments, the allergy is to a dust mite allergen, preferably a house dust mite allergen.

The methods described here can therefore be used to prevent the development and establishment of diseases caused by or associated with human immunodeficiency virus, such as HIV-1 and HIV-2.","Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HI) is a retrovirus which infects cells of the immune system, most importantly CD4 T lymphocytes. CD4 T lymphocytes are important, not only in terms of their direct role in immune function, but also in stimulating normal function in other components of the immune system, including CD8 T-lymphocytes. These HIV infected cells have their function disturbed by several mechanisms and\/or are rapidly killed by viral replication. The end result of chronic HIV infection is gradual depletion of CD4 T lymphocytes, reduced immune capacity, and ultimately the development of AIDS, leading to death.","The regulation of HIV gene expression is accomplished by a combination of both cellular and viral factors. HIV gene expression is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. The HIV genes can be divided into the early genes and the late genes. The early genes, Tat, Rev, and Nef, are expressed in a Rev-independent manner. The mRNAs encoding the late genes, Gag, Pol, Env, Vpr, Vpu, and Vif require Rev to be cytoplasmically localized and expressed. HIV transcription is mediated by a single promoter in the 5\u2032 LTR. Expression from the 5\u2032 LTR generates a 9-kb primary transcript that has the potential to encode all nine HIV genes. The primary transcript is roughly 600 bases shorter than the provirus. The primary transcript can be spliced into one of more than  30 mRNA species or packaged without further modification into virion particles (to serve as the viral RNA genome).","Any of the HIV proteins disclosed here may be used as a viral infectious antigen for productions of conjugates and combinations as described above.","Herpes Virus","The combinations and conjugates described here, including Fve polypeptide combinations and conjugates, may be used to treat or prevent Herpesvirus infection. The methods described here can therefore be used to prevent the development and establishment of diseases caused by or associated with herpesvirus, for example HSV-1, HSV-2, HSV-7 and HSV-8.","Particular examples of herpesvirus include: herpes simplex virus 1 (\u201cHSV-1\u201d), herpes simplex virus 2 (\u201cHSV-2\u201d), human cytomegalovirus (\u201cHCMV\u201d), varicella-zoster virus (\u201cVZV\u201d), Epstein-Barr virus (\u201cEBV\u201d), human herpesvirus 6 (\u201cHHV6\u201d), herpes simplex virus 7 (\u201cHSV-7\u201d) and herpes simplex virus 8 (\u201cHSV-8\u201d).","Herpesviruses have also been isolated from horses, cattle, pigs pseudorabies virus (\u201cPSV\u201d) and porcine cytomegalovirus), chickens (infectious larygotracheitis), chimpanzees, birds (Marck's disease herpesvirus 1 and 2), turkeys and fish (see \u201cHerpesviridae: A Brief Introduction\u201d, Virology, Second Edition, edited by B. N. Fields, Chapter 64, 1787 (1990)).","Herpes simplex viral (\u201cHSV\u201d) infection is generally a recurrent viral infection characterized by the appearance on the skin or mucous membranes of single or multiple clusters of small vesicles, filled with clear fluid, on slightly raised inflammatory bases. The herpes simplex virus is a relatively large-sized virus. HSV-2 commonly causes herpes labialis. HSV-2 is usually, though not always, recoverable from genital lesions. Ordinarily, HSV-2 is transmitted venereally. ","Diseases caused by varicella-zoster virus (human herpesvirus 3) include varicella (chickenpox) and zoster (shingles). Cytomegalovirus (human herpesvirus 5) is responsible for cytomegalic inclusion disease in infants. There is presently no specific treatment for treating patients infected with cytomegalovirus. Epstein-Barr virus (human herpesvirus 4) is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis and has been associated with Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Animal herpesviruses which may pose a problem for humans include B virus (herpesvirus of Old World Monkeys) and Marmoset herpesvirus (herpesvirus of New World Monkeys).","Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a human pathogen capable of becoming latent in nerve cells. Like all the other members of Herpesviridae it has a complex architecture and double-stranded linear DNA genome which encodes for variety of viral proteins including DNA pol. and TK.","HSV gene expression proceeds in a sequential and strictly regulated manner and can be divided into at least three phases, termed immediate early (IE or \u03b1), early (\u03b2) and late (\u03b3). The cascade of HSV-1 gene expression starts from IE genes, which are expressed immediately after lytic infection begins. The IE proteins regulate the expression of later classes of genes (early and late) as well as their own expression. The product of IE175k (ICP4) gene is critical for HSV-1 gene regulation and ts mutants in this gene are blocked at IE stage of infection.","The IE genes themselves are activated by a virion structural protein VP16 (expressed late in the replicative cycle and incorporated into HSV particle). All 5 IE genes of HSV-1 (IE110k\u20142 copies\/HSV genome, IE175\u20142 copies\/HSV genome, IE68k, IE63k and IE12k) have at least one copy of a conserved promoter\/enhancer sequence\u2014TAATGARAT. This sequence is recognized by the transactivation complex which consists of; Oct-1, HCF and VP16. The GARAT element is required for efficient transactivation by VP16. This mechanism of gene activation is unique for HSV and despite Oct-1 being a common transcription factor, the Oct-1\/HCF\/VP16 complex activates specifically only HSV IE genes. ","Any of the herpesvirus proteins disclosed here may be used as a viral infectious antigen for productions of conjugates and combinations as described above.","Cytokines","In a further embodiment, the Fve polypeptide, nucleic acid, fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof is used to modulate cytokine levels in an individual. Preferably, the level of inflammatory cytokines is down-regulated. Examples of inflammatory cytokines include Granulocyte-Macrophage-Colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), as well as any cytokine that mediates migration of alveolar macrophages into the lung and act to increase cell proliferation.","The term \u201ccytokine\u201d may be used to refer to any of a number of soluble molecules (e.g., glycoproteins) released by sells of the immune system, which act nonenzymatically through specific receptors to regulate immune responses. Cytokines resemble hormones in that they act at low concentrations bound with high affinity to a specific receptor. Preferably, the term \u201ccytokine\u201d refers to a diverse group of soluble proteins and peptides which act as humoral regulators at nano- to picomolar concentrations and which, either under normal or pathological conditions, modulate the functional activities of individual cells and tissues.","Particular examples of cytokines which are suitable for use in the methods and compositions described include interleukins, lymphokine, interferon, Colony Stimulating Factors (CSFs) such as Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF), Macrophage-Colony stimulating factor (N-CSF) and Granulocyte-Macrophage-Colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), GSF, Platelet-Activating Factors (PAF), Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF).","Thus, interleukins such as IL1, EL2 and IL4, as well as interferons such as IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 are included. Tumour necrosis factors TNF-\u03b1 (cachetin), TNF-\u03b2 (lymphotoxin) may also be suitably employed. ","Preferred cytokines are those which are capable of recruiting immune responses, for example, stimulation of dendritic cell or cytotoxic T cell activity, or which are capable of recruiting macrophages to the target site. In a highly preferred embodiment, the cytokine comprises EL-2, GM-CSF or GSF.","Chemical Coupling","As noted above, the immunomodulator may be coupled to the allergen by a number of methods. Crosslinkers are divided into homobifunctional crosslinkers, containing two identical reactive groups, or heterobifunctional crosslinkers, with two different reactive groups.

We therefore also disclose pharmaceutical compositions comprising Fve polypeptide or nucleic acid, or a fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof. Such pharmaceutical compositions are useful for delivery of Fve polypeptide, nucleic acid, fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof to an individual for the treatment or alleviation of symptoms as described.","The composition may include the Fve polypeptide, nucleic acid, fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof, a structurally related compound, or an acidic salt thereof. The pharmaceutical formulations comprise an effective amount of Fve polypeptide, nucleic acid, fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers. An \u201ceffective amount\u201d of an Fve polypeptide, nucleic acid fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof is the amount sufficient to alleviate at least one symptom of a disease as described.","The effective amount will vary depending upon the particular disease or syndrome to be treated or alleviated, as well as other factors including the age and weight of the  patient, how advanced the disease etc state is, the general health of the patient, the severity of the symptoms, and whether the Fve polypeptide, nucleic acid, fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof is being administered alone or in combination with other therapies.","Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are well known in the art and vary with the desired form and mode of administration of the pharmaceutical formulation. For example, they can include diluents or excipients such as fillers, binders, wetting agents, disintegrators, surface-active agents, lubricants and the like. Typically, the carrier is a solid, a liquid or a vaporizable carrier, or a combination thereof. Each carrier should be \u201cacceptable\u201d in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients in the formulation and not injurious to the patient. The carrier should be biologically acceptable without eliciting an adverse reaction (e.g. immune response) when administered to the host.","The pharmaceutical compositions disclosed here include those suitable for topical and oral administration, with topical formulations being preferred where the tissue affected is primarily the skin or epidermis (for example, psoriasis, eczema and other epidermal diseases). The topical formulations include those pharmaceutical forms in which the composition is applied externally by direct contact with the skin surface to be treated. A conventional pharmaceutical form for topical application includes a soak, an ointment, a cream, a lotion, a paste, a gel, a stick, a spray, an aerosol, a bath oil, a solution and the like. Topical therapy is delivered by various vehicles, the choice of vehicle can be important and generally is related to whether an acute or chronic disease is to be treated. Other formulations for topical application include shampoos, soaps, shake lotions, and the like, particularly those formulated to leave a residue on the underlying skin, such as the scalp (Arndt et al, in Dermatology In General Medicine 2:2838 (1993)).","In general, the concentration of the Fve polypeptide, nucleic acid, fragment, homologue, variant or derivative thereof composition in the topical formulation is in an amount of about 0.5 to 50% by weight of the composition, preferably about 1 to 30%, more preferably about 2-20%, and most preferably about 5-10%. The concentration used  can be in the upper portion of the range initially, as treatment continues, the concentration can be lowered or the application of the formulation may be less frequent. Topical applications are often applied twice daily. However, once-daily application of a larger dose or more frequent applications of a smaller dose may be effective. The stratum corneum may act as a reservoir and allow gradual penetration of a drug into the viable skin layers over a prolonged period of time.","In a topical application, a sufficient amount of active ingredient must penetrate a patient's skin in order to obtain a desired pharmacological effect. It is generally understood that the absorption of drug into the skin is a function of the nature of the drug, the behaviour of the vehicle, and the skin. Three major variables account for differences in the rate of absorption or flux of different topical drugs or the same drug in different vehicles; the concentration of drug in the vehicle, the partition coefficient of drug between the stratum corneum and the vehicle and the diffusion coefficient of drug in the stratum corneum. To be effective for treatment, a drug must cross the stratum corneum which is responsible for the barrier function of the skin. In general, a topical formulation which exerts a high in vitro skin penetration is effective in vivo. Ostrenga et al (J. Pharm. Sci., 60:1175-1179 (1971) demonstrated that in vivo efficacy of topically applied steroids was proportional to the steroid penetration rate into dermatomed human skin in vitro.","A skin penetration enhancer which is dermatologically acceptable and compatible with the agent can be incorporated into the formulation to increase the penetration of the active compound(s) from the skin surface into epidermal keratinocytes. A skin enhancer which increases the absorption of the active compound(s) into the skin reduces the amount of agent needed for an effective treatment and provides for a longer lasting effect of the formulation. Skin penetration enhancers are well known in the art. For example, dimethyl sulfoxide (U.S. Pat. No. 3,711,602); oleic acid, 1,2-butanediol surfactant (Cooper, J. Pharm. Sci., 73:1153-1156 (1984)); a combination of ethanol and oleic acid or oleyl alcohol (EP 267,617), 2-ethyl-1,3-hexanediol (WO 87\/03490); decyl methyl sulphoxide and Azone.RTM. (Hadgraft, Eur. J.

Exploration of novel and effective treatment for atopic  diseases is active area of allergy research. Induction of allergen-specific T regulatory immune response, suppression of the effects of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 cytokines, and redirecting\/balancing Th2 immune response in allergy is an attractive and promising approach to pursue (Akbari et al., 2002; Scanga and Le Gros, 2000; Zuany-Amorim et al., 2002).","Our in vitro and in vivo studies reveal that Fve interacts with T and NK cells.","Fve-activated T cells produce Th1-skewed cytokines in high levels, and suppress Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) production. Thus these biological activities of Fve can be exploited to treat Th2-associated diseases such allergic asthma and rhinitis. The use of the immunomodulatory properties of Fve to treat allergic diseases is novel because there are a number of differences between Fve approach and other existing methods such as hexameric motifs, called CpG motifs or DNA immunostimulatory sequences (ISS).","The function of ISS is act as a danger signal to stimulate non-specific innate immune response (Krieg 2000). It is known that ISS is recognized by the toll-like receptor 9 on B cells and CD123 dendritic cells. It is unexpected that TLR9 is also involved in autoimmunity (Leadbetter et al., 2002; Krieg 2002; Vinuesa and Goodnow, 2002). Upon the detection of CpG motifs or ISS element, B cells are induced to proliferate and secrete immunoglobulin (Ig), and dendritic cells (DCs) secrete a wide array of cytokines, interferons and chemokines that promote T helper type 1 (Th1) cells. Both B and DCs up-regulate costimulatory molecules and have enhanced abilities to induce Th1 cell immune responses. In contrast, Fve is directly target on T and NK cells to involve in the acquire immunity.","Immunotherapy with recombinant allergen in combination with certain immunomodulator enhancing Th1 but suppressing Th2 immune response is a novel  approach to achieve higher efficacies in immunotherapy. Since Fve protein is an activator of Th1\/Tc1 immune response, it may be used as such an immunomodulator to provide the adjuvant effects to enhance Th1-skewed immunity.","We investigated the adjuvant effects of Fve for allergy immunotherapy with a combination of a recombinant house dust mite major allergen, Der p 2 and Fve using an animal model.","Methods and Materials","A schematic representation of the experimental design is shown in .","8 to 10 week old male BALB\/cJ mice obtained from the Sembawang Laboratory Animal Center of Singapore are divided into two groups for each experiment.

Each of Bt5-Fve, Bt5-FveR27, GST-Dp2-FveR27 are able to increase the number of human PBMC (), to stimulate the proliferation of human lymphocytes (), to polarize human CD8 T cells (), and to increase the production of IFN-\u03b3 (Th1 response) and IL-10 (Tr response) ().","A well-balanced vaccine that induces both Th1 and Tr immune response may be the most valuable and desirable. The Th1 response may very efficiently inhibit the development of Th2 cells via IFN-\u03b3, leading to a life-long protective Th1 memory immune response. Allergen specific Tr cells may in turn dampen the anti-allergic Th1 immune  response, ensuring a well-balanced protective but nonpathological Th1 response. Allergen-Fve fusion proteins meet these criteria since they induce cytokine IL-10.","Thus, combining Fve protein with allergen in the form of a fusion protein may be used effectively to induce antigen-specific adjuvant effect that augment the Th1 and Tr responses, which in turn down-regulate the Th2 allergic responses.","To test the antigenecity of a Blo t 5-Fve fusion protein, competitive inhibition ELISA is performed using varying concentrations of proteins (GST, GST-Blo t5, GST-Fve, GST-Blo t5-Fve, GST-Fve-Blo t5, Blo t5-Fve). The results show that fusion protein Blo t 5-Fve, un-cleaved GST-Blo t5-Fve and GST-Fve-Blo t5 have lower IgE binding affinity compared to Blo t5 alone and un-cleaved GST-Blo t5 (). The fusion protein Blo t5-Fve inhibited IgE binding to a maximum of 70% whereas Blo t5 is able to inhibit the binding of antibody to GST-Bt5 to 100% at inhibitor concentration of 10 \u03bcg\/ml. Control GST and GST-Fve are not able to inhibit the binding of IgE to GST-Blo t5 (background levels). In summary, there is a reduction in the IgE binding affinity of Blo t5 when it is in the fusion forms of Blo t5-Fve, GST-Blo t5-Fve and GST-Fve-Blo t5 indicating that the antigenicity of Blo t5 with Fve in fusion forms is lowered.","Experiment B","Five mice per group of female BALB\/cJ (6-8 weeks old) are subcutaneous immunized with 10 \u03bcg\/ml of major house dust mite allergen Blo t 5 alone or fusion protein Blo t 5-FveT29A in tail at day 1.

It is  anticipated that Fve protein with allergen in the form of a fusion protein could be an effective way to induce antigen-specific adjuvant effect that augment the Th1 and Tr responses, which in turns can down-regulate the Th2 allergic responses. Besides, it is known that in the inductive phase of allergen sensitization, Th1 cytokines can inhibit the development of Th2 cells via IFN-\u03b3, leading to a life-long protective Th1 memory immune response. Allergen specific Tr cells may in turn dampen the anti-allergic Th1 immune response, ensuring a well-balanced protective but nonpathological Th1 response.","Therefore, Fve-allergen fusion proteins can be exploited to develop vaccine for prophylactic of allergic disorders.","Beside the use of gene fusions to produce fusion proteins, protein-protein conjugation also provides a convenient and alternative choice to develop allergen vaccine.","To date, allergen conjugated adjuvants which have been reported include crystalline bacteria cell surface layer (S-layers) (Jahn-Schmid et al., 1996), CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG motifs) (Shirota et al., 2000), cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) (Rask et al., 2000), and (Scharf et al., 2001).","Here we disclose Fve protein which is isolated from edible mushroom can also be an ideal adjuvant coupling to allergen vaccine. Poly-lactic acid (PLA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) are two materials which may be used to couple Fve and house dust mite allergen (Der p 2 or Blo t 5), although other materials will be evident to the skilled reader.","Particular coss-linking reagents which may be used to conjugate an allergen and immumodulator, such as Fve, include N,N\u2032-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), N-succinimidyl-S-acetyl-thioacetate (SATA), N-succinimidyl-3-2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP), ortho-phenylenedimaleimide (o-PDM), and sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC). A chemical conjugation  protocol which may be used is that provided in the Protein-Protein Crosslinking Kit (P6305) from Molecular Probes, Eugene, USA. Protocols for conjugation using SPDP are disclosed in Clinical Experimental Allergy 30: 1024-1032, 2000 and European Journal of Immunology 28: 424-432, 1998.","For example, native Fve or recombinant Fve from is conjugated with N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP, Molecular Probes) as a bifunctional coupling reagent. The resulting Allergen-Fve conjugates are purified by gel filtration and characterized for their allergenicity and adjuvanicity by in vitro and in vivo assays.","Materials and Methods","To elucidate and identify subsets of human T lymphocytes responding to Fve stimulation, purified CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells from four human tonsillectomy patients (subject 1, 6 yrs-old Chinese; subject 2, 16 yrs-old Indian; subject 3, 17 yrs-old Malay, subject 4, 27 yrs-old Malay) are stimulated with 20 \u03bcg of Fve after AutoMACS seperation. AutoMACS is an automated magnetic cell sorter from Miltenyi-Biotec, Germany. The differential cytokine production profiles of these subsets are determined by intracellular cytokines staining after 48 hours in vitro culture.","Results","Fve Triggers Th1\/Tc1 Cytokine Production in Human T Cells","The human cytokines induction studies show that Fve stimulates the production of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 whereas IL-4 and IL-10 are nearly undetectable. In addition, purified CD4 T cells produce higher levels of TNF-\u03b1 than purified CD8 T cells (CD4 vs CD8: 11.4% vs 2.5%), whereas purified CD8 T cells produce higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 than purified CD4 T cells (CD4 vs CD8: 3.6% vs 8.5%) upon Fve stimulation (Table 4). Therefore, the enrichment of CD8 T cells seems to derive from a protein-cell direct interaction. Taken together, this data supported that Fve could trigger Th1\/TC1 cytokines production in human T lymphocytes.

Each of these biological properties may contribute to suppression of tumor growth and to prevent the risk of cancer recurrence by inducing various forms of nonspecific or even specific immunity after surgery.","Malignant melanoma is a very common cancer in the western world. A subset of patient with metastatic melanoma can be successfully treated by the administration of recombinant IL-2, sometimes given together with autologous melanoma-reactive lymphocytes that have been expanded ex vivo. Since melanocyte differentiation antigens, including MART-1\/Melan-A, gp100, tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2, and cancer-testis antigens, including MAGE-3, BAGE, GAGE, NY-ESO-1, are recognized by human T lymphocytes, therefore they become the attractive targets for melanoma vaccines. However, from an immunological point of view, these melanocytes differentiation antigens and cancer-testis antigens are \u201cself\u201d antigens. It may induce central or peripheral tolerance, and thus potentially hampering the induction of powerful anti-melanoma immune responses. Therefore, induction of a strong tumor specific immunity with an immunopotentiator or novel adjuvant could be a useful treatment strategy to overcome immune ignorance and tolerance.","In order to investigate the anti-tumor effect of Fve, C57BL6J mice are subcutaneously inoculated either with T cell lymphoma EL4 or melanoma B16-F1, the later is a well established and widely used tumor model for which treatment is notoriously difficult. The tumor growth and survival rate of mice are monitored.","Materials and Methods","Construction of pCIneo-Fve and pDisplay-Fve Recombinant Plasmid DNA","The pCIneo vector is designed for high level and constitutive expression of cloned DNA inserts in mammalian cells (). Fve DNA is amplified from pGEX-fve and  subcloned into the Xho I and EcoR I restriction enzyme cutting sites of pCIneo vector. The pCIneo-fve is used for priming the immune response by intramuscular injection.","The pDisplay vector is a mammalian expression vector that is designed to target and to display recombinant proteins to the surface of mammalian cells (). Fusion DNA of Fve and murine Ig kappa chain V-J2C signal peptide without hemagglutinin A epitope is generated by recombinant PCR and subcloned into the EcoR I and Pst I restriction enzyme cutting sites of pDisplay vector. The Fve protein expressed from the pDisplay-fve acts as triggering signal for immune system and recruiting T lymphocytes to recognize tumor cells.","Transfection of B16-F1 Cells with pDisplay-Fve","The murine melanoma cells B16-F1 is purchased from ATCC, USA. Tumor cells are grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in 5% CO. Cells in the exponential growth phase within four passages are used in this investigation. To obtain stable transfectants, endotoxin free plasmid pDisplay-fve is mixed with polyfect transfection reagent (QIAGEN, Germany) and transfected into B16-F1 cells. Colonies resistant to G418 (Geneticin, GIBCO BRL) at 1000 \u03bcg\/ml for 25-30 days are isolated and designated as B16-Fve.

The diameters of tumors are measured with a caliper and tumor volume is calculated by long diameter time short diameter. Finally the survival rate is recorded. ","DNA Vaccination and B16-F1 Tumor Protection Experiments","Endotoxin free pCIneo and pCIneo-fve are purified from the QIAGEN plasmid DNA extraction and purification kits. 100 \u03bcg of pCIneo-fve is intramuscularly injected into the tibialis muscle of C57BL\/6 mice at day-30 and day-1. Muscles are pulsed with Electro Square Porator ECM830 (BTX, Genetronics, USA) equipped with a two needle array electrode after DNA injection. Mice are inoculated with 5\u00d710B16-F1 cells.

Mice are kept until they died to assess survival.","Our results show that tumor established mice that received pCIneo-fve DNA and Fve protein had shown a reduction of T cell lymphoma growth rate () and an extension of survival time (). Similar results are also seen in melanoma B16-F1 inoculated C57BL\/6J mice ).","These data indicate that Fve induces some protection against the solid EL4 tumor and B16-F1 melanoma, suggesting that Fve could be a potential candidate molecule for the development of the immunotherapeutic reagents for treatment of some cancers. The results also show that DNA vaccine-mediated treatment using the gene of Fve can be further exploited for effective cancer treatment. Nowadays, DNA vaccination is being explored as a potential strategy for combating cancer. However, tumor antigens are often weak and the  immune system of patients may be compromised. Like the concept of allergen-Fve fusion protein, fusion of Fve to specific tumor antigen may an effective way to activate protective anti-tumor immune response. Genetic immunization with chemeric gene encoding Fve and tumor antigen may augment and direct immune attack on a range of target tumor antigens.","In previous study, we have proved that using Fve plasmid DNA primed in muscle and Fve protein boosted in tumor region could initiate anti-tumor immune response and thus prolong the survival time of tumor-inoculated mice. Instead of injection Fve surrounding the tumor, we specifically targeted Fve gene into tumor cells and tried to create an inducible-antigenic tumor for cancer therapy. This genetically modified tumor cells may provide signals for antigen presenting cells and both helper and cytotoxic T cells.","To determine whether introduction of the Fve gene into malignant cells would result in enhanced tumor recognition ability via Fve display and lead to extended survival rate in solid tumor experiment. Recombinant plasmid DNA pDisplay-fve is transfected into wild type B16-F1 mouse melanoma and then G418 resistant colonies are selected. Five female of C57BL\/6J mice are inoculated with 5\u00d710of B16-Fve transfectant. The antigenicity of B16-vec and B16-Fve transfectants are compared through the life span of two groups of tumor-inoculated mice.","Result demonstrated that artificially expressed Fve on the surface of B16-F1 mouse melanoma extended survival rate as compared to B16-vec inoculated mice (). We propose that the characteristics of highly antigenecity and lymphocytes mitogenecity of Fve may elevate immune function to fight against tumor when it displayed on the surface of melanoma. Therefore, Fve may use as immune response activator and enhancer especially for those poorly recognized and low immunogenic tumor, which escaped from cancer surveillance and immune clearance by altering immune recognition and modulating cytotoxic response. ","Cancer vaccines are designed to prevent and treat cancer. In general, research has shown that the most effective anti-tumor immune responses are achieved by stimulating T cells, which can recognize and kill tumor cells directly. Most current cancer vaccines try to activate T cells directly, try to enlist APCs to activate T cells, or both. Some novel ways in which researchers are attempting to better activate T cells are: (1) Altering tumor cells so molecules that are normally only express on APCs are now express on the tumor cell. These molecules are capable of giving T cells a stronger activating signal than the original tumor cells. (2) Testing more cytokines and adjuvants to determine which are best candidates for recruiting APCs to areas where they are needed. (3) Using dendritic cells and other APCs fused with tumor cells as the cancer vaccines. These cells go into the body carrying tumor antigen and ready to activate T cells. Early cancer vaccine clinical trials involved mainly patients with melanoma. Currently, cancer vaccines are also being tested in the treatment of many other types of cancer, including prostate cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, and lymphoma.","Here, we accessed tumor immunity that stimulated by recombinant Fve DNA vaccination alone and the combination of Fve DNA vaccination and Fve-transduced tumor cells. C57BL\/6J mice are separated into three groups and each group consisted of ten mice. Mice are inoculated either with 5\u00d710of B16-Fve or B16-vec tumor transfectants in the dorsal back. Tumor formation is observed at day 5-7. 100 \u03bcg of pCIneo-fve plasmid DNA is intramuscularly injected at the right and left tribilis muscle of C57BL\/6J at day-77, day-35 and day-21. Mice are subcutaneously injected with 5\u00d710of B16-Fve transfectant and B16-vec transfectant at day 0, respectively. 100 \u03bcg of pCIneo plasmid DNA is administered following similar experimental procedure and mice are subcutaneously injected with 5\u00d710of B16-vec transfectant as negative control. The fatal rate of mice are recorded and data are presented as survival curves.","Result showed that Fve DNA vaccination contained certain degree of tumor protection (Green line in ) as compared with vector DNA vaccination (Blue line  in ). In addition, the combination of Fve DNA vaccination and B16-Fve transfectant exerted a stronger tumor protection effect (Red line in ). Based on the result, we propose Fve is a novel protein to activate T cells directly. This protein is capable of giving T cells a strong activating signal when it is displayed on the surface of poorly immunogenic tumor cells. Therefore, the phenomenon of extended survival rate is observed in the experimental tumor-inoculated mice.","In future, the adjuvant effect of fusion proteins between Fve and tumor antigens to enhance tumor immunity will be determined. In particular, DNA fusion vaccine strategy, whereby target tumor antigen is genetically linked to immunostimulatory molecules such as Fve, is currently being explored. The introduction of fusion gene encoding tumor-associated antigen with Fve into antigen-presenting cells hold considerable promise for the treatment of patients with cancer. The ease of DNA manipulation has allowed incorporation of a wide variety of molecules able to promote antigen uptake, processing and presentation by professional antigen-presenting cells, to provide critical CD4 T-cell help and to activate more effective immune effector pathways (Zhu and Stevenson 2002). The concept of DNA fusion vaccine strategy is particularly important for cancer vaccines to increase their immunogenicity and to overcome tolerance.","2\u00d710of B16-F1 melanoma cells is delivered to C57BL\/6J via tail vein injection. The effect of combination of distill water and DNA vector pCIneo versus Fve protein and plasmid DNA pCIneo-fve administration on survival after the establishment of lung metastasis is determined. Survival extended in both metastatic experimental groups undergoing Fve protein orally primed and DNA intramuscularly boosted strategy.","Two groups of five C57BL\/6J mice are given with 10 mg\/ml of Fve protein in the drinking water at days-35, -28 and -21, and each water providing is maintained consecutively for one week. Mice are intravenously injected with 2\u00d710of B16-F1 (wild type) melanoma cells at day 0. One week after, mice are intramuscularly injected with  100 \u03bcg of pCIneo-fve plasmid DNA into the right and left tribilis muscle, respectively. The mixture of 5\u00d710of B16-Fve cells lysate plus 10 \u03bcg of Fve protein (Red line in ) or 10 \u03bcg of Fve protein alone (Green line in ) are subcutaneously injected into mice at the following three weeks. Negative control group of mice received same amount of 1\u00d7 PBS in the drinking water, intravenously injected with 2\u00d710of B16-F1 melanoma cells, followed by intramuscularly injected with plasmid DNA vector pCIneo, and finally subcutaneously injected with B16-vec cells lysate plus 1\u00d7 PBS (Blue line in ).","Results showed that the strategy of orally primed with Fve protein before tumor introduced into the lung and intramuscularly boosted the immune response with the plasmid DNA pCIneo-fve after tumor established in lung could extend the survival rate of mice as compared with the control group (). This data provided another evidence suggesting Fve could augment anti-tumor immune response against developing or metastatic tumor cells. The inhibition of B16-F1 melanoma experimental lung metastasis by Fve may go through induction of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and activation of anti-tumor host mechanisms. IFN-\u03b3and TNF-\u03b1gene knockout mice and in vivo depletions of CD4, CD8, or NK1.1 cells may provide supportive evidence to this phenomenon.","The invention of microarray technology allows the simultaneous monitoring of the transcriptional behavior of thousands of genes. This technology has been repeatedly shown to be useful in the analysis of the response of a variety of cellular systems to stimuli, in the classification of human cancer, and in the analysis of animal models of human disease (Churchill 2002; Slonim 2002; van Berkum and Holstege, 2001). To characterize the transcriptional profile of Fve, we analyzed gene expression patterns in T and NK cells from either healthy donor or human cell lines stimulation with Fve by using oligonucleotide microarrays and compared them with gene expression patterns in non-stimulation cells. In future, protein microarray assays would also be used to study protein-protein interactions on a genome-wide scale (Templin et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2001).

In allergic murine model, mice treated with Der p 2 plus Fve showed a significant Der p 2-specific IgG2a production. Taken together, Fve may act as a strong adjuvant to drive immune responses toward Th1-type responses. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a major cause of cervical cancer worldwide. The HPV oncogenic proteins, E6 and E7 are required for tumorigenesis and maintenance of tumor state. Clinical study found that E7-specific immune responses are detected in cervical cancer patient, suggesting that E7 could be a specific target for immunotherapy against HPV-derived cervical cancer. In this animal study, we demonstrated that the production of HPV E7-specific IgG1 and IgG2a is greatly enhanced when E7 is co-administrated injection with the fungal immunomoodulatory protein Fve.

ELISA","In all ELISA experiments, samples are assayed in duplicates and 50 \u03bcg per well of reagents and samples are used. 96-well plates (Costar 9018, Corning, NY, USA) are incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. with 5 \u03bcg\/ml of purified E7 proteins in 0.1 M NaHCO, pH 8.3 coating buffer. Wells are washed three times with washing buffer TBST (0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) in 1\u00d7(0.01 M) TBS, pH 7.4) using the automated Columbus washer (TECAN, Austria) and blocked with 100 \u03bcl\/well of blocking buffer (1% BSA; bovine serum albumin in TBST) for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates are washed three times and diluted sera appropriately and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. For quantification and internal control purposes, known serial dilutions of purified mouse IgG1, IgG2a and \u00ea light chain isotype standard (Pharmingen, California, USA) is used on wells coated with anti-mouse \u00ea light chain (Pharmingen, California, USA).","Plates are again washed 6 times before adding biotin-conjugated anti-mouse isotypic antibodies IgG1, IgG2a (Southern Biotech, Alabamba, USA) at 1:1000 dilution are added. The plates are then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by 6 times washing and 1 hour incubation at room temperature with ExtrAvidin alkaline-phosphatase conjugate Sigma, Missouri USA). The plates are then washed 6 times and developed in paranitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) substrate Sigma, Missouri USA) at room temperature in the dark. The binding of specific antibodies is measured as absorbance at 405 nm with the Sectra (Shell) reader TECAN, Austria). The antibody production units of antigen-specific antibodies are determined from the ODusing the plot of absorbance versus concentration of the standard.","Two groups of female BALB\/cJ mice aged 6 to 8 weeks are given subcuteneous injection of either 10 \u03bcg of HPV E7 antigen alone (group 1) or mixture of 10 \u03bcg of E7 with 10 \u03bcg of Fve (group 2) at day 1. Mice are boosted with 20 \u03bcg of same antigen at day 14 and 28. Sera are collected weekly and E7-specific IgG1and IgG2a antibodies are analyzed using Elisa. ","A schematic protocol of the animal study is shown in .","Results","Combinations of E7 and Fve Enhance E7-Specific Immune Response","The results are shown in . These results show that the production of E7-specific IgG1and IgG2a are dramatically increased when E7 is co-administrated injection with Fve, as compared with E7 alone. The induction of IgG2a is 17-fold higher in the experimental mice as compare with the control group. This demonstrates that Fve displays an adjuvant effect and therefore enhance specific immune response to viral antigen. Co-administration of fungal immunomodulatory protein Fve and viral antigen HPV E7 increases the production of neutralizing antibodies.","The three dimensional structural of Fve provides a good basis for the understanding of protein functions, immunomodulations and therapeutic applications in allergy and other diseases. We have crystallized the well-diffracting crystals of Fve and show that it diffracts to 1.4 \u212b resolution when exposed to synchrotron radiation.","This and the follwing Examples describe a 1.6 A\u00b0 x-ray structure of Fve, determined by Single Anomalous Diffraction (SAD) using the anomalous signal of bromide ions present in the crystal for phasing. Fve represents a novel structure, wherein each monomer consists of an N-terminal \u03b1-helix followed by an immunoglobulin fold (beta-sandwich). The structure strongly suggests that dimerization, critical for the activity of FIP proteins, occurs by 3-D domain swapping of these helices and is stabilized predominantly by strong hydrophobic interactions between them.","Crystallization","Fve protein is obtained as described above. It is concentrated to 4 mg\/ml in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5. Initial crystallization screening is done by the sparse matrix crystallization screening kit 1 & 2 from Hampton Research (Jancarik and Kim, 1991;  Cudney, et al., 1994). All the screening and crystals growth are accomplished by hanging drops vapor diffusion method at 21\u00b0 C. in VDX multi-well plates with 650 \u03bcl reservoir solutions. Drops consisting of 4 \u03bcl precipitant buffer from reservoirs and 4 \u03bcl protein sample (4 mg\/ml) are equilibrated over the well solution for one week.","After extensive screening, plates-like crystals are obtained at two different low salt conditions: (1) 30% PEG 4000, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 0.2 M MgCl; (2) 30% PEG 4000, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 0.2 M NaOAc. 3D cubic-shaped and octahedral crystals also appeared after 3 days at two different high salt conditions: (1) 2.0 M (NH)SO, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5; (2) 2% PEG 400; 0.1 M Na Hepes pH 7.5, 2.0 M (NH)SO. To optimize the crystallization condition, combinations of varied protein and salt concentrations, different molecular weights of PEG, and different pH are screened.","The best crystals formed at the high salt condition is optimized to 2.5% PEG 400, 2.0 M (NH)SO, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5 at 21\u00b0 C. They grew to the approximate dimensions of 1.0\u00d70.9\u00d70.5 nm within five days. The micrographs of Fve crystals are captured by inverted light microscope ().","High resolution protein crystals are therefore grown by vapor diffusion from hanging drop at 2.0% PEG 400, 2.0 M (NH)SO, 0.1 M Tris-Base, pH 8.5 for 1-2 weeks. Heavy atom derivatives are prepared by soaking the crystals in mother liquor containing 25% glycerol and 1M NaBr. The crystals are flash-frozen at 100 K after a 1-min soak in the heavy atom (Br) solution. SAD data from a derivatized crystal are collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) beam line X12C) at one wavelength (***) around the Br absorption edge. The crystal diffracted to 1.7 \u212b.","X-Ray Analysis","The X-ray diffraction intensities from Fve crystals are measured at 100 K on beamline BL9-2 from the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory facility with ADSC Quantum-315 CCD detector. Data are collected at a wavelength of 1.07 \u212b. All the data are processed by MOSFLM (Leslie, 1992) and X-ray intensities are scaled with SCALA  (CCP4, 1994). Well-ordered diffraction data at 1.4 \u212b resolution are collected from larger crystals ().","Analysis of the collected data (Table 9) indicated that Fve crystals belong to the tetragonal space group P422 with unit cell dimensions of a=b=96.92 \u212b, c=61.42 \u212b. The Matthews parameter (V) of these crystals is 2.84 \u212bper Da and thus the solvent content is 56.37% assuming two molecules of Fve per asymmetric unit (Matthews, 1968). A total of 344079 observations are obtained at 1.4 \u212b resolution giving approximate 56993 unique reflections (99.7% complete, R=0.047).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0675","num":"0674"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00013","num":"00013"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 9"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Data Collection and Statistics of Fve Crystal"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"X-ray source, beamline","SSRL, BL9-2"]},{"entry":[{},"Wavelength","1.07 \u212b"]},{"entry":[{},"Detector distance","99.97 mm, Q-315 CCD Detector"]},{"entry":[{},"Cell angles (\u00b0)","90.00, 90.00, 90.00"]},{"entry":[{},"Unit cell dimensions (\u212b)","96.92, 96.92, 61.42"]},{"entry":[{},"Space group","P422"]},{"entry":[{},"Number of molecules per ASU","2"]},{"entry":[{},"Number of observed reflections","344079"]},{"entry":[{},"Number of unique reflections","56993"]},{"entry":[{},"Solvent (%)","56.37"]},{"entry":[{},"V(\u212bDa)","2.84"]},{"entry":[{},"Resolution range (\u212b)","33.5-1.4"]},{"entry":[{},"Average I\/\u03c3(I)","10.1"]},{"entry":[{},"R","0.047"]},{"entry":[{},"Completeness (%)","99.7"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"left","id":"FOO-00001"},"sup":"a","sub":["merge ","i ","i","i "]}]}]}}]}}},"Data Processing","The SAD data are processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK from the HKL2000 suite of programs (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997).","The crystal of Fve belongs to the tetragonal space group P43212 and has unit cell dimensions a=b=97.12, c=61.41 and \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=90.0. All of the bromine heavy atom positions are located and refined by the program SOLVE at 1.7 \u212b (Terwilliger and  Berendzen, 1999) and solvent flattened map is calculated using RESOLVE (Terwilliger, 2001). The resulting electron density map reveals secondary structure elements and side chains. In principle, it is possible to build an initial model by standard protein map-tracing methods. However, the phases obtained from RESOLVE are directly used in ARP\/wARP (Morris et al., 2001) for automated main chains tracing, result in 4 continuous fragments that contained 97% of model. The rest of the model and side chains are fitted manually using XtalView (McRee, 1999). The refinement is carried out in REFMAC 5 (Murshudov et al., 1999) using resolution range 30.02-1.7 and water molecules are picked up by ARP\/WARP later in the refinement.","In chain A, C-terminal residue 114 is modeled as Ala residue, whereas in chain B, C-terminal residue 113 and 114 are omitted from the final model, due to the poor interpretable density. The quality of the final model is verified with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). However, the Ramachandran plot shows that Lys 14 in both A and B chains is in the disallowed region, although this residue fits very well in the 2fo-fc map.","The crystal structure is solved by single anomalous scattering using Br as the heavy-atom, and is refined to a resolution of 1.7. The atomic coordinates are presented in Appendix C.","In total, two chains with a total of 226 residues, 16 bromine atoms and 136 solvent molecules are built into a high quality electron density map. Fve comprises almost exclusively of \u03b2-sheet structure with an Ig-like fold, which is formed by seven major antiparallel \u03b2-strands arranged into two sheets of four (D, E, H and I) and three (B, C and F) strands packed again each other. The N-terminal domain is composed of a \u03b1-helix which spans a length of 12 residues from Ala2 to Val13 and a \u03b2-sheet (A). The N-terminal serine residue is blocked by an acetyl group the density of which is also observed. Six loops connect the two main \u03b2-sheets and one loop connects the N-terminal domain with  \u03b2-sheet structure. The loop between the \u03b2-sheets F and H contains a short \u03b2-strand and a 3helix.","The structure of Fve () reveals that exists as a dimer. This is corroborated experimentally by running Fve on a gel filtration column against standard molecular weight markers (data not shown). From the structure, there are two extended regions of subunit-subunit interactions: between the two N-terminal \u03b1-helical regions (residues 2 to 13) and the \u03b2-stranded region (A and A\u2032).","The buried side chains of the \u03b1-helical regions form a hydrophobic core (), containing residues Ala 2, Leu 5, Leu 9 and Val 13 whereas the side chains of \u03b2-strand (A and A\u2032) make inter-subunit hydrogen bonds (). These hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds are responsible for dimer formation. The two monomers, A and B chains, of Fve can be closely superimposed: the RMSD between corresponding Cpositions of 112 residues is 0.29 \u212b ().","Domain Swapping","Domain swapping is a very efficient method of forming oligomers since the interactions within the monomer are reused in the dimer. There is thus no need to evolve a new site on the surface which in one monomer mutually recognizes the corresponding site on the other monomer, since in the domain swapped dimer the recognition requirement has already largely been accounted for (Bennett et al., 1995).","Domain-swapped proteins have a C-interface generally with many specifics interaction, formed between domains linked by a hinge loop (Bennett et al., 1995). In p13suc1, two proline residues, located in the hinge region, have been shown to be essential and control the domain-swapping process (Rousseau et al., 2001).","As shown in , half of the dimer of Fve contains one N-terminal helix, forming a C-interface with hydrophobic core, which is linked to rest of its subunit by a hinge loop, stretching from residue Val 13 to Pro 22. Furthermore, Fve contains a proline  residue at the end of the hinge region, which could adopt alternative conformation in the dimer by releasing the tension in the monomer. These observations suggest that domain-swapping swapping could be the mechanism for forming dimer protein from its monomer. The monomer is modeled ().","Structural Similarity with Other Proteins","Fve has no sequence homology to any other non-FIP proteins. However, a search for similar structure in the DALI database (Holm and Sander, 1993) reveals that the protein has a significantly similar fold to 140 proteins but none with the significant sequence similarity to Fve. Among 140 similar fold protein, fibronectin type III family emerged with less topology diversity to Fve \u03b2-sandwich fold: the heparin and integrin binding segment of human fibronectin (FN12-15; PDB entry 1FNH), the fragment of human fibronectin type III repeat (FN7-10; 1FNF), The p40 domain of human interlukin-12 (p40; 1F42) and the antibody a6 fragment interferon-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN\u03b3R1-108; 1JRH). An alignment of FN12-15, FN7-10, p40, IFN\u03b3R1-108 and Fve on the basis of structural similarity shows topology diversity in the range 11-17, calculated by Topp program (Lu, 1996) (Table 10).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0690","num":"0689"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00014","num":"00014"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 10"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},"Length of",{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"PDB","Z-","RM","aligned","Topological","Superfamily",{}]},{"entry":[{},"Name","ID","Score","SD","segment","Diversity","(Family)","Species"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","interleukin-4 receptor alpha chain","1iar-B","5.8","3","78","8.5","Fn III",{"i":"Homo"}]},{"entry":[{},"fragment: b:1-96",{},{},{},{},{},"(FNIII)",{"i":"sapiens"}]},{"entry":["2","mhc class ii i-ak: a:82-181","1iak-A","5.8","4.7","83","18.6","Ig (C1)",{"i":"Mus"}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{"i":"musculus"}]},{"entry":["3","mhc class ii i-ak: b:93-190","1iak-B","5.6","3.5","74","17.8","Ig (C1)",{"i":"Mus"}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{"i":"musculus"}]},{"entry":["4","igg2a intact antibody - mab23, kappa L","1igt-B","5.5","3.8","86","18.4","Ig (V)",{"i":"Mus"}]},{"entry":[{},"chain: a:1-108",{},{},{},{},{},{},{"i":"musculus"}]},{"entry":["5","class ii histocompatibility antigen, ","1hdm-B","5.3","4.7","82","18.4","Ig (C1)",{"i":"Homo"}]},{"entry":[{},"HLA-DM: a:94-196",{},{},{},{},{},{},{"i":"sapiens"}]},{"entry":["6","fibronectin fragment, heparin & integrin","1fnh-A","5.3","3","73","11.1","Fn III",{"i":"Homo"}]},{"entry":[{},"binding segment: a:93-182",{},{},{},{},{},"(FNIII)",{"i":"sapiens"}]},{"entry":["7","ch3 domain of mak33 antibody","1cqk-A","5.3","3.3","76","18.5","Ig (C1)",{"i":"Mus"}]},{"entry":[{},"fragment: chain a",{},{},{},{},{},{},{"i":"musculus"}]},{"entry":["8","CD1, beta2-microglobulin and alpha-3","1cid","5.3","2.8","76","17.8","Ig (V)",{"i":"Rattus"}]},{"entry":[{},"domain:d",{},{},{},{},{},{},{"i":"rattus"}]},{"entry":["9","fibronectin fragment, ED-B ","2fnb-A","5.2","3.9","72","17","Fn III",{"i":"Homo"}]},{"entry":[{},"domain: chain a",{},{},{},{},{},"(FNIII)",{"i":"sapiens"}]},{"entry":["10","hiv-1 gag peptide: a:182-276","1agd-A","5.2","3.8","84","20.1","Ig (C1)",{"i":"Homo"}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{"i":"sapiens"}]},{"entry":["11","iggI antibody 32c2 fragment: a:1-110","32c2-A","5.1","5.6","80","19.4","Ig (V)",{"i":"Mus"}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{"i":"musculus"}]},{"entry":["12","fibronectin repeat 7: 1142-1235","1fnf","5.1","2.7","71","10.8","Fn III",{"i":"Homo"}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},"(FNIII)",{"i":"sapiens"}]},{"entry":["13","interleukin-12 beta chain ","1f42-A","5.1","2.8","70","12.8","Fn III",{"i":"Homo"}]},{"entry":[{},"fragment: a:88-211.",{},{},{},{},{},"(FNIII)",{"i":"sapiens"}]},{"entry":["14","Mutant growth hormone receptor","1axi-B","5.1","3.2","72","14.7","Fn III",{"i":"Homo"}]},{"entry":[{},"fragment: b:131-236",{},{},{},{},{},"(FNIII)",{"i":"sapiens"}]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Akbari O, Freeman G J, Meyer E H, Greenfield E A, Chang T T, Sharpe A H, Berry G, DeKruyff R H, and Umetsu D T.
