{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE","SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates to a system for monitoring and controlling loads attached to a power system, and more particularly to a system for monitoring and controlling loads where available power is limited, such as an onboard power system for an aircraft.","In limited power systems (including, but not limited to, power systems on an aircraft), a closed loop control system is often implemented to control the output voltage of a generator to ensure proper operation of devices attached to the power system.","A typical closed loop control system for power generation is shown schematically in . The system has a generator  and a reference sensor , which senses the output  and provides a reference signal  fed back to the generator. The output is connected to a load . The reference signal has a finite frequency response to allow for control of the output. As the output changes, the reference sensor adjusts the generator to remain at a constant output.","A critical point may be reached in a closed loop system where the input impedance Zof the load  is lower than the output impedance Zof the generator . In this case, the system can revert from closed loop control to open loop control and possibly into sub-harmonic oscillation or modulation of the output voltage.","The onboard power generation system for a modern passenger aircraft must accommodate different types of loads. In the case of galleys, heaters, air conditioners, etc. the load is resistive, so that a decrease in the voltage input to the load causes a decrease in the load current. In contrast, inflight entertainment (IFE) systems and other electronic systems generally have a reactive load with a negative impedance or constant power characteristic, so that as the generator voltage decreases the load current increases. As the IFE system load increases, the impedance Zdecreases, and may become lower than the output dynamic impedance Zof the generator. When this happens, the generator can go into a \u201chunting\u201d mode in an attempt to regain closed loop control. This behavior typically presents itself as a voltage modulation about the mean of the voltage set point, characterized by a voltage modulation envelope.","The power generating system may be designed to tolerate a certain modulation envelope size (maximum voltage peak to valley). The modulation may be successfully limited as long as the load remains within the boundaries for closed loop control. Accordingly, it is desirable to implement a modulation monitor and control system to control the load, limit the modulation envelope, and thereby ensure that the system stays within operational boundaries.","The present disclosure provides a system and method for monitoring and controlling the voltage modulation on a power grid, in order to maintain closed-loop control of the grid. The power grid has a plurality of connections including unused connections to which a load is not connected and used connections to which a load is connected.","According to a first aspect of the disclosure, a system is provided which includes a detector and a controller. The detector is configured to detect a modulation voltage on the power grid. The controller is configured to receive signals from the detector, and to control connections to the power grid. The controller disables power to the unused connections in accordance with the detected modulation voltage exceeding a first threshold and disables power to the used connections in accordance with the detected modulation voltage exceeding a second threshold; the used connections are disabled in sequence at a first time interval each for a period given by a second time interval. The controller also restores power to the used connections and to the unused connections in accordance with the detected modulation voltage being less than a third threshold.","According to another aspect of the disclosure, a method for maintaining closed-loop control of a power grid includes the steps of: detecting a modulation voltage on a power grid; disabling power to the unused connections in accordance with the detected modulation voltage exceeding a first threshold; and disabling power to the used connections in accordance with the detected modulation voltage exceeding a second threshold. The used connections are disabled one at a time at a first time interval each for a period given by a second time interval. The method also includes the step of restoring power to the used connections and to the unused connections in accordance with the detected modulation voltage being less than a third threshold.","According to an additional aspect of the disclosure, a system is provided which includes a detector and a timer control circuit. The detector is configured to detect a modulation voltage on a power grid. The timer control circuit is configured to receive signals from the detector and to control connections to the power grid by causing power to the unused connections to be disabled in accordance with the detected modulation voltage exceeding a first threshold, and causing power to the used connections to be disabled in accordance with the detected modulation voltage exceeding a second threshold.","The foregoing has outlined, rather broadly, the preferred features of the present disclosure so that those skilled in the art may better understand the detailed description of the disclosure that follows. Additional features of the disclosure will be described hereinafter that form the subject of the claims of the disclosure. Those skilled in the art should appreciate that they can readily use the disclosed conception and specific embodiment as a basis for designing or modifying other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present disclosure and that such other structures do not depart from the spirit and scope of the disclosure in its broadest form.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["20","21","25","22","23","24","26"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["20","21","311","321","331","31","32","33","312","31","33","361","363","34"]},"Timer control circuit  includes a disconnect timer  and a reconnect timer . Disconnect timer  has a preset timing step (e.g. between 1 and 15 seconds) defining a time interval for disabling a load. If one or more signals - indicate that any of the three phases has a modulation greater than a defined threshold, disconnect timer  causes a SET signal  to be input to a disable driver circuit . Disable driver circuit  outputs a DISABLE signal  to disable loads successively at the preset disconnect interval, to bring the modulation back below the threshold value. Reconnect timer  has another preset timing step (e.g. between 1 and 15 minutes) defining a time interval for reconnecting a load. If signals - indicate that all of the three phases have been restored to a modulation less than the defined threshold, reconnect timer  causes a RESET signal  to be input to disable driver circuit . Disable driver circuit  outputs a REENABLE signal to reconnect loads successively at the preset reconnect interval. In this embodiment, loads are reconnected in the reverse order of disconnection (last off, first on).","Controller  is configured to perform a confidence test of the system (built-in test or BITE). In an embodiment, controller  sends modulated voltage signals (self-test signals) - to phase modulation detectors -, monitors signals -, and modifies the timers ,  to speed up the disconnect and reconnect processes. Controller  sends a signal  to reset the disable driver  if the test is successful. The BITE test may be performed when the system is turned on and\/or by an external command.","Further details of the phase modulation detectors - and the timer control , according to particular embodiments of the disclosure, are shown in  respectively.","As shown schematically in , each phase modulation detector (e.g. detector ) has an AC scaling circuit having as inputs the AC phase , neutral  and self-test signal . Circuit  scales the AC line voltage through a voltage divider. The line voltage phase signal is then processed though a filter (for example, a 6th order filter ), to effectively remove the input carrier frequency from the voltage modulation (the voltage modulation being the signal of interest). The voltage modulation is input to a differentiator and high gain amplifier circuit . The output of circuit  is connected to an absolute value amplifier , which is connected to a comparator circuit . The comparator circuit monitors the voltage modulation for a value greater than a reference voltage  (the modulation threshold); if the modulation voltage exceeds the threshold, the comparator circuit outputs signal  to trigger the timer control circuit .","As shown schematically in , the timer control circuit  includes clock divider , trigger circuit , disconnect timer  and reconnect timer . The timer control circuit is connected to the disable driver circuit , which outputs DISABLE signals to remove a load from the grid and REENABLE signals to reconnect a load to the grid.","A master clock  provides a clock signal (typically at 32 KHz) to clock divider circuit . This circuit then sends a timer signal  corresponding to a disconnect interval (e.g. 1 second) to disconnect timer , and a timer signal  corresponding to a reconnect interval (e.g. 56 seconds) to reconnect timer . Signals  and  are used to control the UP\/DOWN count function of timers ,  respectively.","Trigger circuit  receives as inputs signals - from the phase modulation detector circuits -, and has outputs ,  connected to timers , .","Disconnect timer  includes an UP counter  that counts time intervals, in accordance with disconnect settings  and input  from clock divider circuit . When a voltage modulation greater than the threshold exists in any of the three phases, the UP counter  is triggered; depending on the disconnect settings, DISABLE signals  will be activated one at a time in steps from 1-15 seconds per step.","Reconnect timer  includes a DOWN counter  that counts time intervals, in accordance with reconnect settings  and input  from clock divider circuit . When the voltage modulation falls below the threshold for all of the phases, a REENABLE signal will be activated to reconnect loads to the power grid in the opposite order (last off, first on) in approximately 1-15 minute intervals as set by the reconnect settings .","The reconnect timer  may be viewed as an optional circuit, since a reconnect feature may not be desirable in all cases. Another embodiment, where the reconnect timer is not used, is discussed below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A and 6B"},"In the monitoring and control procedure, the three phases are monitored for voltage modulation (step ). The frequency of modulation may vary from about 1 Hz to about 20 Hz. The disconnect time interval is settable (via disconnect settings ) at a time from about 1 second to about 15 seconds. The reconnect time interval is settable (via reconnect settings ) at a time from about 1 minute to about 15 minutes.","Normal operation  is characterized by a voltage modulation not greater than 2.6 VRMS. If the voltage modulation exceeds this value, but is less than the maximum permitted value (3.25 VRMS in this example; step ), a RESTRICTED mode is set; this condition is communicated via a communication interface (step ). In the restricted mode, unused connections on the grid are turned off, but connections in use are not affected (step ).","If the voltage modulation increases to a value greater than 3.25 VRMS (step ), a DISABLED mode is set and communicated (step ). Power to the PEDs is disabled (step ), one connection at a time and at the set interval (between 1 and 15 seconds), for the selected period (between 1 and 15 minutes).","When the reconnect time period expires (step ), and if the voltage modulation has decreased to less than 2 VRMS (steps , ), the ENABLED mode is set and communicated (step ). The disabled power connections are re-enabled in reverse order to their being disabled. Unused connections, previously turned off, are turned on again.","Steps in a self-test (BITE) procedure, performed at power on or by an external command  from a user of the system, are shown in . The controller checks the voltage references, thresholds, and discrete driver output (step ). The system is checked for a missing phase and for a modulation in any phase of greater than 3.25 VRMS (step ). The system is held in the DISABLED mode until the test is successful.","If the test is successful (step ), a BITE status of PASS is communicated (step ); signal  resets the disable driver circuit . If the test is not successful, a BITE status of FAIL is communicated (step ), and the system continues in the DISABLED mode (step ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIGS. 7-9","FIG. 7","FIGS. 7A-7C","FIG. 8","FIGS. 8A-8E","FIG. 9"],"b":["41","6","42","43","44","45","34","51","52","54","55","35","37","361","363","371","373","38"]},"An alternative embodiment is shown schematically in . In the MMCU  of this embodiment, a programmable controller is not used (compare ). A separate SELF TEST circuit , coupled to the timer control circuit, sends self-test signals to the phase modulation detectors in response to a signal from a RESET circuit . As in the previous embodiment, the self-test procedure may also be invoked upon activation of the system or in response to a command from a user of the system. The MMCU may also be configured without a reconnect feature, as shown in . In this embodiment, the MMCU disables (disconnects) loads successively at a preset disconnect interval to bring the modulation back below the threshold value, but does not automatically reconnect the loads.","While the disclosure has been described in terms of specific embodiments, it is evident in view of the foregoing description that numerous alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the disclosure is intended to encompass all such alternatives, modifications and variations which fall within the scope and spirit of the disclosure and the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A and 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 7A-7C","FIGS. 7A-7C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIGS. 8A-8E","FIGS. 8A-8E"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
