title: Upload security scheme
abstract: The need for upload security arises during content sharing between users in communication link with each other and a server. In one embodiment, providing the upload security involves the server identifying a mobile device that sends an upload message destined to a user. Providing the upload security further involves the server accessing opt-in parameters predetermined by the user, determining if the identity of the sending mobile device is included in the opt-in parameters, and, if so, allowing the upload to the user's account, otherwise blocking the upload. The opt-in parameters include the identity of mobile devices that are authorized by the user to upload data to the user's account. In one embodiment, the communication link includes a wireless carrier network with capability for security screening of the upload message before it reaches the server based on the identity of the wireless carrier network.

No. 10\/934,645 filed on Sep. 2, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,797,529 and entitled \u201cUPLOAD SECURITY SCHEME,\u201d which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/518,898 filed Nov. 10, 2003 and entitled \u201cBACK BUTTON IN MOBILE APPLICATION,\u201d U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/518,858 filed Nov. 10, 2003 and entitled \u201cNAVIGATION PATTERN ON A DIRECTORY TREE,\u201d U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/518,857 filed Nov. 10, 2003 and entitled \u201cBACKUP AND RESTORE IN MOBILE APPLICATIONS,\u201d and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/518,897 filed Nov. 10, 2003 and entitled \u201cUPLOAD SECURITY SCHEME;\u201d each of the non-provisional and provisional applications being incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates generally to wireless mobile devices and more particularly to applications that offer upload security. Among such applications, one type is a mobile photos application.","Mobile-friendly technologies are advanced to provide a rich multimedia environment and enhance the wireless device users' experience. An outcome of this evolution is the manifest closeness between the wireless universe and the Internet domain, as well as the advent of wireless devices with multimedia capabilities. The newest versions of mobile wireless devices such as digital mobile phones, pagers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), handsets, and any other wireless terminals, have multimedia capabilities including the ability to retrieve e-mail, and push and pull information via the Internet.","One practice these capabilities allow is sharing content, such as photos. At the same time, there needs to be a way for managing this activity. One reason for controlling content sharing is security. Typically, the need for security arises from the risk of unauthorized access to data. In the case of content sharing, the need for security arises from the additional risk of unauthorized imposition, where a sender (mobile user) uploads unwanted or excess content for a recipient without first obtaining the recipient's permission. Accordingly, the present invention provides possible ways for addressing the risks associated with unauthorized imposition.","The present invention is based, in part, on the observation that a need exists for upload security, and that it can be improved as described below. Accordingly, the upload security concept is implemented so as to allow content sharing without the imposition of unwanted or too frequent uploads.","For the purpose of this invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a method, a computer readable medium and a system are proposed as possible implementations of the upload security concept. These implementations typically involve a server in communication link with a plurality of mobile devices. In the examples below the mobile devices are typically wireless devices such as wireless camera phones and the content is photograph data (or simply one or more photos).","In one embodiment, a method for providing upload security, includes identifying the mobile device used by a sender of an upload message destined to a user, in response to the server receiving the upload message from the mobile device via a network. The method also includes accessing, in the server, opt-in parameters predetermined by the user, determining if the identity of the mobile device used by the sender is included in the opt-in parameters, and if so, allowing upload of content from the upload message to the account associated with the user. Otherwise the upload is blocked. The opt-in parameters include the identity of mobile devices that are authorized by the user to upload data to an account on the server associated with the user. In addition, optionally, the opt-in parameters include a limit number of upload messages which are authorized by the user during a given period, and wherein the method further comprises determining if the limit number for the sender is exceeded by the upload message such that it is not permitted by the user and thus the upload is blocked. If the upload is blocked, the method optionally includes rerouting the upload message to a standard email address of the user.","In this embodiment, the network includes a wireless carrier network and a networking service which provides security screening of the upload message before it reaches the server based on the identity of the wireless carrier network. The identity of the wireless carrier network includes an internet protocol (IP) address. The identity of the wireless phone is a phone number assigned to it by the bearer of the wireless carrier network. In this instance, the IP address is combined with the identity of the mobile device in the upload message, such that the method further includes parsing the upload message to obtain the IP address and the identity of the mobile device.","Further in this method, the sender uses email as a transport mechanism for the upload message. The sender identifies to the server the user for whom the upload message is destined by indicating the user's email address. Then, the server correlates the user's email address with the account associated with the user. If the capability exists, the method further includes establishing a communication link from the sender's mobile device to the user in order to prompt the user to indicate, on the user's mobile device or personal computer, whether the user wants to add the sender's mobile device identity to the opt-in parameters (in order to allow the upload).","The approach described above can be implemented in a computer readable medium embodying a computer program with program code for providing the upload security. In this implementation, the computer program is divided into parts, one part being at a server side, a second part being at a client side and a third part being at a networking service. A system for providing the upload security includes the server, plurality of the mobile devices and typically also a wireless network, the Internet and a gateway through which the server communicates with the mobile devices. The server is configured with a processor and a memory embodying a server-side program as a portion of a computer application. The server-side program includes program code for causing the processor in the server to perform the aforementioned identifying, accessing, determining and authorizing steps, in response to the server receiving from such mobile the upload message.","As can be understood from these examples, by introducing the upload security capability to the system, the present invention makes the content sharing more useful, secure and user friendly. Such advantages will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art from the description and practice of the invention disclosed herein.","The present invention contemplates upload security and implementation of this concept in mobile applications. One such application is mobile photos, an example of which is referred to as the Yahoo! Photos\u2122 application. Yahoo! and Yahoo! Photos are trademarks of Yahoo! Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif. Any other trademarks are the property of their respective holders.","Although it can be implemented in various applications, for clarity and for illustration, the approach contemplated by the present invention is described here in the context of the Yahoo! Photos application. The server side of this application is the \u201cserver Yahoo! Photos,\u201d and the client side of this application is the mobile client application, or \u201cclient Yahoo! Photos.\u201d A client application is generally considered to be a downloadable application; namely, J2ME\u2122 (Java\u2122 2 platform, Micro Edition, by Sun Microsystems, Inc.), Yahoo! Photos\u2122, or any other application that is downloadable to the mobile device. In the example here, the client Yahoo! Photos runs on a mobile phone, and more specifically, a mobile camera phone.","The Wireless Communication Environment","A. Wireless Communication Protocols","Wireless protocols, the standards which govern communications of data between wireless devices and the Internet, utilize and support the enhanced capabilities of modern mobile wireless devices and Internet content technologies. Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is an often used standard, and other standards include the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), M-services, i-Mode and Web clipping. Although other protocols are also possible, WAP appears to provide a proper framework for the content sharing. Therefore, adoption of standards such as WAP is suitable for the purpose of the present invention, and it is discussed in some detail below.","The adoption of WAP builds on existing Internet standards and protocols adapted for use in wireless communication networks and addresses the unique characteristics of mobile wireless devices (with limited computing, memory, display, user interface, and power capabilities). WAP is a specification suite defining a set of protocols for presentation and delivery of wireless information and telephony services on mobile wireless devices. WAP services provide information access and delivery to WAP-enabled devices. WAP was designed to empower users with easy and instant access to information and interactive services. Thus, interoperability between WAP-enabled device is possible through any WAP-compliant infrastructure to deliver timely information and accept transaction and queries.","WAP can be built on any operating system, including PalmOS, EPOC, Windows CE, FLEXOS, OS\/9, JAVA OS etc. Being air interface independent, WAP is designed to be scalable to new networks as they develop, allowing bearer independence and development of common solutions across disparate networks.","The term \u201cWAP\u201d is commonly used to refer to the wireless application environment (WAE) although it is WAE that includes the WAP suit of protocols and technologies. WAE provides the rich application environment which enables delivery of information and interactive services to mobile wireless devices. An important aspect of the WAE is the WAP stack, namely the wireless protocol layers, as shown for example in . At the bottom of the WAP stack 11 is a network layer, topped by the transport layer, the security layer, the transaction layer, and the session layer.","Briefly, the network protocol layer supports network interface definitions, governing interface with the networks of wireless service providers (wireless bearers) such as short message service (SMS), code division multiple access (CDMA), cellular digital packet data (CDPD), general packet radio service (GPRS), high speed circuit-switched data (HSCSD), third generation (3G), GSM (global system for mobile communications), and unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) channel. The wireless transport layer supports the wireless datagram protocol (WDP), and when operating over an IP (Internet protocol) network layer WDP is replaced with user datagram protocol\/IP (UDP\/IP). WDP offers to the upper protocol layers a datagram service and transparent communication over the underlying bearer services. In other words, WDP offers to the upper protocol layers a common interface to and ability to function independent of the type of bearer wireless network. The wireless transport layer security (WTLS) provides a secure transport service to preserve the privacy, authentication and data integrity of the transport service at the layer below, as well as the ability to create and terminate secure connections between communicating applications. The transaction protocol (WTP) layer provides transaction oriented protocol for the WAP datagram service, including, for example, request-response transactions. The wireless session protocol (WSP) layer provides HTTP\/1.1 functionality and features such as session suspend\/resume. The WSP provides the upper-level application lever of the WAE with an interface to connection and connectionless services operating above the transaction protocol and the datagram transport layers, respectively.","The WAE (i.e., the wireless application environment) is further fashioned with a wireless markup language (WML) micro-browser, a WML script virtual machine, a WML script standard library, a wireless telephony application interface (TAI), and WAP content types. The WAP micro-browser, also referred to as the \u201cWAP browser,\u201d facilitates interaction between WAP\/Web applications and WAP-enabled devices. The micro-browser is a tag-based wireless browser application supporting wireless markup language (WML), and extensible transport hyperlink markup language (XTHML). The micro-browser uses the \u201ccard\u201d metaphor for user interface, where user interactions are split into cards. The WAP card metaphor provides a common interface to which all applications can conform, much like the desktop metaphor in PCs. The micro-browser supports user actions, defined at tree levels (deck, card, and select & link options, i.e., , etc.) and default tasks (, etc.). For example, a deck of cards is split into a navigation card, variables card, and input elements card. A navigation card is formed as a script encapsulated with the \u2018card\u2019 tags. The following example of a card includes the type of interaction (\u201d) and link (=\u201c#e\u201d).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<CARD>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<DO TYPE=\u201dACCEPT\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<GO URL=\u201d#eCARD\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/DO"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003WELCOME!"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/CARD>"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"B. Wireless Communication Infrastructure",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","100","18","16","18","18"]},"Indeed, with this capability, users can capture photo images in their mobile devices, store and manipulate the captured images, and upload data of the captured images to a server (e.g., server ). Thus, the server  operates as a repository for the data of photo images, and users can download from the server to their mobile devices data of previously captured photo images, as well as store and manipulate such images. Photos resident on one mobile device can be shared with another via the server  and the communication network(s)  and .","In this wireless interconnect model, the mobile phones used to download the Yahoo! Photos client side program are WAP-enabled. As shown in , the WAP-enabled devices  support the WAP protocol and the server  typically supports the WWW (world-wide web) protocol. In particular, the wireless application environment at the mobile device side  includes the micro-browser, a suite of WAP protocols at the network through session layers, and the downloadable (client-side) Yahoo! Photos application program. The micro-browser defines how WML documents and WML script applets should be interpreted and presented to the mobile device user. The Micro-browser's WTA (wireless telephone application) functionality provides call control, phone book access and messaging within WML script applets to allow selective call forwarding or other secure telephony. The wireless application environment at the server side  includes the server-side Yahoo! Photos in addition to a standard web browser and WWW protocol stack (HTTP and TCP\/IP).","To enable web-based access to content, service providers deploy wireless data through the carrier network  while controlling the data communications to their subscribers and tracking the billable activity. Typically, the gateway  is tasked with tracking subscriber activities, controlling access and, in addition, functioning as the proxy for the mobile device , on the one hand, and for the server , on the other hand. The gateway  is implemented, building on standard web proxy technology, to interconnect the services offered by the wireless service providers to the HTTP protocol so as to permit access to content on the wired Internet.","One model of interaction between a WAP-enabled device, the WAP-enabled proxy\/gateway, and the server, is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 1.1 response\/request transaction, where HTTP 1.1 is profiled for the wireless environment. The gateway ( & ) translates requests from the WAP protocol to the WWW protocol, and vice versa; translating WML(\/HTML) documents to HTML(\/WML), resolving domain names in URLs and providing a control point for managing access. From the WAP-enabled gateway with encoders\/decoders, the URL requests or WML documents (possibly in encoded form) can be sent encoded\/decoded to add security to the user interaction. Note that, unlike the flat structure of HTML documents, WML documents are divided into a set of user interaction units, namely a deck of cards. Each user interaction unit is a card (or page), and the user can navigate between cards in one or more WML documents.","Another model of interaction between a WAP-enabled device, the WAP-enabled proxy\/gateway, and the server, is the HTTP response\/request transaction (protocol running on top of the Internet's TCP\/IP suite of protocols). This model is appropriate for the newer WAP 2.0 (with protocol stack not shown in ). Unlike the above-mentioned, and illustrated, WAP stack 11, WAP 2.0 stack includes the IP, TCP (transmission control protocol), TLS, HTTP and WAE layers atop the network layer (all of which are profiled for wireless environment). For example, the wireless profile for the TLS protocol will permit interoperability for secure transactions.","Yet another model of interaction via bearer networks, between 3-generation (3G)-enabled mobile devices and servers or other devices, is shown in . As shown, a 3G terminal supports higher-speed, wider-band wireless cellular service communications based on various technologies, including wide code division multiple access (W-CDMA), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), unified threat management system (UMTS), and high speed circuit switched data (HSCSD). A 3G terminal is equipped with cordless connections for local, short distance communications. The communication protocols in the 3G terminal are comparable to the open system interconnection (OSI) protocols, layered in the OSI stack.","Various services are supported by these protocols, including web browsing, short message service (SMS), multimedia messaging service (MMS), e-mail, M-commerce, real-time video, and pre-paid. The MMS, for example, is a store and forward messaging service capable of adding multimedia elements to SMS, including images, text, audio clips, and video clips. MMS is synchronized across a common timeline, rather than being discrete like e-mail and SMS; it is akin to a presentation layer over e-mail and looking like a slide show with images. On a compatible phone, the MMS message will appear with a new message alert. The picture message will open on the screen, the text will appear below the image and the sound will begin to play automatically.","Downloadable applications such as Yahoo! Photos and network games are likewise supported in the 3G terminal and interact with services such as MMS. The originator can easily create a multimedia message, either using a built-in or accessory camera, or can use images and sounds stored previously in the phone (and possibly downloaded from a web site). However, for simplicity, the following description assumes that the mobile device is a WAP-enabled camera phone used for downloading photo applications such as the Yahoo! Photos.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","100","112","100","114","116","118","110"]},"As further shown in , the Yahoo!-enabled phone  supports wireless cellular service communications based on various technologies such as the GPRS and GSM. This device is configured for supporting WAP communication protocols (at all layers of the WAP stack). Various services shown as being supported by these protocols, include web browsing, SMS, MMS, e-mail, M-commerce, real-time video, and pre-paid. The downloadable programs shown to interact with such services include the network games and Yahoo! Photos.","The mobile device functionality is preferably implemented using a platform, such as the J2ME\u2122 platform, which is tailored for a broad range of embedded devices including mobile phones. The J2ME\u2122 platform includes a set of standard Java APIs (application programming Interface), and provides a user interface, a security model, built-in network protocols (e.g., WAP, as shown in ), and support for networked and disconnected applications (Yahoo! Photos is a networked application).","With the J2ME\u2122 platform, applications are written once for a wide range of device. Applications leveraging each device's native capabilities are then downloaded dynamically. The J2ME\u2122 platform defines configurations, profiles and optional packages as elements for building complete Java run time environments. Configurations are composed of a virtual machine and a minimal set of class libraries and provide the base functionality for a particular range of devices that share similar characteristics. Current configurations include connected limited device configuration (CLDC) for devices with limited memory and processing capabilities (e.g., mobile phones, two-way pagers, and PDAs) and connected device configuration (CDC) for devices with better memory, processing and network bandwidth capabilities (e.g., TV set-top boxes, residential gateways, in-vehicle telematics systems, and hi-end PDAs). However, in order to provide a complete runtime environment targeted at specific device categories, the configurations must be combined with a set of the high-level APIs, or profiles, that further define the application life cycle model, access to device-specific properties, and user interface.","One example of profiles is the mobile information device profile (MIDP) which is designed for mobile phones and entry-level PDAs. MIDP offers a core application functionality required by mobile applications, including user interface, network connectivity, local data storage, and application management. The J2ME\u2122 can be further extended by combining various optional packages and their corresponding profiles to address specific market requirements, e.g., Bluetooth\u2122, web services, wireless messaging, multimedia, and database connectivity.","The Upload Security in the Context of Mobile Yahoo! Photos","Note that the example here focuses on the camera phone, but the principles of the present invention are not limited to camera phones. Any phone or other wireless mobile device can embody a variation of the present invention. When the mobile device is a smart handset, downloading application programs and implementing the upload security scheme are possible even though the communications with the service provider may be different in character.","It should be mentioned that, although the manufacturer provides the Yahoo!-enabled phone  with camera functionality\u2014i.e., functionality for capturing images, and saving, displaying, manipulating, transmitting and receiving data of image\u2014this camera functionality is independent from the Yahoo! Photos program. That is, data of the captured images reside in the mobile phone outside the Yahoo! Photos environment until such time that this data is introduced to the Yahoo! Photos environment by being first uploaded to the Yahoo! server and then downloaded to the local (mobile) Yahoo! Photos album, as will be later explained.","On mobile devices, various client application programs are offered to the user on a default start-up or main menu screen or on a manufacturer-installed virtual vending machine screen. Other selection items include, for example, the menu item for setting the sound. These start up and vending screens show a menu with a list (or icons) of applications which the user can obtain by following an install procedure. The menu provides links to various service web sites, including, for example, the Yahoo! Photos site. The links, of course, are URLs (Uniform Resource Locator)\u2014i.e., the world wide web address of a site on the Internet, and on the Yahoo!-enabled phone, at least one such menu item is the link for downloading the Yahoo! Photos application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","303","304","304","306","306","306","400","320","500"],"i":["a","b","d"],"sub":"A-D"},"If the user accepts the offer to buy the application, the order is confirmed  and the application is downloaded into the mobile phone, becoming resident on the mobile phone.  show the respective PC-based and mobile-based registration and buy flow diagrams.","Incidentally, as shown in , if the user confirms acceptance, assuming the user has an account on the server having signed in before, the user is prompted to provide the telephone number of the mobile phone. With that phone number, the server sends a short message embedded with a link to the mobile phone and causes the mobile phone to vibrate or, otherwise, signals the user with a message requesting confirmation of the purchase . With this confirmation  the server proceeds to send the program to the mobile phone.","As shown in , registration can originate on the PC or the mobile phone. In the PC-based registration process, once, the compatible phone list is reviewed  and the phone is deemed compatible, registration can go forward starting with the user entering the 10-digit mobile phone number . The service provider dials the 10-digit phone number and requests confirmation from the user via that mobile phone . The user is also prompted to follow the buy instructions  or follow the link to the vending machine . Once the download takes place the Yahoo! Photos client home page  is presented on the mobile screen. Alternatively, rather than indirectly via the PC, a program such as Yahoo! Photos can be purchased directly via the mobile phone, as shown in . That is, the registration process originating from the mobile phone is launched from the menu page, e.g. Yahoo! home pages  or . Beyond that, the link to (virtual) vendor machine page , download page , confirmation page  and home page  are similar to those in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 4D","b":["480","482","486","488","490","492","494","498"]},"For implementing upload security, as mentioned above, the registration and buy process of  includes setting the upload opt-in  parameters.  shows an upload opt-in process  for setting the user's upload parameters that establish the user's upload preferences (once the upload opt-in module is invoked ). Preferably at the PC, the user is prompted to enter the service provider-issued phone numbers of mobile phones authorized by the user to upload their photos to the user's Yahoo! Photos account (on the server) . The user is additionally prompted to enter one or more of the user's e-mails, e.g., <user reg.#@messaging.sprintPCS> or other e-mails, e.g., <jsmith@sprintpcs.com>, through which the photos are uploaded to the user account . The e-mails are posted on the approved list. Although it is not shown, the user can additionally pre-select the maximum number of upload messages the user wants to receive in a day (or any other predefined period of time). At the end of this selection process the user is prompted to confirm the entries  before they are stored in the database for future reference.

Photos prompts this program to display the \u2018home\u2019 page . with two main options: mobile album, and online album (as shown in ). The mobile album is an album of photos stored locally on the mobile phone, so that the user need not go out over the network to obtain them. The online album is an album of photos stored on the server in the user's account. As mentioned before, photo images can be captured and manipulated by the mobile phone outside the Yahoo! Photos environment. These photo images will not be available at the mobile or online albums until they are uploaded to the server, stored in the online album and then (selectively or in batch) downloaded to the mobile album, and vice versa. Accordingly, selecting \u2018online album\u2019 allows the user to access and manipulate photo images that have already been uploaded to the server from the user's PC or mobile phone and stored in the online album. Likewise, selecting \u2018mobile album\u2019 allows the user to access and manipulate photo images that have been already downloaded from the server into the mobile album.","Then, if the \u2018online album\u2019 option is selected from the Yahoo! Photos client program \u2018home\u2019 page (.), as shown in , it prompts the program to display the next page which is the \u2018sign-in\u2019 page (.). It requires the user to follow a sign-in procedure that typically includes providing a Yahoo! ID and user password. The sign-in procedure will, among others, bring up the user's account and relate it to the user's online albums. That is, the sign-in procedure allows the user to access his account via the Internet (and other proprietary network if applicable).","The next page is the \u2018my online albums\u2019 page (.). For the specific user, this online albums page lists the names of photo albums available to the named user which are associated with the user's account. Of course, only albums that are on the server are listed, and if the selected album is empty the next page will display an indication to that effect (i.e., \u201cthis album is currently empty\u201d at page; ..). Alternatively, if the album is not empty, selecting that album will bring up the next page, the \u2018photo list\u2019 page for that album (..). In the \u2018photo list\u2019 page, a photo can be selected for downloading it from the server onto the mobile phone. Additionally, a selected photo can be opened or other actions can be invoked in relation to it. The other actions are presented in a menu that is shown on the screen as a pull-down menu, pop-up menu, or a menu superimposed on any part of the current page (in this example the menu is shown as a pull-down menu).","Such menu (hereafter \u201cphoto options menu\u201d) provides a number of selection items, each of each representing an action, including: \u2018save to mobile,\u2019 \u2018email photo,\u2019 \u2018screen saver,\u2019 \u2018thumbnails,\u2019 \u2018online albums,\u2019 and \u2018home.\u2019 Each selection brings up a page that corresponds to the selected action item. Two of the action items have already been discussed above, \u2018home\u2019 and \u2018online album.\u2019 Selecting home, will lead the user back to the home page (.), and selecting online album, will lead the user to the aforementioned \u2018my online albums\u2019 page (.).","Selecting \u2018thumbnails\u2019 brings up a \u2018photo thumbs\u2019 page .. that shows a group of thumbnail photo images from the selected album. Note that the number of photo thumb groups downloaded from the server depends on the memory size of the mobile phone (or whatever device is used). With this feature, the user can then thumbnail through the groups of photos in the album. The groups of thumbnail photo images in this album are each loaded from the server. The user can then move between the images back and forth (scroll back and forth) and select any one of the photos in the \u2018thumbnails\u2019 page.

The \u2018added to mobile\u2019 page (..) is brought up in this case to show the photo being saved and to give an indication that saving is done.","When \u2018email photo\u2019 action is invoked, the \u2018share as email\u2019 page comes up (..). This page shows the photo(s) selected for emailing and prompts the user for the email address. In this implementation, a number of recently-used email addresses are provided. Incidentally, \u2018email\u2019 is simply a transport mechanism which is presently used to send photos from camera phones. Other transport mechanisms may be developed and employed for this application. Then, when the photo is emailed from the mobile phone to the selected e-mail address, a message pops up indicating that the email has been sent or, if not, that an error occurred. For example, a transmission will fail if the user is not authorized to upload photos to the selected e-mail. An error message of this kind is a product of the upload security scheme contemplated by the present invention, as embodied in the Yahoo! Photos application program. More details on the upload security are provided below with reference to , B and C.","When the \u2018screen saver\u2019 action is invoked, the selected photo will be used to populate the screen when the phone is idle, standing by, or starting up. The \u2018screen saver\u2019 option is associated with screen saver page (..) which shows the selected photo and requires the user to select \u2018OK\u2019 or \u2018cancel\u2019 to add this photo to the screen saver photo roster. A message pops up to indicate the status of the photo download.","Going back to the mobile album is possible with the photo options menu via the \u2018home\u2019 page, using the \u2018home\u2019 option as discussed above. Another way for getting to the mobile album or any other previous page is with the \u201cback\u201d action using the \u2018back\u2019 button, as will be later explained. Also, as mentioned above, when the Yahoo! Photos application is invoked from the landing\/menu page, the \u2018home\u2019 page (.) presents the \u2018mobile album\u2019 as one of the selection items. Accordingly, the mobile album can be directly accessed via the \u2018home\u2019 page.","The mobile album screen flow, shown in , starts with the \u2018home\u2019 page (.) and selection of the mobile album brings up the \u2018mobile photo\u2019 list page (..). This page presents two action menus, \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018action.\u2019 Thus, selection of any of the listed photos can be followed by selecting \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018action.\u2019 As before, when \u2018open\u2019 is selected the photo is shown on the screen in the \u2018photo thumbs\u2019 page (..). When \u2018actions\u2019 is selected, a mobile photo action menu is provided. This menu includes action items such as \u2018slide show,\u2019 \u2018move,\u2019 \u2018delete photo,\u2019 \u2018delete all\u2019 (photos), \u2018thumbnails,\u2019 \u2018history,\u2019 and \u2018home.\u2019","Except for the photos being local (at the mobile album), the thumbnails feature, associated with the \u2018photo thumbs\u2019 page (..), works as described above with reference to the online album. A photo selected on the mobile \u2018photo thumbs\u2019 page can be enlarged as shown in the next page, the \u2018mobile photo\u2019 page (..). The menu for the \u2018photo thumbs\u2019 and \u2018mobile photo\u2019 pages includes a subset of the aforementioned mobile photo action menu.","When the slide show is invoked from such a menu the \u2018mobile slide show\u2019 page comes up (.). While this feature is active, the slide show will scroll through the mobile album photos, showing each photo for a certain period. The slide show will go on until the user selects \u2018stop\u2019 on the bottom of the page. If the user selects \u2018actions\u2019 a slide show menu gives the user the options of \u2018pause,\u2019 \u2018show,\u2019 \u2018normal,\u2019 and \u2018fast.\u2019 The \u2018pause\u2019 option is selected for pausing the slide show; \u2018slow\u2019 will slow down the slide show, \u2018speed\u2019 will speed up the slide show, and \u2018normal\u2019 will bring it to normal speed. (, parts (i) and (ii), describes setting up favorites for the mobile album slideshow; part (i) describes the process in the mobile device, and part (ii) describes the process originating at the PC).","As further shown in , the \u2018move\u2019 page comes up (..) when the \u2018move\u2019 action (referred to also as \u2018rearrange\u2019 action) is selected from any one of the three pages (.., .. and ..). In this page, the program displays a group of photos (thumbnails) and the user can rearrange the photos using the 5-point navigation key, as well as choose to drop a photo or save it ( shows flow diagrams for photos view, share and save). When the \u2018delete\u2019 or \u2018delete all\u2019 actions are selected, the user has the option of deleting or canceling the delete action (as shown in pages .. and ..). The \u2018delete\u2019 page shows the photo selected for deletion to allow the user to change their mind. When all the photos are deleted, or when the mobile album is empty to begin with, the \u2018mobile album empty\u2019 page is displayed (..). It allows the user to select the home page or select the answer to any one of the queries, such as \u201cwhere are my photos?\u201d and \u201cwhat is the mobile album?.\u201d Selection of the latter will bring up the \u2018about\u2019 page (...), and in this page pressing \u2018OK\u2019 provides user access to the online album(s). Selection of the former brings up the \u2018restore album\u2019 page .... The \u201crestore\u201d function is explained in more detail below.","Note that, when the user signs in, the server associates the user's identification with his historical record so that the application program can record (backup) the photo in the server each time the user saves a photo to the mobile album. This historical record serves as a backup that allows the user to restore his album if the Yahoo! Photos program is erased, for any reason, from the mobile phone memory and the user then reloads this program. This history feature is useful to reduce the navigation for restoring the mobile album since the server maintains this information in the user's client account.","It is important to note that although the history feature is described in the context of the Yahoo! Photos program, it is useful in any mobile device application where backup is desired. Thus, although this feature is implemented for the Yahoo! Photos application, it can be implemented more generically for other applications.","In the Yahoo! Photos context, every photo from the user's online album that is saved to the mobile album is \u2018remembered\u2019 by the server. Preferably, since the page traversal path is not predictive the history is recorded accurately and fully. This is made possible with the association of the user's Yahoo! ID to a user's historical record on the server that records all photos saved by the user to the mobile album. Moreover, since each mobile phone device is distinct, and a user may have more than one device, each device can in principle have its own distinct historical record. However, it can be arranged when the user first establishes or later updates his account that the user's Yahoo! ID is associated with a plurality of mobile phones and, upon signing in, the user can have access to his historical record from any one of these mobile phones. Thus, in a situation where the Yahoo! Photos program is deleted somehow or photos in the mobile album are erased for some reason the historical record provides a mobile album backup for restoring that album.","To that end, when the user reloads the application, it will query the user as to whether the user wishes to restore any of the mobile album photos. That is, when the user selects the query \u201cwhere are my photos?\u201d (in page ..) the \u2018restore album\u2019 page is displayed (...). As with the previous page (..), this page allows the user to go to the \u2018home\u2019 page (.) and, this time via \u2018OK\u2019, it allows the user to go to the next mobile \u2018restore album\u2019 page (....) for a historical photo download list (of photos previously downloaded to the mobile phone).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 6E","b":["2","0","3","1","4","3","1","4","2","33","35","3","1","4","2","1","37","3","1","1"]},"Note that the pages shown in  and discussed herein are exemplary rather than exhaustive, and they do not necessarily include all possible pages (or user interaction cards) that a photo application such as Yahoo! Photos presents. Moreover, the reference designations (call-out numbers) typically refer to the pages themselves rather than any portion of their content. Where applicable, similar pages appear in different figures with the same call-out numbers, e.g., home page ., although their respective contents can vary slightly.","As to navigating through the pages on the mobile phone, the pages can be traversed forward as described above and they can be traversed backwards using the \u201cback button\u201d feature.  provides a simplified diagram to illustrate the \u201cback button\u201d feature. As can be seen, the \u201cback a level\u201d mode allows hierarchical backwards sequence traversal one level each time the \u2018back\u2019 button is touch activated or clicked (hereafter \u201cclicked\u201d). The \u201cback in sequence\u201d mode allows sequential backwards one page each time the \u2018back\u2019 button is pressed. For example, in back a level mode, back a level takes the application from a photo page (e.g., 6) one level up to the list of photos page (); and from there one more level up to the list of albums page () and one more level up to the home page (). As can be further seen in this example, the back in sequence mode functions to take the application from the current photo page () to the former photo page (), rather than up one level (), when the back button is touched. Additional activations of the back button will traverse through all the pages in reverse sequence.","It makes no difference if the \u201cback button\u201d feature is used while in the online album or mobile album part of the application. The principles apply equally well to both situations. Either way, the steps (pages traversed) are remembered, and they can be recorded server side, locally, or both on the server side and locally.","Having mentioned it in the above overview of the Yahoo! Photos application, we turn again to upload security for a more detailed description of this scheme in the context of Yahoo! Photos. As indicated, the idea is to provide a new scheme for uploading photos to online accounts in a secure manner so as to prevent spam and unauthorized uploading. At the outset, the upload security scheme involves an opt-in process ( in ) which prompts the Yahoo! Photos user to pre register phone numbers of camera phones that will be authorized to upload to the user's Yahoo! Photos account. For each phone authorized, the user can also pre-select the maximum number of upload messages the user wants to receive in a day (or any other predefined period of time). At the end of this selection process the phone number, the carrier, and the message limit are stored in the database for future reference. At any point subsequent to the opt-in phase, when an email photo upload to a Yahoo! Photos user account is conducted from any camera phone, the upload security scheme refers to the user's predetermined upload parameters for authorization of the photo upload via that email. In particular, when the \u2018email photo\u2019 action is invoked by a user, the \u2018share as email\u2019 page (..) comes up on the user's mobile device and shows the photo(s) selected for emailing. The page also prompts the user for an email address for the upload.","In one possible implementation, a number of recently-used destination email addresses are provided. The user can select one of these emails or enter a new destination email address. The user will send the photo to that address, provided however that the user is allowed to upload photos to that destination user's Yahoo! Photos account.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIGS. 8A-C","FIG. 8A","FIGS. 8B-C"]},"In this example, the step  shown in , includes taking the photo on the mobile camera phone. Step  varies with each device, and it might be \u2018share\u2019 or \u2018send\u2019 the photo from the mobile phone. Step  includes prompting the user to enter the destination email address.","As noted above, even though this looks like a standard email address, the recipient does not actually receive an email in his or her Yahoo! Mail inbox. Rather, email is the transport mechanism and the emails are sent to Yahoo! Photos upload e-mail servers. Each photo message is identified with a particular Yahoo! Photos user account. This email address takes the form: Yahoo!ID@photos.Yahoo.com. Suppose that the destination Yahoo! ID is JSmith, then the email is (\u201cTo:\u201d) jsmith@photos.Yahoo.com and the Yahoo! Photos upload e-mail server identifies this email with JSmith's Yahoo! Photos account. In a different version, in addition to the photo, this email includes the photo name and destination album (JSmith's album) on the Yahoo! Photos Server.","The email transport protocol in this instance is SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol defined in STD 10, RFC 821), which is commonly used to transfer electronic mail between computers. Among others, MMS and SMS protocols are possible alternatives. SMTP is typically a server to server protocol, so other protocols are used to access the messages. The SMTP dialog usually happens in the background under the control of the message transfer agent, e.g. sendmail, but it is possible to interact with an SMTP server using telnet to connect to the normal SMTP port. The local host (of the carrier) is typically identified by the IP address of its gateway.","Once the destination is known, the email is sent from the mobile phone to the server, i.e., Yahoo! Photos upload email server  (note that Yahoo! email and Yahoo! Photos are shown as being handled by the same server, but other configurations are possible). On its way to the server, the photo email is transported via the carrier network (e.g., Sprint PCS network)  and is first transmitted to carrier's SMTP Server. The carrier SMTP server then forwards the messages to Yahoo! Photos upload SMTP servers.","At the carrier's server (not specifically shown but represented by the carrier network ), the email sender's mobile phone number (mobile ID number) is identified and combined with the carrier's domain information to form the email source (\u201cFrom:\u201d) IP address, say, 408-555-555@messaging.sprintpcs.com. As soon as the photo message arrives at Yahoo! network, the IP address of SMTP server that originates the photo message is checked for validity at the security layer (in step  of the destination side). An invalid carrier domain renders the IP address invalid and on such determination the security layer blocks the email from proceeding further, where the Yahoo! Photos upload email server does not receive the blocked email. An IP address that is deemed valid by the security layer  is allowed to proceed to the Yahoo! Photos upload e-mail server .","After the photo message arrives at the Yahoo! Photos upload e-mail server, the Yahoo! ID, i.e., JSmith, is extracted from the destination email address, i.e., jsmith@photos.Yahoo.com (in step  of the destination side). The phone number and the carrier are extracted from the source address of the photo message. The phone number and carrier info are then used to check if the extracted destination Yahoo! ID has given permission to upload to the destination user's Yahoo! Photos account. As an example, let us assume that the extracted sender's mobile phone number is 408-555-555 and the carrier is SprintPCS. In addition, the extracted destination Yahoo! ID is JSmith. The server will then check the database to see if the phone number and carrier is in JSmith's approved upload list. This is to verify that JSmith authorized the sender (i.e., mobile phone 408-555-555 with SprintPCS) to upload photos to JSmith's Yahoo! Photos account. Upon determining that the upload is permitted, the server uploads the photo to JSmith's Yahoo! Photos account. Otherwise, an unauthorized upload is discarded. In a different version, the unauthorized email is redirected to a standard email address.","Having established the roles of the system components in the upload security scheme we move to the process diagram in . Again, one way upload security can be established is by access control using mobile phone numbers. For each user, the scheme requires the user to enter the approved mobile phone numbers. When an upload message is sent to the Yahoo! Photos upload e-mail server, the mobile phone number and carrier domain information are part of the \u201cFrom:\u201d IP address that accompanies the upload message. The phone number and carrier domain information are retrieved from the upload email message  and the carrier domain information and mobile phone number are checked to determine if the upload is authorized , , .","Approval of the carrier takes place at the security layer even before the message gets to the Yahoo! Photos upload e-mail servers. A network level filter is introduced in order to provide access control (using a list of SMTP gateways) based on IP addresses. This filter blocks all messages that are not from a global access control list (ACL) , . In this instance, the global access control list is built by collecting from Yahoo!'s carrier partners IP addresses of SMTP gateways used for e-mail photo sharing purpose. The messages sent from carriers that are not in the access control list are blocked at the network level . This way, the Yahoo! Photos upload email server receives only messages for uploading photos that are from carriers listed in the global ACL. Moreover, the ACL improves efficiency in that it insures that the server need not process email messages from unauthorized carriers or spammers and can focus its resources on processing emails from authorized carriers.","Once the server receives the email, the (sender's) phone number and the carrier are checked against the pre-authorized list in the database  which is associated with the destination user. If the pair of phone number and carrier exists in this list , the photo will be retrieved and inserted into the user's Yahoo! Photos account . Otherwise the message will be discarded. This insures that only photos sent from the mobile phones that are authorized are inserted into user's photos account.","Finally, we turn to the flow diagram in  for an overview of the upload rules. An email message sent to jdoe@photos.yahoo.com  is first filtered at the network security level . If it filters through the network security the message is routed to the Yahoo! Photos upload email server for further verification which involved one or more steps. In one variation of this scheme, only premium users (who are Yahoo! users, have logged in before and have purchased the Yahoo! Photos application) who have a right to selectively grant access to upload photos can upload their email photo messages . Otherwise, the message is discarded  or, optionally, redirected to a standard Yahoo! Mail address (jdoe@yahoo.com) of the (destination) user . The recipient can proceed to accept the photo and manually upload and store select photos , , , . Then, whether or not the premium user feature is present and is turned ON\/OFF, the next step  involves determining if the sender's mobile phone number is on the user's approved list and is authorized to upload the photo. If the sender's phone number is not on the approved list the email message is discarded  or, optionally, re-directed to the destination user's standard email address .","One limitation the user can impose is the number of uploads permitted in a period of time (e.g., day, hour or week). This limitation is set during user registration. Accordingly, the next step involves determining if the limit number, x, of permitted uploads is reached or not . If not, the upload can proceed, otherwise the message is discarded  or, optionally, redirected to the user's standard email address .","In one variation, a SMS message with embedded URL can be pushed to sender's mobile device if the sender is the owner of Yahoo! Photos account. The sender can then click the link and authorize uploading via a WAP session.","Once a photo is uploaded, the photo is stored in the user's account on the server . If, the user's album is specifically identified, the photo is directed to such album. If the photo name is identified the specific photo is uploaded and stored. It is anticipated that future photo programs will be designed with the capability to identify the photo by name and to identify the specific album to which the photo is directed.","In view of the above, the upload security scheme improves efficiency and controls access to user accounts. With the ever growing problem of rogue broadcasts, spasm and parasites, the controlled access of upload security helps block unwanted uploads.","Implementation Details","Additional implementation details associated with the foregoing description are provided below.
