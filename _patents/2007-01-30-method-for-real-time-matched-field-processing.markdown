title: Method for real time matched field processing
abstract: A method for utilizing a matched field-processing algorithm employing a number of sensors wherein the sensor output is the measured acoustic data as the first input and is translated to a frequency by applying a Fourier transform to a set of time samples as a data vector output. A replica vector is the second data input as a predicted quantity which is computed by an acoustic model with an assumed acoustic location. The output is an ambiguity surface ranging between zero and one with the highest values indicating the likely position of an acoustic location. The matched field response is generalized by averaging the response over multiple frequencies. A response for an array may be computed by forming beams and then combining them by multiplying each by an eigenray factor before summing. The computation of the response may be further defined by voxel interpolation.

No. 11\/767,787; filed 25 Jun. 2007, entitled \u201cPoint Source Localization Sonar System and Method\u201d by co-inventors, W. Robert Bernecky and Matthew J. Krzych.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a method for computing a real time matched field response using sensor outputs of a passive sonar array.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Matched field processing (MFP) is a sonar signal processing technique that incorporates acoustic propagation modeling into signal processing algorithms. MFP provides for localization of an acoustic point source in three dimensions.","In operation, the MFP beamformer matches the sound pressure field measured by an array of hydrophone sensors with a replica. The replica is derived from an acoustic propagation model and presumes a specific location for the acoustic source. That is, each hypothetical location of the presumed sound source determines, in conjunction with oceanic acoustic propagation parameters, a particular replica.","Each replica is matched with the measured field, and the maximum values computed by the MFP represent the replicas that most closely represent the received, measured signal. This information enables the MFP to estimate the location of a sound source in range (distance), bearing and depth.","Previous methods for computing a broadband matched field surface have various shortcomings. In a first shortcoming, the methods are computationally expensive. The methods are also not suitable for producing results in real time because the methods do not compute results at a rate equal to the rate of the incoming sensor data. Furthermore, the methods use stationary, vertically oriented arrays and cannot be used on mobile, horizontally towed sensor arrays. Also, no previous method efficiently compensates for the changing shape of a towed array of sensors.","As such, a need exists for computing a broadband matched field surface in real time as an improved method of determining the distance, angular bearing and depth of an acoustic source relative to a sonar sensor array. Preferably, the method would be flexible and mobile as well as comparatively inexpensive to existing methods.","Accordingly, it is a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a method for determining real time matched field responses.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a cost-effective method for determining real time matched field responses.","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a mobile method for determining real time matched field responses.","In order to attain the objects of the present invention, a method is provided for computing real time matched field responses. The method utilizes an algorithm and requires two data inputs. The first data input is measured acoustic data from a sonar set of hydrophones. The second data input is a replica data set against which the measured data is compared. Multiple replicas are compared to the measured data and the closest match is retained. The closest match of the replica is presumed to characterize the data in some important way (e.g., a source location).","More specifically, the output of a sensor of the towed array is translated to the frequency domain by applying a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) or a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to a set of contiguous time samples x (n, t=Tto T). A replica vector (d) is the frequency domain N\u00d71 vector representing the predicted or expected values at each sensor of the sensor array for a specific frequency.","The corresponding output of the method is an ambiguity surface. The ambiguity surface is a set of numbers ranging between zero and one with each number corresponding to a specific location in the ocean. The highest values on the ambiguity surface indicate the most likely position of an acoustic source.","A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals and symbols designate identical and corresponding parts through the view and wherein:","The method of the present invention for real time matched field processing primarily utilizes a matched field-processing algorithm and requires two data inputs.","The first data input is measured acoustic data from at least one sensor of a sonar array of hydrophones.

It is recommended that only those eigenrays that contribute a significant fraction of the pressure field be included in the processing.","The method of the present invention is now described for one time step and one frequency. The full output of the process given by Equation (12) requires that this process be repeated and averaged over time and frequency.","The process begins by computing the eigenrays between the source at the origin of a voxel and the destination at the acoustic center of the sonar array . Only the most significant P eigenrays are retained. The most significant eigenrays are chosen by computing the eigenrays that describe the acoustic signal at one spot in the ocean. This set of eigenrays is sorted by the energy of each eigenray, large to small. Add the energy of each eigenray in the set, strong to weak, until the sum of the energies represents ninety percent of the total.","A beam is then formed for each of the P eigenrays. That is, using an efficient range focused k\u2212\u03c9 beamforming algorithm, a beam is computed that is steered exactly at the conical angle coinciding with the arrival angle of the eigenray being considered. The result of this step is a P\u00d71 complex vector \u201cb\u201d representing the P beams formed along the P (possibly non-unique) conical arrival angles.","The individual beams are then attenuated and phase shifted as indicated by Equations (10) and (11). Let f be the","P\u00d71 vector resulting from this step (i.e., |eb|=|ff|). Note that the magnitude square of the complex summation of the P result, |eb|is the real time matched algorithm response for the center of the voxel.","For the subvoxel at location (\u03c1 \u03b8); compute P phase shifts \u2212exp [\u2212j\u03c9\u0394], where \u0394of each is defined by Equation (15) to form the P\u00d71 vector \u201cg\u201d. The real time matched algorithm output for the subvoxel is then |gf|\u2014note that the phase shifts have been conjugated to account for the complex conjugate transpose operator. Repeat for each subvoxel in the voxel.","A significant advantage of the described method of the present invention is the savings in computational cost. The computational advantage supports the feature of processing mobile horizontal towed array sonar data by using digital processing in real time. Specifically, the first savings arises from the feature that the acoustic model computes the eigenrays only between the center of the sonar array  and the center of the voxel. This is in contrast to computing the eigenrays between every source point (for example: the 400 subvoxels) and every destination point (for example: 50 individual hydrophones), a factor of 20,000 greater computation.","Second, the subvoxel response is computed using P (inputs) rather than N (the number of sensors). This reduces the cost of the computation by (N\/P), or approximately by a factor of five for many applications.","Third, the method of the present invention takes advantage of k\u2212\u03c9 beamforming, an N log N computation as compared to the Ncomputation which would otherwise be required.","Fourth, the range focused k\u2212\u03c9 beamforming supports efficient compensation for some shape distortion of the sonar arrays.","The foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description only. It is not intended to be exhaustive nor to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed; and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching.
