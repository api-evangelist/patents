{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention pertains to user interfaces for displaying information in connection with communication systems. More particularly, the invention pertains to user interfaces for dispatchers on public safety and similar communications systems.","Communication systems, including radio communication systems, can be quite complex. Such communication systems may include numerous communication channels with many receivers, transmitters, and transceivers all operating simultaneously on the communication network. In certain types of communication network, certain individuals, hereinafter operators, are responsible for monitoring and controlling communications and communicating with field personnel via the communication network to coordinate the efforts and locations of the field personnel.","A classic example of such an operator is a dispatcher of a public safety radio telecommunication network used by public safety officials, such as police, fire fighters, emergency medical technicians (EMTs), hospitals, etc. Other examples include military operations, dispatchers for transportation companies such as trucking companies, taxi companies, and other livery companies, shipping and courier companies such as Federal Express and the United States Postal Service, and utility companies such as telephone, cable television, electricity, and gas companies. These dispatchers are often responsible for coordinating the efforts of a large number of field personnel, such as police officers, fire fighters, taxi drivers, repair and installation crews, etc.","It is common for a single dispatcher to have these responsibilities with respect to a plurality of different talk groups. A talk group, as used herein, is a set of radio devices that can communicate with each other. For instance, police officers may comprise one talk group while fire fighters comprise a different talk group. Generally speaking, the police officers can communicate with the dispatcher and with each other using one set of communication channels and the firefighters can communicate with each other and the dispatcher using another set of channels, but the firefighters and the police officers in different talk groups cannot communicate with each other directly over the communication network.","A single dispatcher may oversee a very large number of different talk groups, possibly numbering in the hundreds. A talk group may be an individual police unit (e.g., SWAT, Narcotics, Canine), an individual police department, an individual EMT group, the members of an individual fire station, or combinations thereof (e.g., the New York City Fire Department and the New York City Police Department combined may be a talk group, while the New York City Police Department and the New York City Fire Department also are two other talk groups).","Commonly, a dispatcher sits at a dispatch station that may be in a control room shared with several other dispatchers. Each dispatcher station typically comprises a plurality of computer monitors and other user interface devices (such as computer mouses, foot switches, speakers, microphones, etc.).","Dispatchers frequently work under emergency conditions in which potentially life and death decisions must be made under severe time constraints.","A typical dispatcher station may have about three to six monitors between which the dispatcher must divide his or her attention. In the exemplary dispatcher station illustrated in , the dispatcher  has four monitors , , , , three of which (, , ) are under the control of and use by a computer aided dispatch (CAD) computer system  that displays to the dispatcher  important information, such as the locations and identities of various field personnel and equipment and the location and identity of various situations or incidents that require the attention of the field personnel. Typically, another monitor  is dedicated for use by a dispatch console . A dispatch console essentially is a specially programmed computer  (it may be a general purpose computer running special dispatch console software) that manages the communication assets at the dispatcher's disposal and displays information about the communication network on a monitor like monitor  that is dedicated to the dispatch console. Each dispatch station further typically has a plurality of speakers ,  on which the communications of the various talk groups are heard. Each speaker typically has the communications of a plurality of talk groups on it. The dispatcher normally also has a two-way communication headset  on which the dispatcher usually communicates with one particular talk group at any given time (or possibly a patch or simulselect group as will be discussed further below).","By way of a typical example, using a public safety dispatcher as an example, a call taker at a 911 center receives calls from the general population relating to emergencies and other public safety situations and types up an incident report with the critical information about the emergency, such as the nature and the location of the emergency, and sends it electronically to a dispatcher's CAD system. The dispatcher reviews the information and makes a determination based on his or her experience as to what field assets (personnel, equipment, etc.) should be assigned to the incident as a function of the size and nature of the incident, the available assets and their locations, other on-going incidents, and then uses the dispatch console to create, manipulate, and control talk groups and communicate with field personnel to attempt to address the incident.","A typical dispatch console software product, such as the Maestrosystem sold by Harris Corporation, provides hundreds upon hundreds of features. Often, the government entities and companies that purchase these systems set up the communication network and dispatch stations using only a small, custom-selected subset of all of the available features of the dispatch console. The individual dispatchers may also wish to customize their stations to their own liking. However, often, the companies or government entities do not permit further customization by the dispatchers for several reasons. First, having a uniform graphical user interface simplifies training of new dispatchers, since all dispatchers are trained on identical systems. Furthermore, dispatching commonly is a twenty-four hour a day operation such that dispatchers usually work in shifts and, therefore, each dispatch station is actually used by a plurality of different dispatchers every day. When dispatchers change shifts, particularly in the middle of one or more emergencies, there is no time to reconfigure the station and no time to learn the configuration use by the preceding dispatcher. Therefore, having a uniform graphical user interface for all dispatchers will facilitate shift switches without confusion.","Even where all of the dispatchers have the same graphical user interface, each individual dispatcher usually has his or her own individual subset of those features within the uniform graphical user interface that he or she tends to use most often.","Normally, a dispatcher's attention is primarily directed to the CAD system monitors , , , and not to the dispatch console monitor , which often is positioned off to the side of the CAD monitors. Nevertheless, the dispatch console has an extremely critical role in enabling the dispatcher to perform his or her duties.","The invention pertains to methods and apparatus for displaying information about a communication network efficiently in a compact display area that can occupy a small portion of a monitor. The methods and apparatus also provide efficient mechanisms for interfacing with the communication network and calling up additional information at will.","In one embodiment, a compact dispatch interface is provided that is highly configurable by the user. In another embodiment, a standard dispatch console graphical user interface remains unaffected on its dedicated monitor, and the compact dispatch interface is docked on another monitor, such as a monitor that is primarily dedicated to a computer aided dispatch system and the compact dispatch interface displays a subset of the information that is also available on the dedicated dispatch console monitor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","201","202","1","202","2","202","203","201","204","1","204","2","204","203"],"sup":"IP ","i":["n","m "]},"A third portion of the screen  displays a call history, which may include a list of all calls to the dispatcher in chronological order. Each entry in the list may include information such as the time of the call, an alphanumeric ID of the caller, and the talk group to which the caller belongs. A fourth portion  of the screen comprises a plurality of buttons -, -, . . . , - that may be operated to cause something to happen with respect to a one of the talk groups that has previously been selected in portion  (such as by left clicking on it). Some of the buttons may open up menus containing additional information and\/or buttons. The particular operation or additional information to which each button corresponds will depend, of course, on the particular system and the primary focus of its intended users, but may include things such as volume up, volume down, transmit (i.e., push to talk), etc. Finally, in this example, a fifth portion of the screen  is dedicated to an interface for handling individual calls from radios and persons outside of the normal framework of the pre-designated talk groups. This portion may include further buttons, lists, and information that affect communication with respect to such individual calls.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"300"},"The CDI  may be a software module running within the dispatch console software. Alternatively, it may be provided as a plug-in software module that plugs into the CAD software. However, in one embodiment, it is its own exclusive software application that runs independently and exclusive of the dispatch console software. In one embodiment, the exclusive CDI  software runs on the computer that is running the CAD (or other) system, but does not interface with the CAD software. The advantage of this particular embodiment is that the manufacturer of the CAD system essentially does not need to modify its CAD software in any way to integrate the CDI into it. Rather, the CAD system manufacturer merely needs to obtain a copy of the CDI software and load it onto its computer as a separate software application. The CDI software requires very few computer resources from the CAD system computers. Particularly, most of the processing power necessary to support and manage the communication system remains on the dispatch console computer. The CDI software interfaces with the dispatch console software via a simple application programming interface (API) or other common form of software interface to manage the communication resources. Depending on the features available through the CDI, to the extent the CDI  may need to interface with the CAD software, this also can be accomplished through the use of one or more appropriate APIs or the like. The only processes related to the CDI that run on the CAD system computer are the software for generating the actual CDI graphical user interface and one or more simple APIs that allow the CDI to communicate with the dispatch console software. The dispatch console software still performs all of the processor intensive operations, with the CDI  merely sending user instructions (based on user inputs through the CDI) to the dispatch console via an API and receiving information that it needs to display from the dispatch console via an API.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"In this specification, every portion of the display that has an operation that can be performed by activating it (e.g., by touching it (if a touch screen) or clicking on it using a mouse-controlled pointer) or discloses variable data (e.g., is not merely an aesthetic element) may be referred to herein as a button, UI control, or widget. It should be understood that these terms are being used broadly and in an exemplary manner and are intended to encompass any reasonable user operable graphical interface element, such as radio buttons, toggle buttons, push buttons, checkboxes, sliders, list boxes, dialog boxes, pop up menus, etc.","Referring now to the specific exemplary CDI  of , section  is a button that, when activated, opens a main menu (not shown). The main menu in this embodiment would not be accessed during normal dispatcher operations. The main menu contains buttons, etc. that provide basic CDI operations like logging in and out, exiting the CDI program, and an \u201cAbout\u201d dialog.","Section  is dedicated to functions pertaining to patch and simulselect operations. A patch is a temporary conjunction of two or more talk groups that are not normally permitted to communicate with each other directly through the communication network. Activating a patch group allows the dispatcher to communicate with all members of all of the talk groups in the patch group and also allows the individual members of those talk groups to communicate with each other directly. For instance, one talk group may be the city of Springfield police department and another talk group may be the Springfield fire department. Members of these two talk groups normally cannot communicate with each other over the communication network. However, in certain emergency situations, e.g., a car accident involving a flammable liquid on fire, it may be necessary to allow radios in these two talk groups to communicate with each other directly via the communication network.","Section  provides a plurality of buttons, in this example six toggle buttons -that can be operated to create, manipulate, and select patch groups and\/or simulselect groups. Patch groups may be created ahead of time or as situations arise and can be activated by, for instance, left clicking on any one of corresponding buttons -in section . Preferably, activating the corresponding patch group also causes the button to change appearance (e.g., color change, highlighted, shadow, etc.) so that the dispatcher can visually see if and which patch groups are activated. Multiple patch groups may be activated simultaneously.","Simulselect is similar to a patch in the sense that it is a conjoining of two or more talk groups that allows the dispatcher to speak with members of all of the groups in the simulselect group, but the individuals in the various separate talk groups remain unable to speak with each other. Of course, individuals in each talk group comprising the simulselect group still can speak with the other individuals in their same talk group. In exemplary CDI , five patch groups and one simulselect group are offered in section . However, the numbers are merely exemplary.","Referring now to , it shows the CDI  and a dialog window  that can be called up for display by a UI control input, i.e., a user operation such as right clicking anywhere within section . References to specific user operations in this specification (such as the aforementioned right clicking of a computer mouse device) are exemplary.","Window  is a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing various operations with respect to the patch and simulselect groups. The window  has two primary portions. The left portion  is an ordered list of all of the available talk groups at the disposal of the dispatcher. Each row in the list corresponds to a single talk group, e.g., . Each column provides a certain piece of information about a talk group. This exemplary list shows, for each talk group, in the columns from left to right, (1) the talk group number , (2) an alphanumeric name  of the talk group for easy reference, (3) if there is a pending emergency pertaining to that talk group , (4) whether the talk group is part of an existing patch or simulselect group (and, if so, which one) , (5) whether that talk group is currently muted at the dispatcher's station , (6) the volume at the dispatcher's station to which the talk group is set , (7) which speaker the talk group is on , and (8) whether the communications of that talk group are encrypted .","The buttons , , ,  at the bottom of the left-hand portion  are filter buttons. By left clicking on any of those buttons, the list of available talk groups in section  is filtered to include only the talk groups having certain properties. For instance, the \u201cAll\u201d button  causes all available talk groups to be shown in section  (i.e., no filter), the \u201cPolice\u201d button  causes only police talk groups to be shown, the \u201cFire\u201d button  causes only firefighter talk groups to be shown, and the \u201cEMT\u201d button  causes only Emergency Medical Technician talk groups to be shown. The \u201cDone\u201d button  closes the entire window .","The right hand section  of window  provides an interface through which the dispatcher may create, manipulate, activate, deactivate, and modify patch groups and simulselect groups. In this example, there are four tabbed pages , , ,  from which the dispatcher may select. When window  is called up by left clicking the mouse when the cursor is positioned over any of the buttons -in section  of CDI , it is called up with one of the tabbed pages , , ,  selected. Third tabbed page  is the patch activation\/deactivation page, which shows relevant information for each of the five patch buttons , . If the cursor is positioned on any of the patch buttons -that is already assigned to a defined patch group, then window  opens with the patch activation page  selected. If the button -is assigned and activated, the group list in position  of window  is pre-filtered to show only the talk groups that are part of that patch group.","Another tabbed page (page ) provides a GUI in which a dispatcher of other operator may define and create patch and simulselect groups. On the other hand, if the mouse is left clicked when the cursor is positioned over any of buttons -and that button is presently unassigned to a patch or simulselect group, then window  is called up with the patch\/simulselect group definition page  pre-selected.","Relevant information for each patch group button -is displayed in one of rows -in page . Column  displays the identity of the patch group button. Column  comprises drop down menus each containing a list of all patch group definitions, with the patch group definition to which the corresponding button is presently assigned shown in the main window. The names of the patch group definitions in this example are descriptive of when the dispatcher is likely to wish to use them (i.e., activate them). In this manner, the dispatcher can easily identify a patch group that should be activated in certain situations (like when the dispatcher takes a \u201cbreak\u201d and another dispatcher must cover for him or her for a brief period) without having to remember the actual talk groups in the patch. However, alternatively, the names could be descriptive of the talk groups comprising the patch group (like \u201cFire, Police, and EMT\u201d). The dispatcher can change the patch button assignments using the drop down menus in column  in the conventional fashion of use of such drop down menus.","The last two columns ,  are ON and OFF buttons, respectively, for activating the corresponding patch group. However, in at least one embodiment, the dispatcher also may activate and deactivate the patch and simulselect groups directly from the CDI  without calling up window  by simply double left clicking on the appropriate button -","The Simulselect activation tabbed page  (not shown, except for its tab) is similar to page  except that it pertains to simulselect groups rather than patch groups, and is automatically selected if window  is called up when the mouse is left clicked while the cursor is over button F.","In accordance with another feature, illustrated in , the dispatcher may call up a simpler pop-up window  by a different UI control input, e.g., clicking a third computer mouse button while the cursor is positioned over any of buttons -. This menu, for instance, may show a brief list  of the three most commonly used patch (or simulselect) groups and permit the dispatcher to assign the particular button to one of those patch groups by, e.g., left clicking the mouse while the cursor is positioned over the name of the particular patch group. In this example, in order to increase user friendliness, the pop up window shows the name of the button (P in this case)  at the top of the pop up menu. It also permits the dispatcher to select a \u201cMore\u201d option  in the menu to be presented with a full patch dialog box, rather than the abbreviated patch pop-up window . Finally, the dispatcher may select the \u201ccancel\u201d option  to close the pop up window.","Returning to , section  of the CDI  is the select module and is dedicated to one particular talk, patch, or simulselect group (hereinafter talk group) selected by the dispatcher. Typically, the dispatcher will assign a talk group to this module corresponding to the particular incident on which the dispatcher is most focused. Presumably, it is the same group that the dispatcher has assigned to his or her head set. This section  shows the more significant information about the selected talk group and offers easy access to a number of operations. First, a text box identifies the talk group. Text box identifies the individual who is currently transmitting (if no one is presently transmitting, the box may be blank or, alternately, may show the last individual in that talk group to transmit). Text box shows the volume to which the dispatcher has set the corresponding talk group. Particularly, typical dispatch consoles allow the dispatcher to electronically set the relative volume of each individual talk group. This is independent of the dispatcher's ability to control the overall volume of each speaker and his or her head set. More specifically, a dispatcher commonly will turn up the relative volume of the talk group or groups on which he is most focused. Knowledge of the volume to which each talk group is set also is extremely helpful in allowing the dispatcher to audibly determine from which talk group a particular transmission is coming and to focus on one or more particular talk groups. In one embodiment, the dispatcher can change the volume by performing some reasonable action within box , such as double clicking to call up a volume slider or the like.","The Rx and Tx buttons  and  visually show the dispatcher when he is receiving a transmission on the select talk group or transmitting on the select talk group, respectively. These two buttons will light up or otherwise change appearance to indicate those conditions. Further, above the text boxes -, area  bears the label \u201cSelect\u201d to indicate that this is the select module. However, this area  also provides space for one or more alert buttons indicative of certain specific notable situations, when appropriate. For instance, the radios carried by field personnel in public safety networks often have an emergency button that the field personnel can press to indicate an emergent situation. If that button has been pressed by any of the field personnel in the selected talk group, then an Emergency button  appears in area . Also, if the selected talk group uses an encrypted channel, a PVT button  may appear in area . If the dispatcher has temporarily muted that selected talk group, a Mute button  will appear in area . Finally, if the selected group is a patch group or simulselect group, a button  will appear in area  indicating such.","Finally, select module  includes a TX button  that is essentially a press-to-talk (PTT) button that the dispatcher presses when he or she wishes to transmit on the select talk group (although dispatchers often also have a footswitch that causes them to broadcast on the selected talk group when they depress the footswitch).","Again, the dispatcher may call up a small pop up window  such as illustrated in  by a particular UI control input, such as left clicking the computer mouse when the cursor is positioned over any of text boxes -. In this exemplary embodiment, this opens a pop up window  showing a list  of five possible talk groups to assign to the select module . The subset of the available talk groups shown in the list may be selected based on any reasonable criteria, such as the talk groups most recently assigned to the select module , the talk groups most often assigned to the select module, or a predetermined list created by the dispatcher or network administrator at an earlier time. Finally, like the patch group pop up window , it also permits the dispatcher to select a \u201cMore\u201d option  in the menu to be presented with a full select talk group dialog box, rather than the abbreviated pop-up window . Finally, the pop-up window  also includes a \u201ccancel\u201d option  to close the pop up window .","The next section is a general status section  that provides general information relevant to the overall communication system. It includes a simulated VU meter  that indicates the transmission level when the dispatcher is transmitting. It also includes space for at least three messages about the communication system. These messages can be any relevant messages. Illustrated are three messages, including a mute message  that indicates that the dispatcher has muted all talk groups other than the select talk group (as identified in the select module ). Preferably, the mute message  is a button that the dispatcher can operate to unmute or mute the other talk groups when desired. Next is a message button  that appears when the dispatch console software has generated one or more messages for the dispatcher. These generally are messages related to the communication system as a whole. Preferably, the dispatcher may left click on button  to call up a window that displays the message(s). Finally, an Emergency button  appears when there is at least one pending emergency situation. The Emergency button preferably also includes a counter indicating the number of current emergencies. In one embodiment, the counter indicates the number of emergencies pending that have not been reset. Specifically, in many public safety radio communication systems, when an emergency is first indicated, such as by a field officer activating the emergency button on his or her radio, it causes several audio and\/or visual alarms to activate in order to get the dispatcher's attention. For each such emergency, the counter counts up one unit. Once the dispatcher is aware of an emergency, the dispatcher usually \u201cresets\u201d the emergency, which causes the other visual and\/or audible alarms to cease. This reset operation does not cancel the emergency or mean that the emergency is over, but merely that the dispatcher has tuned off the emergency alarms. When the dispatcher resets each emergency, the counter goes down by one. However, the Emergency alert  remains as long as at least one emergency is pending. Only when an emergency situation has been resolved does the dispatcher cancel the emergency (through an interface not represented in this particular exemplary CDI, but, for instance, an operation on the primary dispatch console interface displayed on monitor ). When there are no further emergencies pending, the emergency button is removed from general status section . In an alternate embodiment, one or more of the alerts , ,  may be permanently assigned to the area in section  below the virtual VU meter . For instance, the emergency button  may be permanently docked where shown and merely change appearance when there are no more pending emergencies (e.g., turns from red to gray).","Next, unselect module  is somewhat similar in nature to the select module  except that it is used to show information about talk groups other than the talk group currently assigned to the Select module . For instance, it also includes three text boxes , , . Boxes , , and show similar information to text boxes , , and of the Select module . Specifically, they show the talk group, the individual within that talk group, and the volume of that talk group, respectively, corresponding to the most recent transmission in any talk group other than the selected talk group. In one embodiment, the text boxes -show information only during actual transmissions (and when there are no active transmissions from field personnel, the text boxes , , and are blank). However, in other embodiment, the text boxes may continuously show information for the most recent transmission even after the transmission ended).","Unselect module  also includes a counter  (in this example, in the form of an electronic UV meter) indicating the number of simultaneous transmissions (up to 4 in this example) that are being received (on all talk groups other than the talk group in select module ). Particularly, this can be important information to have readily available since the transmissions on the unselected talk groups are being heard simultaneously via one or more speakers at the dispatch station and, sometimes, it may be difficult to discern how many transmissions are being heard simultaneously. There also is space within area  for additional buttons like the aforementioned emergency and PVT buttons.","In accordance with one useful feature of the CDI , left clicking anywhere within the Unselect section  will call up a call history pop up window , such as the one illustrated in . This window provides a list  of the four most recent calls (preferably, including the one originally shown in the window sections , , ). However, it shows a little more information with respect to each call. For instance, for each of the four most recent calls, the pop up window  may show the caller's radio ID , the caller's name (or other alphanumeric designation) , the caller's group number , the callers group name , and the time of the call . It also happens to show the word \u201cGroup\u201d  next to each entry for clarity. Finally, like the patch group pop up window  and the select group pop up window , this pop up window also permits the dispatcher to select a \u201cMore\u201d option  to be presented with a full call history dialog box, rather than the abbreviated pop-up window . finally, a \u201cCancel\u201d option  allows the operator to close the pop up window .","Unlike the select module , the unselect module  does not have a PTT button for permitting the dispatcher to transmit on that talk group. This is because each dispatcher normally may transmit on only one talk group at any time. If the dispatcher wishes to talk to one of the talk groups in the unselect module, he or she may make that talk group the selected talk group in select module  or right click to bring up a dialog that allows TX on any group in order to talk on that talk group.","Next, a group module  comprises only two buttons  and . This module is used to provide information about one specific talk group and may, for instance, be used to constantly monitor a particular talk group that is infrequently used, but, when used, usually carries extremely important communications such that the dispatcher would want to be immediately aware of it when a transmission is received on that talk group. This module has only two buttons. First, button  is a label indicating the particular group that has been assigned to the group module. Button  also is a PTT button so that the dispatcher may left click this button to transmit on that talk group without the need to make that talk group the selected talk group in select module . A second button  alternately shows the volume to which that talk group has been set or the identity of the individual transmitting on that talk group. Specifically, when there are no transmissions on that talk group, it shows the volume and, when there is a transmission on that talk group, it shows the identity of the person transmitting on that talk group. In some embodiments, more than one group module  may be provided in the CDI to permit tracking of multiple talk groups in this manner.","Finally, a speaker module  contains a plurality of buttons (in this example, two buttons , ). Each button is dedicated to one of the multiple speakers typically located in a dispatch station. As previously noted, a dispatcher station usually has several speakers with each speaker typically outputting the audio from a plurality of talk groups simultaneously. In one embodiment, each of these buttons ,  has a first appearance when there is no audio on the corresponding speaker and will have a second appearance when there is audio in that speaker. For instance, when there is no audio, the button  or  shows the identity of the speaker to which it corresponds (the speakers usually are assigned a number).","When there is audio, the button changes colors and possibly shows the talk group(s) that are the source of the audio. In other embodiments, it might show the individual generating the transmission, the volume of the corresponding talk group, or any other potentially relevant information.","As previously mentioned and as described above for most of the buttons in exemplary CDI , any or all of the buttons in the CDI  may be designed to cause an action to occur and\/or to call up an additional graphical user interface when clicked. One such feature was discussed above in connection with  in connection with clicking anywhere within the patch section  of CDI .  illustrates a few more of such examples. For instance, left clicking on the Message button  in General Status section  of CDI  will bring up a window  showing all of the pending messages . Window  can be made to disappear by clicking on the Done button  appearing in that window.","Furthermore, left clicking on the Emergency button  in General Status section  of CDI  will bring up an emergency dialog box . The emergency dialog box  shows relevant information about pending emergencies. In this particular example, it gives the identity of the field officer declaring the emergency , his or her talk group , and the time at which the emergency was declared . If the dispatcher wishes to see information about the emergencies, he or she may click on the More button , which will further expand the window to show additional information about the emergency. Again, when the dispatcher is finished with the window, clicking the Done button  will cause the window to disappear.","With reference to  and in accordance with another aspect of the invention, right clicking in various places in CDI  will call up a call history window , wherein the call history list  is pre-sorted or pre-filtered in a specific manner as a function of where the cursor was positioned within the CDI  when the mouse was right clicked. For instance, if the mouse is right clicked when the cursor is position in the select module , a call history window comes up showing all calls in the selected talk group (in reverse chronological order). On the other hand, if the mouse is right clicked while the cursor is over the emergency button , the call history window shows only those calls in talk groups that have an active emergency. If the mouse is right clicked while the cursor is in the unselect module , the call history shows all calls (in reverse chronological order) for all channels other than the selected channel. If the mouse is right clicked while the cursor is in the group module , the call history list shows the call history in the talk group that is assigned to the group module . As a final example, if the mouse is right clicked while the cursor is over either of buttons  or  in the speaker module , the call history window shows only the call history in talk groups assigned to that particular speaker. Once the call history window  is open, however, the dispatcher can re-sort and re-filter the list as desired.","The call history window  provides additional features, operations, and\/or UI controls in it. For instance, the call history list portion  of the window includes the call list and shows relevant information about each call, such as the unit number  and an alias (alphanumeric name) of the caller . The former is used by the system to route calls. The latter is a human interface convenience. It also shows the corresponding talk group  of which the caller is a member, the identity of the callee , the time , and the type of communication . Along the bottom of the left-hand portion of the window are several buttons. Clicking on the update button  will cause the call history list to be updated. The next four buttons are all predetermined filter buttons. For instance, clicking on the SEL button  will cause only the call history in the talk group currently in the Select module  to be shown (which is the manner in which the call history list  would already be pre-filtered if the dispatcher had initially called up the call history window  by right clicking while the cursor was positioned in the Select module ). Clicking on the SUPV button  filters out all calls except those in the supervisory talk groups. Likewise, clicking on the POLICE button  filters out all calls from radios that are not in one of the police talk groups. Finally, clicking on the Queue button  initiates a filtering algorithm that goes through the full call history list and filters out all but the most recent call from each individual. This Queue feature can be very useful insofar as, it is often the case that speaking with the last caller in a talk group is all that is needed to get caught up with respect to an incident. Also, it is often the case that a single caller calls many times in a row until he or she gets a response from the dispatcher.","Referring now to the right hand portion  of the call history window , this portion comprises a series of buttons for performing operations and\/or providing information about a particular call selected from within the call history list window . For instance, the dispatcher can left click on one of the calls in the call history window to select it (whereupon it may be highlighted or otherwise visually altered to indicate that it is the selected call). Thereafter, all of the UI controls in the right hand portion and\/or displayed information  of the window  will correspond to actions or information pertaining to that call from the call history window only. For instance, section  is a module very similar to the select module  in the CDI  and shows essentially the same information (the talk group, the individual caller and volume of that talk group). Clicking on the PTT button  permits the dispatcher to talk to that talk group. Clicking on the Delete button  will remove the selected call from the call history list . Portion  of the call history window  comprises playback buttons such as play , stop , and fast play . A playback progress bar  also is provided showing where within the call the playback currently is positioned. Finally, a Done button  closes the call history window .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","300","700","325","350","370","380"]},"As before, the particular talk groups appearing in the group list may be prefiltered depending on where the cursor was positioned when the dispatcher called up the group information window . For instance, if the dispatcher activated the group information window  while the cursor was in the Select module , then only the information for the selected talk group appears. If, on the other hand, the dispatcher activated the group information window while the cursor was in the Unselect module , then all the information of all talk groups appears. If activated when the cursor was positioned over button  in Speaker module , then only the talk groups assigned to speaker  are listed in the group information window, etc.","The group information window  can be arranged similarly to the call history window. Particularly, the left hand side of the window  provides a list  of all the talk groups on the communication system and relevant information about each, such as the talk group number , a descriptive name of the group , whether there is an existing pending emergency in that talk group , the identity of any patch group or simulselect group  of which the talk group is a member, whether the talk group is currently muted  at the dispatch station, the current volume for that talk group , the speaker to which that talk group is assigned , and whether the talk group is using an encrypted channel . Again, across the bottom of the left hand portion are four filter buttons for filtering the group lists. These include All button  (list all talk groups), Police button , Fire button , and EMT button . There also is a DONE button  to close the window when the dispatcher is finished using it.","Also as previously described in connection with the call history window  and , the dispatcher may click on one of the talk groups in the left hand side of the window to highlight it, and then any operations performed or information shown in the right hand portion  of the window  will be performed on or correspond to that selected talk group. The right hand portion  of the display may be populated with any information and\/or UI controls deemed likely to be particularly useful or relevant. A text box  that displays the same type of information as the Select module  of CDI  appears near the top. Merely as some other examples, there is a volume control slider  on the bottom that can be manipulated to set the volume for the selected talk group. There also is a Select button , which makes the group selected from the group list  the select group in Select module  of the CDI . Several speaker buttons , ,  can be operated to assign the selected talk group to a particular speaker. The Emergency button  can be pressed to generate an emergency in the selected talk group. The PVT button  can be pressed to control the communication system to encrypt communications on the selected talk group.","As previously mentioned, the embodiments described herein are merely exemplary. Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment, the CDI graphical user interface is highly configurable by the purchaser and\/or individual operators. For instance, the software for the CDI  may include a software module that provides a GUI within which the user may drag and drop UI controls, etc. into a blank or partially populated CDI template.","In another embodiment, the CDI software can be designed to interface with the CAD system software so as to allow the CAD system software to custom configure CDIs for specific situations. For instance, it is a common feature of many CAD systems for the system to generate a recommendation as to what resources should be committed to an incident that was input to the system (e.g., the incident report generated by a 911 call taker). For instance, the CAD system may receive an incident report of a car fire at grid location 24-59 and recommend that the dispatcher commit (1) a police car and its two occupants that is in the vicinity of the care fire, (2) a hook and ladder unit from the nearest fire station, and (3) a city tow truck to the incident. The dispatcher normally has the choice to accept the recommendation or ignore the recommendation and choose resources on his or her own. In any event, if the dispatcher chooses to accept the recommendation, the CDI program can be configured to interface with the CAD system to receive the incident report and then automatically build a CDI for that incident. For example, that CDI may comprise one button (or an entire module) for each of the personnel committed to the incident. The button (or module) may show some relevant information about the individual and also act as a PTT button for communicating with the individual. The CDI software may also automatically create a patch group comprising the relevant field personnel (and\/or their talk groups) and include in the generated CDI a patch button just like the any of patch buttons -assigned to that patch.","In order to enhance intuitive learning of the system's operation, all user operations of a certain type (e.g., a right mouse click) may be designed so as to correspond to computer operations of a similar theme. For instance, a right mouse click always calls up a new window or a left mouse click always selects something.","The invention has been described hereinabove as a software module or package. The software may be delivered to a user or customer on a computer readable medium from which it can be loaded onto a computer or other digital processing device into executable form for use. Alternately, it may be delivered in executable form and already embodied within a computing device. In addition, it should be understood that software is merely an example of an embodiment of the invention and that any or all of the above discussed features, steps, and processes may be implemented with software, firmware, hardware or combinations thereof. This includes, but is not limited to, computers, microprocessors, processors, digital signal processors, state machines, integrated circuits, FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), combinational logic, analog circuits, digital circuits, program software, and any combinations thereof.","Having thus described a few particular embodiments of the invention, various alterations, modifications, and improvements will readily occur to those skilled in the art.
