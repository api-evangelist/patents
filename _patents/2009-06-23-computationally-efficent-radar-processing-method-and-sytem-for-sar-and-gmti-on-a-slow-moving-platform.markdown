title: Computationally efficent radar processing method and sytem for SAR and GMTI on a slow moving platform
abstract: A method and system for processing radar data from a movable platform comprising passing a radar signal through a low noise amplifier; down converting the signal to a lower frequency; filtering out harmonics; sampling using A/D converter at or above Nyquist frequency; determining a scene center; performing a two stage averaging scheme of the received signals with a variable window function based upon the velocity, acceleration of the platform and scene center; coherently averaging N pulses to create an average pulse; performing an inverse Fourier transform; compensating to the scene center by multiplying by a complex exponential based upon GPS and inertial navigational system; summing the average pulses using a low pass filter; repeating the determination of an average pulse for a time period that is less than the Nyquist sample time interval to generate second average pulses; and performing a 2D inverse Fourier transform to obtain SAR image.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","REFERENCE TO COLOR DRAWINGS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS","APPENDIX A","APPENDIX B MATLAB WINDOW FUNCTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the United States Government. The claimed invention was made as a result of activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement between the U.S. Government and the University of Florida.","The patent or application file contains at least one drawing executed in color. Copies of this patent or patent application publication with color drawing(s) will be provided by the Office upon request and payment of the necessary fee.","The present invention relates in general to a process and apparatus for generating imagery, and in particular to generating imagery using electromagnetic waves.","Current synthetic aperture radar (SAR) algorithms are implemented on platforms that are moving at a constant velocity and at a high speed, and require computationally intensive signal processing. Small platforms generally will not have constant velocity and cannot support computationally intensive signal processing. There exists a need for an algorithm which overcomes the problems associated with generating a SAR image or a GMTI image on a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), robotic vehicle and\/or manned vehicle. Previously, the problem encountered difficulties due to algorithm complexity, memory limitations, and DSP (computations per second) limitations. Small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can provide soldiers at the platoon level with a \u201chover and stare\u201d capability. Small unmanned air vehicle can be propelled using ducted fan technology and controlled using micro-electrical sensor technology. This can also provide robotic vehicles with a way of detecting and avoiding dismounts (personnel).","Aerial image radar and computer subsystems can gather and display broad and detailed information, as events occur; including position and tracking information on vehicles and personnel. The information is relayed in near-real time to ground stations via the secure links and to other ground nodes beyond line-of-sight via ultra high frequency satellite communications. The communications\/datalink and operations and control subsystems comprise operator workstations displaying computer-processed data in graphic and tabular format on video screens; in order to perform surveillance, intelligence, communications and maintenance functions. Generally speaking, radar can operate in wide area surveillance, ground moving target indicator (GMTI), fixed target indicator (FTI) target classification, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) modes, Ground moving target indicator (GMTI) is used to detect moving targets by essentially subtracting out images of stationary objects. Moving target are obtained using Doppler shift theory in GMTI modes. GMTI uses the frequency shift of the returned signal continuous surveillance from a long range. On an aircraft, the antenna can be tilted to either side in order to develop a 120 degree field of view covering hundreds of miles. The GMTI radar will detect any moving objects of sufficient size and density, such as vehicles; but will not pick up stationary objects. The system SAR mode is used produce images of stationary objects. Objects with many surface angles (for example, a the bed of a truck) will give a much better radar signature (referred to a specular returns).","In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the SAR processing algorithm assumes that the platform is moving at a slow speed and has a constant acceleration along the flight path. The algorithm combines pulse averaging with and without motion compensations. Using the invention, one can average before motion compensation or one can motion compensate, and then average. The technique is adaptable for processing non-uniform samples. One concept of one embodiment of the invention comprises using a variable linear window function and variable sample size which are determined by the estimated velocity and acceleration of the platform to average the radar samples in time. Generally the platforms are slow moving. Data is segmented into different windows based upon the velocity and acceleration of the platform. The window function is constructed so that the phase center of the averaged data is uniformly sampled. The matlab code demonstrates how to generate the window function, as shown in Appendix 2.","These and other aspects of the embodiments of the invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following descriptions, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention and numerous specific details thereof, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments of the invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the embodiments of the invention include all such modifications.","The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown. However, this invention should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the dimensions of objects and regions may be exaggerated for clarity. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. As used herein the term \u201cand\/or\u201d includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to limit the full scope of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises\u201d and\/or \u201ccomprising,\u201d when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and\/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and\/or groups thereof.","It will be understood that when an element such as an object, layer, region or substrate is referred to as being \u201con\u201d or extending \u201conto\u201d another element, it can be directly on or extend directly onto the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d or extending \u201cdirectly onto\u201d another element, there are no intervening elements present. It will also be understood that when an element is referred to as being \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201ccoupled\u201d to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly connected\u201d or \u201cdirectly coupled\u201d to another element, there are no intervening elements present.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections should not be limited by these terms. For example, when referring first and second photons in a photon pair, these terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.","Furthermore, relative terms, such as \u201clower\u201d or \u201cbottom\u201d and \u201cupper\u201d or \u201ctop,\u201d may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to other elements as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in the Figures is turned over, elements described as being on the \u201clower\u201d side of other elements would then be oriented on \u201cupper\u201d sides of the other elements. The exemplary term \u201clower\u201d, can therefore, encompass both an orientation of \u201clower\u201d and \u201cupper,\u201d depending of the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d other elements would then be oriented \u201cabove\u201d the other elements. The exemplary terms \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below. Furthermore, the term \u201couter\u201d may be used to refer to a surface and\/or layer that is farthest away from a substrate.","Embodiments of the present invention are described herein with reference to cross-section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments of the present invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and\/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region or object illustrated as a rectangular will, typically, have tapered, rounded or curved features. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.","Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.","It will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art that references to a structure or feature that is disposed \u201cadjacent\u201d another feature may have portions that overlap or underlie the adjacent feature.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The simulation software modeled all the major factors that affect the performance the radar.

First, the images from the two antennas are aligned by skipping data collected with the left antenna until the effective phase centers of the right and left antenna are approximately equal. Next, SAR images are generated using the algorithms described in either  or ; then they are calibrated and subtracted from each other.","The SAR images were calibrated using a technique based upon signal subspace decomposition (SSD) (). The technique assumes that the SAR images are related to each other through a linear transfer function. The simplest realization of this technique is a one-element finite impulse response (FIR) filter. To implement this filter, a gain and a phase correction factor between the two images was calculated using the ratio of the average powers and the amplitude weighted phase difference between the two images. A more complicated realization of this technique is to assume that the subimages from each antenna are related by a 2-dimensional FIR filter. This technique was implemented by minimizing the least squares error using the left matrix divide operation in MATLAB. Results will be shown for both techniques. Calibration based upon signal sub-space decomposition effectively cancels most of the clutter, however, some residue will still be present. To reduce the residue of large clutter discretes, a normalization procedure was developed. To normalize the image, the SAR image difference was divided by the square root of the minimum amplitude value for each pixel location in the two images plus a constant value representing the noise as shown below.\n\nNorm=Min(|SAR1|,|SAR2|)+Noise\u2003\u2003(1)\n","The performance of the GMTI algorithms based upon SAR processing techniques was simulated in MATLAB ().

The SAR images were generated using either the block diagrams in  or  and the SAR image calibration was performed using signal subspace decomposition using either a 1-element or 3\u00d73-element FIR filter. The algorithm was tested using six moving targets described in table 5. One target was moving at 10 m\/s, three targets were moving at 1 m\/s, and two targets were moving at 0.5 m\/s. All the moving targets had an RCS of \u22126 dBsm and were located at a range of approximately 1 km. The angular location of the targets was specified relative to the azimuth boresight angle of the right antenna, which was 45 degrees. The height of all these targets was fixed at zero meters. Table 5 shows the velocity and location of each target.","Table 5. Moving targets for GMTI simulation with RCS=\u22126 dBsm.","The clutter was modeled using either three or one scattering center for each range bin.

A linear frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar with homodyne demodulation and an interferometric capability in azimuth is proposed to meet the above requirements. Table 1 shows the major design specifications for the radar. The frequency response of signals output by the radar is between 125 KHz and 2.5 MHz. These signals are sampled at 10 MSPS with a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC).","The simulation software modeled all the major factors that affect the performance the proposed UAV radar. The return signal from targets was modeled using the standard radar equation. The radar model included the effects of range, component noise, transmit power, antenna, and various noise sources. The antenna was modeled as either a Gaussian or isotropic radiator. The noise in the simulation included the leakage signal, phase noise, thermal noise, and crystal vibration effects. The electromagnetic scattering from targets and clutter were modeled as isotropic point scatterers. Multipath was not modeled, but for the geometries of interest, it is not anticipated to have a significant effect on the radar performance. The point scatter model included 3-d location, 3-d velocity vector, and a fixed amplitude and phase. The clutter was modeled statistically with point scatter models. The amplitude of the scatterers were derived from \u03c3values were specified as a function of angle. The platform was modeled using 3-velocity vector, 3-d acceleration vector, and 3-d vibration vector. The simulation parameters were input by editing a Matlab m file. Appendix A shows an example of the parameters in an mfile for a SAR simulation. The details of these factors are described below.","There were several sources of noise included in the simulation. The thermal noise was assumed to be white and Gaussian. Its power was determined by the IF bandwidth, radar noise figure, and receiver loss. This model assumed that the data was sampled at Nyquist frequency. The effect of vibration noise on the crystal oscillator was modeled as an additive term to the phase of the oscillator with an arbitrary number of harmonics. In the simulation, the fundamental frequency was approximately 133 Hz (8000 rpm\/60 with 4 additional harmonics included in the model. The power level of each frequency was \u221226, \u221244, \u221248, \u221251, \u221265 dB below the power of the fundamental frequency of the oscillator. The signal associated with each frequency was added to the phase of the transmitted signal. The vibration of the outer structure of the UAV and the antennas attached to it were also simulated using a harmonic model. The same frequencies used to model the crystal oscillator were used to model the vibration of the UAV and the antennas attached to it. The value of the g's used in the simulation for each frequency were 10, 3, 1, 0.5, and 0 m\/s2.","The phase noise model allowed arbitrary power levels for arbitrary frequency ranges. For SAR data collected on a UAV, this can require several seconds of data. This requirement is difficult to simulate using conventional techniques with a single filter.","For this simulation, the phase noise was generated by filtering white noise with two infinite impulse response (HR) filters, interpolating, then combining the results. This process simplified the filter design problem by breaking it up into two pieces. Both filters were generated by solving Yule Walker equations for a 10order system.  shows an example of the desired and actual response for these filters. The output of the filter shown in was computed once, and then interpolated over a CPI of data. The output of the filter shown in was recomputed for every PRI. The results for the two data streams were added together to simulate the phase noise. This software can accept arbitrary inputs, but the user must check that the designed filters are good approximations to the specifications.","The clutter was modeled using point scatterers with a statistical distribution. The value of \u03c3varied as a function of depression angle as shown in . Due to memory and processing time limitations, the number of scatterers was limited. This is not ideal, but for most applications, the impact should be minimal. The amplitude and position of the scattering centers were calculated at each range bin associated with a chirped linear frequency modulated (LFM) waveform. To limit processing time, the number of scatterers per range bin was set one value if the range bins were of high interest and to another value if the range bins were of low interest. For all the simulations shown, three scatterers were generated per range bin for clutter between 900-1100 m, and one scatterer was generated for range bins between 100-900 m and 1100-1300 m.  shows an example of a histogram of the amplitude of the scattering centers and  shows an example of the spatial distribution of the scattering centers. The amplitude of the scattering centers were randomly selected with the constraint that the expected value of the power of the scattering centers corresponded to average power returned for \u03c3multiplied by the area of range swath for the angle of angle of interest. The scattering centers were spread even in angle over the beam width of the antenna, and then randomly perturbed in angle and range.","The beam pattern of the antenna was modeled as either omnidirectional or Gaussian. The shape of the Gaussian antenna was controlled by a pointing angle which corresponds to the mean and the beamwidth which corresponds to the standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution. The effect of pitch, yaw, and roll were not modeled. Small variations in these parameters probably do not have a significant impact on the radar performance since a typical value for the antenna beams widths are 70\u00d7100 degrees.","The motion of the UAV was modeled as a constant acceleration in x, y and z directions. The amplitude of the acceleration was 0.1 m\/sfor range\/Doppler processing and 0.05 m\/sfor SAR processing. The position of the targets could be input in either Cartesian or spherical coordinate systems. In both coordinate systems, they were described relative to scene center. The motion of the targets was modeled as 3-d vectors with a constant velocity.","The path lengths in the radar were assumed to be configured so that the leakage signal and the demodulation signal used for down conversion had approximately equal time delays. For all the simulation runs, the path length difference between these signals was set at 1 centimeter and the amplitude of the leakage signal was attenuated by 30 dB.","Range\/Doppler simulation. The simulation software was developed to evaluate the radar performance for the UAV operating in a range\/Doppler mode. For range\/Doppler processing, range and radial velocity can be determined from the peaks in the range\/Doppler matrix. Angle can be determined by comparing the phase of the peak pixels in range\/Doppler matrices processed in the right and left receive antennas.  shows a block diagram of the proposed signal processing to generate a range\/Doppler matrix.","The simulation software was used to evaluate the radar performance for the UAV operating in a hovering mode. Table 4 shows the values of the major parameters used in the simulation.

The clutter was simulated using a \u03c3varying from \u22125 to \u221215 dBsm\/sm. The simulation included the phase noise modeled using the curves shown in . The effects of vibration on the crystal oscillator were also included as previously described. The output of the simulation is shown in . No clutter subtract is performed in the processing. The SNR for the slow moving targets is approximately 15 dB.

Targets 2 and 4 were easily observed, and targets 5 and 6 could be seen, but would be detected with a high false alarm rate. These results indicate that dismount-like targets could be detected at a range on 1 km using the proposed radar and signal processing.","Simulation software was developed for testing the performance for a UAV platform. The simulation software modeled all the major factors that affect the performance the proposed UAV radar. The radar model included the effects of range, component noise, transmit power, antenna, and various noise sources. The antenna was modeled as either a Gaussian or isotropic radiator. The noise in the simulation included the leakage signal, phase noise, thermal noise, and crystal vibration effects. The electromagnetic scattering from targets and clutter were modeled as isotropic point scatterers. Point scatterers model included 3-d location, 3-d velocity vector, and a fixed amplitude and phase. The clutter was modeled statistically with point scatter models. The amplitude of the scatterers were derived from \u03c3values were specified as a function of angle. The UAV platform was modeled using 3-d velocity vector, 3-d acceleration vector, and 3-d vibration vector.","The performance of Range\/Doppler processing, SAR, and SAR-based GMTI algorithms developed for the proposed radar were simulated and examples of the results were presented. The GMTI algorithms were based upon generating SAR images in each of the two receive antennas, and then coherently subtracting them. With this type of processing, stationary targets cancel, while the slowly moving targets do not.","The performance of the algorithms, particular the SAR-based GMTI algorithms, need further evaluation. More realistic simulations and measured data with better ground truths are needed to estimate their performance.","SIGNAL PROCESSING\u2014SAR imagery is generated by coherently processing the sampled radar data.
