title: Telepresence communications system and method
abstract: The sharing an image of a local participant in a group with at least one other participant in that group commences by establishing, for that local participant, orientation information indicative of an orientation of the communication channel local participant relative to a display screen and a video camera. The local participant sends his or her image of the local participant along with the orientation information to at least one other participant. The orientation information enables display of the image of the local participant with a common orientation recognized by the at least one other participant.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit, under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7365 of International Application PCT\/US2011\/06036, filed Dec. 2, 2011, which was published in accordance with PCT Article 21(2) on Feb. 7, 2013 in English and which claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 61\/513,794 filed Aug. 1, 2011.","This invention relates to system and method for sharing content among a distributed audience.","In the early days of radio and television, a small number of nationwide networks broadcast entertainment for contemporaneous audience consumption, thereby providing a common cultural experience shared by large segments of the population. Now, many more sources of content exist and many content subscribers have the ability to record content for time-shifted viewing or for viewing-on-demand. The ability of individual content subscribers to select content from an ever-increasing array of content has significantly diluted the cultural experience of large audiences viewing the same content simultaneously because of desire of content subscribers to consume the same content as others in their social network at substantially the same time.","Various techniques exist to facilitate the simultaneous sharing of content. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,653,545 by Redmann et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 7,518,051 by Redmann both teach a distributed musical performance system that includes a distributed transport control. The distributed musical performance system disclosed in these patents enable substantial synchronization of the execution of commands to play, pause, rewind, fast-forward, and stop media playback at each location, regardless of network latency.","Other efforts to share content include the integration by the cable television network CNN of a video feed of President Obama's inauguration with a parallel Facebook-based feed so participants could see comments made by friends in real-time. Unfortunately, not all participants enjoyed a synchronized video feed, so some comments appeared long before or long after viewing of the actual event.","One company, frog design inc now provides an application for the iPhone called \u201ctvChatter\u201d that uses Twitter as a background service to collect and redistribute contemporaneous commentary for live broadcasts of new television episodes. Unfortunately, content subscribers in an earlier time zone can enter comments about portions of the content net yet viewed by content subscribers in a later time, leading to complaints of \u201cspoiling\u201d the outcome of television programs, which can significantly detract from sharing comments on elimination-based reality shows or suspenseful dramas.","Other efforts to share content include the ability of certain gaming consoles, most notably the Microsoft Xbox 360, to implement a Netflix movie-streaming application that offers the option to \u201cWatch with Party.\u201d After a Netflix and Xbox Live account holder logs in, the account holder's Xbox Live avatar becomes the participant's on-screen persona. The participant can select \u201cStart Party\u201d and invite other, Xbox Live and Netflix subscribers currently on-line to join the party. The account holder that initiated the \u201cparty\u201d can select movies from the regular Netflix catalog by browsing posters in the hierarchical arrangement (e.g., by theme, by genre, by rating, by similarity to other movies, etc.). Invited party members can select movies, which appear as suggestions. After selection of a suggested movie, the application performs a bandwidth test for video quality. Assuming sufficient bandwidth exists, the application launches, causing an on-screen image of a theatrical venue to appear, and the party members' avatars then enter and take seats. The movie begins playing on the screen within the simulated theatrical venue. The participants can have their corresponding avatars \u201cemote\u201d by selecting one of eight or so choices, in response to which the participant's avatar will make arm gesture and mime catcalls or cheers. A transport control allows the party members to pause, rewind, fast-forward, and resume playback across all the party member platforms.","Another example of content sharing includes video conferencing. Many organizations now maintain special facilities for video conferencing that offer one or more video screens and video cameras. Using such a facility, a panel of participants can \u201cmeet\u201d with one or more participants at one or more remote sites. Such video conferencing facilities allow the sharing of presentation materials, for example Microsoft PowerPoint\u00ae slides. Further, such video conferencing facilities can include special video cameras for capturing images of physical documents to share among participants. Several vendors, including Cisco Systems, sell cameras, monitors, lighting systems, and video networking equipment to establish a video conferencing facility having the ability to exchange video and audio among other video conferencing facilities.","Cisco has also published a telepresence interoperability protocol (TIP) to improve the ability of video conferencing facilities to interoperate with each other even when using equipment from different manufacturers. The Internet Engineering Task Force now has under review a more general but competing standard \u201cControlling Multiple Streams for Telepresence\u201d (CLUE).","Despite the various efforts to share content, difficulties persist. Thus, a need exists for a system, which affords simultaneous sharing of content across a distributed audience.","Briefly in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present principles, a method for sharing an image of a local participant in a group with at least one other participant in that group commences by establishing, for that local participant, orientation information indicative of an orientation of the local participant relative to a display screen and a video camera. The local participant sends his or her image of the local participant along with the orientation information to at least one other participant. The orientation information enables display of the image of the local participant with a common orientation recognized by the at least one other participant.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","130","110","120","110","120","113","123","114","124","115","125","110","112","122","120"]},"The site  has a telepresence monitor , which displays images captured by a remote telepresence camera  situated at the site , whereas a telepresence monitor  resides at the site  to display images captured by a remote telepresence camera  at the site . Throughout this discussion, the \u201cfacing\u201d of a telepresence monitor (e.g., telepresence monitors  and ) and the corresponding telepresence camera associated with each monitor (e.g., the telepresence monitors  and ) relates to the relative orientation considered with respect to the corresponding shared content monitor (e.g., the shared content monitors  and ). In some instances, the terms \u201cleft\u201d or \u201cright\u201d serve to summarily define the orientation. In other words, the telepresence monitor\/camera pair, when viewed by a local participant using both the shared content monitor and the telepresence monitor\/camera, will appear to the participant's left or right as the local participant faces the shared content monitor. A microphone (not shown) serves to capture audio from the participant . Typically, the microphone resides in or near the camera  or the monitor . One or more audio speakers (not shown), located in or near monitor , serve to playout audio from remote participant . Similarly, a microphone (not shown) serves to capture audio from the participant . Typically, the microphone resides in or near the camera  or monitor . One or more audio speakers (not shown), located in or near monitor , serve to playout audio from remote participant . In an alternative embodiment, the microphones can reside anywhere within their respective sites  and  and the speakers (not shown) can reside other than near the corresponding monitors  and . Further, one or both of the sites could include one or more speakers in a surround array (not shown) driven by a communications device, for example at site , the communications device is illustratively depicted by a Set-Top- Box (STB) , which could carry the audio from the microphone at the remote site .","In one exemplary embodiment, the source for shared content could comprise content  mutually remote from sites  and  which both sites  and  obtain from either of a broadcast server  or a video-on-demand (VOD) server , both accessible through communication channel . In another exemplary embodiment, the shared content could comprise content  locally stored by virtue of being previously downloaded or recorded by the set-top box (STB)  at the site , using a well-know personal video recorder (PVR) system. Similarly, the shared content could originate from a DVD player . In either case, the STB  would accept the shared content for streaming to a remote STB . At the same time, the STB  could play out such content locally on a shared content monitor . Upon receipt of shared content received by STB , the STB would playout the shared content monitor  with or without buffering.","If desired, all or part of the total delay caused by transport latency to, and the buffering by, the STB  can serve to define a locally imposed delay adopted by the STB  before playout begins on the shared content monitor . This delay from the remote participant creates a minimum temporal disparity between the content viewed by the distributed participants  and . In still another example, the shared content can reside locally at each site. For example, each of the STBs  and  can previously download or record the same shared content as local content  and , respectively. Alternatively, each of DVD players  and  (or such other physical media players) can possess the same content. Under such circumstances, the STBs  and  will implement a distributed transport process, (such as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,653,545 by Redmann et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 7,518,051 by Redmann) whereby the corresponding STBs  and  accept the same play, pause, forward, and rewind commands from the remote controls  and , respectively, for distribution to the corresponding remote STBs  and , respectively for substantially simultaneous execution. This allows the playout of shared content at each site to remain substantially synchronized, regardless of the transport control operations entered by the participants  and . A similar distribution of transport controls can occur with respect to the broadcast server  or the VOD server , whereby the stream control commands issued from each of STBs  and  get shared among themselves before issuance to the stream controllers in the STBs responsible for managing the independent remote content streams from the servers  and .","In accordance with the present principles, the arrangement of the monitors , , , and , and the cameras  and  occurs in such a way as to provide a psychological impression of a common space. Since the camera  faces the participant , when the participant  looks in the direction  (toward the telepresence monitor ), the image of the participant  displayed on the telepresence monitor  appears to look toward the participant . Likewise, when the participant  looks in the direction  (toward the camera ), the image of the participant  displayed on telepresence monitor  appears to look toward the participant .","When the participant  looks in the direction  (toward shared content monitor ), the image of the participant  on the telepresence monitor  appears to look toward the shared content monitor , since camera  captures a partial profile of the participant  to provide the illusion of looking toward the shared content monitor . Likewise, when the participant  looks in the direction  (toward the shared content monitor ), the partial profile captured by camera  will undergo display on the telepresence monitor  so that the image of participant  appears to look toward the shared content monitor .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","110","120","100","113","114","112","118","113","119","116","127","113","123","124","227","127","130","116","217","117","130","126"]},"When the participant  looks in the direction  (towards the screen  or the camera ), the participant  will perceive that the participant  looks directly at him or her.

In this configuration, a direct relay of the image from the camera  will appear to show on telepresence monitor  that remote participant  faces the wrong way, that is, away from the shared content monitor . The STB at either or both ends of the connection over communication channel  will correct this anomaly using one of several techniques. For example, a sending STB (e.g., the STB ) can notify each receiving STB (e.g., the STB ), that its associated telepresence camera  resides to the right of its associated participant. Upon receipt of the images from the camera , the STB  can decide how to display that image on the telepresence monitor . Since the telepresence monitor  associated with the receiving STB  lies on the same side (right) of its associated participant , the STB  would need to flip the image received from camera  and STB  left-to-right so that the image of the remote participant  appears on the telepresence monitor  to face the shared content monitor . This approach affords the advantage that, for any number of connections to remote STBs, a sending STB need only send one image format.","Using a different approach, the receiving STB (e.g., the STB ) could notify each sending STB (e.g., the STB ) that its associated telepresence camera  lies to the right of its associated participant . Before sending an image from the camera  to the STB , the STB  can decide whether to flip the image left-to-right so that the image sent to the STB  has the correct orientation for display on telepresence monitor . This approach has the advantage that all inbound video signals have the correct orientation and can readily undergo display on the telepresence monitor. However, a horizontal flip of a video signal does not entail a terribly heavy computational process, and incurs a downside risk that the sending STB  might need to create two different streams, for oppositely arranged sites  and .","A third approach obviates the need to share arrangement notifications: Each sending STB (e.g., the STB ) will format the image from its corresponding telepresence camera , that is, the STB will flip the image or not, so that the image emulates a predetermined configuration, for example, a camera to the right of corresponding local participant  (which in the case of site , happens to be the actual case). All receiving STBs (e.g., the STB  and the STB ) assume this predetermined configuration, and act accordingly for the video signals they receive. In the case of site , where since the actual monitor  lies to the right of local participant , STB  will need to flip all received telepresence video signals (regardless of their source). However, in the case of the site , where the actual monitor  lies to the left of the local participant , the STB  will never need to flip any received telepresence video.","However, under this third approach, in order to send telepresence video to other sites  and , the STB  will need to horizontally flip the video from the telepresence camera . Given that a horizontal flip does not require heavy computation, the STBs  and  residing in the sites ,  configured with the telepresence monitors  and,  to the right of local participants  and , respectively, would not incur an onerous burden by the requirement to flip all inbound telepresence video. Further, this approach for achieving a configuration change remains a local matter: Assuming an initial error in the setting representing the local configuration of the STB and a later correction, the setting change and altered behaviors remain strictly local. This remains true even though the correction results in video coming from properly configured remote sites now showing correctly, and the outbound video sent to those remote sites also now appearing correctly.","The end result of these three methods remain the same and appear in , where a distributed situation  combines the substantially simultaneous local situations , ,  in each of sites , , and , respectively.

These inbound telepresence streams pass from communication interface  to a decoder . The decoder  distinguishes between each of the inbound streams  and  and processes these streams as telepresence image data  and , respectively, written to the inbound video buffers A and B, all respectively. Any remote site configuration metadata  recognized by decoder  undergoes storage in the settings portion  for use in the operation of the video controllers , . The inbound video controller  will access at least a portion of video data from the video buffers A and B for writing to the video output buffer . The inbound video controller  performs the access of video buffers A, B and the writing to video output buffer  in accordance with configuration data from the settings portion , including which, if any of the inbound images need horizontal flipping (which in this example is neither). The STB  will output a video signal  from video output buffer  for display on the telepresence screen as the image .","In accordance with the information in the settings portion  within the STB , the image  captured by telepresence camera  requires a horizontal flip before being sent to remote STBs , . However, both of inbound video streams  and  possess the correct orientation and require no horizontal flipping. The result, as shown for the site  in situation  in , indicates that the faces of the remote participants  and  in the image  on telepresence screen  seem to look toward the shared screen .","The foregoing describes a technique for sharing content among a distributed audience to enable display of the image of a local participant with a common orientation recognized by at least one remote participant."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A","FIG. 1"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
