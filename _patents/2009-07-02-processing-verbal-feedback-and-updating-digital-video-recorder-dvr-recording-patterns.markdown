title: Processing verbal feedback and updating digital video recorder (DVR) recording patterns
abstract: A method, a system and a computer program product for using speech/voice recognition technology to update digital video recorder (DVR) program recording patterns, based on program viewer/listener feedback. A speech controlled pattern modification (SCPM) utility utilizes a DVR recording sub-system integrated with speech processing functionality to compare control phrases with phrases uttered by a viewer. If a control phrase matches a phrase uttered by the viewer, the SCPM utility modifies the DVR recording patterns, according to a set of pre-programmed governing rules. For example, the SCPM utility may avoid modifying the recording patterns for programs within a list of “favorite” programs but may modify the recording patterns for programs excluded from the list. The SCPM utility determines priority of the uttered phrases by identifying users and retrieving a preset priority level of the identified users. The priority level is then used to control changes to the recording patterns.

Technical Field","The present invention generally relates to speech processing technology and in particular to controlling device functionality by using speech processing technology.","2. Description of the Related Art","Digital Video Recorders (such as those from Television Input Video Output (\u201cTIVO\u201d) Inc.) are devices that typically record broadcasted television programs on a hard-disk based on a pre-configured schedule. This enables a television viewer to watch the recorded television programs at a later time or save them for repeated viewings. Typically, DVR devices provide a menu-driven graphical user interface (GUI) displayed on the television screen where the user can use a remote control device to select channels and television programs and set up the DVR to record the selected television programs when the programs are being broadcasted. Users can typically search for programs by genre, by name of the program, by days\/times the program is broadcast, by keyword or by the names of the actors appearing in the program. Once the viewer has set up the channels and programs to record, the \u201crecording pattern\u201d is saved in the DVR hard-disk. The DVR automatically records the programs when these programs are broadcasted by the television stations.","Currently, there is no way to modify the currently stored DVR recording patterns based on user feedback. DVRs provide no efficient way\/feature to modify an already stored recording pattern. The only way to change the previously stored recording pattern on the DVR is to navigate through the GUI and manually set up the programs to record or delete programs to record, which is a cumbersome process that is generally avoided by users. As a result the DVR hard drive may often get filled up with programs that the user has no desire to watch.","While watching a television program, a viewer may typically say phrases to fellow viewers such as \u201cI love this program\u201d, \u201cThis is a bad TV show\u201d or \u201cThis is a boring movie\u201d. Once the program ends, a viewer's level of appreciation for a program represented by words\/phrases may typically be forgotten and lost, and the DVR recording patterns remains the same unless the user takes manual steps to modify the pattern.","Audience Measurement Systems provide a practical application of verbal feedback. Audience Measurement Systems measure how many people are in an audience, usually in relation to radio listeners and television viewers. Audience Measurement helps broadcasters determine how many people are watching or listening to a certain television or radio program. This allows broadcasters to gauge the \u201cpopularity\u201d of particular television or radio programs (also known as the \u201crating\u201d). This information is very useful for advertisers who wish to advertise products in a way that exposes the advertisements to the maximum number of viewers\/listeners.","Conventional methods used for audience measurement only provide broadcasters with an indication of how many people were watching\/listening to a particular program. These conventional methods do not reflect whether viewers actually liked or disliked a show\/radio program. Many times when a multi-episodic program is in the beginning stages of the program's run, many viewers tune into the early episodes, leading to high ratings. However, if the viewers do not like the program, a relatively lower number of viewers will watch (or listen to) the program in the later weeks, which triggers a big drop in ratings. Knowing the \u201clike\u201d rating of a show\/program may be useful for predicting the future ratings of these programs. Current systems are unable to provide useful feedback on the \u201clike\u201d rating of a program that may allow a broadcaster to predict a potential ratings drop and take action accordingly. Currently, there is no automatic way to modify the recording patterns based on verbal feedback.","Disclosed are a method, a system and a computer program product for using speech\/voice recognition technology to update digital video recorder (DVR) program recording patterns, based on program viewer\/listener feedback. A speech controlled pattern modification (SCPM) utility utilizes a DVR recording sub-system integrated with speech processing functionality to compare control phrases with phrases uttered by a viewer. If a control phrase matches a phrase uttered by the viewer, the SCPM utility modifies the DVR recording patterns, according to a set of pre-programmed governing rules. For example, the SCPM utility may avoid modifying the recording patterns for programs within a list of \u201cfavorite\u201d programs but may modify the recording patterns for programs excluded from the list. The SCPM utility determines priority of the uttered phrases by identifying users and retrieving a preset priority level of the identified users. The priority level is then used to control changes to the recording patterns.","The above as well as additional objectives, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed written description.","The illustrative embodiments provide a method, a system and a computer program product for using speech\/voice recognition technology to update digital video recorder (DVR) program recording patterns, based on program viewer\/listener feedback.

The priority level is then used to control changes to the recording patterns.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical, architectural, programmatic, mechanical, electrical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and equivalents thereof.","Within the descriptions of the figures, similar elements are provided similar names and reference numerals as those of the previous figure(s). Where a later figure utilizes the element in a different context or with different functionality, the element is provided a different leading numeral representative of the figure number. The specific numerals assigned to the elements are provided solely to aid in the description and not meant to imply any limitations (structural or functional or otherwise) on the described embodiment.","It is understood that the use of specific component, device and\/or parameter names (such as those of the executing utility\/logic described herein) are for example only and not meant to imply any limitations on the invention. The invention may thus be implemented with different nomenclature\/terminology utilized to describe the components\/devices\/parameters herein, without limitation. Each term utilized herein is to be given its broadest interpretation given the context in which that terms is utilized.","With reference now to the figures, and beginning with , there is depicted a block diagram representation of an example data processing system (DPS), as utilized within one embodiment. DPS may be a computer, a portable device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), a smart phone, and\/or other types of electronic devices that may generally be considered processing devices. DPS  also may represent a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) device. As illustrated, DPS\/DVR  comprises at least one processor or central processing unit (CPU)  connected to system memory  via system interconnect\/bus . Database  is also connected to system bus . DPS  also comprises storage , within\/from which data\/instructions\/code may also be stored\/retrieved. In addition, DVR recorder and controller subsystem  which comprises Speech Recognition System  is connected to system bus . Also connected to system bus  is input\/output (I\/O) controller , which provides connectivity and control for input devices, of which remote control transceiver\/pointing device (or mouse)  and keyboard  are illustrated. I\/O controller  also provides connectivity and control for output devices, of which display  is illustrated. Additionally, a multimedia drive  (e.g., compact disk read\/write (CDRW) or digital video disk (DVD) drive) and USB (universal serial bus) port  are illustrated, coupled to I\/O controller . Multimedia drive  and USB port  enable insertion of a removable storage device (e.g., optical disk or \u201cthumb\u201d drive) on which data\/instructions\/code may be stored and\/or from which data\/instructions\/code may be retrieved.","DPS  is also illustrated with a network interface device (NID) , by which DPS  may connect to one or more access\/external networks , of which the Internet is provided as one example. NID  may be configured to operate via wired or wireless connection to an access point of the network. Connection to the external network  may be established with one or more servers , which may also provide data\/instructions\/code for execution on DPS , in one embodiment.","In addition to the above described hardware components of DPS , various features of the invention are completed\/supported via software (or firmware) code or logic stored within memory  or other storage (e.g., storage ) and executed by CPU . Thus, for example, illustrated within memory  are a number of software\/firmware\/logic components, including operating system (OS)  (e.g., Microsoft Windows\u00ae, a trademark of Microsoft Corp, or GNU\u00ae\/Linux\u00ae, registered trademarks of the Free Software Foundation and The Linux Mark Institute), DVR applications , Recording Patterns  and speech controlled pattern modification (SCPM) utility  (which executes on CPU  to provide SCPM logic).","During implementation of one or more embodiments of the invention, speech recognition functionality may be provided by a voice recognition application (e.g. IBM (International Business Machines) ViaVoice\u00ae, Dragon Naturally Speaking\u00ae, a product of Nuance Communications, Inc., Microsoft Windows\u00ae Speech Recognition, a product of Microsoft Corp), which may be separate from or associated with SCPM utility . In actual implementation, SCPM utility  may be combined with DVR applications  and Recording Patterns  to provide a single executable component, collectively providing the various functions of each individual software component when the corresponding portion of the combined code is executed by the CPU . For simplicity, SCPM utility  is illustrated and described as a stand alone or separate software\/firmware component, which provides specific functions, as described below.","CPU  executes SCPM utility  as well as OS , which supports the user interface features of SCPM utility . In the described embodiment, SCPM utility  generates\/provides several graphical user interfaces (GUI) to enable user interaction with, or manipulation of, the functional features of SCPM utility . Certain functions are supported and\/or implemented by processing logic when SCPM utility is executed by processor . These functions may further utilize device hardware to complete the implementation of the functions. For simplicity of the description, the collective body of code that enables these various functions is referred to herein as SCPM utility . Among the software code\/instructions\/logic provided by SCPM utility , and which are specific to the invention, are: (a) code\/logic for capturing and processing spoken\/audio phrases\/words to provide feedback to a content broadcaster; (b) code\/logic for comparing pre-recorded (feedback) control phrases with spoken words\/phrases uttered by a viewer while the viewer is watching\/monitoring a television\/radio program; and (c) code\/logic for dynamically modifying DVR program recording patterns, according to a set of governing rules and filters. According to the illustrative embodiment, when CPU  executes SCPM utility , DPS  initiates a series of functional processes that enable the above functional features as well as additional features\/functionality. These features\/functionalities are described in greater detail below within the description of .","Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the hardware components and basic configuration depicted in  may vary. The illustrative components within DPS  are not intended to be exhaustive, but rather are representative to highlight essential components that are utilized to implement the present invention. For example, other devices\/components may be used in addition to or in place of the hardware depicted. The depicted example is not meant to imply architectural or other limitations with respect to the presently described embodiments and\/or the general invention. The data processing system depicted in  may be, for example, an IBM eServer pSeries system, a product of International Business Machines Corporation in Armonk, N.Y., running the Advanced Interactive Executive (AIX) operating system or LINUX operating system.","In one embodiment, the speech monitoring and other functionality described herein are provided\/supported within a digital video recorder (DVR) device. The DVR would then include a user-setup guide to enable the monitoring and other functionality provided by the invention to be selectively turned on or off. A prompt to turn off monitoring may be provided at each start up of the DVR or during initial set-up and subsequent global set-up of the device. Alternatively, the option to turn the monitoring on or off may be provided as a menu item in the global menu of the DVR. In one implementation, a microphone symbol is provided on-screen (with television or computer viewing) whenever the monitoring functionality is \u201con\u201d so that persons within the environment are aware that monitoring is ongoing. Additionally, in one implementation, a positive reward feature may be associated with the functionality being turned on, such that the device user or device owner is encouraged to turn the monitoring feature on. For example, when the functionality is turned on a DVR device that doubles as a cable\/satellite receiver, marketing research may be conducted utilizing the device. A network-connected server then detects the receipt of data from the specific DVR device and responds by forwarding an electronic coupon\/credit (generated on behalf of the market research facility\/entity) to the DVR device to enable purchasing of a pay per view program from the cable or satellite provider.","With reference now to , a DVR system with a recording sub-system is illustrated, according to one embodiment. DVR system  comprises DVR recording sub-system . DVR recording sub-system  further comprises Speech Recognition System (SRS) , which receives speech input  from an audio sensor\/receiver device such as a microphone. DVR recording sub-system  also comprises DVR recording application  which communicates with SRS . DVR recording application  receives input video signals\/programs via cable or antenna input . DVR recording application  transfers output video signals\/programs  to a video display device\/system, for example, a television. DVR system  includes DVR drive . DVR drive  comprises recorded programs  and recording patterns and schedule data . DVR system  is connected to a data network, for example, the Internet or Local Area Network (LAN) .","SCPM utility  utilizes Speech\/Voice recognition technology within the DVR recording system, to capture and process words and phrases that may trigger updates of DVR program recording patterns. SCPM utility  may access a network or the Internet via the network interface capabilities of DVR System . SCPM utility , thus, enables a viewer to access the DVR recording functionality on a local DVR device or a remote device via a web-based interface. In one embodiment, SCPM utility  utilizes a local DVR recording program to update program recording patterns. In another embodiment, SCPM utility  uses an external device\/program that uses the internet-based Application Programming Interface (API) provided by the DVR System  to modify the recording pattern stored in DVR System . The way in which SCPM utility  automatically modifies a recording pattern is described below.","In order to respect the privacy rights of the audience within the sensory receiving environment , during implementation of one or more of the various embodiments described herein, when voice recognition  is engaged, one or more privacy statements are displayed (and\/or otherwise outputted within\/at the environment) within and\/or near the sensory receiving environment . The privacy statement informs each individual that one or more statements output (i.e. spoken, expressed via song, laughter, etc) within sensory receiving environment  are being monitored. The privacy statement further notifies an individual entering sensory receiving environment  that although the statements are monitored, the statements are not recorded. The monitored statements are analyzed by a computer system which outputs information associated with sensory receiving environment . The information obtained within sensory receiving environment  is unassociated with the individual(s) providing the output.","SCPM utility  activates features of the embodiment when a user\/viewer begins viewing television. SCPM utility  uses SRS  to detect (key) phrases spoken by the viewer. SCPM utility  compares these key phrases with a set of pre-recorded control phrases. The pre-recording of control phrases may be performed as a one-time\/occasional activity, i.e., a configuration\/setup step that may be initiated anytime the user wishes to add and\/or modify any control word\/phrase. With each recorded control phrase, SCPM utility  enables the user to potentially have the option to set other parameters including a level of priority\/weight of the feedback if the phrase is uttered by a particular person. SCPM utility  may enable the configuration\/setup via a web based interface to the recording and voice capturing system. The control phrases are stored in the database.","If SCPM utility  finds a control phrase that matches an uttered phrase, SCPM utility  activates the recording pattern modification functionality of DVR sub-system  to automatically modify the recording pattern, according to a set of governing rules. In one embodiment, the DVR recording pattern modification functionality may be invoked directly via a voice\/speech command (e.g., \u201cdelete future recordings\u201d). Again, SCPM utility  uses a set of governing rules to dictate how the recording pattern is dynamically modified.","SCPM utility  utilizes a set of filtering rules to control changes to the recording patterns. The filtering rules may allow a recording pattern to be modified automatically, or avoid modifying the recording pattern. SCPM utility  may use a particular filter to search through a set of stored \u201cfavorite programs\u201d to determine whether a program being viewed is exempt from specific changes to the recording pattern based on the program's inclusion in the list of \u201cfavorite programs\u201d. If the television program being watched matches a program in the set, then the system could potentially modify only those programs that are not in the set of favorite programs and avoid modifying programs that are in the set.","SCPM utility  may use another filter to detect key phrases spoken by the viewer, using SRS . For example, if the viewer says the phrase\/sentence, \u201cThis is a boring program\u201d, or the keyword(s) \u201c(is) boring\u201d then SRS  may compare this phrase\/keyword against pre-recorded phrases\/keywords. If a match is found, SCPM utility  may initiate automatic modification of recorded patterns.","SCPM utility  may utilize another filter to establish a priority level criterion based on the identity of the viewer. For example, if SCPM utility  (uses SRS  and) identifies the viewer as the owner of DVR System , SCPM utility  may initiate\/perform actions based on a (high) preference\/priority associated with phrases spoken by the owner. For example, only the owner's views may be considered in order to make recording changes. Conversely, SCPM utility  may assign a lower preference\/priority to a guest or \u201cunrecognized\u201d speaker (whose words are captured by DVR sub-system ) who may be watching the same program in the owner's home. While watching one television program, the viewer in a conversation with a fellow viewer, may say phrases like \u201cI like XYZ movie\u201d. SCPM utility  may capture this type of remark to be used \u201creal-time\u201d for feedback recording purposes when that particular movie is running.","SCPM utility  may activate a delayed feedback feature that uses a historical count of \u201cmatches\u201d of viewer phrases with control phrases before actually changing the recording pattern. SCPM utility  is able to track positive feedback phrases and negative feedback phrases over a period of time before actually making the decision to modify the recording pattern. For example, SCPM utility  may be prompted by a threshold negative count to change the recording patterns to avoid future recordings of a particular program. The recording pattern may not be updated directly by the system based on a viewer's choice or device configuration. Instead, SCPM utility  may trigger alerts and guide the viewer to actions pertaining to the recording pattern modifications. SCPM utility  may provide the viewer with a configurable option to select auto modifications by DVR System , or to provide system alerts to give the viewer decision making support.","SCPM utility  may utilize the enhanced capabilities of DVR sub-system  integrated with SRS  to automatically interface with other systems (e.g., Movie review sites), that may allow a viewer to share his (i.e., the viewer's) feedback and reviews with other persons. Further, SCPM utility  may utilize a reminder system that maintains\/provides recognition of remote control keypad interactions during conversations. For instance, if the user\/viewer presses a recognized code, for example, \u201c1111\u201d, SCPM utility  may allow DVR system  to automatically delete or record the program in the future.","SCPM utility  uses speech recognition technology to initiate the capture of speech and utterances by a viewer\/user that is watching a television\/video program connected to a display device that is either (a) connected to DVR device  or (b) integrated with DVR device . SCPM utility  provides a configuration\/setup facility within DVR recording sub-system  to enable a user to pre-record control words and phrases that SCPM utility  uses to create a set of governing rules and\/or a set of filters. SCPM utility  uses speech recognition technology to capture real-time user feedback during the show\/radio program and provide that feedback to a broadcaster. The useful features and functions of SCPM utility  are demonstrated in the examples described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304","306","300","303","305","307","308","309","310"]},"In the example of , a program named \u201cA\u201d is broadcasted on a TV channel. Initially, the program has a good rating, based on the number of viewers watching the show. As time passes, the popularity of program \u201cA\u201d decreases since the number of viewers watching the show decreases. On the other hand, a program named \u201cB\u201d is broadcasted on a TV channel and initially has a moderate rating based on the number of viewers watching the show. As time passes, the popularity of program \u201cB\u201d increases since the number of viewers watching the show increases.","SCPM utility  has the ability to collect user\/audience feedback during the runtime of program \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d, by using Speech recognition technology. A broadcaster may use the feedback to help adjust (i.e., increase or maintain) the rating for a particular program. The feedback recording functionality is able to detect frequently used key phrases like \u201cThis is boring\u201d, \u201cI hate this show\u201d, \u201cI love this program\u201d, \u201cGreat show\u201d, etc., together with the program which is currently running on TV or radio.","Referring again to Table , a further example illustrating the process of obtaining dynamic user feedback for a program in real-time is described. In the example, two (2) persons, \u201cAl\u201d and \u201cBob\u201d, are watching a particular TV program. SCPM utility  uses DVR sub-system  to capture phrases spoken in the room. During the show, Al utters a number of feedback phrases\/keywords including \u201cI hate this program\u201d\/\u201chate\u201d, as indicated within first row entry . Bob says \u201cI can't miss this one\u201d\/\u201ccan't miss\u201d, as indicated within fourth row entry . SCPM utility  may check the device configurations for control phrases\/keywords via an interface with the web database. SCPM utility  saves the captured phrases as feedback since SCPM utility  identifies matching control feedback phrases\/keywords in database .","In this instance, the positive feedback from Bob is higher then the negative feedback from Al and the program recording continues. In particular, First row entry  indicates that Al's negative feedback has a (negative) weight of two (2) points. The corresponding program counter value \u201cPcount_A\u201d for program \u201cA\u201d is adjusted to Pcount_A\u22122, as illustrated in first row entry  of \u201cAction: Program\/Movie Count Changes\u201d column . Fourth row entry  indicates that Bob's positive feedback has a (positive) weight of three (3) points. The corresponding program counter value \u201cPcount_A\u201d for program \u201cA\u201d is adjusted to Pcount_A+3, as illustrated in fourth row entry  of \u201cAction: Program\/Movie Count Changes\u201d column . However, if both users say they hate the program, while watching the program, SCPM utility  may allow DVR system  to remove the recording of the program. The update to the recording pattern may again happen through the web interface to enable access to system features at various locations. SCMP utility  may provide the viewer with a configurable option to select auto modifications to the recording pattern by the system or to have system alerts to give him decision making support.","SCPM utility  saves the captured phrases as feedback since SCPM utility  identifies a matching control feedback phrase during a check of device\/control phrase configurations in database . At the conclusion of the program, SCPM utility  may update both positive and negative feedback as one feedback (from Al) expresses \u201clike\u201d while the other (from Bob) expresses \u201cdislike\u201d. SCPM utility  may forward the feedback to the broadcaster via the Internet. SCPM utility  may provide feedback in a format that indicates the count of positive and negative feedback received. The broadcaster obtains information about the program's like\/dislike rating and may take action accordingly.","Table  further indicates that different weights\/preferences\/priorities are attached to identical phrases spoken by each viewer. For example, if Bob also says \u201cI hate this program\u201d, as indicated within second row entry  of Table , SCPM utility  increments the negative feedback by one point. When Al utters \u201cI hate this program\u201d, as indicated within first row entry  of Table , SCPM utility  increments the negative feedback by two points. In some cases, feedback for a particular movie may be desired and obtained using a particular feedback control phrase. This feedback may be desired\/collected only for a particular period of time for a particular movie and may be repeatedly collected for an extended period of time for a TV show. The user may have different phrases to identify\/distinguish feedback for movies and feedback for shows. In particular, sixth row entry  of Table  indicates that if either Al or Bob utters \u201cI love . . . movie\u201d, while watching a particular movie, SCPM utility  matches this phrase and updates the feedback tally\/count for the particular movie. In addition, SCPM utility  increments the positive count of the particular movie by one (1) point. The corresponding movie counter value \u201cMcount_C\u201d for movie \u201cC\u201d is adjusted to Mcount_C+1, as illustrated in sixth row entry  of \u201cAction: Program\/Movie Count Changes\u201d column .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","113","113","103","201","113","404","103","404","402","200","130"]},"While a viewer watches a particular program on a television connected to DVR System , SCPM utility  initiates capture of the phrases spoken in the room. SCPM utility  utilizes DVR sub-system  (e.g., SRS  and Customer Feedback application ) to capture the spoken phrases. SCPM utility  searches database  for a match for the captured phrase with a feedback control phrase. If a match is found, SCPM utility  saves the captured phrase, in database , as feedback for the program. After the current program ends, SCPM utility  updates the feedback and forwards feedback data  to the broadcaster via the Internet. SCPM utility  may provide feedback data  in a format that indicates the amount of positive and negative feedback received. Thus, SCPM utility  is capable of transferring the viewer feedback data to the broadcaster as an organized count of specific program feedback.","SCPM utility  provides an accurate measurement of live\/instantaneous viewer\/listener feedback for a program\/show in progress to assist with program planning\/scheduling. For example, if many viewers responds to the show with negative phrases like \u201cThis is boring\u201d, \u201cI hate this show\u201d, SCPM utility  provides an indication that even though the program is being watched\/listened to, the show most likely may not be as popular in upcoming weeks. On the other hand, if the viewer\/listener is uttering positive phrases like \u201cI love this program\u201d, \u201cGreat show\u201d, the show may most likely maintain high popularity in the future weeks.

If, at block , SCPM utility  determines that the captured phrase matches a control phrase, then SCPM utility  modifies a recording pattern on a local DVR system or stored on a remotely located DVR system which is accessible via web API. SCPM utility  modifies the recording pattern according to governing rules and filters, as shown at block . In one embodiment, the governing rules or filters determine whether the recording patterns are modified in real-time or based on delayed feedback via an aggregated count. In another embodiment, the governing rules and filters, conditions any changes to recording patterns upon the priority level assigned to the speaker of the feedback. If, at block , SCPM utility  determines that the captured phrase has no match in the database, the process returns to block . The process ends at block .","In the flow charts above, one or more of the methods are embodied in a computer readable medium containing computer readable code such that a series of steps are performed when the computer readable code is executed (by a processing unit) on a computing device. In some implementations, certain processes of the methods are combined, performed simultaneously or in a different order, or perhaps omitted, without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus, while the method processes are described and illustrated in a particular sequence, use of a specific sequence of processes is not meant to imply any limitations on the invention. Changes may be made with regards to the sequence of processes without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. Use of a particular sequence is therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention extends to the appended claims and equivalents thereof.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the present invention may be embodied as a method, system, and\/or computer program product.
