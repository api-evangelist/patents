{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This present invention generally relates to preparation and utilization of customer profile data in a cable services network. More particularly, the present invention relates to preparation and utilization of customer profile data for providing customer-specific services and product offerings and customer-specific information content through a cable services network.","With the advent of cable television networks, cable customers have grown accustomed to receiving a variety of television programming from numerous broadcasting sources. In recent years, technology advances have enabled customers to receive an even greater variety of services through cable services networks. Modern cable services networks provide traditional video television programming, telephone services, high speed Internet access, electronic mail services, video-on-demand, information services, and the like. Through the use of set-top boxes (computing systems) cable services providers can provide interactive television services to customers. Such interactive television services allow customers to interact directly with services providers in response to services and product offerings presented to the customers through their personal television sets.","In a typical setting, a cable television channel may be utilized by a cable services provider for providing an interactive menu through which a subscriber may order and update services and products and through which a customer may receive valuable information content such as services or product offerings, local weather updates, traffic information, news flashes, and the like. However, because individual customers subscribe to many different combinations of services and products and because customers are physically geographically disbursed, it is often difficult to provide a particular customer with services and\/or product offerings or valuable information content that is particularly useful to the individual customer as compared to other customers.","Accordingly, there is a need in the art for methods and systems for preparing and maintaining customer profiles that may be utilized by an interactive television system for tailoring interactive services, services and product offerings and helpful information content provision to given customers. It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present invention has been made.","Embodiments of the present invention solve the above and other problems by providing methods and systems for preparing, updating and maintaining customer profile data that may be utilized in an interactive television system for providing tailored customer-specific interactive services, services and product offerings and helpful information content. According to an interactive television system of the present invention, a cable television services customer may interact with services and products providers through her personal television set via a set-top box. The set-top box controls and facilitates the presentation of video programming and data to the customer's television set. Additionally, the set-top box serves as a client-side computing platform for allowing the customer to send and receive data to and from a server-side computing system operated by the customer's interactive television services provider.","When the customer boots or initializes her set-top box for the first time, or after the elapse of a set amount of time, the customer's set-top box queries an application server at the server-side computing system of her interactive television services provider for profile data corresponding to the customer. The query from the set-top box to the application server includes identification information for the requesting set-top box. In response to receipt of the query from the set-top box, the application server populates a data query with the set-top box identification information and passes the data query to a web services system along with a request for profile data for the customer associated with the identified set-top box.","In response to the data query from the application server, the web services system formulates a data query to each of a number of data services associated with the interactive television services provider to obtain profile data for the customer. According to one aspect of the invention, the web services system is operative to communicate with disparate data services systems according to communications protocols required by each individual data services system. For example, an interactive television services provider billing system may be queried for name, address, telephone number, business identification number, Social Security number, credit history, services and products subscription data, and the like for the customer. For another example, a services provider electronic mail system may be queried for electronic mail services subscription data for the customer, including electronic mail address, if any. A customer services database may be queried for information regarding services and products currently subscribed to by the customer. Advantageously, any system maintained by or associated with the interactive television services provider may be queried for available data for the customer.","After the web services system receives responses to all data queries, available customer data is passed by the web services system back to the application server. The application server prepares a customer profile from the customer data and formats the customer profile for use by the client-side set-top box. The customer profile is then passed to the set-top box associated with the customer's television set and is stored by the set-top box. If customer data is not received by the web services system in response to data queries to the data services systems, the application server prepares a default customer profile from most recently available customer data. If no recently available customer data is available, the application server prepares a default customer profile without customer-specific data. The default customer profile is passed to the customer's set-top box and is stored by the set-top box.","According to another aspect of the invention, after the elapse of a defined period of time, for example 24 hours, during which a given customer profile has not been updated, the set-top box queries the application server for a refresh of the customer profile. In order to refresh the customer profile, the application server again queries the web services system, and the web services system again queries one or more data services systems for customer data that may be used by the application server to update the customer profile.","After the customer profile is stored at the set-top box, customer-specific information content may be presented to the customer, and customer-specific services and product offerings may be presented to the customer in the form of targeted advertising. The customer may select a menu function to commence an interactive services session with the customer's services provider via the customer's set-top box. Once the interactive services menu is launched and is displayed on the customer's television set, the customer profile stored by the set-top box may be used to provide services and product offerings to the customer via the displayed menu. For example, if a customer profile indicates that the customer is not a subscriber to high speed Internet access, an advertisement may be displayed to the customer offering that service. For another example, if the customer profile contains a street address for the customer at which a new service is now available, an advertisement may be displayed to the customer offering the new service. Similarly, information content may be tailored to the customer profile for provision to the customer. For example, local weather keyed to the customer's street address and\/or ZIP code may be obtained and displayed to the customer.","These and other features and advantages, which character the present invention, will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed.","As briefly described above, embodiments of the present invention are directed to methods and systems for preparing, updating and maintaining customer profile data for providing interactive services, services and product offerings and information content that is tailored to a specific customer based on profile data for the customer. These embodiments may be combined, other embodiments may be utilized, and structural changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several figures, aspects of the present invention and an exemplary operating environment will be described.","Operating Environment","Embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in a number of distributed computing environments where functionality is tailored for provision to a given user based on a user profile obtained by polling data sources having data associated with the user. According to an actual embodiment, the present invention is implemented in a cable television\/services system.  is a simplified block diagram illustrating a cable television\/services system (hereafter referred to as \u201cCATV\u201d) architecture that serves as an exemplary operating environment for the present invention.","Referring now to , digital and analog video programming, information content and interactive television services are provided via a hybrid fiber coax (HFC) network  to a television set  for consumption by a cable television\/services system customer. As is known to those skilled in the art, HFC networks  combine both optical fiber and coaxial cable lines. Typically, optical fiber runs from the cable head end  to neighborhoods of 500 to 2,000 customers. Coaxial cable runs from the optical fiber feeders to each customer. According to embodiments of the present invention, the functionality of the HFC network  allows for efficient bidirectional data flow between the client-side set-top box  and the server-side application server  of the present invention.","According to embodiments of the present invention, the CATV system  is in the form of a distributed client-server computing system for providing video and data flow across the HFC network  between server-side services providers (e.g., cable television\/services providers) via a server-side head end  and a client-side customer via a client-side set-top box (STB) functionally connected to a customer receiving device, such as the television set . As is understood by those skilled in the art, modern CATV systems  may provide a variety of services across the HFC network  including traditional digital and analog video programming, telephone services, high speed Internet access, video-on-demand, and information services.","On the client side of the CATV system , digital and analog video programming and digital and analog data are provided to the customer television set  via the set-top box (STB) . Interactive television services that allow a customer to input data to the CATV system  likewise are provided by the STB . As illustrated in , the STB  is a multipurpose computing device having a computer processor, memory and an input\/output mechanism. The input\/output mechanism receives input from server-side processes via the HFC network  and from customers via input devices such as the remote control device  and the keyboard . The remote control device  and the keyboard  may communicate with the STB  via a suitable communication transport such as the infrared connection . The STB  also includes a video processor for processing and providing digital and analog video signaling to the television set  via a cable communication transport . A multi-channel tuner is provided for processing video and data to and from the STB  and the server-side head end system , described below.","The STB  also includes an operating system  for directing the functions of the STB  in conjunction with a variety of client applications . For example, if a client application  requires a news flash from a third-party news source to be displayed on the television , the operating system  may cause the graphics functionality and video processor of the STB , for example, to output the news flash to the television  at the direction of the client application  responsible for displaying news items.","Because a variety of different operating systems  may be utilized by a variety of different brands and types of set-top boxes, a middleware layer  is provided to allow a given software application to be executed by a variety of different operating systems. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the middleware layer  may include a set of application programming interfaces (API) that are exposed to client applications  and operating systems  that allow the client applications to communicate with the operating systems through common data calls understood via the API set. As described below, a corresponding middleware layer is included on the server side of the CATV system  for facilitating communication between the server-side application server and the client-side STB . According to one embodiment of the present invention, the middleware layer  of the server-side application server and the middleware layer  of the client-side STB  format data passed between the client side and server side according to the Extensible Markup Language (XML).","The set-top box  passes digital and analog video and data signaling to the television  via a one-way communication transport . The STB  may receive video and data from the server side of the CATV system  via the HFC network  through a video\/data downlink and data via a data downlink. The STB  may transmit data from the client side of the CATV system  to the server side of the CATV system  via the HFC network  via one data uplink. The video\/data downlink is an \u201cin band\u201d downlink that allows for digital and analog video and data signaling from the server side of the CATV system  through the HFC network  to the set-top box  for use by the STB  and for distribution to the television set . As is understood by those skilled in the art, the \u201cin band\u201d signaling space operates at a frequency between 54 and 860 megahertz. The signaling space between 54 and 860 megahertz is generally divided into 6 megahertz channels in which may be transmitted a single analog signal or a greater number (e.g., up to ten) digital signals.","The data downlink and the data uplink, illustrated in , between the HFC network  and the set-top box  comprise \u201cout of band\u201d data links. As is understand by those skilled in the art, the \u201cout of band\u201d frequency range generally lies between zero and 54 megahertz. According to embodiments of the present invention, data flow between the client-side set-top box  and the server-side application server  is typically passed through the \u201cout of band\u201d data links. Alternatively, an \u201cin band\u201d data carousel may be positioned in an \u201cin band\u201d channel into which a data feed may be processed from the server-side application server  through the HFC network  to the client-side STB . Operation of data transport between components of the CATV system , described with reference to , is well known to those skilled in the art.","Referring still to , the head end  of the CATV system  is positioned on the server side of the CATV system and includes hardware and software systems responsible for originating and managing content for distributing through the HFC network  to client-side STBs  for presentation to customers via televisions . As described above, a number of services may be provided by the CATV system , including digital and analog video programming, interactive television services, telephone services, video-on-demand services, targeted advertising, and provision of information content.","The application server  is a general-purpose computing system operative to assemble and manage data sent to and received from the client-side set-top box  via the HFC network . As described above with reference to the set-top box , the application server  includes a middleware layer  for processing and preparing data from the head end of the CATV system  for receipt and use by the client-side set-top box . For example, the application server  via the middleware layer  may obtain data from third-party services  via the Internet  for transmitting to a customer through the HFC network  and the set-top box . For example, a weather report from a third-party weather service may be downloaded by the application server via the Internet . When the application server  receives the downloaded weather report, the middleware layer  may be utilized to format the weather report for receipt and use by the set-top box . According to one embodiment of the present invention, data obtained and managed by the middleware layer  of the application server  is formatted according to the Extensible Markup Language and is passed to the set-top box  through the HFC network  where the XML-formatted data may be utilized by a client application  in concert with the middleware layer , as described above. As should be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a variety of third-party services data, including news data, weather data, sports data and other information content may be obtained by the application server  via distributed computing environments such as the Internet  for provision to customers via the HFC network  and the set-top box .","According to embodiments of the present invention, the application server  obtains customer profile data from services provider data services  for preparing a customer profile that may be utilized by the set-top box  for tailoring certain content provided to the customer. As illustrated in , the services provider data services  include a number of services operated by the services provider of the CATV system  which may include data on a given customer.

As should be understood by those skilled in the art, the disparate data services systems , , ,  are illustrated as a collection of data services for purposes of example only. The example data services systems comprising the data services  may operate as separate data services systems, which communicate with a web services system (described below) along a number of different communication paths and according to a number of different communication protocols.","Referring still to , a web services system  is illustrated between the application server  and the data services . According to embodiments of the present invention, the web services system  serves as a collection point for data requested from each of the disparate data services systems comprising the data services . When the application server  requires customer profile data from one or more of the data services  for preparation or update of a customer profile, the application server  passes a data query to the web services system . The web services system formulates a data query to each of the available data services systems for obtaining any available data for a given customer as identified by a set-top box identification associated with the customer. The web services system  serves as an abstraction layer between the various data services systems and the application server . That is, the application server  is not required to communicate with the disparate data services systems, nor is the application server  required to understand the data structures or data types utilized by the disparate data services systems. The web services system  is operative to communicate with each of the disparate data services systems for obtaining necessary customer profile data. The customer profile data obtained by the web services system is assembled and is returned to the application server  for ultimate processing via the middleware layer , as described above.","Operation","Having described an exemplary operating environment for embodiments of the present invention with reference to , preparation and utilization of a customer profile will now be described.  is a simplified block diagram illustrating a customer profile data structure for providing customer profile data to a set-top box according to embodiments of the present invention.
