title: Method and system to automatically generate use case sequence diagrams and class diagrams
abstract: A system and computer-executed method automatically generate a sequence diagram from Class-Responsibility-Collaborator (CRC) information. The CRC information identifies objects, responsibility information for each object, and collaborator information for each object, and the CRC information corresponds with each activity in an activity diagram. The method includes storing, in a storage device, the objects and corresponding class types of the objects according to the CRC information and associating, by a processor, each of the objects with one or more other objects according to the collaborator information of the CRC information. The method also includes determining, by the processor, messages from each of the objects to associated objects according to the responsibility information, and the processor automatically generating the sequence diagram including the objects and the messages among the objects.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a Non-Provisional of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/713,144 filed Oct. 12, 2012, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","The development of a software system, to process well log data obtained in a downhole environment, for example, typically entails multiple software programmers developing multiple elements that must eventually be integrated together. Thus, tools that allow modeling and top-level visualization of systems are employed in software design. For example, Unified Modeling Language (UML) provides a common design language to model computer applications. UML provides several types of diagrams that facilitate ease of understanding of an application under development. System requirements can be decomposed into a model that includes diagrams depicting system behavior. Major behavioral aspects are decomposed into \u201cUse Cases\u201d to help analyze system functionality. Sequence diagrams are a UML notation and one way in which to capture behavior within each Use Case. However, because sequence diagrams are cumbersome to generate and maintain, they tend to become out-of-date as a software development project progresses and, therefore, less useful in validating a design. Accordingly, a system and method to efficiently construct and maintain sequence diagrams and class diagrams would be appreciated in the software development industry.","According to one aspect of the invention, a computer-executed method of automatically generating a sequence diagram from Class-Responsibility-Collaborator (CRC) information, the CRC information identifying objects, responsibility information for each object, and collaborator information for each object, and the CRC information corresponding with each activity in an activity diagram, includes storing, in a storage device, the objects and corresponding class types of the objects according to the CRC information; associating, by a processor, each of the objects with one or more other objects according to the collaborator information of the CRC information; determining, by the processor, messages from each of the objects to associated objects according to the responsibility information; and the processor automatically generating the sequence diagram including the objects and the messages among the objects.","According to another aspect of the invention, a computer-executed method of automatically generating a class diagram from Class-Responsibility-Collaborator (CRC) information, the CRC information identifying an object, responsibility information for the object, and collaborator information for the object, and the CRC information corresponding with each activity in an activity diagram, includes storing, in a storage device, the objects and corresponding class types of the objects according to the CRC information; associating, by a processor, each of the objects with one or more other objects according to the collaborator information of the CRC information; determining, by the processor, dependencies among the objects according to the responsibility information associated with each object; and the processor automatically generating the class diagram including the objects and the dependencies among the objects.","According to yet another aspect, a system to automatically generate a sequence diagram and a class diagram from Class-Responsibility-Collaborator (CRC) information, the CRC information identifying an object, responsibility information for the object, and collaborator information for the object, and the CRC information corresponding with each activity in an activity diagram, includes a storage device to store the CRC information and instructions for deriving information from the CRC information; a processor to execute the instructions to generate the sequence diagram and the class diagram based on the information derived from the CRC information; and an output device configured to output the sequence diagram or the class diagram.","While one or more embodiments have been shown and described, modifications and substitutions may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the present invention has been described by way of illustrations and not limitation.","As noted above, maintaining up-to-date sequence diagrams throughout a software development process becomes a cumbersome and often-neglected task. Embodiments detailed below include a system and method to automatically generate and update a sequence diagram and a class diagram. One or more Class-Responsibility-Collaboration (CRC) cards, detailed below with reference to , are associated with each activity in an activity diagram, detailed with reference to . In alternate embodiments, activity-level sequence diagrams, as shown in , are manually built to represent the CRC information additionally or instead. Based on the CRC information, a sequence diagram and a class diagram are automatically generated. The software development process and many of the aspects of the embodiments described herein involve one or more processors working in conjunction with one or more memory devices that store operation commands and data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","105","110","115","115","120","120","110","110","125","100","100","100"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","b ","d ","e"]},"In the wellbore data processing example, the exemplary activity diagram  may include an activity of receiving data collected by one or more sensors downhole. At , a decision may be made whether all the expected data was telemetered from sensors in the borehole to a processing system on the surface. The processing system, a computer, for example, may include one or more processors and one or more memory devices and the processing system, alone or in combination with other processing systems in a network would be implementing the software system described by the activity diagram . If the decision at were that all the data is not received, activity may include collecting the remaining data. Upon completion of activity or if the decision at were that all the data was available, activity may include pre-processing the collected data. Based on a decision regarding the pre-processing at , the activities may end in this Use Case () or a split may lead to parallel processing of activities and to separately process and display results of sensor data processing. The end of the parallel processing () also leads to the end () of the activities in the exemplary Use Case.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","205","205","200","300","110","100","110","510","210","200","205","510","210","210","510","215","215","215","215","210","215","210","220","230","510","210","210","220"]},"In the exemplary wellbore data processing system discussed with reference to , activity (receiving data collected by one or more processors downhole) would be associated with CRC information  for an object  in a class  of Entity type, for example. The responsibilities  of the receiver class include collecting and buffering data telemetered or otherwise provided by downhole sensors. The collaborators  of the receiver class would be each of the sensors and any additional system involved in providing the sensor data. As a software design team adds to and modifies the activity diagram  during development of the software system, the CRC information  associated with each new or modified activity  is also added to or modified to maintain an accurate association between the CRC information  and each activity .
