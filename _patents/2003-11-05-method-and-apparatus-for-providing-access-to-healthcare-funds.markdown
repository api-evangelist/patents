{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/319,297, filed Dec. 13, 2002, which is incorporated by reference herein.","This invention relates to a method and apparatus for payment for healthcare goods and services. More specifically it relates to a method and apparatus for providing funds and routing payments for healthcare expenses. Even more specifically, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for providing funds from one or more accounts for healthcare expenses.","The present method of paying for healthcare expenses partially covered by medical insurance is cumbersome. This is especially true for a consumer wishing to pay for eligible healthcare expenses using funds from a tax-advantaged account (TAA), such as a flex spending account or health reimbursement arrangement. The healthcare provider must submit a claim for the part of the expense paid for by insurance and charge the participant for the balance due (Participant balance-due amount), which usually consists of, but is not limited to, the sum of the co-payment amount, any deductible amount, any uncovered amount, coinsurance, etc. If the participant has a TAA with her employer and desires reimbursement, the participant must save the receipt and submit it to a plan administrator, a function that the employer typically out-sources to a third party administrator (TPA), to receive reimbursement, usually with a significant delay. This is a problem for the participant since she pays out-of pocket twice, the first time from her paycheck and the second time to the provider, before she can be reimbursed for the eligible medical expense. The TPA then must manually process the receipts and adjudicate the participant's claims according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and employer plan rules. This is a costly and error prone process since TPA's usually administer plans from numerous employers and each employer can tailor its own plan with respect to eligible medical expenses. The TPA then sends reimbursements to the participant for eligible claims. This is considered the initial and usual system process for reimbursing participants from their TAAs for eligible medical expenses. Although attempts have been made to streamline the process, significant inefficiencies and unnecessary costs remain. The trend is for more money fronted in TAAs as the participant balance-due amount increases due to increases in co-pay and deductible amounts.","Initial System Problems","Problems associated with the initial process for reimbursing the participant for eligible expenses from TAAs include the following:\n\n","Additionally, an increasing number of employers are using combinations of TAA plans for employees. Not only are employers permitted to offer multiple TAAs to employees, such as offering employees both an FSA and an HRA, but employers may create different restrictions related to otherwise allowable expenses under IRS rules for each. This practice has increased the manual processing requirements and created significant risks of error. Since the employer is ultimately liable on the plan, yet it is the TPA who is typically managing the plan, conflicts inevitably arise as these plans and plan combinations become more and more complicated.","In order to solve some of the initial system problems, a method of payment for healthcare expenses from TAAs with a debit card was introduced. The participant can pay for any participant balance-due amount at the point of sale with the debit card using traditional payment networks such as the MasterCard network. The payment transaction would verify against and debit the participant's TAA for the amount of the transaction. The debit card provider would then pay the healthcare provider directly for the amount of the transaction. The intent of the debit card is to eliminate the participant double-pay (or unnecessary pay in the case of payments from HRAs) penalty for eligible medical expenses paid from TAAs. Unfortunately, this system of payment does not solve all of the initial system problems and, moreover, introduces significantly greater problems. The participant still must save all her receipts for auditing purposes and verification that she purchased only qualified medical expenses according to the IRS and employer plan rules. Even though the debit card transaction was electronic, the TPA must still manually adjudicate every claim since the participant can purchase any product at the point of sale with the debit card, not just eligible medical expenses (the cashier has no way of knowing that the debit card relates to a TAA, nor would it have the means to enforce particular rules). What's worse is the fact that the TPA must manually adjudicate each debit card claim with less information than it had when manually adjudicating with receipts. For debit card transactions, the TPA can typically only see who the provider was and the transaction dollar amount. No information about the product or products purchased is available to the TPA at this point. The debit card processors usually have constraints so that purchases can only be made through qualified medical providers such as medical equipment providers and pharmacies; however, these institutions sell many products, not just products that are eligible medical expenses under IRS and employer plan rules. It is up to the TPA to decide which transactions look suspicious and request the documentation from the participant for these transactions (hence the need for the participant to maintain receipts). There are also usually significant processes in place to recover funds from participants who have made debit card purchases for impermissible medical expenses or who can't provide the requested documentation to prove that they made an allowable medical purchase. These range from disabling the debit card to garnishing the participant's wages. This is all because the debit card does not prevent the purchase of unqualified medical expenses up front.","First Effort to Overcome the Problem\u2014Debit Card","The debit card solves only one of the problems with the initial system. It partially solves two other problems. It actually creates several additional problems.","The problem the debit card solves is related to the \u201cdouble payment.\u201d With the debit card, payment for goods and services comes directly from the TAA, therefore the double payment (and unnecessary payment with respect to HRAs) problem is eliminated.","The two problems the debit card only partially solves are:\n\n","The debit card system actually creates additional problems:\n\n","Other Efforts to Overcome the Problem","There have been attempts to mitigate problems associated with the initial system or the debit card system, or both. They are described briefly below.","The websites www.evolutionbenefits.com and www.medibank.com both disclose FSA cards. These cards allow a participant to spend money directly from a FSA, rather than pay out-of-pocket and seek reimbursement later. However, www.medibank.com still requires the participant to save the receipts to verify eligibility of the expenses. Further, the account cards only allow spending from the participant's FSA. If the participant runs out of money in the FSA, the participant will be forced to pay out-of-pocket, or provide other payment means.","United States Patent Application Publication No. US 2002\/0147678 discloses a debit card system for accessing funds in a participant's FSA. The debit-card does not post directly to the participant's FSA, but rather to a program sponsor's shadow account (an unfunded account used for record keeping purposes during claim adjudication). The funds to pay the provider for the transaction are deducted from the program sponsor's group account (funded by the sponsor) at the same time as the posting to the shadow account occurs. The transactions (not the funds) remain in the shadow account until such time as they can be adjudicated, at which time they are released from the shadow account and posted to the individual participant's FSA. Rejected transactions are moved from the shadow account to the program sponsor's suspense account. The program sponsor can use the information in the suspense account to reclaim the funds from the participant by various means, such as debiting the participant's next paycheck. This provision in and of itself underscores the deficiency with the proposed approach. A combination of manual and automatic adjudication methods are proposed for handling the FSA reimbursements.","United States Patent Application Publication No. US 2002\/0198831 discloses a means for processing FSA transactions using a plurality of pharmacies, a stored value card service provider (SVCSP), one or more pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs), individuals having FSAs, and a stored value card (SVC) for debiting a participant's FSA. At the point of service (POS), the goods or service provider, such as a pharmacy, electronically transmits a claim to the respective payor, such as a PBM, which includes the participant information. The payor adjudicates the claim and responds with the participant balance-due amount. At the same time, the payor transmits some of the transaction data, such as the participant identifier, date and time of the transaction, and participant balance-due amount, to the SVCSP. The participant then uses the SVC at the POS to pay for the participant balance-due amount from the participant's FSA. The SVCSP handles the adjudication of this SVC transaction by searching its' database for a matching transaction received from the payor. If a match is found and there are sufficient funds in the participant's FSA, the transaction is automatically adjudicated. If no match is found, the adjudication request is rejected. The intent of this invention is to prevent the use of FSA dollars for impermissible IRS expenses. This requires that the payor successfully adjudicates only claims for IRS allowed expenses. This requirement is stated as an advantage of the subject invention. The fact is payors, such as PBMs, are focused on participant eligibility, what is and what is not covered under a specific participant's health plan, and what participant balance-due amount is due for a claim. Payors\/PBMs are not focused on or concerned with whether or not a claim is for an IRS allowable expense and an employer allowable expense in connection with a TAA, and this validation is not part of their normal adjudication process. There is a shared responsibility between the employer, SVCSP, and participant to ensure that such reimbursements are properly substantiated according to IRS and employer plan rules. More specifically, there may be items that are covered by medical plans and therefore successfully adjudicated by the payor, which are not expenses allowed by both the IRS and employer rules in connection with the TAA. This point conflicts with the invention's proposal that SVC transactions that match a payor adjudicated claim can be automatically adjudicated by the SVCSP as IRS and employer plan allowed TAA expenses. Furthermore, this invention moves the day-to-day task of ensuring IRS claims substantiation from the employer to the payor, a party that is not substantially involved with this responsibility in whole or in part today, thus opening the door for more complicated compliance procedures and\/or potential legal ramifications. This point is underscored with the invention's statement of the advantage that the payor (and not the SVCSP database) may retain sufficient information to enable the SVCSP to later prove that the specific drug or item that was the subject of the transaction was properly reimbursable. Simply put, the fact that an item has passed the payor's adjudication does not mean it is properly reimbursable under IRS and employer plan rules.","United States Patent Application Publication No. US 2003\/0061153 discloses a method of using a debit card for an employee benefits program. The debit card transactions are processed as \u201ce-claims\u201d and still require the participant to send in receipts and the processor to manually adjudicate these claims. Significant mechanisms are described to notify participants that receipts are due for substantiating a claim and to disable the debit card in situations in which the claims are not verified within a specified period of time or if the claims are for unqualified IRS expenses. As well, no mechanisms are described for preventing the purchase of impermissible IRS expense items upfront.","In summary, none of these approaches a complete solution to the problems associated with the initial system; participant inconvenience and costly manual adjudication of TAA related claims. Additionally, the foregoing attempts to solve the problems with the initial system have created new problems; a greater potential for unauthorized use of TAA dollars, increased employer and provider costs, and new participant inconveniences. In fact, all debit card approaches substantially require mechanisms to recover tax-advantaged dollars used for purchases that may later be deemed to be impermissible. The increasingly sophisticated attempts to automate some of the claim substantiation with debit cards, such as matching purchase amounts with participant health plan co-pay amounts to automatically adjudicate debit card transactions allow room for abuse by savvy participants who can use the debit card to cover non-qualified product\/service purchases that match these same amounts. These efforts will result in increasing exposure over time as the complexity of health plans are increasing with the combination of larger and varied co-pay, deductible, and coinsurance amounts. Moreover, these efforts do not eliminate the costly manual adjudication of claims for reimbursement.","IRS Guidance","The IRS, in the advanced copy of Revenue Ruling 2003-43, which was scheduled to appear in the Internal Revenue Bulletin 2003-21, dated May 27, 2003, has described the rules regarding the use of debit cards and credit cards to reimburse participants in self insured medical reimbursement plans. It is clear from the guidance that the IRS requires all claims to be substantiated, no matter how small the dollar amount. The desire to fix the problems of manual claims substantiation and consumer double pay are so great that the IRS has provided for some scenarios in which claims can be automatically substantiated, without a receipt, with a debit\/credit card transaction. First, claims in which the dollar amount at a health care provider equals the dollar amount of the co-payment for that service under the major medical plan of the specific employee-cardholder can be automatically substantiated. Second, recurring expenses that have been previously approved for the same amount, from the same provider, and during the same time period can be automatically substantiated. Third, if the merchant, service provider, or other independent third party, at the time and point of sale, can provide information to the employer that the charge is for a medical expense, the charge can be automatically substantiated. All other scenarios are considered conditional pending confirmation of the medical expense. In our estimation it is still possible that invalid medical expenses can be reimbursed via the first two scenarios described above. It is also possible under the third scenario, with debit card use, that invalid medical expenses can be reimbursed if the employer has restricted the allowable expenses in their tax-advantaged plan. While the IRS is attempting to reduce costs associated with manual claim adjudication, the implementation of these scenarios will be costly.","Problems that Still Remain\n\n","What is needed is a system that solves all of the problems presented by the initial system, without creating new problems.","What is needed is:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0010","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.

The method comprises determining a participant balance-due amount based on a participant's insurance coverage, determining the availability of funds from a one or more of the participant's prioritized accounts, and deducting at least a portion of the participant balance-due amount from the highest priority account having available funds.","A general object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus to automatically, electronically facilitate the payment of the participant balance-due amount (co-pay, deductible, coinsurance, uncovered amounts) for healthcare or other expenses from a participant's account(s) so as to eliminate all manual adjudication of claims, and participant inconveniences such as the need to maintain and submit receipts and the double payment (or unnecessary payment).\n\n","Another object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus to facilitate automatic payment of the participant balance-due amount from the highest priority client account having available funds, and from multiple participant accounts, and from accounts of multiple participants.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus facilitate payment of a participant balance-due amount for healthcare expense while automatically meeting all of the IRS claims substantiation requirements.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus to facilitate payment of the participant balance-due amount from TAAs such as FSAs and HRAs.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus to facilitate payment of part or all of the participant balance-due amount from accounts sponsored by third-parties for incentive programs, rewards programs, points programs, coupons, etc.","These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon a reading of the following detailed description of the invention in view of the drawings and claims.","Virtual Debit Card","The system of the present invention solves the all the problems in the initial system problem and provides benefits not available with existing solutions today.\n\n","It should be appreciated that, in the detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention that follows, like reference numbers on different drawing views are intended to identify identical structural elements of the invention in the respective views.","Payment for healthcare goods and services is currently being made in an inefficient manner, especially with respect to TAAs such as FSAs and HRAs. In the present invention, a FSA is an account containing pre-tax funds provided by an employee under Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7105(b) for healthcare expenses. A HRA is an account containing funds provided by an employer for an employee's healthcare expenses.","A schematic diagram summarizing the current system for providing reimbursement for paid participant balance-due amounts is shown in . Participant  requests a healthcare good or service from provider . Participant  communicates the good or service needed () and the participant's health insurance information () to provider  by a means such as showing provider  a prescription and an insurance card. Provider  then contacts the appropriate insurance company , via a real time, online software application such as Zadall to determine the eligibility of and\/or to file a claim for the participant  for health insurance benefits. Provider  communicates a message  containing a description of the good or service requested () and participant information () to the insurance company  via a real time, online software application such as Zadall. Insurance company  sends a message  to provider  via a real time, online software application such as Zadall to communicate the plan-covered amount () under participant's plan and the participant balance-due amount () required from participant  for the requested good or service (). The insurance company  sends payment  to the provider  for the plan-covered amount () at a later date and time. The provider supplies the good or service  to participant  and communicates to participant  the participant balance-due amount (). Participant  tenders payment of participant balance-due amount () by check, cash, credit or debit card, or other form of payment. If participant  would like the participant balance-due amount () to come from funds in a TAA, such as a FSA or HRA, participant  must save the receipt  and submit it with a claim for reimbursement  to the plan administrator (PA) , which is typically a TPA. Upon receiving the claim for reimbursement  with the appropriate receipt , the PA  manually adjudicates the claim for reimbursement . If the PA  adjudicator determines that the expense is an eligible healthcare expense under the IRS and employer plan rules for use of participant's  TAA funds, it sends reimbursement  to participant . If the PA  adjudicator determines that the expense is not an eligible healthcare expense under the IRS and employer plan rules for use of participant's  TAA funds, it sends participant  a rejection . If the PA  adjudicator determines that the expense may not be an eligible healthcare expense under the IRS and employer plan rules for use of participant's  TAA funds, it sends participant  a rejection  and requires additional information from participant  before approving the claim for reimbursement . This becomes a very cumbersome and frustrating process for participant . For example, the participant  may send in a receipt  for a valid medical expense such as a prescription. If the receipt  does not have the appropriate prescription information listed, then the PA  may request additional documentation . The participant  would then have to submit additional documentation, such as an explanation of benefits form  that has more detailed prescription information on it in order to get reimbursed for the expense.","A work flow diagram of the present invention is shown in . Participant  communicates the good or service needed () and the participant's health insurance information () to provider , such as by showing provider  a prescription and a health insurance card. Provider  then contacts the appropriate insurance company  via a real time, online software application such as Zadall to determine the eligibility of and\/or to file a claim for the participant  for health insurance benefits. Provider  communicates a message  containing a description of the good or service requested () and participant information () to the insurance company  via a real time, online software application such as Zadall, using a standard protocol such as TCP\/IP. The Virtual Debit Card Real-Time System (VDC RTS)  receives the message  from the provider . The VDC RTS  makes a copy  of the message , and then forwards the message  to the insurance company  for claim adjudication, via a standard protocol such as TCP\/IP. At the same time, VDC RTS  uses information from its' copy  to request participant account(s) information and rules  contained in the Virtual Debit Card Host System (VDC HOST)  loaded previously (and described in more detail below). Insurance company  sends a response message  to VDC RTS  using a standard communications protocol such as TCP\/IP to communicate the plan-covered amount () and the participant balance-due amount () required from participant  for the requested good or service (). VDC RTS  receives message . VDC RTS  also receives the previously requested participant account(s) information and rules  from the VDC HOST . VDC RTS  uses the participant account(s) information and rules  to adjudicate the participant's virtual claim for reimbursement () (a virtual claim for reimbursement is a claim automatically generated by the VDC System  on behalf of the participant  to automatically effect payment from a participant account(s)  for the participant balance-due amount ()) and deter-mines if there are enough funds available in the participant's account set  to adjust (reduce or zero-out) the participant balance-due amount (). A message  containing the adjusted participant balance-due amount () (which would be zero unless there are insufficient funds in the account set  to pay the full amount of participant balance-due amount ()) is sent from the VDC RTS  to the provider . The VDC RTS  sends an update transaction  to the VDC HOST  to adjust the account set  in a manner consistent with the payment of the participant balance-due amount (). The relevant contents of each message  and update transaction  where an adjustment to account set  occurs are stored in the VDC HOST database  as a virtual claim () for payment, billing, reporting, and other purposes. Account set  may include any kind of accounts where units are stored and can be used to fully or partially pay a participant balance-due amount (). The most typical types of accounts  in account set  would be TAAs. But, account set  may also include (or include instead) checking accounts, savings accounts, credit or debit card accounts, or any other financial account known in the art. Units would typically represent currency. Any number of account(s)  within account set  may be designated by the participant  or the employer  to provide funds for healthcare expenses. The units to pay the participant balance-due amount () are deducted from the appropriate account(s)  within account set  based upon participant account(s) information and rules . The appropriate account(s)  are automatically determined on a case-by-case basis by participant account(s) information and rules  (see further descriptions of rules below). If the processing of the participant account(s) information and rules  does not result in sufficient funds to pay any of the participant balance-due amount (), the message  that is sent from VDC RTS  to provider  will not contain an adjusted participant balance-due amount () but rather the original participant balance-due amount (). In that case, the participant would be required to pay the full participant balance-due amount () by other means at the point of sale. If the processing of the participant account(s) information and rules  does not result in sufficient funds to pay all of the participant balance-due amount (), the message  that is sent from VDC RTS  to provider  may contain an adjusted participant balance-due amount () that is more than zero. In that case, the participant would be required to pay the partial, adjusted participant balance-due amount () by other means at the point of sale.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0113"},"figref":"FIG.
