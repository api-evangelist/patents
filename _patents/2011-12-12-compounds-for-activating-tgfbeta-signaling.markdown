No. 12\/249,577, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,097,645, filed Oct. 10, 2008, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/998,658, filed Oct. 12, 2007, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with Government support from the Department of Veterans Affairs and under contract AG020603 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present subject matter relates to small-molecule compositions and methods for treatment and prevention of diseases and conditions associated with reduced TGF-\u03b2 signaling, including neurological disorders.","TGF-\u03b2","Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling is implicated in a numerous diseases and conditions, including stroke, heart disease, bone loss, cancer, multiple sclerosis, wound healing, inflammation, and neurodegenerative disorders. TGF-\u03b2 is a member of a superfamily of conserved cytokines, growth factors, and morphogens, which play key functions in development and homeostasis.The TGF-\u03b2 subfamily includes three isoforms in mammals, TGF-\u03b21, 2 and 3, which promote cell survival, induce apoptosis, stimulate cell proliferation, induce differentiation, and\/or initiate or resolve inflammation, depending on the particular cell type and environment. Accurate regulation of TGF-\u03b2 bioactivity and signaling is key to controlling these functions and essential to health and normal aging. The disruption of TGF-\u03b2 signaling molecules frequently results in embryonic lethality in mice.","The biological actions of TGF-\u03b2s are mediated by a receptor complex consisting of the TGF-\u03b2 type 1 (TBR1\/ALK5) and type 2 (TBR2) serine\/threonine kinase receptor subunits.Receptor activation leads to phosphorylation of Smad proteins, which translocate to the nucleus where they bind to the Smad DNA-binding element (SBE) present in an estimated 400 genes.TGF-\u03b2s can also activate other signaling pathways including the p38 MAP kinase pathway and the JNK or NF-kB pathways.Despite interaction with other pathways, knockout studies in mice suggest that Smad proteins are the key mediators of many of TGF-\u03b21's actions in vivo.","TGF-B in the CNS","TGF-\u03b2 is known to play a role in neurological diseases and condition. In the normal central nervous system (CNS), TGF-\u03b21, 2, and 3, and their receptors are expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia.The best studied isoform, TGF-\u03b21, is expressed in the adult CNS predominantly in response to CNS injury, and may function as an organizer of protective and regenerative responses.It is upregulated in glial cells in response to brain lesioning, transient forebrain ischemia, and stroke.TGF-\u03b22 and TGF-\u03b23 bind to the same receptors as TGF-\u03b21 but have different patterns of activation and expression.Immunoreactivity to TGF-\u03b22 and TGF-\u03b23 is detected in astrocytes and neurons in the normal CNS and is increased in neurodegenerative diseases or after stroke.Changes in TGF-\u03b2 expression are reported in AD brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and serum.TGF-\u03b21 immunoreactivity is increased in (or near) amyloid plaquesand around cerebral blood vessels.","TGF-\u03b2 Protection of Neurons","TGF-\u03b21 has been demonstrated to protect neurons against various toxins and injurious agents in cell culture and in vivo.Astroglial overexpression of TGF-\u03b21 in transgenic mice protected against neurodegeneration induced with the acute neurotoxin kainic acid or associated with chronic lack of apolipoprotein E expression.Boche and coworkers also demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21 protects neurons from excitotoxic death.","Several mechanisms have been postulated to explain how TGF-\u03b21 protects neurons. For example, TGF-\u03b21 decreases Bad, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, and contributes to the phosphorylation, and thus inactivation, of Bad by activation of the Erk\/MAP kinase pathway.On the other hand, TGF-\u03b21 increases production of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.TGF-\u03b21 has also been shown to synergize with neurotrophins and\/or be necessary for at least some of the effects of a number of important growth factors for neurons, including neurotrophins, fibroblast growth factor-2, and glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor. In addition, TGF-\u03b21 increases laminin expressionand is necessary for normal laminin protein levels in the brain.It is also possible that TGF-\u03b21 decreases inflammation in the infarction area, attenuating secondary neuronal damage.","Transgenic Animals","TGF-\u03b21 transgenic mice overexpressing a secreted, constitutively active form of TGF-\u03b21 in astrocytes at modest levels develop age-related cerebrovascular abnormalities including thickening of the capillary basement membrane and cerebrovascular amyloid deposition,nevertheless, these mice have better cognitive function than nontransgenic controls. Similar microvascular abnormalities are typical for AD and consistent with the observation that TGF-\u03b21 mRNA levels in brains of AD cases correlate positively with vascular amyloid deposition.","TGF-\u03b21 transgenic mice cross-bred with human amyloid precursor (hAPP) transgenic mice, develop synaptic degeneration and amyloid plaques in the brain parenchyma. Unexpectedly, a prominent reduction in plaque formation and overall A\u03b2 accumulation was found in hAPP\/TGF-\u03b21 double transgenic compared with hAPP mice.Most of the remaining amyloid accumulated around cerebral blood vessels.","Increased levels of TGF-\u03b21 reduced the number of plaques in human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) mice by 75% and overall A\u03b2 levels by 60%, compared to mice with normal levels of TGF-\u03b21. Interestingly, TGF-\u03b21 stimulated microglial cells to degrade synthetic A\u03b2 peptide in culture. Because TGF-\u03b21 also caused an activation of microglia in hAPP\/TGF-\u03b21 mice, these data suggest that at least some of the effects of TGF-\u03b21 involve the activation of microglial phagocytosis.","The need exists for more effective pharmaceutical compounds for treating and preventing stroke, heart disease, bone loss, cancer, multiple sclerosis, wound healing, inflammation, and neurodegenerative disorders. The present compositions and methods involve small-molecules that modulate TGF-\u03b2 signaling.","The following references and any additional references cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entireties.\n\n","The present composition and methods are for treating and preventing disorders associated with reduced TGF-\u03b2 signaling.

Introduction","In one aspect, compositions are provided for treating a mammalian patient at risk for or diagnosed with a disease or condition characterized by reduced TGF-\u03b2 signaling. The compositions are bioactive, small-molecule, TGF-\u03b2 agonist compounds that cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). Reduction in TGF-\u03b2 signaling is associated with such diseases and conditions as stroke, heart disease, bone loss, cancer, multiple sclerosis, wound healing, inflammation, and neurodegenerative disorders. TGF-\u03b2 agonists are known to reduce the number of amyloid plaques and overall accumulation of A\u03b2 in the AD brain.","In another aspect, methods are provided for treating or preventing the progression of a disease or condition characterized by a reduction in TGF-\u03b2 signaling. On category of such diseases or conditions are neurodegenerative disorders. One example is Alzheimer's disease (AD), or another disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid plaques and overall accumulation of A\u03b2 in the brain. Examples of such diseases are described, infra.","Experiments performed in support of the present compositions and methods are described, below.","II. TGF-\u03b2 Reporter Gene and Cells for Screening Compounds","An in vitro screening method was developed to identify small-molecule chemical compounds with TGF-\u03b21-like bioactivity. The method utilized a fusion gene consisting of the luciferase or secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene under control of the TGF-\u03b2 responsive Smad-binding element (SBE) minimal promoter sequence.To screen for compounds that mimic TGF-\u03b2 bioactivity, reporter cell lines were prepared by stably-integrating SBE-SEAP into C6 astrocytoma cells, a primary astrocyte line derived from tgfb1 mice, a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line derived from tgfb1 mice (MFB-F11), and NG108-15 neuroblastoma cells (Table 1). Such cell lines remained stable for at least 20 passages.Use of a tgfb1 genetic background avoids interference by the exogenous tgfb1 gene.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0151"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"287pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Cell lines for screening of compounds with TGF-\u03b2 signaling activity"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Reporter","Colonies\/","Lines","Average fold"]},{"entry":["Cell line","Origin","gene","lines tested","selected","induction**"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["C6","Rat astrocytoma","SBE-SEAP*","34","6","7","(line 29)"]},{"entry":["MFB","Mouse fibroblast, Tgfb1","SBE-SEAP","49","7",">500","(line F11)"]},{"entry":["MAB39","Mouse primary","SBE-SEAP","64","2","3","(line 66)"]},{"entry":[{},"astrocytes, Tgfb1"]},{"entry":["NG108-15","Mouse neuroblastoma","SBE-SEAP","46","5","18","(line H18)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"*using 1 ng\/ml TGF-\u03b21, # SBE, Smad binding element; SEAP, secreted alkaline phosphatase"},{"entry":"**best cell line*"}]}}]}},"br":{}},"A library with 5,000 chemically diverse small molecules (average Mr 200 Da) was obtained from Comgenex LLC (South San Francisco, Calif.).

screens, and subsequent screens, can be tested any of the in vitro and in vivo assays described herein and known in the art, including the reporter cell screening assay, neurological protection assay, bioavailabilty assay, toxicity assay, ADMET (i.e., absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) assays, blood-brain barrier assay, in vivo\/transgenic animal assays, and behavioral assays, described above and in Examples.","The present compositions and methods include salts of active compounds and formulations containing active compounds.","V. Effects of TGF-\u03b2 Analogs in vitro","Some of the small-molecule TGF-\u03b2 agonist compounds were tested for neuroprotection activity and toxicity in vitro (cell culture). In addition, the mechanism of action of the agonists was explored using cells with different genetic backgrounds with respect to protein of the TGF-\u03b21 signaling pathway.","A. Neuroprotection Activity",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0184"},"figref":"FIG. 1H"},"B. Toxicity","A microarray assay was used to identify changes in gene expression caused by stimulating tgfb1 fibroblasts with TGF-\u03b21 or 13A04. mRNA was harvested 1, 5, and 24 hours following stimulation of tgfb1 fibroblasts with TGF-\u03b21 (or control) and analyzed for differential expression of 128 genes related to TGF-\u03b2 signaling, using a commercially available filter array (Superarray Bioscience Corp.; ). While the expression of many genes was induced by TGF-\u03b21 and 13A04 treatment (e.g., Fos, Jun, Myc, Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Interleukin-6, etc.) the expression of other genes was differentially by TGF-\u03b21 and 13A04 (e.g., Bmper, Col1a1, Fkbp1b, Serpine1 (aka PAI-1), Plat, etc.). Several genes in the latter group have important roles in vascular remodeling. These data suggest that 13A04 (and similar analogs) are agonists of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, mimicking the actions of TGF-\u03b21. However, there may be additional clinical advantages, e.g., involving vascular remodeling, of the small-molecule agonists.","C. Mechanism of Action\/targets","To understand how the TGF-\u03b2 signaling agonists function and identify molecular genetic targets in cells, fibroblasts lacking different elements of the TGF-\u03b23 signaling pathway, including Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4, were used in combination with plasmids encoding different inhibitors of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway to study TGF-\u03b2 agonists in different backgrounds. For reference, the canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway is illustrated in . The biological actions of TGF-\u03b21 are mediated through interactions with the type 2 TGF beta receptor (TBR2) 2 and the type I TGF beta receptor (TBRI) 3. Betaglycan 4 may participate in the binding of TGF-\u03b21. Receptor activation leads to the phosphorylation of Smad proteins, such as Smad 2\/3 5 and Smad 4 6, which translocate to the nucleus 7 to bind to the Smad DNA-binding element (SBE) 8, present in numerous genes, in combination with transcription factors (TF) 9. Smad 7 10 is inhibitory with respect to Smad 2\/3 5 phosphorylation. Alternative signaling involves p38 11 and the MAP kinase pathway. TAB1 12 activates TAK1 13, which activates p38 11.","The signaling of recombinant TGF-\u03b21 is blocked or strongly inhibited by the absence of Smad4 or the expression of a dominant negative (dn) TGF-\u03b2 receptor, dominant negative Smad 3, or Smad 7 (). Signaling by the 3A agonist was not affected (or was even stronger) in the absence of Smad4 ().","Because Smad2 and Smad3 can substitute for each other, results with Smad2 or Smad3 knock-out fibroblasts were more difficult to interpret. Nonetheless, the synergistic effect of TGF-\u03b21 and 11H was blocked in the absence of Smad2 () or Smad3 (not shown). In these assays, signaling is reported via SBE elements, which are specific elements that bind Smad proteins. Thus, the 11H compound must signal through this element. Without being limited to theory, it is believed that the 3A compound functions as a competitive agonist of Smad binding to the SBE, representing a novel target and mode of action.","VI. Animal Studies","Transgenic mice harboring the SBE-luc reporter gene were generated and used to test the present compositions in vivo. These \u201creporter mice\u201d mice express SBE-luc (i.e., \u201cthe transgene\u201d) in all cells of the body.Intraperitoneal injection of luciferin into SBE-luc mice produces bioluminescence generated by luciferase and photons penetrating the skull can be imaged using sensitive camera systems.","A. Monitoring TGF-\u03b2 Pathway Activation in Animals","Tissue analysis of transgene expression at basal level in 2-month-old mice of lines T9-55 and T9-7 showed the highest levels of luciferase activity in the brain. Further dissection of the brain into different regions (not shown) demonstrated the highest levels of reporter activity in the hippocampus and cortex.","Primary astrocytes and primary neurons isolated from the brains of the SBE-luc mice showed increased expression of luciferase in response to recombinant TGF-\u03b21.Luciferase activation corresponded with nuclear translocation of activated (i.e., phosphorylated) Smad2, which is a transcription factor and downstream signal transducer of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway (not shown).","These experiments demonstrated that the reporter mice show the expected distribution of TGF-\u03b21 in the body and that the mice responded as expected to exogenous TGF-\u03b21. The transgene can be used to monitor activation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway in vivo using living mice.","B. Bioactivity and Availability","To determine whether 3A and its analogs are bioactive in vivo and able to penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB), TGF-\u03b21, 3A, 22B02, or 13A04 were injected into reporter mice i.p. or s.q. The animals were then sacrificed at the indicated times following injection. Bioactivity was measured in living mice using bioluminescence as shown in .  summarizes the data, and shows that activation by 13A04 was in a dose-dependent manner. There was no obvious activation of the reporter in other organs.","Bioactivity data were confirmed by biochemical measurements of tissue luciferase in hippocampal homogenates (). The results showed that peripheral administration of recombinant TGF-\u03b21 and 3A-like compounds activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling in vivo, indicating that the compounds pass the BBB.","C. TGF-\u03b2 Signaling at the Cellular Level","To study TGF-\u03b2 signaling at the cellular level, additional reporter mice were generated, which express a fusion protein consisting of luciferase, red fluorescent protein (REP), and thymidine kinase (TK) under control of the SBE promoter (i.e., SBE-lucRT mice). Using RFP immunohistochemistry, it was shown that a TGF-\u03b2 agonist (compound 13A04) activates the reporter gene and TGF-\u03b2 signaling in hippocampal neurons (). These data are consistent with previous data showing expression of phosphorylated Smad2 in the same neurons of unmanipulated or injured wild-type mice. No activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling was observed in the vasculature. These results demonstrated that the TGF-\u03b2 agonist activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling in neurons in vivo.","D. Activation of TGF-\u03b2 Signaling in Response to Excitotoxic Injury","SBE-luc mice were further used for non-invasive monitoring of reporter activation in response to excitotoxic injury. The mice were lesioned with kainate in a model for excitotoxic injury (FIG. A-D).Excitotoxicity causes an excessive activation of glutamate receptors and subsequent Ca influx in neurons. The resulting neuronal injury leads to an inflammatory response and oxidative stress that amplifies neuronal degeneration and death.Excitotoxicity has been postulated to be responsible, not only for neuronal loss associated with seizures, traumatic and ischemic brain injury, and hypoxia,but also for neuronal damage in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.","Relative luciferase reporter activity was measured in kainate lesioned SBE-luc mice as bioluminescence over the skull and compared with postmortem neuropathological parameters). The relative number of photons emitted from the brain in lesioned animals correlated with biochemical measurements of luciferase activity in postmortem hippocampal samples (not shown).","Neurodegeneration and microglial activation were most prominent in hippocampus and cortex although the extent of damage varied among mice. This variability is typical for kainate lesions and was advantages in correlating reporter gene activation with different degrees of damage. Bioluminescence corresponded to silver staining, which is a sensitive method for detecting degenerating cells as well as the relative number of pyramidal neurons estimated in cresyl violet-stained sections (). Similar correlations were found with NeuN, MAP-2, synaptophysin, and calbindin immunostaining, which were used to assess synapto-dendritic and overall neuronal integrity.","Glial cells were sensitive to neuronal dysfunction and damage. Microglial activation measured as a function of macrosialin\/CD68 expression showed highly significant positive correlations with bioluminescence (). These data demonstrated that reporter gene activity correlated with neurodegeneration and microgliosis in kainate injured SBE-luc mice, further validating the animal model.","SBE-luc mice can also be used to monitor activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in response to glial activation after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. While LPS induces rapid and long-lasting activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in the brain, treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs such as dexamethasone or flurbiprofen strongly reduced signaling () and microglial activation (data not shown). Bioluminescence imaging in living mice demonstrated the efficacy of these compounds in reducing signaling, validating the animal model.","In a further experiment, a group of 5-month-old APP-T41 mice were treated with vehicle or 13A04 (i.p.) for 10 days. At this age, the mice are starting to deposit A\u03b2 which can be quantified in brain sections using A\u03b2 immunostaining. The TGF-\u03b2 agonist compound was well tolerated and no side effects were observed. Although the result were not statistically significant, a trend towards reduced A\u03b2 deposition in 13A04-treated mice was observed, when compared with controls ().","E. Activation of TGF-\u03b2 Signaling in the Hippocampus","In another experiment performed to asses the ability of the present compounds to activate TGF-\u03b2 signaling in animals, SBE-luc mice were given either PBS or the 11H compound via i.p. injections as described in Example 10. Following drug or PBS injection, mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and perfused with saline. Brains were dissected and snap-frozen. Hippocampal tissues were assayed for luciferase activity.","Hippocampi from mice injected with the 11H compound demonstrated twice the levels of activation of the TGF-\u03b2 reporter gene compared to those injected with PBS (), demonstrating the activity of the present compounds in increasing TGF-\u03b2 signaling, in vivo.","VII. Summary of Results","Experiments performed in support of the present compositions and methods show that TGF-\u03b21 is neuroprotective and can reduce the accumulation of A\u03b2 in an animal model. Small-molecule agonists of TGF-\u03b21 modulated TGF-\u03b2 signaling and activated a reporter gene in the brains of transgenic mice. Together, these data suggest that agonists of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway can be used to reduce or prevent amyloid plaques and A\u03b2 accumulation in the CNS, thereby treating or preventing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and associated diseases. While the present compositions and methods relate primarily to TGF-\u03b21, one skilled in the art will recognize that TGF-\u03b22 and \u03b23 can be modulated in a similar manner.","While the present compositions and methods are described mainly for treatment and prevention of AD, other neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by amyloid plaques and\/or accumulation of A\u03b2 in the brain can be treated or prevented in a similar manner. Such diseases\/disorders include localized amyloidosis while as well as systemic amyloidosis. Amyloidosis can appear without other pathology or can accompany plasma cell dyscrasia or multiple myeloma. Amyloidosis is also associated with chronic infection or chronic inflammation. Familial forms of amyloidosis include familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), familial British dementia (FBD), and familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP). Another form of amyloidosis is found in long-term hemodialysis patients. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, motor neuron diseases, polyglutamine disorders (including Huntington's disease), progressive frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Lewy Body dementia (LB), progressive supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Pick's disease, and Parkinson's disease can also be associated with amyloid plaques and\/or accumulation of A\u03b2 in the brain.","Chemical compounds with TGF-\u03b2 agonist activity have previously been described (e.g., exemplified by A-161906 from Abbott Laboratories). Such compounds turned out to be hystone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. A commercially available assay was used to measure HDAC inhibitory activity of the present small-molecule compounds. The present TGF-\u03b2 agonists did not inhibit HDAC activity in HeLa nuclear extracts, while the known inhibitor, trichostatin A, reduced activity by >90% (). Therefore the present compounds do not appear to be significant inhibitors of HDAC 1, HDAC 2, or SIRT 1 (the main HDACs tested in the assay). In contrast, the TGF-\u03b2 agonist\/HDAC inhibitor, A-161906 (Abbott), inhibited HDAC 1 and 2 with an 1050 of 9 nM.","VIII. Methods or Treatment","The present compositions are useful in the preparation of a medicament for treating or preventing diseases and conditions associated with reduced TGF-\u03b2 signaling, including neurological disorders. In a particular example, the compositions are useful in treating or preventing AD or other diseases characterized by neurodegeneration. In some embodiments, the composition is provided in a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral delivery. In some embodiments, the composition is provided in a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for i.p., i.v., or i.m. delivery.","Tablets and capsules containing a compound for modulating the TGF-\u03b2 pathway may be prepared by combining a compound with additives such as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (e.g., lactose, corn starch, microcrystalline cellulose, sucrose), binders (e.g., alpha-form starch, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone), disintegrating agents (e.g., carboxymethylcellulose calcium, starch, low substituted hydroxy-propylcellulose), surfactants (e.g., TWEEN\u00ae 80, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene copolymer), antioxidants (e.g., L cysteine, sodium sulfite, sodium ascorbate), lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc), or the like.","The present compounds can also be mixed with a solid, pulverulent or other carrier, for example lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, starch, such as potato starch, corn starch, millopectine, cellulose derivative or gelatine, and may also include lubricants, such as magnesium or calcium stearate, or polyethylene glycol waxes compressed to the formation of tablets. By using several layers of the carrier or diluent, tablets operating with slow release can be prepared.","Liquid preparations for oral administration can be made in the form of elixirs, syrups or suspensions containing, e.g., ethanol, water, glycerol, propylene, glycol and possibly other additives of a conventional nature.","Other suitable formulations include a protective coating that protects the compound in the stomach and intestines until absorbed by the intestinal mucosa. Protective dosage forms for proteins are known in the art, and include enteric coatings and\/or mucoadhesive polymer coatings. Exemplary mucoadhesive polymer formulations include ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, Eudragit\u00ae, carboxyvinly polymer, carbomer, and the like.","While the present compositions and methods have been described using particular experimental data and examples, further embodiments and uses of the compositions and methods will be apparent to the skilled artisan in view of the disclosure.","The following Examples are provided to illustrate the present compositions and methods and are in no way intended to be limiting.","Compounds are tested for activation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway using two different cell lines produced by stably transfecting cells with the SBE-SEAP reporter gene. These cells lines are TGF-\u03b21 knockout fibroblasts MFB-F11 and mouse NG108-15 neuroblastoma cells. MFB-F11 cells do not produce TGF-\u03b21 and are extremely sensitive to activators of the pathway.Mouse NG108-15 neuroblastoma cells have been used extensively in the field (>1,100 references in Medline) because they can be differentiated into cells with neuron-like properties. Such cells are ideal for assaying TGF-\u03b21 pathway activity in vitro.","Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (i.e., ADMET) assays, including metabolic stability assays using human liver microsomes, permeability assays modeling intestinal and blood brain barrier absorption, and drug interaction assays that evaluate cytochrome P450 inhibition, are known in the artand can be used to evaluate any of the above compounds and those apparent in view of these compounds. Compounds that show favorable characteristics in these in vitro assays can be further evaluated for oral bioavailability and toxicity (maximum tolerated dose) in vivo","Primary mixed neuronal cultures are exposed to A\u03b2 oligomers and treated with compounds (0 to 10 \u03bcM concentration) and cell survival is measured using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release or by counting 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained cells. A\u03b2 oligomers may be produced according to a protocol described by LaDu and coworkers.Such preparations contain mostly oliogomeric A\u03b2, as demonstrated using atomic force microscopy, and it is toxic to neurons. Neuritic dystrophy in 21 DIV neurons can also be measured by quantifying the tortuosity of neurites as described by Ferreira et al.and modified by others.  shows the effect of A\u03b2 on these cells. Further incubation of these cells with the present compounds provides a sensitive assay for neuroprotection.","Male Sprague-Dawley Rats","Oral bioavailability and BBB passage of test compounds can be measured using, e.g., male Sprague-Dawley rats. Animal brains are collected from rats at preselected times following administration of a test compound or control and a bioanalytical method, e.g., LC\/MS-MS, is used to determine bioavailability by comparing the plasma level curves and the brain concentration of the parent drugs after, e.g., i.v. or oral administration. All data from these studies will be analyzed using WinNonlin (SCI Software, NC) or a similar software program to determine appropriate pharmacokinetic parameters such as terminal elimination half-life, area under the curve (AUC), maximum concentration in blood and\/or plasma after oral administration (C), and other pharmacokinetic parameters as appropriate. These experiments will be used to determine the % bioavailability of compounds in plasma and brain and show which compounds are orally active and enter the blood.","SBE-luciferase Transgenic Mice","Two-month old SBE-luciferase transgenic mice receive different concentrations of a test compound either s.q., i.p., or orally by gavage. Compound doses may be estimated from in vitro potency, and are typically in the range of from about 1 to about 50 mg\/kg body weight. Following administration of the test or control compounds, mice are injected with luciferin i.p. At, e.g., 2, 8, and 16 hours following injection of luciferin, the mice are imaged to detect bioluminescence as described above. Brains may be harvested 16 hours following test compound injection, and may be divided sagittally. For example, one hemi-brain can be homogenized in luciferase assay buffer for measurement of reporter gene activation, while the other hemi-brain can be frozen at \u221270\u00b0 C. for future study, including sectioning into individual brain regions","Using this assay, compounds can be tested for the optimal route of injection, half-life, bioactivity, toxicity, efficiency of crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB), accumulation in particular regions of the brain, etc.","Toxicity of test compounds can be determined in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Dose levels are estimated based on structure-activity analysis, comparison to toxicity of similar drugs, data obtained in vitro, and data obtained in other in vivo studies. A range of doses covering at least one log are typically employed. Three rats\/sex\/dose group are administered, e.g., a single oral or i.p. dose of test compound on Day in an appropriate vehicle (e.g., water, methylcellulose, corn oil). In some examples, three dose levels are evaluated for each test compound, along with an appropriate control (e.g., vehicle). The rats are euthanized and necropsied on Day 5. Endpoints include daily clinical observations, body weights, clinical pathology and gross pathology at necropsy. These studies show whether compounds have unusual toxicity in a particular organ and help establish a maximal therapeutic dose.","Mice are injured with kainic acid and treated with different test compounds at two concentrations each to determine if they can reduce neurodegeneration and\/or microglial activation. Wildtype mice on the FVB\/N genetic background (8-weeks-old) will be injured with kainic acid (Tocris, Ellisville, Mo.) dissolved in PBS and injected subcutaneously (s.q., 20 mg\/kg).Seizure activity is scored from 0 to 5, with 0 corresponding to no behavioral changes and 5 corresponding to constant rearing and falling.Only kainate-injected mice reaching at least stage 3 are used for the studies. On day five following injury, mice are anesthetized, transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline, and brains harvested and dissected. One hemi-brain may be fixed for 24 hours in 4% paraformaldehyde and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. Serial coronal sections (40 \u03bcm) can be cut with a freezing microtome (Leica, Allendale, N.J.) and stored in cryoprotective medium. One set of sections, representing different levels of the hippocampus, will be used for the various stains. The other hemi-brain will be dissected into hippocampus, cortex, thalamus, brain stem, and cerebellum. In this manner, the ability of test compounds to reduce neurodegeneration in kainate-injected mice can be assayed.","Bioluminescence has been used recently to monitor and quantify gene activity repeatedly in the same animal in vivo and to study disease progression in peripheral organs with great success.Although, this imaging modality lacks high resolution and cannot be used at present to localize signals at the cellular level, it is quantitative and can faithfully report gene activation if appropriate fusion gene constructs are used. While initial studies demonstrated the use of this technology for the tracking of luciferase expressing bacteria or tumor cells in vivo,more recently transgenic mice were generated that express the Firefly luciferase reporter gene under control the HIV-1 LTR, c-fos, or \u03b2-lactoglobulin,or NF-kB promoters\/enhancers.","Transgenic mice that overproduce FAD-mutant human APP reproduce important aspects of AD, including amyloid plaques, neurodegeneration, and cognitive deficits. APP-T41 mice which overexpress APP751in neurons develop amyloid pathology, neurodegeneration, and cognitive deficits.Mice overexpressing human tau protein associated with familial forms of fronto-temporal dementia (a dementia characterized by extensive tangle formation) develop neurofibrillary tangles similar to the ones observed in AD and suffer from locomotor deficits around 10 months of age.APP-T41 and Prp-taumicecan be used to determine the in vivo efficacy of test compounds in treating AD-like diseases.","APP-T41 mice have low but detectable levels of A\u03b2 in brain and plasma at 2-months of age, consistently show A\u03b2 deposits at 5-months of age, and exhibit a prominent pathology at 12-months of age.Test compounds will be administered to animals at different stages of disease progression to determine when the compound should be administered for maximum effect, how late in disease progression compounds can be delivered, and the degree of protection afforded by the compounds. Compounds can also be tested for their ability to reverse cognitive deficits.","Prp-taumice show consistent tau pathology around 6-months of age and develop motor deficits around 9-months of age. Motor function can be tested using a rotarod and cognitive function can be tested using a fear conditioning paradigm.","Both short-term and long term studies can be performed using APP-T41 and Prp-taumice.","Morris Water maze: Mice are trained on a Morris water maze as described. Latency, path length, and proximity scores serve as measures of learning. A probe trial will be administered 1 and 7 days after training, followed by reversal trials to determine whether the observed results are due to behavioral inflexibility. Swim speeds will also be compared.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0147","num":"0235"},"figref":"FIG. 8A"},"Contextual fear conditioning: To assess cognitive function in rTg4510 tau mice a Pavlovian fear-conditioning paradigm can be used in addition to the water maze.Briefly, after receiving a foot shock coupled with an acoustic stimulus in a brightly lit chamber, mice are exposed to the same chamber (contextual memory assessment) or placed in a differently shaped, scented, and lit box (cued memory assessment), e.g., 24 hours or 10 days later. The freezing response of the mice is then quantified. This type of memory test is reliable for assessing deficits in contextual memory and discreet cued memory in mice.It involves a rapidly acquired form of learning, thought to be a model of human explicit memory that appears to involve the hippocampus and that is impaired in AD.An additional advantage of fear conditioning over other spatial memory tasks, such as the Morris water maze, is that it minimally relies on motor skills (i.e. stamina and speed), or vision, and allows cognitive testing of mice with slight motor deficits, as is the case for some transgenic mice.","SBE-luc mice (T9-7F), 2-4 months of age, 4-5 mice per group, were given either the 11H compound at 30 mg\/kg via i.p. injections, or PBS as a control. The 11H compound was completely dissolved in PBS at the concentration of 3 mg\/ml. This working solution was given to mice at 10 \u03bcl\/g body weight to achieve the desired level of 30 mg\/kg. Five hours following drug or PBS injection, mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and perfused with saline. Brains were dissected and snap-frozen. Hippocampal tissues were homogenized in 100 \u03bcl of 1\u00d7 luciferase assay buffer and 20 \u03bcl of the resulting supernatant was used for luciferase assays.","Hippocampi from mice injected with the 11H compound demonstrated twice the levels of activation of the TGF-\u03b2 reporter gene compared to those injected with PBS (). These data indicated that the 11H compound specifically activated TGF-\u03b2 reporter gene expression, and therefore, TGF-\u03b2 signaling, in vivo."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0135"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A-1J"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0136"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-2D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0137"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A-3G"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0138"},"figref":"FIGS. 3F and 3G"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0139"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A-4F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0140"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0141"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0142"},"figref":"FIG. 6A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0143"},"figref":"FIG. 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0144"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A and 7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0145"},"figref":"FIG. 8A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0146"},"figref":"FIG. 8B"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
