title: Automated word substitution for contextual language learning
abstract: A contextual language learning capability is disclosed. The contextual language learning capability is configured to enable an end user to use knowledge of a first language to learn a second language. The contextual language learning capability is configured to modify source content (in which content is provided in the first language) to form modified content (including a combination of content in the first language and content in the second language). The source content is processed to replace at least a portion of the content provided in the first language with corresponding content provided in the second language, thereby producing the modified content. The modified content is presented to the end user for use in learning the second language. The replacement of a subset of the source content in the first language with corresponding content in the second language gives context to the content in the second language, thereby giving the end user an understandable context for the content provided in the second language. This increases the likelihood that the end user will be able to understand and, thus, learn, the second language.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention relates generally to language learning and, more specifically but not exclusively, to contextual language learning.","There is significant demand for products and services that assist people in learning languages.","Various deficiencies in the prior art are addressed by embodiments for contextual language learning.","In one embodiment, an apparatus includes a processor and a memory, where the processor is configured to process, based on content replacement control information, source content in a first language to replace a subset of the source content in the first language with corresponding content in a second language.","In one embodiment, a computer readable storage medium stores instructions which, when executed by a computer, cause the computer to perform a method which includes processing, based on content replacement control information, source content in a first language to replace a subset of the source content in the first language with corresponding content in a second language.","In one embodiment, a method includes processing, based on content replacement control information, source content in a first language to replace a subset of the source content in the first language with corresponding content in a second language.","To facilitate understanding, identical reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate identical elements that are common to the figures.","In general, a contextual language learning capability is depicted and described herein, although various other capabilities also may be presented herein.","In at least some embodiments, the contextual language learning capability is configured to enable an end user to use knowledge of a first language to learn a second language.","In at least some embodiments, the contextual language learning capability is configured to modify source content in a first language (e.g., in which words are provided in the first language) to form modified content including a combination of content in the first language and content in the second language (e.g., including a combination of words in the first language and words in the second language). The source content is processed to replace at least a portion of the content provided in the first language with corresponding content provided in the second language, thereby producing the modified content. The modified content is presented to the end user for use in learning the second language.","In at least some embodiments, the contextual language learning capability, by replacing a subset of the words provided in the first language with corresponding words provided in the second language, gives context to the words provided in the second language. This gives the end user an understandable context for the words provided in the second language and, thus, increases the likelihood that the end user will be able to understand and, thus, learn, the second language.","In at least some embodiments, the contextual language learning capability, by replacing a subset of the words provided in the first language with corresponding words provided in the second language within the context of an activity normally performed by the end user (e.g., reading an email, viewing content received from the Internet, reading an electronic book, listening to an audio book, and the like), ensures that the process of language learning is not necessarily solely focused on language learning. This enables language learning to be performed as a secondary activity in conjunction with the primary activity that would otherwise be performed by the end user anyway. This increases the likelihood that the end user will practice language learning, because the language learning is achieved while the end user is performing activities that he or she would be performing anyway, and, further, because the need for the end user to set aside additional time to devote only to language learning is obviated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The contextual language learning capability  enables an end user to use his or her knowledge of a first language (also referred to herein as a source language) to learn a second language (also referred to herein as a target language).","The contextual language learning capability  is configured to use a content modification module  to process source content (which includes content in the source language) to form thereby modified content (which includes a combination of content in the source language and content in the target language). The content modification module  receives the source content . The content modification module  processes the source content to replace at least a portion of the content provided in the source language with corresponding content provided in the target language. The content modification module  outputs the modified content . The modified content is presented to the end user for use by the end user in learning the target language. It is noted that references herein to content (e.g., content provided in the source language and content provided in the target language) also may be read as being references to words, as one or more words of the source content may be replaced with one or more words of the target content at any suitable granularity (e.g., for words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and the like). In this manner, the replacement of a subset of the words provided in the source language with corresponding words provided in the target language (such that modified content includes a combination of words in the source language and words in the target language) gives context to the words provided in the target language, thereby enabling the end user to experience the words of the target language within the context of the modified content that still includes words in the source language. This gives the end user an understandable context for the words provided in the target language, thereby increasing the likelihood that the end user will be able to understand and, thus, learn the target language.","The content modification module  is configured to process source content to form modified content within the context of an activity normally performed by the end user. For example, the activity may include one or more of viewing content available locally on an end user device, viewing content received via a network connection, and the like. For example, the activity may include one or more of reading a document, reading email, reading an electronic book, listening to an audio book, and the like. As noted herein, this ensures that the process of language learning is not necessarily solely focused on language learning. In this manner, the activity for which content modification is performed may be considered to be a primary activity of the end user and language learning that is provided as a result of content modification may be considered to be a secondary activity of the end user that is performed in conjunction with the primary activity that would otherwise be performed by the end user anyway.","The content modification module  may be configured to support context-based language learning for any suitable languages. The source language may be any language suitable for use as a reference language that will facilitate learning of the target language by the end user (e.g., any language of which the end user has a relatively good understanding, such as a native language of the end user or any other language suitable for use as a reference language that will facilitate learning of the target language by the end user). The target language may be any language which the end user is attempting to learn (e.g., where the end user is attempting to attain a basic understanding of the language, where the end user has at least some level of proficiency\/competency in the language and is attempting to improve one or more aspects of his or her proficiency in the language, and the like). For example, the source language and the target language may be selected from any suitable set of languages, such as English, French, German, Japanese, Russian, Mandarin, and\/or any other languages.","The content modification module  may be configured to support content replacement processing for any suitable type of source content and modified content . For example, source content may be text-based content (e.g., a document, an email, a webpage, and the like), audio-based content (e.g., a song, an audio clip, an audio book, and the like), video-based content, multimedia content, or any other suitable type of content. Similarly, for example, modified content may be text-based content (e.g., a document, an email, a webpage, and the like), audio-based content (e.g., a song, an audio clip, an audio book, and the like), video-based content, multimedia content, or any other suitable type of content or any other suitable type of content. As such, various embodiments of contextual language learning capability  enable learning of written and\/or auditory aspects of the target language.","The content modification module  may be configured to utilize source content from any suitable source(s). For example, source content may be sourced from local memory of a device processing the source content to form modified content , a local content storage medium (e.g., disk, flash drive, and the like) local to a device processing the source content to form modified content , an information stream being received by a device processing the source content to form modified content (e.g., data stream, audio stream, and the like), and the like.","In one embodiment, source content and modified content may be of the same content type (e.g., where text-based source content is modified to produce text-based modified content , where audio-based source content is modified to produce audio-based modified content , and the like).","In one embodiment, source content and modified content may be of different content types. In one embodiment, for example, where text-based source content is modified by content modification module  to form text-based modified content , the text-based modified content may then be converted from text to audio for presentation to the end user in audio format (e.g., using a text-to-audio conversion mechanism).","In one embodiment, for example, where audio-based source content is modified by content modification module  to form audio-based modified content , the audio-based modified content may then be converted from audio to text for presentation to the end user in text format (e.g., using an audio-to-text conversion mechanism). It is noted that other types of content conversions may be used. It is further noted that although primarily described with respect to embodiments in which content conversion is performed after the source content is processed to form the modified content , content conversion may be performed prior to processing of the source content to form the modified content .","The content modification module  may be configured to activate and deactivate contextual language learning in any suitable manner. In one embodiment, for example, contextual language learning may be activated or deactivated manually by an end user. In one embodiment, for example, contextual language learning may be activated automatically (e.g., in response to invocation of a program, in response to detection that a particular type of content is received or requested, and the like, or in response to any other suitable condition or trigger). The use of contextual language learning may be manually or automatically activated\/deactivated in various contexts, e.g., contextual language learning may be activated\/deactivated on a per content item basis (e.g., for some or all of the content items within one or more programs via which contextual learning may be provided), on a per program basis (e.g., for all emails opened via an email reader for which contextual language learning is provided, for all web pages accessed via a browser for which contextual language learning is provided, and the like), for some or all of the programs used by the end user, on a per information stream basis (e.g., for some or all of the information streams accessed by the end user), and the like, as well as combinations thereof.","The content modification module  may be configured to control at least one characteristic of the subset of the words in the first language that are replaced with corresponding words in the second language. For example, the least one characteristic may include a percentage of content replaced, a scope of content replaced (e.g., words only, sentences only, words and sentences, and the like), a type of content replaced (e.g., nouns only, pronouns only, verbs only, nouns and verbs, and the like), a vocabulary difficulty of content replaced, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof.","The content modification module  may be configured to control modification of source content to form modified content in any suitable manner. It is noted that control of modification of source content to form modified content may include control over selection of the portion(s) of source content in the first language to be replaced with content in the second language to form thereby the modified content (i.e., processing of the source content to form modified content may include selection of the subset of source content in the first language that is to be replaced with corresponding content in the second language).","In one embodiment, for example, at least a portion of source content which is modified to form modified content may be selected based on content replacement control information. In one embodiment, for example, content replacement control information may include one of more of: one or more content replacement parameters, indications of user proficiency with respect to the target language, user feedback information (e.g., offline and\/or real time), language-specific control information, dynamic analysis, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof.","In one embodiment, for example, at least a portion of source content which is modified to form modified content may be selected according to one or more content replacement parameters. The content replacement parameter(s) may be configured to control various aspects of content replacement, such as one or more of the percentage of content replaced (e.g., 5%, 20%, and the like), the scope of content replaced (e.g., words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and the like), the type of content replaced, the difficulty of the vocabulary of content replaced, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof.","In one embodiment, for example, a content replacement percentage parameter is configured to control the percentage of content of the source language that is replaced by corresponding content of the target language. For example, the content replacement percentage may specify a percentage of words to be replaced. For example, the content replacement percentage may specify a percentage of sentences to be replaced (e.g., where content replacement is performed at the sentence level). It is noted that the content replacement percentage parameter may support any suitable number and\/or types of values. For example, the content replacement percentage parameter may be configurable in 5% increments, 10% increments, or at any other suitable granularity, although any other suitable types and\/or numbers of values may be used.","In one embodiment, for example, a content replacement scope parameter is configured to control the scope of content of the source language that is replaced by corresponding content of the target language. For example, the content replacement scope parameter may be configured to specify replacement of individual words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, a mix of one or more scopes, and the like. It is noted that the content replacement scope parameter may support any suitable number and\/or types of values. For example, the content replacement percentage parameter may be set to values of \u201cwords\u201d, \u201cphrases\u201d, \u201csentences\u201d, \u201cparagraphs\u201d, and the like, although any other suitable types and\/or numbers of values may be used.","In one embodiment, for example, a content replacement type parameter is configured to control the type of content of the source language that is replaced by corresponding content of the target language. For example, where the content replacement scope parameter is set to \u201cwords\u201d, the content replacement type parameter may be configured to specify replacement of only nouns, only verbs, only subjects, nouns and verbs, subjects and nouns, verbs and adjectives, and the like. For example, where the content replacement scope parameter is set to \u201csentences\u201d, the content replacement type parameter may be configured to specify replacement of sentences other than the first sentence of any paragraph. It is noted that the content replacement type parameter may support any suitable number and\/or types of values. For example, the content replacement type parameter may be set to values of \u201cnouns\u201d, \u201cverbs\u201d, \u201cnouns\/verbs\u201d, \u201cverbs\/adjectives\u201d, and the like, although any other suitable types and\/or numbers of values may be used.","In one embodiment, for example, a vocabulary difficulty parameter is configured to control the difficulty level of words\/phrases the source language that are replaced by corresponding words\/phrases of the target language. It is noted that the value specified for the vocabulary difficulty parameter may be indicative of the highest difficulty of words for which replacement is performed (e.g., selection of a \u201cmedium\u201d level results in replacement of words classified as \u201ceasy\u201d and\/or \u201cmedium\u201d). It is noted that the vocabulary difficulty parameter may support any suitable number and\/or types of values. For example, the vocabulary difficulty parameter may be set to values of \u201ceasy\u201d, \u201cmedium\u201d, \u201cdifficult\u201d, and the like, although any other suitable types and\/or numbers of values may be used.","Although primarily depicted and described with respect to use of specific content replacement parameters to control content replacement, it is noted that various other content replacement parameters may be used to control content replacement (e.g., fewer parameters, more parameters, different sets of parameters, parameters defined in other ways, and the like).","Although primarily depicted and described with respect to use of specific numbers and types of values of the content replacement parameters to control replacement, it is noted that various other numbers and\/or types of values of the content replacement parameters may be used to control content replacement.","The content replacement parameters may be determined in any suitable manner. For example, content replacement parameters may be specified within one or more programs executed to provide functions of the contextual language learning capability, retrieved from memory, determined based on user input (e.g., values set in advance, values set and\/or changed on the fly, and the like), determined from a user profile of the associated end user (e.g., stored locally on an end user device processing the source content to form modified content , hosted on a network device for use by the network device where the network device is processing the source content to form modified content and\/or for use by an end user device where the end user device is processing the source content to form modified content , and the like), and the like, as well as various combinations thereof.","The content replacement parameters may be adjusted in any suitable manner. For example, content replacement parameters may be adjusted manually (e.g., in response to end user input, such as specific requests to modify values of parameters, feedback regarding the language learning of the end user, and the like). For example, one or more of the content replacement parameters may be adjusted automatically in response to one or more triggers or conditions (e.g., based on the type of activity that is being performed by the end user, in response to an indication of a certain level of and\/or change in proficiency of an end user with respect to the target language, and the like).","In one embodiment, one or more of the content replacement parameters may be directly controllable by the end user. For example, an end user may specify one or more of a value of the content replacement percentage parameter, a value of the content replacement scope parameter, a value of the content replacement type parameter, a value of the vocabulary difficulty parameter, and the like.","In one embodiment, one or more of the content replacement parameters may be indirectly controllable by the end user using one or more user-controllable parameters. In one such embodiment, setting of the value(s) for the user-controllable parameter(s) may result in setting of appropriate values of the underlying content replacement parameters which are used to control content replacement. It is noted that the user-controllable parameter(s) may support any suitable number(s) and\/or type(s) of values which may be specified by the end user.","In one embodiment, for example, a user-controllable difficulty level parameter may be supported, whereby the end user may specify a difficulty level for use of the contextual language learning capability which results in setting of appropriate values of one or more of the content replacement parameters. The user-controllable difficulty level parameter may support any suitable numbers and\/or types of values.","For example, levels of \u201ceasy\u201d, \u201cmedium\u201d, \u201cdifficult\u201d, and \u201cexpert\u201d may be supported. In this case, for example, selection of \u201ceasy\u201d may result in setting of the content replacement parameters as follows: the content replacement percentage parameter is set to 10%, the content replacement scope parameter is set to \u201cwords\u201d, the content replacement type parameter is set to \u201cnouns\/subjects\u201d, and the vocabulary difficulty parameter is set to \u201ceasy\u201d. In this case, for example, selection of \u201cdifficult\u201d may result in setting of the content replacement parameters as follows: the content replacement percentage parameter is set to 50%, the content replacement scope parameter is set to \u201cwords\/sentences\u201d, the content replacement type parameter is set to \u201cnouns\/subjects\/verbs\u201d, and the vocabulary difficulty parameter is set to \u201cmedium\u201d.","For example, ten levels numbered one (easiest) through ten (most difficult) may be supported. In this case, for example, selection of level \u201cthree\u201d may result in setting of the content replacement parameters as follows: the content replacement percentage parameter is set to 15%, the content replacement scope parameter is set to \u201cwords\/phrases\u201d, the content replacement type parameter is set to \u201cnouns\/\/verbs\/subjects\u201d, and the vocabulary difficulty parameter is set to \u201cmedium\u201d. In this case, for example, selection of level \u201ceight\u201d may result in setting of the content replacement parameters as follows: the content replacement percentage parameter is set to 60%, the content replacement scope parameter is set to \u201csentences\u201d, the content replacement type parameter is set to \u201call\u201d (given that replacement is performed at the sentence level), and the vocabulary difficulty parameter is set to \u201cdifficult\u201d.","It is noted that the user-controllable difficulty level parameter may be specified using any other suitable number and\/or type of values.","It is further noted that the user-controllable difficulty level parameter is merely one example of a type of user-controllable parameter which may be employed for providing the end-user with control over various aspects of the contextual language learning capability.","Although primarily depicted and described with respect to use of a single user-controllable parameter to control all of the content replacement parameters, it is noted that one or more user-controllable parameters may be used to control one or more of the content replacement parameters.","In one embodiment, for example, at least a portion of source content which is modified to form modified content may be selected randomly. For example, where a content replacement percentage specifies a certain percentage of the source content which is to be replaced, the words of the source content may be selected randomly (e.g., rather than based on one or more other content replacement parameters such as the scope of content replaced, the type of content replaced, the difficulty of the vocabulary of content replaced, and the like.","The content modification module  may be configured to perform content replacement, in order to replace a portion of the content provided in the source language with corresponding content of the target language, in any suitable manner. For example, content modification module  may be configured to use one or more language translation lists (e.g., lists of words and\/or phrases in two or more languages for enabling translation between the two or more languages) for translating portions of the source content from the source language to the target language. For example, content modification module  may be configured to process the source content using a machine-based language translation tool for translating portions of the source content from the source language to the target language. The modification of portions of source content from the source language to the target language to form modified content may be performed using any other suitable language translation tools and\/or capabilities.","The content modification module  may be configured to adjust content replacement, for replacing a portion of the content provided in the source language with corresponding content of the target language, in any suitable manner. In one embodiment, for example, one or more aspects of replacement of content in the source language with corresponding content in the target language may be adjusted according to at least one input (e.g., in response to an indication of a proficiency of an end user with respect to the target language, in response to an indication of an input entered by an end user, and the like). For example, parameters such as the percentage of words replaced, the difficulty of the vocabulary of the words replaced, and the like may be adjusted based on such input information. In this manner, the overall difficulty of the language learning process may be smoothly adjusted according to the level of proficiency and\/or desires of the language learner.","The content modification module  may be configured to support handling of the modified content in any suitable manner. For example, the modified content may be stored (e.g., locally at a device at which the modified content modified content is formed and\/or remotely at one or more devices remote from the device at which the modified content modified content is formed), presented to one or more users (e.g., via one or more display devices in the case of text-based content, via one or more speakers in the case of audio-based content, and the like), transmitted to one or more devices (e.g., for one or more of storage, presentation, and the like), and the like, as well as various combinations thereof.","Although primarily depicted and described herein with respect to embodiments in which certain features of the contextual language learning capability  are independent of the source and the target languages (e.g., the percentage of content replaced, the type of content replaced, and the like), it is noted that, in one or more embodiments, one or more features of the contextual language learning capability  may be dependent on the source language and\/or the target language.","The content modification module  may be configured to configure one or more characteristics of contextual language learning on a per-language basis (e.g., based on the source language and\/or based on the target language for which the contextual language learning capability  is employed) and\/or on a per-language pair basis (e.g., based on the specific combination of source language\/target language for which the contextual language learning capability  is employed). It is noted that such configuration may be performed in advance and\/or on-the-fly.","In one embodiment, for a given language, one or more characteristics of the contextual language learning may be configured based on one or more language characteristics of the underlying language.","In one embodiment, for a given source language, one or more characteristics of contextual language learning may be configured based on knowledge regarding the manner in which the source language is or may be used as a source language for teaching\/learning another language. It is noted that the manner in which one language is typically used as a basis for language teaching\/learning may be different than the manner in which another language is typically used as a basis for language teaching\/learning. This may be due to various factors, such as one or more characteristics of the languages, existing knowledge regarding the optimum ways to teach\/learn the languages, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof. For example, the type(s)\/set(s) of core words first targeted for teaching\/learning in a first language may be different than the type(s)\/set(s) of core words first targeted for teaching\/learning in a second language. Similarly, for example, type(s)\/set(s) of secondary words targeted for teaching\/learning in a first language (which build upon the core words first taught\/learned in the first language) may be different than the type(s)\/set(s) of secondary words targeted for teaching\/learning in a second language (which, again, build upon the core words first taught\/learned in the first language). It is noted that various other aspects of language teaching\/learning may be different for different languages.","In one embodiment, for a given target language, one or more characteristics of contextual language learning may be configured based on knowledge regarding the manner in which the target language is or may be taught\/learned. It is noted that the manner in which one language is typically taught\/learned may be different than the manner in which another language is typically taught\/learned. This may be due to various factors, such as one or more characteristics of the languages, existing knowledge regarding the optimum ways to teach\/learn the languages, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof. For example, the type(s)\/set(s) of core words first taught\/learned in a first language may be different than the type(s)\/set(s) of core words first taught\/learned in a second language. Similarly, for example, type(s)\/set(s) of secondary words in a first language (which build upon the core words first taught\/learned in the first language) may be different than the type(s)\/set(s) of secondary words first taught\/learned in a second language (which, again, build upon the core words first taught\/learned in the first language). It is noted that various other aspects of language teaching\/learning may be different for different languages.","In such embodiments, it is noted these differences between languages and\/or language pairs may be evident from existing sources of knowledge regarding language teaching\/learning, such as language teaching\/learning textbooks, existing language teaching\/learning programs, existing language teaching\/learning research, and the like. In at least some such embodiments, this knowledge regarding language teaching\/learning may be leveraged to configure various aspects of contextual language learning provided by the content modification module .","In one embodiment, for example, configuration of one or more characteristics of contextual language learning for different languages and\/or language pairs may include use of different parameters and\/or different parameters values of the content replacement parameters for different languages and\/or language pairs.","In one embodiment, for example, configuration of one or more characteristics of contextual language learning for different languages and\/or language pairs may include use of different content translation mechanisms (e.g., use of different source content types, use of different translation techniques (e.g., word translation lists versus machine-based language translation tools), and the like, as well as various combinations thereof) for different languages and\/or language pairs.","It is noted that various other characteristics of contextual language learning may be controlled for different languages and\/or language pairs on the basis of various other types of language characteristics, various other types of language teaching\/learning knowledge, other types of information, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof.","It is noted that, where characteristics of contextual language learning are controlled for different languages and\/or language pairs on the basis of such information (e.g., language characteristics, language teaching\/learning knowledge, other types of information, and the like), this information used to control characteristics of contextual language learning also may be referred to herein as language-specific control information.","As described herein, contextual language learning capability  is configured to use a content modification module  to process source content to form thereby modified content . Accordingly, it will be appreciated that various functions attributed herein to contextual language learning capability  may be provided by content modification module  and, similarly, that the content modification module  may be implemented in any manner suitable for providing such functions. For example, the content modification module  may be provided using hardware or a combination of hardware and software. For example, content modification module  may include a processor and a memory, where the memory stores instructions which, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform such functions of the contextual language learning capability . For example, content modification module  may represent a software program(s) which may be stored in memory and which, when executed by a processor(s), cause the processor to perform such functions of contextual language learning capability . For example, the content modification module  may represent hardware, alone or in combination with associated software, configured to perform such functions of contextual language learning capability . The implementation of content modification module  may be better understood by way of reference to  and .","As described herein, the contextual language learning capability  may be supported within various types of environments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"As depicted in , environment  includes a user interface  and a controller  in communication via a communication path .","The user interface  includes a presentation interface  and a control interface .","The presentation interface  is configured to present content, such as one or more of text-based content, audio-based content, video-based content, multimedia content, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof. The presentation interface  is configured to present modified content generated via content replacement performed using the contextual language learning. The presentation interface  also may be configured to present other types of content.","The control interface  is configured to accept user input of an end user. The control interface  is configured to accept user input in various formats (e.g., via a keyboard, via point-and-click operations using a mouse, via a keypad, via buttons, via a microphone, and the like). The control interface  is configured to accept various types of user input within the context of contextual language learning. For example, the user input may include user input via which the user may request activation of the contextual language learning capability, configure various aspects of the contextual language learning capability, interact with the contextual language learning capability (e.g., selecting a difficulty level to be used, selecting content presented in a target language for accessing the corresponding content in the source language, and the like), request deactivation of the contextual language learning capability, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof.","The controller  includes a processor , an input-output interface , a memory , and support circuits .","The processor  is configured to communicate with each of the input-output interface , the memory , and the support circuits .
