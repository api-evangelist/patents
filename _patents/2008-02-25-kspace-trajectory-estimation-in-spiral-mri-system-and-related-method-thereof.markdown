title: K-space trajectory estimation in spiral MRI system and related method thereof
abstract: First, benchmark data are collected on two thin slices of an object to get measured k-space trajectories. To find delays on different physical gradients, the root mean square error between estimated and measured k-space trajectories is minimized for different delays. To reduce the error further, an eddy current compensation is introduced along each physical gradient axis. A more accurate estimation of the k-space trajectory can be obtained to image the object.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/903,143, filed Feb. 23, 2007, whose disclosure is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into the present disclosure.","The work leading to the present invention was supported by NIH Grant No. R01 HL079110. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention is directed to magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and more specifically to k-space trajectory estimation using an anisotropic gradient delay model.","For non-2DFT data acquisition in MRI, k-space trajectory infidelity due to eddy current effects and other hardware imperfections will blur and distort the reconstructed images. Even with the shielded gradients and eddy current compensation techniques of current scanners, the deviation between the actual k-space trajectory and the requested trajectory remains a major reason for image artifacts in non-Cartesian MRI. Techniques have been proposed to measure the k-space trajectory in order to correct for gradient imperfections. However, it is usually not practical to measure the k-space trajectory for each imaging slice.","In MR data acquisition, eddy currents introduced by gradient coils produce an additional field that tends to prevent the gradient field from changing. To reduce the eddy current effect, manufacturers have active shielding and pre-emphasis filters in current scanners to eliminate most of the errors. However, the residual error can still cause severe image artifacts, especially in non-Cartesian scanning such as radial and spiral imaging. Eddy currents are typically classified as Beddy currents or linear eddy currents based on their spatial dependence. Beddy currents cause unwanted phase modulation, while linear eddy currents distort the k-space trajectory. There are many ways to measure the linear term, including using the phase difference of two measurements, measuring the current through the gradient coil directly, and using a special phantom to measure the k-space trajectory. Aside from uncompensated eddy current effects leading to distortions of the gradient waveform shape, another significant problem is small timing delay errors arising in the hardware. These anisotropic timing delays exist between the application of a gradient waveform to the gradient amplifiers and the subsequent response of the gradient coils. There are also frequency demodulation delays.","Here we introduce a simple and effective model to estimate the k-space trajectory in spiral image reconstruction with the measured k-space trajectory as the goal. The root mean square error (RMSE) and peak error in phantom images reconstructed using the proposed method are reduced substantially compared to the results achieved by only tuning delays.","In order to get better-quality reconstructions in spiral MRI, we introduce a k-space trajectory estimation method based on an anisotropic gradient delay model with additional eddy current compensation. The phantom images reconstructed using this method in two datasets collected 48 days apart have a much smaller RMSE and peak error compared with the results using delay only model.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be set forth in detail with reference to the drawings.","First, we collect data on two thin slices offset symmetrically around isocenter for coronal, sagittal and transverse views. The Beddy currents are then measured using the method proposed by Gurney et al. [P. Gurney, J. Pauly, D. G. Nishimura, \u201ca simple method for measuring B0 eddy currents\u201d, Proc. ISMRM, 13: 866 (2005)] and deducted from the corresponding phase term. Dividing the corrected signal phase by the slice distance, we get the measured k-space trajectories Kin each view for calibration purposes. Dividing the corrected signal phase by the slice distance, we get the actual k-space trajectories Kon each physical gradient axis in each view as follows for calibration purposes:\n\n=[()()\u2212())\u2212(()\u2212())]\/(4)\n","where P( ) are the phase terms in two symmetrical slices; g are the gradient waveform to be tested and its inverted version; D is the distance between the offset slice and isocenter. Using these measured k-space trajectories, we perform gridding reconstruction to get the benchmark images. A second dataset on some oblique slices was collected after 48 days in order to test the proposed method.","To find the delays on different physical gradients, we conduct a 2D search for the minimum RMSE between the images reconstructed using different delays and the benchmark for each view. With the optimum delays on each physical gradient axis, we have the first guess of the k-space trajectory K. For an arbitrary imaging slice, we can compensate the isotropic delay with the knowledge of the rotation matrix (similar to the equations in Peters D C, Derbyshire J A, McVeigh E R. \u201cCentering the projection reconstruction trajectory: reducing gradient delay errors.\u201d Magn Reson Med, 50: 1-6. (2003)) as the following.\n\n()\u2003\u2003(1)\n","where Gis the final logical gradients for image reconstruction program to calculate the k-space trajectory. R is the rotation matrix transforms a logical gradients vector into a physical gradient vector. T is the delay operator that applies different delays on each physical gradient axis. G=[ggg] is the physical gradient vector associated with the requested logical gradient vector G=[ggg], i.e. G=RG. With the delayed logical gradient vector G, we can integrate it on each axis to get the k-space trajectory K.","However, the k-space trajectory difference \u0394K=K\u2212Kis still large and the images using this delay model have significant residual error. In order to reduce the deviation between the modeled k-space trajectory and the actual measured k-space trajectory, we introduce an additional eddy current compensation term on each physical gradient axis. In a simple eddy current model, the eddy current g(t) can be estimated by the convolution of the slew rate s(t)=\u2212dG\/dt of the desired gradient waveform and the system impulse response function H(t) as the following.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"H","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"mrow":[{"mi":"u","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"n"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["a","n"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"exp","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"t"},"mo":"\/","msub":{"mi":["b","n"]}}}}}}],"mo":"\u2062"}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}}},"where u(t) is the unit step function.

Then we can get a vector a=[a1\/bc\/b] by using weighted least squares (WLS) to fit the k-space difference \u0394K to Kon each physical gradient axis, where c is a constant related to the sampling time. In fact, you can also fit the derivative of \u0394K to Gif you are more interested in the actual gradients. It is also interesting to note that we have many choices here to use the fitting result for future calibration. The first choice would be to use an impulse function H(t) with only one exponential term, ignoring any additional exponential terms. The second choice would be to combine the last two parameters together, since they are only different by a constant scale. The last option is to use is the full correction to give the system more freedom. Though the last two methods should lead to the same result theoretically, it turned out they do not because of noise. So we chose the last one here for simplicity though we might return to the first one with a different fitting target function in the future. Thus no matter how many exponential terms are in H(t), we should be able to get rid of the first order eddy current effect by applying these parameters on each physical axis.

Usually, one can calibrate once for a given scanner, and the object in the scanner at the time of the calibration is a phantom (e.g., a bottle of water). A person could be used as well. Then the model is calculated, and the parameters are stored. The model is then applied each time the scanner is used for imaging subsequently.","In , step , calibration data are taken on coronal, sagittal, and transverse views.

The readout for each slice was done with 16 interleaved spirals each of 16.38 ms readout duration. The samples within the first two interleaves of the readouts were used to estimate the field map.
