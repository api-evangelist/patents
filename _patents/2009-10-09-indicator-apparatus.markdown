A light source is disposed behind the button frame. Operational states of the button are made known to a user by the light source being switched on or off (see Patent Literature 1, for example).","In conventional indicators that are disposed on door panels of VTR devices, a metal coating is applied to a surface of a light-transmitting member by sputtering in order to impart a sense of integration with the door panel (see Patent Literature 2, for example).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":"[Patent Literature 1]"}},"Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-53274 (Gazette)\n\n","Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. HEI 5-273928 (Gazette)","In conventional elevator operating panels such as those described above, the button frame is illuminated when the light source is lit, but the outward appearance of the button frame itself is visible when the light source is not lit, reducing decorative design. In answer to that, methods in which a metal coating is formed on the surface of the button frame are also conceivable, but in that case manufacturing costs are increased. Particularly with parts that are relatively large in size such as parts that are used in elevator operating panels, the number of parts that can be accommodated simultaneously inside a vacuum chamber is small, making manufacturing efficiency low and costs high. If a metal coating is applied, it is also necessary to apply a protective film so as to not to be peeled off even if handled directly. In addition, decorative design freedom is low if a metallic luster is simply imparted to the surface of the light-transmitting member.","The present invention aims to solve the above problems and an object of the present invention is to provide an indicator apparatus that can improve decorative design and decorative design freedom at reduced cost.","In order to achieve the above object, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an indicator apparatus including: a light source; a prism member including: a prism member side surface; and a transmitting and reflecting surface that is inclined relative to the prism member side surface, and into which light is admitted from the light source, the prism member transmitting the light from the light source; and an adjacent member that has an adjacent surface that is adjacent to the prism member side surface, wherein the adjacent surface is visible due to optical reflection at the transmitting and reflecting surface if the prism member is viewed frontally when the light source is lit.","In an indicator apparatus according to the present invention, since light passes through the prism member making the prism member appear to shine when the light source is lit, and the decorative design of the adjacent surface is visible in the prism member when the light source is not lit, the decorative design of the prism member when the light source is not lit can be made similar to the material, color, pattern, etc., of the adjacent surface, enabling decorative design and decorative design freedom to be improved at reduced cost.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the drawings.","Embodiment 1",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","1","2","1","3","1"],"i":["a ","a"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["2","5","1","5","1","6","5","7","6","7","2","6"]},"The operating button  is able to reciprocate toward and away from the button unit . A push-button switch apparatus is constituted by the operating button , the button unit , and the switch portion. On pressing and operating the operating button , a destination floor is registered in an elevator controlling apparatus (not shown), and the light sources  of the push-button switch apparatus that is operated are lit.","The operating button  has: a plunger ; a button cap  that is fixed to the plunger ; and a button cover  that is placed over a surface of the button cap . The button cover  is made of a metal material that is identical or similar to that of the surface plate . In other words, a front surface of the surface plate  and a front surface of the operating button  are made of an identical or similar metal material.","The plunger  and the button cap  are made of a material that transmits light, such as a transparent or opalescent resin, for example. An aperture that is shaped like a floor number is disposed on the button cover . Thus, when the light sources  are lit, light passes through this aperture in the button cover , and the floor number appears to shine.","A ring-shaped prism member (a button frame)  is disposed between an inner peripheral surface of the button aperture and an outer peripheral surface of the operating button . In Embodiment 1, the surface plate  is a first adjacent member that is adjacent to a first side of the prism member , and the operating button  is a second adjacent member that is adjacent to a second side of the prism member .","The prism member  is made of a transparent resin. The light sources  are disposed behind the prism member  so as to be uniformly spaced apart from each other in a circumferential direction.

When the light sources  are lit, the perimeter of the operating button  shines in a ring shape due to the light that is admitted through the transmitting and reflecting surface passing through the prism member .","The prism member side surface is adjacent to and faces an outer peripheral surface of the button cover . In other words, the outer peripheral surface is an adjacent surface that is adjacent to the prism member side surface . The outer peripheral surface is made of a metal material that is identical or similar to that of the front surface of the surface plate  and the front surface of the operating button .","When the light sources  are not lit, the outer peripheral surface that is optically reflected by the transmitting and reflecting surface is visible on the prism member front surface . In other words, if the prism member  is viewed frontally when the light sources  are not lit, the outer peripheral surface is visible by optical reflection at the transmitting and reflecting surface ","In an elevator operating panel of this kind, because decorative design of the prism member  can be made similar to the outer peripheral surface when the light sources  are not lit while maintaining a function of making the perimeter of the operating button  shine when the light sources  are lit, decorative design and decorative design freedom can be improved using a simple construction.","Costs of the prism member  can be reduced compared to when a metal coating (a half mirror coating, etc.) is formed on the prism member front surface . In addition, if a metal coating is formed, it is also necessary to form a protective film to prevent peeling if handled directly, but in the prism member  according to Embodiment 1, deterioration can be prevented even if a protective film is not disposed.","Because the front surface of the surface plate , the front surface of the operating button , and the outer peripheral surface are made of identical or similar materials, a sense of design uniformity can be imparted to the entire operating panel, enabling decorative design to be improved. In addition to using identical or similar materials, decorative design can also be further improved by applying identical or similar surface machining (such as hairlining or figuring), for example.","Embodiment 2","Next,  is a partial cross section of an elevator operating panel according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention.

In other words, a thickness between a prism member front surface and the transmitting and reflecting surface is thinner, and the angle of inclination \u03b81 of the transmitting and reflecting surface is greater on a side where the transmitting and reflecting surface and the prism member front surface are closer to being parallel to each other. The rest of the configuration is identical or similar to that of Embodiment 6.","Using a configuration of this kind, the connecting portion can also be hidden when the light sources  are not lit even if the thickness of the connecting portion is somewhat thicker, enabling decorative design to be further improved.","Embodiment 8","Next,  is a partial cross section of an elevator operating panel according to Embodiment 8 of the present invention.

By curving the cross sections of the prism member front surface and the transmitting and reflecting surface , the adjacent surface can be made to look larger or smaller as required, thereby also enabling decorative design freedom to be improved.","Embodiment 9","Next,  is a front elevation that shows an operating button of an elevator operating panel according to Embodiment 9 of the present invention, and  is a cross section that is taken along line XIII-XIII in . In Embodiment 9, a rectangular operating button  is used. A bar-shaped prism member  is disposed between a lower side of a portion of the operating button  that is inserted into a button aperture and an edge portion of the button aperture . The prism member  is made of a transparent resin.","The prism member  has: a prism member side surface that is an upper surface; a transmitting and reflecting surface that is inclined relative to the prism member side surface , and into which light from light sources  is admitted; a fixed portion that is fixed to a back surface of the surface plate ; and a prism member front surface that is a decorative design surface that is exposed outside the operating panel.","The prism member front surface is parallel to the front surface of the surface plate  and the front surface of the operating button . The prism member side surface is perpendicular to the prism member front surface . The fixed portion is fixed to an edge portion of the button aperture . The fixed portion may be disposed so as to be continuous along an entire length of the prism member  or may also be disposed only on a portion thereof.","The transmitting and reflecting surface is inclined at a predetermined angle relative to an optical axis direction of the light sources  that are disposed directly below. When the light sources  are lit, a lower portion of the operating button  shines due to the light that is admitted through the transmitting and reflecting surface passing through the prism member .","The prism member side surface is adjacent to and faces an outer peripheral surface of a button cover .

Letters are applied to the outer peripheral surface by printing or engraving, etc. In this case, information that relates to a building floor, \u201cRESTAURANT\u201d, for example, is printed as characters that are applied to the outer peripheral surface ","When the light sources  are not lit, the outer peripheral surface that is optically reflected by the transmitting and reflecting surface is visible on the prism member front surface . In other words, if the prism member  is viewed frontally when the light sources  are not lit, the outer peripheral surface is visible by optical reflection at the transmitting and reflecting surface . Because of this, the characters \u201cRESTAURANT\u201d are also visible on the prism member front surface when the light sources  are not lit.","By reflecting and displaying on the prism member front surface characters that are applied to the outer peripheral surface in this manner, it is no longer necessary to dispose the characters on the prism member  itself, enabling decorative design when the light sources  are lit to be improved. Since users do not touch the characters directly, the characters can be prevented from peeling off or fading, enabling decorative design to be maintained for a long period.","Moreover, tenant names, for example, may also be printed as the information that relates to the building floors.","The outer peripheral surface may also be colored, or a colored pattern or a pattern using machining (hairlining, etc.) applied, either instead of the characters or in addition to the characters, and that color or pattern can be shown when the light sources  are not lit, enabling decorative design freedom to be improved.","Now, in Embodiment 1, a sense of design uniformity was imparted by making the material of the outer peripheral surface identical or similar to that of the front surface of the surface plate  and the front surface of the operating button , but the visibility of the operating button  can also conversely be increased by making the material or decorative design of the adjacent surface different than that of the front surface of the surface plate  and the front surface of the operating button .","In addition, Embodiments 1 through 9 may also be implemented in combination with each other as required. For example, in Embodiments 1 through 8, characters, color, pattern, etc., may also be applied to the adjacent surface. In other words, a decorative design that is different than that of the front surface of the adjacent member may also be disposed on the adjacent surface. The prism member front surface and the transmitting and reflecting surface according to Embodiment 9 may also be curved.","The prism members  through  according to Embodiments 1 through 8 may also be disposed only on a portion of the outer perimeter of the operating button , or may also be divided circumferentially.","The prism member  according to Embodiment 9 may also be disposed around the entire perimeter of the operating button , or may also be disposed on another side thereof.","Embodiment 10","Next,  is a partial cross section of an elevator operating panel according to Embodiment 10 of the present invention. In this example, light sources  are not disposed directly below a prism member , but light from the light sources  is reflected by a reflector  that constitutes a light-directing member on a base plate , and is directed to the prism member . The rest of the configuration is identical or similar to that of Embodiment 1.","Using a configuration of this kind, disposing light sources  directly below the prism member  can be dispensed with, enabling costs to be reduced by reducing the number of light sources .","Moreover, the light-directing member is not limited to the reflector , and may also be a member that diffuses light passing through internally.","A light-directing member such as that shown in Embodiment 10 may also be applied to the configurations of Embodiments 2 through 8.","Embodiment 11","Next,  is a perspective that shows an indicator apparatus according to Embodiment 11 of the present invention.

In other words, if the prism member  is viewed frontally when the light sources  are not lit, the inner peripheral surface is visible by optical reflection at the transmitting and reflecting surface ","In an indicator apparatus of this kind, because decorative design of the prism member  can be made similar to the inner peripheral surface of the salient portion when the light sources  are not lit while maintaining a function of making the prism member  shine when the light sources  are lit, decorative design and decorative design freedom can be improved using a simple construction.","Costs of the prism member  can be reduced compared to when a metal coating (a half mirror coating, etc.) is formed on the prism member front surface . In addition, if a metal coating is formed, it is also necessary to form a protective film to prevent peeling if contacted by a hand or a key, but in the prism member  according to Embodiment 13 deterioration can be prevented even if a protective film is not disposed.","Because the front surface of the surface plate  and the inner peripheral surface of the salient portion are made of identical or similar materials, a sense of design uniformity can be imparted to the entire indicator apparatus, enabling decorative design to be improved.","Moreover, in Embodiment 13, the prism member  is disposed so as to surround the key cylinder , but may also be disposed on only a portion of the perimeter of the key cylinder .","A plurality of prism members may also be disposed so as to be spaced apart from each other around the entire perimeter or on a portion of the perimeter of the key cylinder .","In addition, configurations such as those shown in Embodiments 3 through 10 may also be combined with the type of keyhole indicator apparatus that is shown in Embodiment 13. For example, the prism member front surface may also be curved into a circular arc shape. Letters, color, pattern, etc., may also be applied to the inner peripheral surface of the salient portion . In other words, a decorative design that is different than that of the front surface of the surface plate  may also be disposed on the inner peripheral surface . In addition, the adjacent surface may also be disposed on a side of the key cylinder , or adjacent surfaces may also be disposed on both the surface plate  and the key cylinder .","Furthermore, a keyhole indicator apparatus that is mounted to an automobile is merely an example, and the present invention can be applied to keyhole indicator apparatuses on any type of equipment or building.","In Embodiments 1 through 13, abrasive blasting may also be applied to the prism member front surface. In that case, light can be shone uniformly when the light sources are lit, and the decorative design when the light sources are not lit can also be improved.","In addition, in Embodiments 1 through 13, the material of the prism member is not limited to a resin, and may also be glass, for example.","Furthermore, in Embodiments 1 through 13, the adjacent member may also be a film or a sheet that is bonded to the prism member side surface.","Here, because the adjacent surface is totally reflected on emission from the prism member if set to greater than a critical angle \u03b8c, it is preferable to set the angle of inclination \u03b81 of the transmitting and reflecting surface (see ) according to the following expression. Here, n is an index of refraction specific to the material of the prism member, e.g. approximately 1.49 for an acrylic, and approximately 1.58 for a polycarbonate.\n\n\u03b81>\u03b8=sin(1)\n","If the prism member is made of an acrylic, light is totally reflected at greater than or equal to an angle of incidence of 42.2 degrees, and if made of a polycarbonate, light is totally reflected at greater than or equal to an angle of incidence of 39.9 degrees. Because of this, it is preferable to set the angle of inclination \u03b81 of the transmitting and reflecting surface to greater than 42.2 degrees for an acrylic, and greater than 39.9 degrees for a polycarbonate."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 17"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 19"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
