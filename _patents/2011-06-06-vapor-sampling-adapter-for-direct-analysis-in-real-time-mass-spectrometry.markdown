title: Vapor sampling adapter for direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry
abstract: A vapor sampling adapter for direct analysis in real time mass spectrometer (DART-MS) applications comprises a vapor transport line and a manifold. In the preferred embodiment the vapor transport line is heated and approximately 20 feet in length. This provides a means to utilize the highly accurate and reliable DART-MS device to detect chemical agents at sample location points up to 20 feet away from the device with the ability to easily move the sampling point to any desired point within the sampling range, thus allowing the operator to systematically scan a site in a fashion similar to that used with a handheld detector. Sample vapor flows through the vapor transport line to the manifold where it comes in proximity to the ion generator of the DART mass spectrometer before entering into the mass spectrometer for analysis. The present invention may be used to raster a surface to determine the precise location of chemical agent contamination. Additionally, the invention may be used to tune or calibrate a DART-MS.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.","This invention relates generally to the field of analytical chemistry. More particularly, the invention relates to the field of mass spectrometry using direct analysis in real time.","Given the need to assess, decontaminate, and verify decontamination of a facility for reoccupation after possible chemical agent contamination, various techniques and instruments have been developed for use by the personnel who perform this hazardous work. When performing such tasks in a contaminated or potentially contaminated environment, specially trained workers must wear cumbersome personal protective equipment (PPE). The PPE typically includes a chemical agent resistant hooded garment with gloves, boots, and respirator equipment. Handheld chemical agent detectors, sampling kits, and decontamination kits are commercially available and used in these applications. However, the accuracy and reliability of such handheld chemical agent detectors are compromised to some extent in order to achieve the size restrictions needed for portability. Accordingly, it is standard practice to hand gather a larger number of samples for subsequent analysis. A large number of samples are gathered because the exact location of contamination is generally unknown. Follow-on analysis is then typically performed at a laboratory using stationary, but highly accurate and reliable analytical equipment. In addition to being inefficient from a labor perspective in both the collection and subsequent analysis time, this prior art technique places personnel at greater risk. This is due to the longer duration needed to collect numerous samples with little to no feedback on the precise location of the chemical agent contamination.","Mass spectrometry (MS) using direct analysis in real time (referred to under the trademark DART or DART-MS) ionization provides a preferred analytical means for subsequent laboratory analysis of the samples collected in the application described above. The DART coupled with an appropriate MS system provides highly accurate and reliable analytical results in this application. Detailed teachings to enable practice of DART-MS ionization systems are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7,112,785 entitled \u201cMethod for Atmospheric Pressure Analyte Ionization\u201d and U.S. Pat. No. 7,196,525 entitled \u201cSample Imaging,\u201d both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","When using a DART-MS system, such as the JEOL DART-AccuTOF described in the above-incorporated patents, it is generally a required element of the operation to bring the sample to be analyzed in close proximity to the ion source of the DART-MS where it is typically held by hand in such proximity until a reading on the DART-MS is obtained.","While some attempts have been made to provide a sample line for greater convenience and flexibility while using the DART-MS, these attempts have generally focused on moving the ion source to the sampling point and transporting the resulting ions through the sample line to the MS. The generation of ions and their subsequent transportation has been fraught with limitations because it is inherently difficult to move ionized species over the desired distances, such as 10 to 20 feet, at atmospheric pressure. Losses over even shorter distances such as 3 feet can occur through multiple pathways including gas and surface reactions as well as charge neutralization. Accordingly, handheld detectors for onsite analysis coupled with sampling kits for offsite laboratory analysis have proliferated in this application. In addition, many subject matter experts teach away from attempting to bring high value, sensitive instruments such as the DART-MS into potentially contaminated sites.","Accordingly, what is needed is a means to utilize the highly accurate and reliable DART-MS device to detect chemical agents at sample location points approximately 20 feet away from the device with the ability to easily move the sampling point to any desired point within the sampling range, thus allowing the operator to systematically scan a site in a fashion similar to that used with a handheld detector.","The present invention provides a vapor sampling adapter for use with a DART-MS system. It includes a vapor transport line and a manifold. In the preferred embodiment the vapor transport line is heated and approximately 20 feet in length. This provides a means to use the highly accurate and reliable DART-MS to detect chemical agents at points up to 20 feet away from the DART-MS and easily move sampling to any point within the reach of the transport line. This allows the operator to systematically scan a site in a fashion similar to that used with a handheld detector. Sample vapor flows through the vapor transport line to the manifold where it becomes ionized by the DART gas stream before entering into the mass spectrometer for analysis. The present invention may be used to raster a surface to determine the precise location of chemical contamination. Additionally, the invention may be used to tune or calibrate a DART-MS.","Like reference symbols in the drawings indicate like elements.","An embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in the perspective view of . User or operator  is wearing PPE typical of the operational requirements for areas potentially contaminated with chemical agent. As shown, operator  is probing location  at a distance of approximately 10 feet from DART-MS unit . The sample is being transported from sample location  to the DART ion source  of DART-MS unit  through a vapor transfer line . Vapor transport line  is of sufficient length and flexibility to allow operator  to easily move it throughout the site within an operational radius of approximately 20 feet from DART ion source . In this way, the site can be systematically scanned for chemical agent contamination using the highly accurate and reliable analytical capabilities of the DART-MS as opposed to a handheld device. In addition, the output from the DART-MS is immediately available to operator  and others, which enhances safety and improves operational efficiency. For example, given the real-time readings from the DART-MS, the operator or a team member or supervisor can focus the raster or scanning pattern to pinpoint the precise location of chemical agent contamination. This enhances both the efficiency and safety of the operation.","Vapor transfer line  is preferably made of a substantially gas impermeable, chemical resistant material. In the preferred embodiment, the vapor transfer line  is heated and 20-feet in length, such as part number HTL-0207-2 from Quetron Systems, Inc. This heated transfer line conies with a 96-inch power cord and \u215b-inch connectors of the type sold under the trademark SWAGELOK. The reported equilibrium temperature for this heated line is 160 degrees Fahrenheit.","Turning to , a perspective view of the vapor transfer components in relation to the DART-MS is provided. The DART-MS includes DART ion source  and an adapter sampling port , which is referred to under the trademark VAPUR. The VAPUR adapter sampling port , as shown here includes a compression tube fitting. Manifold  in this particular embodiment includes a smooth walled insertion tube (not visible here) for connection to the compression tube fitting of port . The connection means used in a particular embodiment can be a compression fitting as illustrated herein, a threaded fitting, or a number of other mechanical connections or fastening means that are well known in the art to which the invention pertains. Manifold  in this embodiment includes a female threaded boring  that is screwed onto the outer housing  of DART ion source . Vapor transfer line  is connected to manifold  via fittings . As with the other fittings, the connection means used in various embodiments of the present invention can be a threaded fitting, a compression fitting, or a number of other connection or fastening means that are well known in the art. The key performance properties of these connections are that the fittings are substantially gas-tight, made of thermally and chemically resistant material, and can be readily connected and disconnected as needed by the user.","A detailed perspective view of the DART-MS sampling port area is provided in  to illustrate the connection of manifold  to the compression tube fitting of the VAPUR adapter sampling port . As illustrated in this particular embodiment, the compression tube fitting of port  includes flange component  which is connected with bolts to wall  of the VAPUR adapter for the DART-MS.","Turning to , a detailed perspective view of one embodiment of a vapor transfer manifold is provided. Manifold  in this particular embodiment includes a female-threaded fitting  for interfacing on one end to the DART ion source and an insertion tube  for interfacing on the other end to the VAPUR adapter sample port in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. Manifold  also includes a female-threaded port  for connection to the vapor transfer line. The interior of manifold  provides for unimpeded gas flow between and among fitting  connected to the DART ion source, insertion tube  inserted in the MS sample port, and port  to which the vapor transfer line is connected. In this way, vapor samples are continuously provided during operation of the present invention from the sample point flowing into manifold  where the vapor is exposed to the DART ion source before entering the MS through insertion tube .","The material used for manifold  is preferably made of a machinable, chemical resistant, non-conductive material that is resistant to heat up to at least 100 degrees Celsius. By way of example, a polymer thermoplastic such as polyether ether ketone (PEEK) can be used. Other materials, and fabrication methods other than machining, will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, injection molding could be used to manufacture manifold . In addition, a number of other suitable materials are readily available, such as machinable ceramic. Also, the shape and size of manifold  can vary while still performing the functions as taught herein.","Turning to , a cross-section of vapor transfer manifold  is illustrated. Manifold  includes a sample tube flow path  in communication with aperture  and aperture , both of which have female threads in this particular embodiment. In operation, vapor from vapor sample line  (not shown here) flows into manifold  through aperture  where it is in proximity to the DART source located near aperture . The vapor then flows into the MS (not shown) through sample tube flow path .","Having described the various hardware components of the present invention, attention is now turned to its operation.  is a graph illustrating the capability of the present invention to detect trace contaminations in the amount of 10 nanograms (ng) of the chemical warfare agent VX at a distance of approximately 10 feet from the DART-MS. Even with such a small quantity of agent (10 ng) at a total travel distance of 10 feet from the instrument, the signal as illustrated in  shows a clear peak  corresponding to the moment when the sample point was placed over the agent, allowing for a brief travel-time delay due to the required flow time of the sample through the vapor transport line to manifold and DART-MS. The duration of the delay was approximately five seconds, which is completely acceptable in the operational situation for which the invention is intended.","Turning to , two graphs are used to illustrate the DART-MS tuning or calibration capability provided by the present invention. In the example illustrated here a vapor sample is taken from a bubbler containing tributyl phosphate using the present invention to generate a constant signal as illustrated in data line  of the top graph in . When the present invention is selectively disconnected from the bubbler, the signal returns quickly to background level as illustrated in data line  of the bottom graph in . The stable constant signal provided in this way is very useful for tuning instrument sensitivity.","Turning to , a raster plot and corresponding glass slide sample surface which is contaminated with a trace quantity of VX and blue dye are provided to illustrate the raster capability of the present invention to locate a chemical contaminate. By rastering or systematically moving the inlet to the vapor transfer line over a surface, the signal becomes most intense when the inlet is directly over the contamination. Experiments with the present invention indicate that when the inlet is scanned across a glass slide where 1 microgram (\u03bcg) of VX (with blue coloring added) has been deposited, the mass spectral signal creates a one-dimensional map, locating the contamination. For a two-dimensional surface the process can repeated, each time offsetting the sweep by the image resolution of the device. In this way, the specific location of contamination on a surface can be mapped. This information can then be used to direct decontamination measures.","While specific embodiments of the invention have been described, it will be understood that additional embodiments and various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, various materials can be used for the manifold and vapor transport line as taught herein. The vapor transport line can be heated or unheated. Various mechanical fittings and connectors can be used to connect one component to another. Variations in manifold shape and size are possible while still performing the functions as taught herein. Accordingly, these and other embodiments of the invention fall within the scope of the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
