title: Weight discrimination of colliding ballistic objects
abstract: When a kinetic kill vehicle is launched against an incoming ballistic object and the two objects collide, by measuring the deflection angle of the trajectory of the merged object and comparing the deflection angle against a threshold value, a determination is made as to the relative weight of the incoming ballistic object and whether or not the incoming ballistic object is a decoy and not the warhead.

The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","This disclosure relates to methods and systems for intercepting an object traveling in ballistic trajectory.","None","One of the challenges of defending against ballistic missiles is that some ballistic missiles may deploy a plurality of decoys during the reentry phase of the ballistic flight. Although the decoys are detectible by radar they are not distinguishable from the warhead based on the radar track data alone. One method of defending against such a ballistic missile involves launching multiple kinetic kill vehicles to intercept many of the incoming ballistic objects, so that at least one of which will be a warhead and others being decoys. However, because a large number of decoys are deployed by a ballistic missile, it is not practical to intercept every incoming object and only some are intercepted. Thus, when kinetic kill vehicles intercept one or more incoming ballistic objects deployed by a ballistic missile, it would be beneficial to automatically determine if the intercepted ballistic object is not the warhead. That would allow appropriate follow-on actions to be taken.","According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a method for determining the relative weight of an incoming ballistic object with respect to a predefined weight value, said incoming ballistic object moving in a ballistic trajectory, is disclosed. The method comprises launching at least a second object of a known weight toward the incoming ballistic object, thereby resulting in the two objects colliding at a strike angle and producing a merged object traveling on a second ballistic trajectory that is deflected from the first ballistic trajectory of the ballistic object by a deflection angle. Immediately before the collision, pre-collision track data is collected where the pre-collision track data comprises velocity vectors of the incoming ballistic object and the second object immediately prior to the ballistic object and the second object collide. After the collision, post-collision track data is collected where the post-collision track data comprises observed filtered velocity vector of the merged object after the collision. Next, the deflection angle of the second ballistic trajectory of the merged object is determined based on the pre-collision and post-collision track data and then, the strike angle is determined based on the pre-collision track data. Next, a threshold value for the deflection angle is determined based on the strike angle and said predefined weight value. The relative weight of the incoming ballistic object is determined by comparing the deflection angle with the threshold value and an appropriate follow-on action is taken based on the determination of the relative weight of the incoming ballistic object.","According to another embodiment, a method for determining whether or not an incoming ballistic object moving in a ballistic trajectory is heavier than a predefined weight value is disclosed. The method comprises launching at least a second object of known weight toward the ballistic object, thereby resulting in the two objects colliding at a strike angle and producing a merged object traveling on a second ballistic trajectory that is deflected from the first ballistic trajectory of the ballistic object by a deflection angle. Immediately before the two objects collide, pre-collision track data comprising velocity vectors of the ballistic object and the second object is collected. Post-collision track data is collected after the collision. The post-collision track data comprises the observed filtered velocity vector of the merged object. From the pre-collision and post-collision track data, the deflection angle of the second ballistic trajectory of the merged object is determined and the strike angle is determined from the pre-collision track data. Then, a threshold value of the deflection angle is determined based on the strike angle and the predefined weight value and by comparing the deflection angle with the threshold value, a determination is made as to whether or not the ballistic object was a decoy and not the warhead and an appropriate follow-on action is taken.","This description of the preferred embodiments is intended to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings, which are to be considered part of the entire written description of this invention.

The method of the present disclosure allows determining whether or not the incoming ballistic object intercepted by a given kinetic kill vehicle was the warhead  based on general condition that the warhead  is substantially heavier than the decoys -. Given that condition, acquisition of the pre-collision and post-collision dynamics of the two objects, the kinetic kill vehicle and the incoming ballistic object, allows determination as to whether the warhead  has been intercepted.","Still referring to , according to another aspect of the present disclosure, the target complex  can also include one or more objects  (only one shown for illustrative purposes) that are also heavier than the decoys - but can have a weight similar to or different than warhead . The method of the present disclosure can be applied to determine whether the warhead  has not been intercepted and one of the decoys - has been intercepted by a given kinetic kill vehicle. This will be elaborated further below.","Referring to , the method of discriminating the incoming ballistic object B intercepted by a given kinetic kill vehicle K of a known weight according to an embodiment will be described. A characteristic of the decoys - among the incoming ballistic objects comprising the target complex  is that they are substantially lighter than the warhead . This is also a characteristic shared by the kinetic kill vehicles ,  and K. In other words, the kinetic kill vehicles are also substantially lighter than the warhead . Since kinetic kill vehicles are known objects launched against the incoming ballistic objects, the weight of each of the kinetic kill vehicles are always known. The method of the present disclosure utilizes this substantial difference in the weight between the warhead, decoys, and the kinetic kill vehicle to determine whether or not the kinetic kill vehicle intercepted the warhead based on measured parameters of the post-collision dynamics. In cases where the kinetic kill vehicle is a self-propelled object carrying fuel, the fuel remaining on-board the kinetic kill vehicle at the time of the collision is factored into the calculations concerning the pre-collision and post-collision dynamics. For example, the estimated weight of the remaining fuel on-board can be added to the known net weight of the kinetic kill vehicle.","According to an embodiment, the collision between the kinetic kill vehicle K and the incoming ballistic object B of unknown weight is assumed to be an inelastic collision with total absorption. The incoming ballistic object B is traveling in a trajectory Tand has a velocity {right arrow over (V)}and weight W. The kinetic kill vehicle K is traveling in a trajectory Tand has a velocity {right arrow over (V)}and weight W. The incoming ballistic object B and the kinetic kill vehicle K collide at a strike angle \u03b4. Through the inelastic collision, the incoming ballistic object B and the kinetic kill vehicle K merge into a merged object M. The merged object M has a velocity {right arrow over (V)}and weight Wand travels along a trajectory Tthat has been deflected from the trajectory Tof the incoming ballistic object B by a deflection angle \u03b8.","The incoming ballistic object B and the kinetic kill vehicle K are monitored and tracked by a radar and thus the velocity {right arrow over (V)}of the incoming ballistic object B and the velocity {right arrow over (V)}of the kinetic kill vehicle K before the collision, hereinafter referred to as the pre-collision track data, are collected. The velocity {right arrow over (V)}of the merged object M after the collision, the post-collision track data, is measured and collected by the radar. Because the weight Wof the kinetic kill vehicle K is a known quantity, by measuring the velocities of the two colliding objects before the collision, the velocity {right arrow over (V)}of the merged object M and its deflected angle \u03b8, one can determine whether or not the incoming ballistic object B was one of the decoys - and not the warhead , which is substantially heavier than the kinetic kill vehicle K. In a first scenario where the collision is with the warhead , because the warhead  is substantially heavier than the kinetic kill vehicle K, the deflected angle \u03b8 will be small. Whereas, in a second scenario, where the collision is with one of the decoys -, whose weights are substantially less than the weight of the warhead , the deflected angle \u03b8 will be much larger. Therefore, by setting a threshold value for the deflected angle \u03b8 and comparing the measured deflection angle \u03b8 to the threshold value, the nature of the incoming ballistic object B can be determined. If the measured deflection angle \u03b8 is less than the threshold value, the incoming ballistic object B was the heavy object  or the warhead . If the measured deflection angle \u03b8 is greater than the threshold value, the incoming ballistic object B was a decoy.","The deflection angle \u03b8 can be computed from the velocities measured from the radar. The deflection angle \u03b8 is given by",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b8","mo":"=","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"cos","mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mover":{"mi":"V","mo":"\u2192"},"mi":"M"},{"mover":{"mi":"V","mo":"\u2192"},"mi":"B"}],"mo":"\u00b7"},{"mrow":[{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"V","mo":"\u2192"},"mi":"M"}},{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"V","mo":"\u2192"},"mi":"B"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}]}}}}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["{right arrow over (V)}=(V(1), V(2), V(3)) is the velocity vector of the incoming ballistic object B at the collision,","{right arrow over (V)}=(V(1), V(2), V(3)) is the velocity vector of the kinetic kill vehicle K at the collision,","{right arrow over (V)}=(V(1), V(2), V(3)) is the observed filtered velocity vector of the merged object M after collision given by\n\n\n\nwith\n"]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0025"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["W","B"]},"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["w","K"]},"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["w","B"]},{"mi":["w","K"]}],"mo":"+"}}},"mo":[",","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mi":"and"}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["W","K"]},"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["w","B"]},"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["w","B"]},{"mi":["w","K"]}],"mo":"+"}}},"mo":","}}}]}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["w=weight of the incoming ballistic object B and","w=weight of the kinetic kill vehicle K."]}}}},"Next, in order to compensate for the radar measurement errors in the observed deflection angle \u03b8, the error standard deviation of the deflection angle is determined.

the strike angle and the stored data representing the plots of , for example is used to determine a threshold deflection angle \u03b4. Referring to , if the calculated strike angle \u03b4 is 50 degrees, the threshold deflection angle \u03b8can be defined as 25 degrees, for example; which is the deflection angle corresponding to a 20 kg object colliding inelastically with the kinetic kill vehicle. Then, if the deflection angle \u03b8 of the merged object M calculated as discussed above is greater than or equal to 25 degrees, one can conclude that the incoming ballistic object B intercepted by the kinetic kill vehicle K was at most 20 kg and thus a \u201clight\u201d object. The conclusion will be that the incoming ballistic object B was one of the decoys and not a warhead. On the other hand, if the calculated deflection angle \u03b8of the merged object M is less than 25 degrees, one can conclude that the incoming ballistic object B intercepted by the kinetic kill vehicle K was heavier than a weight class of maximum 20 kg. The conclusion will be that the incoming ballistic object B was either the heavy object  or the warhead .","In another embodiment, after the strike angle \u03b4 is calculated, the strike angle and the stored data representing the plots of , for example is used to determine a threshold deflection angle \u03b8. Looking at the plot of , if the calculated strike angle \u03b4 is 50 degrees, the threshold deflection angle \u03b8can be defined as 1.8 degrees, for example, which is the deflection angle corresponding to a 500 kg object colliding inelastically with the kinetic kill vehicle. Then, if the calculated deflection angle \u03b8of the merged object M is less than or equal to 1.8 degrees, we know that the incoming ballistic object B intercepted by the kinetic kill vehicle K was at least 500 kg and thus a \u201cheavy\u201d object. The conclusion will be that the incoming ballistic object B was the heavy object  or warhead  and not a decoy. On the other hand, if the calculated deflection angle \u03b8 of the merged object M is greater than 1.8 degrees, we know that the incoming ballistic object B intercepted by the kinetic kill vehicle K was lighter than a weight class of minimum 500 kg. The conclusion will be that the incoming ballistic object B was one of the decoys and not a warhead.","According to another aspect of the present disclosure, when there are more than two identifiable weight categories among the incoming ballistic objects, a series of threshold deflection angles \u03b8can be employed to identify whether a desired warhead has intercepted different categories. For example, one such situation would be where the target complex  includes a heavy object  that is heavier than 2000 kg (i.e. heavier than the decoys - and the warhead ), see , and the expected weight of the warhead  is greater than 20 kg but less than 2000 kg. Such heavy object  can be a tank, for example. Thus, in this example, the incoming ballistic objects can fall into one of three weight categories: (1) decoy weight class, (2) warhead weight class, and (3) other heavy object weight class.","In order to confirm whether or not the warhead  has been intercepted, two threshold deflection angles \u03b8and \u03b8can be defined. For purposes of this discussion, we will consider a case where the strike angle is 50 degrees. \u03b8can be set as 25 degrees, the deflection angle corresponding to a 20 kg object, as shown in . \u03b8can be set as 0.5 degrees, the deflection angle corresponding to a 2000 kg object, as shown in . After the strike angle \u03b4 of 50 degrees and a deflection angle \u03b4are calculated from the radar track data of the colliding objects, the calculated deflection angle \u03b8is compared to the \u03b8. If \u03b8, the radar system would conclude that the intercepted object was one of the decoys -. In that situation, since the warhead  is still inbound, an appropriate follow-on action would be taken to address the incoming warhead . Another kinetic kill vehicle can be launched or a different countermeasure may be taken. If \u03b8, the radar system would conclude that the intercepted object was not one of the decoys - because it was heavier than a decoy. However, at this point, it is not known whether the intercepted object was the warhead  or the other heavy object . Next, the calculated deflection angle \u03b8is compared to the \u03b8. If \u03b8>\u03b8, it would mean that the intercepted object was heavier than the decoys but lighter than the heavy object  and the radar system would conclude that a heavy object was intercepted. If \u03b8<\u03b8, the radar system would conclude that the intercepted object was not the warhead  but the other heavy object  and an appropriate follow-on action can be taken.","According to an aspect of the present disclosure, look-up tables or programmed formulae representing plots similar to those shown in  can be prepared and stored in the radar system to accommodate kinetic kill vehicles of varying weights as well as different weight classes of decoys and warheads. Thus, by setting an appropriate threshold deflection angle \u03b8and then comparing the calculated deflection angle \u03b8against the threshold value, a radar system can quickly determine whether a warhead has been intercepted by the kinetic kill vehicle. Depending on the outcome, a decision can be made as to the appropriate follow-on action to be taken. For example, if the kinetic kill vehicle intercepted a decoy rather than a warhead, an appropriate follow-on action can be to launch another kinetic kill vehicle to intercept the warhead. If the kinetic kill vehicle intercepted a warhead, an appropriate follow-on action can be to track or scan for another target complex and launch another kinetic kill vehicle.","As can be understood from the discussion presented herein, the information about the weight of the warhead is known and that information is used to set the deflection angle threshold values accordingly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["51","52","53","54","55","56","57","58"]},"Referring to , an example of a radar system  incorporating the method of the present invention is shown.
