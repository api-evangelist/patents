title: Valve with a delayed closing
abstract: Delayed valve of the type comprising a water entrance (), a water exit (), a plunger () supporting a shutter () and comprising a tubular tail () passing through the seat () in a sealed manner and comprising, at least, an opening () through which water can penetrate when the shutter is moved away from its seat and an exit opening (), characterized in that the raising of the shutter is controlled by the pressing down of a pressing button () the internal end of which is conformed to obturate the exit opening () of the tail (), said pressing button being submitted to the action of a counter spring ().

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention relates to improvements to delayed closing valves, of the type of those whose pressing of a pressing button defines the raising of the shutter, the flowing of water and simultaneously the evacuation of a delayed chamber in which a plunger comprising said shutter is moving, the filling of said chamber being performed through a calibrated opening allowing delaying the moving of the shutter pushed back into its seat by a spring.","If the user maintains the pushing button down, water flows and the delaying of the closing is prevented.","This drawback is very sensitive in a shower installation where the valve is controlled by a \u201cpriming valve\u201d, having a very simple structure and comprising a shutter and a pushing button that allow communication between the delaying chamber of the main valve and the outside free air.","In French patent 2492942, there is recited a valve in which the time of maintaining of the pressing down of the pressing button has no action on the delaying. Such a valve is particularly well adapted to being used as a primer valve in a shower installation.","Experience has shown that the making of such a valve is complicated.","In European patent 0928918, there is recited a valve whose opening cannot be obtained but by releasing the pressing button.","This valve is characterized essentially by the fact that the shutter comprises a tubular tail through which water flows when the shutter is moved away from its seat during the action on the usual pressing button, said tail being obturated by a elastically deformable membrane interposed between the end of said tail and said pressing button.","This device has proved efficient, but however it appeared that the making of the membrane is delicate and that the membrane is sensitive to aging.","Experience has also shown that this valve present problems concerning its assembling.","Of the know way, the shutter comprises a body having an entrance and an exit for water disposed each on either side of the seat, and a tubular tail passing through said seat in a sealed manner, characterized in that said tail can be obturated by the internal end of a pressing button during its pressing down.","The valve comprises a body , a water entrance  and a water exit , disposed, each on one side and the other of a seat  that is normally obturated by a shutter  supported by a plunger  delimitating with said body a delaying chamber . The plunger  is submitted to the action of a spring, not represented because this is well known in the technical field, interposed between its end and the bottom of the body.","Of known fashion, the plunger  comprises a tubular tail , having at least an opening  allowing water to penetrate in said tail to be, after that, evacuated through the exit opening .","According to the invention, the opening of the valve, which implies the moving of the plunger supporting the shutter along arrow F, is made by a pressing button  whose internal end is conformed to obturate the end of the tail .","As it can be inferred from , by pressing down the pressing button , the plunger  is pushed back by the tail , and then the shutter  is being moved from its seat .","Water coming from entrance  can penetrate into the tail but cannot reach the exit  and flow, since the end of the said tail is totally obturated by the internal end of the pressing button.","This state of fact will keep being as long as an action will be maintained on the pressing button.","As it can be inferred from , by pressing down the pressing button , the plunger  is pushed back by the tail , and then the shutter  is being moved from its seat .","By releasing the pressing button , the latter is pushed back by the spring , de-masking the end of the tail , by having the openings  and  communicating with each other and by allowing, simultaneously, the plunger  to move along the arrow F, as per the usual technique (). Water penetrates into chamber  through, for example, a small notch made at the periphery of the skirt of the shutter. This device is recited in European patent 0928918.","It can be inferred from the above explanations that such a valve is particularly well adapted to constitute or a priming device of a shower installation.","In such a case, the opening entrance  communicates with the discharging opening of the main valve and the delay period is determined to allow emptying of the delaying chamber of the main valve.","In general, the parts that are making the valve have been studied to allow an easy assembling, without the help of tools.","The plunger, the seat and its supporting organ  and the pressing button  are maintained in the body  by a covering cap , engaged in said body , also forming the guiding organ of the pressing button .","The whole is maintained by a spindle passing through the body , by holes and against which the cap  bears under the action of the spring .","As shown on the drawings, there is used two spindles , forming, each, the arm of a clamp .","The penetration of the organ , supporting the shutter , into the body  is imitated by a shoulder . The organ  and the cap  have the same diameter, and therefore, the same gaskets may be used for making the sealing with the body .","The organ  comprises a lengthening piece , against which the cap  bears, having diametrical slots allowing water coming from said tail  to reach the exit  when the moving parts are in the position shown on .","The shutter  and the organ  are forming a functional assembly made of two parts assembled together, for example by clipsage, to allow the mounting of the gasket , allowing the tail  to pass through this assembly in a sealed manner."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"p":["Other features will come from the description that follows, made in relation to the appended drawings, that are given only as examples, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
