The contents of this related provisional application are incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made with government support under Contract No. 9529152 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to multi-channel audio and particularly to the delivery of high quality and distortion-free multi-channel audio in an enclosure.","2. Description of the Background Art","The inventors have recognized that the acoustics of an enclosure (e.g., room, automobile interior, movie theaters, etc.) play a major role in introducing distortions in the audio signal perceived by listeners.","A typical room is an acoustic enclosure that can be modeled as a linear system whose behavior at a particular listening position is characterized by an impulse response, h(n) {n=0, 1, . . . , N\u22121}. This is called the room impulse response and has an associated frequency response, H(e). Generally, H(e) is also referred to as the room transfer function (RTF). The impulse response yields a complete description of the changes a sound signal undergoes when it travels from a source to a receiver (microphone\/listener). The signal at the receiver contains consists of direct path components, discrete reflections that arrive a few milliseconds after the direct sound, as well as a reverberant field component.","It is well established that room responses change with source and receiver locations in a room. A room response can be uniquely defined for a set of spatial co-ordinates (x, y, z). This assumes that the source (loudspeaker) is at origin (0, 0, 0) and the receiver (microphone or listener) is at the spatial co-ordinates, x, yand z, relative to a source in the room.","Now, when sound is transmitted in a room from a source to a specific. receiver, the frequency response of the audio signal is distorted at the receiving position mainly due to interactions with room boundaries and the buildup of standing waves at low frequencies.","One mechanism to minimize these distortions is to introduce an equalizing filter that is an inverse (or approximate inverse) of the room impulse response for a given source-receiver position. This equalizing filter is applied to the audio signal before it is transmitted by the loudspeaker source. Thus, if h(n) is the equalizing filter for h(n), then, for perfect equalization h(n){circle around (\u00d7)}h(n)=\u03b4(n); where {circle around (\u00d7)} is the convolution operator and \u03b4(n) is the Kronecker delta function.","However, the inventors have realized that at least two problems arise when using this approach, (i) the room response is not necessarily invertible (i.e., it is not minimum phase), and (ii) designing an equalizing filter for a specific receiver (or listener) will produce poor equalization performance at other locations in the room. In other words, multiple-listener equalization cannot be achieved with a single equalizing filter. Thus, room equalization, which has traditionally been approached as a classic inverse filter problem, will not work in practical environments where multiple-listeners are present.","Given this, there is a need to develop a system and a method for correcting distortions introduced by the room, simultaneously, at multiple-listener positions.","The present invention provides a system and a method for delivering substantially distortion-free audio, simultaneously, to multiple listeners in any environment (e.g., free-field, home-theater, movie-theater, automobile interiors, airports, rooms, etc.). This is achieved by means of a filter that automatically corrects the room acoustical characteristics at multiple-listener positions.","Accordingly, in one embodiment, the method for correcting room acoustics at multiple-listener positions includes: (i) measuring a room acoustical response at each listener position in a multiple-listener environment; (ii) determining a general response by computing a weighted average of the room acoustical responses; and (iii) obtaining a room acoustic correction filter from the general response, wherein the room acoustic correction filter corrects the room acoustics at the multiple-listener positions. The method may further include the step of generating a stimulus signal (e.g., a logarithmic chirp signal, a broadband noise signal, a maximum length signal, or a white noise signal) from at least one loudspeaker for measuring the room acoustical response at each of the listener position.","In one aspect of the invention, the general response is determined by a pattern recognition method such as a hard c-means clustering method, a fuzzy c-means clustering method, any well known adaptive learning method (e.g., neural-nets, recursive least squares, etc.), or any combination thereof.","The method may further include the step of determining a minimum-phase signal and an all-pass signal from the general response. Accordingly, in one aspect of the invention, the room acoustic correction filter could be the inverse of the minimum-phase signal. In another aspect, the room acoustic correction filter could be the convolution of the inverse minimum-phase signal and a matched filter that is derived from the all-pass signal.","Thus, filtering each of the room acoustical responses with the room acoustical correction filter will provide a substantially flat magnitude response in the frequency domain, and a signal substantially resembling an impulse function in the time domain at each of the listener positions.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the method for generating substantially distortion-free audio at multiple-listeners in an environment includes: (i) measuring the acoustical characteristics of the environment at each expected listener position in the multiple-listener environment; (ii) determining a room acoustical correction filter from the acoustical characteristics at the each of the expected listener positions; (iii) filtering an audio signal with the room acoustical correction filter; and (iv) transmitting the filtered audio from at least one loudspeaker, wherein the audio signal received at said each expected listener position is substantially free of distortions.","The method may further include the step of determining a general response, from the measured acoustical characteristics at each of the expected listener positions, by a pattern recognition method (e.g., hard c-means clustering method, fuzzy c-means clustering method, a suitable adaptive learning method, or any combination thereof). Additionally, the method could include the step of determining a minimum-phase signal and an all-pass signal from the general response.","In one aspect of the invention, the room acoustical correction filter could be the inverse of the minimum-phase signal, and in another aspect of the invention, the filter could be obtained by filtering the minimum-phase signal with a matched filter (the matched filter being obtained from the all-pass signal).","In one aspect of the invention, the pattern recognition method is a c-means clustering method that generates at least one cluster centroid. Then, the method may further include the step of forming the general response from the at least one cluster centroid.","Thus, filtering each of the acoustical characteristics with the room acoustical correction filter will provide a substantially flat magnitude response in the frequency domain, and a signal substantially resembling an impulse function in the time domain at each of the expected listener positions.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a system for generating substantially distortion-free audio at multiple-listeners in an environment comprises: (i) a multiple-listener room acoustic correction filter implemented in the semiconductor device, the room acoustic correction filter formed from a weighted average of room acoustical responses, and wherein each of the room acoustical responses is measured at an expected listener position, wherein an audio signal filtered by said room acoustic correction filter is received substantially distortion-free at each of the expected listener positions. Additionally, at least one of the stimulus signal and the filtered audio signal are transmitted from at least one loudspeaker.","In one aspect of the invention, the weighted average is determined by a pattern recognition system (e.g., hard c-means clustering system, a fuzzy c-means clustering system, an adaptive learning system, or any combination thereof). The system may further include a means for determining a minimum-phase signal and an all-pass signal from the weighted average.","Accordingly, the correction filter could be either the inverse of the minimum-phase signal or a filtered version of the minimum-phase signal (obtained by filtering the minimum-phase signal with a matched filter, the matched filter being obtained from the all-pass signal of the weighted average).","In one aspect of the invention, the pattern recognition means may be a c-means clustering system that generates at least one cluster centroid. Then, the system may further include means for forming the weighted average from the at least one cluster centroid.","Thus, filtering each of the acoustical responses with the room acoustical correction filter will provide a substantially flat magnitude response in the frequency domain, and a signal substantially resembling an impulse function in the time domain at each of the expected listener positions.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the method for correcting room acoustics at multiple-listener positions includes: (i) clustering each room acoustical response into at least one cluster, wherein each cluster includes a centroid; (ii) forming a general response from the at least one centroid; and (iii) determining a room acoustic correction filter from the general response, wherein the room acoustic correction filter corrects the room acoustics at the multiple-listener positions.","In one aspect of the present invention, the method may further include the step of determining a stable inverse of the general response, the stable inverse being included in the room acoustic correction filter.","Thus, filtering each of the acoustical responses with the room acoustical correction filter will provide a substantially flat magnitude response in the frequency domain, and a signal substantially resembling an impulse function in the time domain at the multiple-listener positions.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the method for correcting room acoustics at multiple-listener positions comprises: (i) clustering a direct path component of each acoustical response into at least one direct path cluster, wherein each direct path cluster includes a direct path centroid; (ii) clustering reflection components of each of the acoustical response into at least one reflection path cluster, wherein said each reflection path cluster includes a reflection path centroid; (iii) forming a general direct path response from the at least one direct path centroid and a general reflection path response from the at least one reflection path centroid; and (iv) determining a room acoustic correction filter from the general direct path response and the general reflection path response, wherein the room acoustic correction filter corrects the room acoustics at the multiple-listener positions.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the method for correcting room acoustics at multiple-listener positions includes: (i) determining a general response by computing a weighted average of room acoustical responses, wherein each room acoustical response corresponds to a sound propagation characteristics from a loudspeaker to a listener position; and (ii) obtaining a room acoustic correction filter from the general response, wherein the room acoustic correction filter corrects the room acoustics at the multiple-listener positions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["20","22","10","24","25","26","27","28","29","31"]},"The sound propagation characteristics may be described by the room acoustical impulse response, which is a compact representation of how sound propagates in an environment (or enclosure). Thus, the room acoustical response includes the direct path and the reflection path components of the sound field. The room acoustical response may be measured by a microphone at an expected listener position. This is done by, (i) transmitting a stimulus signal (e.g., a logarithm chirp, a broadband noise signal, a maximum length signal, or any other signal that sufficiently excites the enclosure modes) from the loudspeaker, (ii) recording the signal received at an expected listener position, and (iii) removing (deconvolving) the response of the microphone (also possibly removing the response associated with the loudspeaker).","Even though the direct and reflection path taken by the sound from each loudspeaker to each listener may appear to be different (i.e., the room acoustical impulse responses may be different), there may be inherent similarities in the measured room responses. In one embodiment of the present invention, these similarities in the room responses, between loudspeakers and listeners, may be used to form a room acoustical correction filter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["60","64","68","72","60","64"]},"Furthermore, the right panels,  and , clearly show a significant amount of distortion introduced at various frequencies. Specifically, certain frequencies are boosted (e.g., 150 Hz in the bottom right panel ), whereas other frequencies are attenuated (e.g., 150 Hz in the top right panel ) by more than 10 dB. One of the objectives of the room acoustical correction filter is to reduce the deviation in the magnitude response, at all expected listener positions simultaneously, and make the spectrum envelopes flat. Another objective is to remove the effects of early and late reflections, so that the effective response (after applying the room acoustical correction filter) is a delayed Kronecker delta function, \u03b4(n), at all listener positions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"Specifically, the top left panel  in  is the correction filter obtained by inverting the magnitude response of one position (i.e., the response of the top right panel ) of . Upon using this filter, clearly the resulting response at one expected listener position is flattened (shown in top right panel ). However, upon filtering the room acoustical response of the bottom left panel  (i.e., the response at another expected listener position) with the inverse filter of panel , it can be seen that the resulting response (depicted in panel ) is degraded significantly. In fact there is an extra 10 dB boost at 150 Hz. Clearly, a room acoustical correction filter has to minimize the spectral deviation at all expected listener positions simultaneously.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["100","102"]},"Since the room acoustical responses are substantially different for different source-listener positions, it seems natural that whatever similarities reside in the responses be maximally utilized for designing the room acoustical correction filter .

In another aspect of the present invention, the room acoustical correction filter  may be designed using a weighted average scheme that employs the similarity search algorithm. The weighted average scheme could be a recursive least squares scheme, a scheme based on neural-nets, an adaptive learning scheme, a pattern recognition scheme, or any combination thereof.","In one aspect of the present invention, the \u201csimilarity\u201d search algorithm is a c-means algorithm (e.g., the hard c-means of fuzzy c-means, also called k-means in some literatures).
