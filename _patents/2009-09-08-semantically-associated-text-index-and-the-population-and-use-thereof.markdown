title: Semantically associated text index and the population and use thereof
abstract: The construction of a semantically associated computer search database is disclosed. A text catalog containing the text particulars and contents of a plurality of electronic documents, a term association database which joins text search terms with their semantic meanings or definitions, and a content association database which contains records associating text search terms and their contextual definitions in respect of individual electronic documents are used to in conjunction provide a text index in which it is possible to search based upon the actual definitions or meanings of certain text or terms within the electronic documents, reducing or refining query search result sets. A method of operating a search engine with the index in question, as well as other e-commerce methods employing the index as a refining tool are also disclosed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is the national stage of PCT\/CA2009\/001241, filed Sep. 8, 2009, which claims priority from Canadian Patent Application Ser. No. 2639438, filed Sep. 8, 2008.","This invention is in the field of Internet search engine technology, and is more specifically in the field of the construction and use of a text index which includes the association of different text search terms with their proper semantic definitions, yielding a semantically associated text index.","As the volume of content available on the Internet continues to grow exponentially, the importance of Internet search engines and search technology is reinforced. Virtually every Internet user uses one or more search engines such as Google, Yahoo or the like to locate relevant Internet content of interest to them on a more or less frequent basis. With the large quantity of material available on the Internet, various tools and methods for the refinement of search engine results have been created and tested with varying degrees of success.","The most popular search engines available on the Internet, including Google, are primarily based upon the user entering a set of text search terms through a search engine interface and those text search terms are used to extract a result set from the index created or administered by the search engine. One of the limitations however to a purely text-based search is that if you use a text search term which can have more than one definition or meaning, the result set which is retrieved will not be as focused or relevant to the topic of interest as might be desired.","Search engines have endeavored in the past to internally assemble by use of proprietary algorithms or the like ranked indexes of content to inquisitively try to provide more relevant results to the user, or in more likely circumstances to at the very least provide the ability for the search engines to sell higher ranked positions in their index to generate advertising revenue.","To date one of the primary methods by which a provider of search services is able to provide focus or limitation in the results sets to be returned in response to basic text queries such as this is to limit the content within the index\u2014for example, if a particular search provider is interested only in providing medical publication results, then they need to create an index which contains pointers and information relating to medical publication content. In this way, the results returned from a search exercised upon their text index will be limited similarly to the medical publication content contained therein. It would be desirable to be able to provide a method of ranking or limiting search results in a more general text index without the need to physically restrict the types of content which were indexed therein.","Another limitation of purely text-based searching is the search engine provided with a single text search term is not able to provide search results which encompass more than one different word or term having the same definition. In circumstances where different locales or dialects use different words to describe the same thing, it would be necessary to include both or all of those text search terms in the search query fed to the search engine in order to ensure that results were returned from the application of that search query to the index covering the use of all of the different terms sharing the same definition. If there were a way to associate a particular text search term with other similar terms by linking it through its definition this could allow for enhancements in search technology.","All of these various limitations to present-day text-based search engines and search techniques on the Internet are related or traceable in some way to the fact that a text-based search does not itself incorporated into the search criteria or the characterization or prioritization of the search results any one or more actual \u201cdefinitions\u201d of each of the text search terms which are included in the search query fed to the search engine and applied to the indexing question. By re-orienting or adding to the criteria used in the application of a search query to a particular search engine or index the actual semantics or definitions of those terms, the relevance of the search results can be enhanced. As well, the development of such as searching methodology will allow for the aggregation as it is used by various search users of a semantically associated index of Web content which beyond being indexed in a way that keeps track of various pieces of content solely by the presence of a particular text term therein will over time aggregate the necessary information to understand in the case of terms which might have more than one definition, only one of which might be relevant to the content in that item, what is the proper definition or relevance of the terms present therein and\/or whether or not that particular piece of Internet content is actually semantically relevant to the query being submitted and processed. Beyond its use as an enhanced searching tool this type of an Internet text index would have other commercial uses including the ability to provide enhanced relevance in the serving of content such as advertising.","Beyond pure text correlation, one of the primary ways that a user right now can endeavor to narrow down a text search to isolate contents of the definitional nature they desire is to provide multiple text search terms with the proper query operators associating them and by this way endeavor to narrow down the results returned in the execution of a query against the text index [for example if you were looking for references related to apples as fruit, you could execute a query that searched for the terms APPLE and FRUIT, with a view to isolating or minimizing the references that you received in your query result set from a large number of those pertaining to for example, the Apple Computer Company.] Provision of a text indexing tool which will allow for semantic refinement or limitation of the search results would be desirable and effective over what is being done currently in basic text searching.","It is the object of the present invention to provide an enhancement to traditional text-based search engine technology, used on the Internet and otherwise, to allow for the refinement of text-based search results based upon me definitions of selected text search terms, rendering the search results more semantically accurate or relevant.","The present invention will accomplish its objectives by associating the text search terms selected by a user with predetermined definitions, resulting in the aggregation of a semantically associated text catalog over time.","The invention comprises a semantically associated text index, being a data structure for use in the rendering of semantically associated text searches of one or more electronic documents. The semantically associated text index includes a text catalog, a term association database and a content association database, which are all parts of a data structure which will allow for the rendering of the semantically associated search results. The text catalog will comprise contents records pertaining to at least one electronic document, identifying at least one text search term present in the electronic document. The second aspect of the data structure of the semantically associated text index is a term association database, which will contain term association records corresponding to a text search term with a particular definition. Multiple text search terms can be associated with an individual predefined definition, and multiple predefined definitions can in the inverse be associated with a single text search term. The final element of the data structure of the present invention which is required for its operation is a content association database. The content association database will contain content association records, each content association record basically linking a particular contents records from the text catalog with a particular term association records from the term association database. By linking a reference to a particular electronic document or webpage to a particular term association record corresponding to a text search term appearing in that webpage or asset, the relevant definition of the text search term in question is effectively tag to the electronic document or website in question. The content association database could be pre-populated and is also contemplated specifically to be populated by ongoing or aggregated use of the system of the present invention with this data structure to create additional content association records in the content association database.","This data structure can be used to provide refined and semantically associated search results in a search engine context as well as being used in other applications to for example provide semantically associated advertising content or in other e-business applications where increasing the semantic association or relevance of the results served based on a particular text search term or text search terms would be desired.","In addition to the data structure of the semantically associated text index outlined herein, in both the case of an integrally hosted text catalog or in the context of the remainder of the semantically associated text index being built for use in association with the pre-existing internal or external text catalog, there are also numerous methods of use and apparatus for the use of the data structure of the present invention which are contemplated within the scope hereof. There is for example contemplated a website search engine system which would, by using the semantically associated text index of the present invention, provide the ability for users to conduct enhanced semantically associated searches of a index such as that disclosed and to obtain more contextual relevance in the search results. Again, one of the keys to the ongoing enhancement or improvement of the contents of the semantically associated text indexing question is the ongoing capture or creation of additional content association records in the content association database based upon repeated or subsequent uses of the system of the present invention by users.","In operation of the website search engine or other software methods of accessing the semantically associated text index of the present invention, a user would be provided with the ability to, in the scope of selecting the query parameters for execution against the text catalog, selecting the appropriate contextual definitions for association with text search terms being selected for running against the text catalog. By selecting particular definitions for the terms being used in the search, the results which are retrieved from the text catalog can be refined by association of the selected definitions or consideration of the selected definitions of the text search terms in question against the contents of the content association database. In addition to providing the ability to produce more relevant processed result sets using this method, by associating the proper contextual definitions with each text search term or some of the text search terms by the users, it also makes it possible to either automatically in the background or manually upon some user intervention trigger the creation of additional content association records in the content association database.","The primary means of use of the software method of the present invention is initially contemplated to be by way of the development of a plug-in or interface which will allow for the overlay of the semantic enhancement method of the present invention over top of a pre-existing Internet search engine such as Yahoo, Google or the like. Installation of a plug-in in the web browser of the user which will interact through the appropriate API with the search engine in question will allow for the use of the semantic enhancement method of the present invention with a pre-existing search engine. The method of semantic enhancement of text-based search results as outlined elsewhere herein is also explicitly contemplated within the scope of the present invention.","The software of the present invention could either comprise its own locally installed application, or could be likely more optimally provided as a server-based solution, wherein a Web server, either internal or external, could serve the necessary content to and from client browsers to allow for an interface with the system of the present invention.","One of the methods by which the association of selected text search terms with particular definitions, and particular term association records in the term association database, could be conducted is explicitly contemplated to be the provision of an interface whereby a drop down or a pick list of the corresponding term association records or relevant information therefrom was displayed to a user upon the typing of the particular text search term into the search form of the search engine in question.","A method of serving contextually relevant advertising or other content is also explicitly contemplated. Capturing, either automatically or manually, a definitional association with the term association record from the term association database in the semantically associated text index of the present invention would allow for the searching of contextually relevant advertising content when a user went with their browser to visit a website. In an even more advanced or enhanced version of that semantically associated server method, rather than somehow trying to have the user or the client browser indicate manually or automatically a particular term association, it could also be the case that the development of the necessary content association records in the content association database of the index of the present invention would provide for the primary means of serving contextually relevant information. For example, advertisers wishing to advertise in respect of apples, as fruit, rather than as computers, could purchase that type of an advertising approach from the search engine provider in the search engine provider could in turn know which electronic documents or webpages on the Internet related to apples as fruit, rather than as computers, based upon content association records captured in the content association database of the index of the present invention by users using an otherwise in the search environment.","Provision of a service bureau by which access to be provided to this type of the semantically associated text index for the purpose of enhancing advertising or other content serving is also contemplated to be one embodiment of the present invention.","By providing a data structure within which at least one text search term in a particular electronic document can be associated with its appropriate definition, the method and database of the present invention allow for searching and other e-commerce methods to be conducted with more relevance and accuracy. The data structure itself as well as the method of its population and exploitation are contemplated within the scope of the present invention as is the operation of the service bureau or the exploitation of the semantically associated text index outlined herein as a component of an advertising server.","The text catalog might not be resident in the actual data structure of the semantically associated text index and might rather be the previously created or existing text catalog of a search engine, wherein the use of the semantically associated text index of the present invention along with this at externally hosted or supplied text catalog will allow for the practice of the present invention as an overlay or a refinement to the operation of the search engine or the provider of the text catalog in question.","The following narrative is intended to generally speaking described the operation of the selected illustrative embodiments of the present invention, for the purpose of outlining or enabling its operation to those skilled in the art. Review of this information will, to those skilled in the art, also infer or disclose reasonable modifications or extensions of the described subject matter, all of which are also contemplated within the scope hereof.","Present day internet search engines typically provides that a purely text-based search is applied to an index collected or administered by the search engine to yield the first result set which is primarily focused upon the presence of the selected text search terms or words within the content of the pages in question. On occasion, the search engine then also applies some kind of an internal algorithm or refinement which might endeavor to try and definitionally restrict the contents of the search query or to rank them, either by definitional relevance or more likely than not by other advertising factors such as whether or not certain key words have been purchased by advertisers on the search engine etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"]},"One of the key concepts which differentiates the present invention from the prior art and will result in the assembly of a superior definitionally-oriented text index is the fact that the method by which it is anticipated that text search terms will be associated with definitions in respect of individual content pages or assets will be driven or significantly assisted by the community of search engine users, insofar as the user would select the desired definition of individual text search terms as the search query was configured for submission, and then based upon either the specific selection or submission of the identification of the content in question from the search results as being particularly relevant to the terms in question, or even in an automatic fashion based upon viewing or access of that content from the query results set, the pages in question within the results set would be associated with the proper definitions for the text search terms in question and based on this \u201ccommunity\u201d or aggregation approach, the assembly of a relational index which has individual entries made by some human selection or guidance and criteria applied in its assembly rather than simply being mechanically generated by a computer will result in the higher accuracy and relevancy on a concept level of subsequent search results or uses of the index in question.","Semantically Associated Text Index:","The core of the present invention is a semantically associated text index  which can be used to provide refined Internet search engine results as well as being capable of being used in other applications for the refinement of the delivery of various Internet content or services. The text index  of the present invention will allow for the conduct of a text-oriented search of a plurality of text-based electronic documents . Each electronic document  is a webpage or other file which it is desired to include within the index  so that can be searched and accessed by a user.","The actual data structure of the text indexing question will be any data structure which is capable of being stored in a memory for access by at least one application program being executed a data processing system. The data processing system in question would be a search engine or other search program employing the semantic associations search methodology of the present invention. The specific details of the data structure could vary based upon the network infrastructure or other tools being used in the operation of the system of the present invention and any modifications or adjustments to the overall concept outlined herein which still result in the end result of practicing the semantic associations search method of the present invention are all contemplated within the scope hereof.","The data structure of the text index will include at least one contents record which corresponds to electronic document. The content record would identify at least one text search term which was present within the electronic document. In addition to at least one contents record, the data structure would also include at least one term association record which signified the connection of a particular text search term, or word, with a particular semantic definition. More than one semantic definition for individual terms to be contained within the database, and more than one term could be associated with a single semantic definition. Finally there would be at least one content association record in the data structure which would link a term association record from the structure with a content record. Basically, the content association record would connect the presence of a particular text search term in an electronic document with the semantic definition of that term in that particular document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIGS. 3 and 4","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIGS. 3 and 4"],"b":["21","5","21"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"5"},"The first content collection which is required for the practice of the present invention is a text catalog , which would contain, in an accessible data structure, content records corresponding to each of the electronic documents which is desired to index or search in accordance with the present invention. Dependent upon the design of the data structure in question, the text catalog  might contain individual records or links identifying the electronic documents with single text search terms contained therein, or might take some other format which is practical and understood to one skilled in the art of database and indexed design. Overall, the intention of the text catalog  is to comprise a listing of all of the words which are found in the individual electronic documents  with a key referencing each occurrence of those terms back to the electronic document  in question.","The specific methods and means of constructing a bare text catalog will be understood by one skilled in the art\u2014any type of the data structure which is accessible by the remainder of the software components required within the scope of the present invention and which basically outlines the contents of the individual electronic documents in question and associates the text contents of those documents with their identity will be within the scope of the present invention.","Each electronic document  is identified in the text catalog  by a location identifier  and the text contents of each such electronic document  are captured in the text catalog  typically by a spidering engine or some other similar type of searching approach [the precise method of population of a text index is understood by those skilled in the art of search engine programming and the various approaches which could be taken to that will be understood to be contemplated within the scope of the present invention].","The second key component of the data structure of the semantically associated text index  required for execution of the present invention, shown at  in , is a plurality of term association records, in this case shown in a term association database .","The term association database  would contain at a minimum a plurality of term records  each corresponding to a particular text search term , a plurality of definition records  each corresponding to a predefined term definition , and a concordance comprising a plurality of term association records  each linking a particular term record  with a particular definition record . Again, there will be obvious modifications or alterations to this type of a basic data structure which will not the part from the scope and intention of the present invention obvious to one skilled in the art of database or search engine indexed design and all such modifications are again contemplated within the scope hereof.","The third element of the semantically associated text index  which is shown in  is a content association database  which will actually be the key repository of results from the operation of the system of the present invention. While the text catalog  and the term association database  include the base information upon which semantic associations can be drawn between the use of specific terms  having particular definitions  in specific electronic documents , it is the content association database  which will contain the correlation between electronic documents , text search terms  and definitions . In the content association database  as shown there are a plurality of content association records, each of which links a particular term association record with a particular content record i.e. links a particular definitionally associated text search term with a particular electronic document.","The method of population and exploitation of the content association database  will be explained in more detail elsewhere herein but what is effectively intended is that the content association database  would contain cross-references between content records  in the text catalog  and term association records  in the term association database  based upon the selection of particular definitions  for text search terms  from the text search term association database  by the user at the time of execution of a query against the semantically associated text index . The structure of the content association database  then would be that it would contain a plurality of content association records , each of which would identify a particular contents record  from the text catalog  and would also identify a particular term association record  from the term association database .","The content association database , by its correlation of content records  with term association records , would contain an indication that in the webpage shown in , for example, the use of the term \u201capples\u201d referred to the Apple computer company rather than apple fruit, which is referenced in the webpage shown in . A sample content association record  is shown at the bottom of this Figure. Also shown in the sample record on that Figure is a user identifier which might be included in the contents of the content association database  which could be used to provide user specific feedback or functionality in the use of the index  of the present invention.","As more searches were conducted by users of the system of the present invention, and more content association records  were created in the content association database  as more associations between terms and definitions within certain electronic documents was captured, there would be additional strength developed in the content association database  insofar as there could actually begin to develop enough data within which to assess the strength or weakness of a particular definitional association with a particular electronic document  based upon the number and details of content association records  corresponding thereto within the database . Again, the detailed operation and assembly of the semantically associated text index  of the present invention will be described in further detail elsewhere herein but this gives a general description of the three essential components to the text index  itself which are both required for the sake of data capture as well as for the sake of extracting definitionally relevant search results from the text index  of the present invention.","While  shows three separate database elements , ,  as components of the semantically associated text index , it will be understood that separate database elements are simply shown for the purpose of demonstrating different approaches which could be taken to the data structure in question and that all three of those database elements could also be a part of one single relational database. The specific data structure chosen for execution of the method of the present invention will, it will be understood by those skilled in the art, be capable of modifications or rendering in various forms are types without departing from the intended or described form and function outlined herein.","Text Catalog:","The semantically associated text index  of the present invention could contain its own integrally hosted text catalog , or could rely upon an externally hosted text catalog . In the context of an integrally hosted text catalog , the search engine system of the present invention could contain its own set of spidering components or other necessary software tools capable of aggregating and building, along with providing access to, a text catalog  containing an index of the details of a plurality of electronic documents , along with their location identifiers .","In the case of reliance upon an externally hosted text catalog , the search engine system of the present invention would not itself need to contain the software components to actually aggregate or construct the text catalog  from the contents of the plurality of electronic documents  cataloged therein. It is specifically contemplated that the remainder of the system of the present invention could be constructed such that a pre-existing search engine with an appropriate API could be used as the text catalog  upon which the remainder of the method of the present invention could be constructed or practiced. This would lessen the infrastructure requirements on the system of the present invention and there are many different search engines or text catalogs  available at present which have very effectively and efficiently accomplished their objectives of building a text catalog  and will in appropriate circumstances make that available to outside systems or vendors.","The specific data structure of the text catalog , or its operation in terms of the execution of a text-based search query, can vary, so long as the general concept of the conduct of a text-based content query can be accommodated by that text catalog  and the associated software components which are used to access and search the contents records  contained therein which correspond to the occurrence of particular text search terms  within particular electronic documents .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["2","21","19","2","9","21","9","21"]},"The text catalog  which is shown in this Figure is shown as a separate part of the data structure for the purpose of demonstrating the possibility of either an internal or external connection or availability of the text catalog  as a part of the overall structure of the semantically associated text index  up the present invention. It will be understood that the text catalog  along with the remaining components shown in  could each be administered as a separate portion of a distributed data structure, or in certain circumstances might all be tied together in a single relational database, and that the precise nature of this structure or so long as those components remain effectively the interoperable to accomplish the remainder of the objectives of the present invention are contemplated herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 3 and 4"],"b":["2","2","9","21","21","2","20"]},"The specific nature of the data structure which is used in a text index to properly catalogue and even prioritize based on the recurrence or prevalence of particular text search terms in particular pages will be understood to those skilled in the art and is to a large degree not relevant to the discussion herein. As well it is contemplated that there may be data structures which could be used within the text catalog  which would minimize the number of contents records  by perhaps identifying in relation to individual electronic documents  more than one term  contained therein and that such optimizations in the data structure are contemplated to not depart from the scope and intention of the present invention.","The creation or maintenance of the text catalog component  of the system of the present invention can be done in many conventional ways\u2014it is primarily contemplated that the remainder of the system of the present invention would rely upon a pre-existing text catalog component , either hosted internally or more likely hosted externally by one or more search engine companies, and the semantic associations which will be conducted by the use of the system of the present invention could be maintained separately by the system of the present invention and then integrated with the text catalogs  of the search engine to provide results.","Association of Terms and Definitions:","At the heart of the creation of the semantically associated text index of the present invention is the inclusion of the term association database  component or similar structure within the index  as a whole. One of the key elements to the success of the present invention is the ability or the necessity to be able to associate particular words or text search terms with their dictionary definitions [or perhaps slang definitions, trademark definitions etc. in terms of developing a full spectrum of the different uses of particular text search terms].","Specifically, the term association database  would contain at a minimum a plurality of term records  each corresponding to a particular text search term , a plurality of definition records  each corresponding to a predefined term definition , and a concordance comprising a plurality of term association records  each linking a particular term record  with a particular definition record . The use of this type of the structure including the term association records  will allow for many to many relationships to exist in the term association database , whereby a single term , represented in a term record , can be associated with more than one predetermined definition and its corresponding definition record  by the existence of the corresponding number of term association record  and similarly one definition, represented by definition record , could be correlated to more than one term  and its related term record  again by the creation of multiple term association records  or pointers in that portion of the data structure.","A predefined list of definitions  will be used so that definitive cross-references between related terms  and different terms  sharing similar definitions  can be established in the dataset maintained by the system of the present invention. Use of a predetermined list of definitions  in the semantically referenced text index  will also be key to streamline the user selection and data entry process. One of the other benefits to the use of a predetermined list of definitions from which the desired definition for a particular term can be selected is that multiple terms sharing a single definition can be cross-referenced or defined so that the execution of a search query seeking content using one of the related text search terms can, by incorporation or reliance upon that cross-reference also pull up references to other content which may be related to the same definition that use other text search terms sharing that same definition rather than the words selected by the user in the search query.","As a starting point it is contemplated that the term association database  of the present invention would include complete sets of definitions from one or more dictionaries, so that when the remainder of the system of the present invention was presented with a particular word or text search term it was able to generate a list of possible or probable definitions of that term which could be associated.  demonstrates a sample of a snippet from one embodiment of a term association database  which might be used in accordance with the remainder of the present invention. It will be understood by one skilled in the art as the specific data structure of the term association database numeral for or that component of the remainder of the index  of the present invention could take many forms dependent upon the software tools used to execute the remainder of the system and method of the present invention.","The specific nature of the data structure of the term association database  is in large part not relevant to the operation of the system of the present invention and on that basis could be executed in many ways without departing from the scope hereof. In this particular example, there is shown a sample of a database table with four columns. There is shown a column containing a listing of potential text search terms , potential definitions corresponding to those text search terms , as well as a serial identifier for each record in the database shown at  and a cross-reference field shown at .","Referring briefly to  to demonstrate further some of the association concepts, it can be seen that the term  \u201capple\u201d for example at least three predetermined definitions  in that table. [There likely would be more if different commercial sources, trademarks, dictionaries etc. were included in the table but this should be sufficient for demonstration purposes]. Based on whatever number of definitions  are stored within the term association database , a pick list of those definitions could be presented to a user to basically select the proper definition  for the term \u201capple\u201d  if they wish to use that term in the execution of a semantically enhanced query. The most relevant located results can then be tagged the definitions  chosen for the text search terms  by the user so that in the future, additional searches which are conducted by the user, or by other users of the system, can then rely on the fact that one or more references have previously been tagged as relating to Apple \u201cfruit\u201d rather than Apple the computer company.","Dependent upon the data structure used in the term association database , the term records in , definition records  and term association records  may comprise separate records in separate data structures, or it is also contemplated that there could be a circumstance in which there would simply be a term association record  created in respect of each term  and definition  pairing.","Association of Related Terms:","The \u201cdefinition ID\u201d  could potentially just be any serial key which would be applied to individual entries in the definition table or data structure in a typical database. The generation or application of such a key to entries or records in the database will be known and understood to those skilled in the art. One of the primary benefits to using a single centralized set of definitions  is that based on the use of this key , searches executed using this type of a database or an index could include references to other terms  which share the same definition  but which may not be spelled in any way remotely similarly to the text search term  selected by the user so they may not otherwise be returned. One simple example of this which is demonstrated in the table is if a user was searching for some type of information on the Internet about repairing their \u201ctoilet\u201d. The table demonstrates that the phrase \u201ctoilet\u201d shares the same definition  with the phrase \u201cwater closet\u201d, so that the text index and system of the present invention could return relevant results which ranked \u201cwater closet\u201d references similar to those based on the word \u201ctoilet\u201d even though the user may not have selected one or the other of those two text search terms . The sharing of a single definitional record is demonstrated by the same definition ID  being used on each of those two records in the table demonstrated. The ability to extract information and provide further detailed results to the user with these associations of different terms which share similar definitions even though they do not share the same spelling or context is one of the key benefits to the approach taken by the present invention to provide contextually or semantically enhanced text search results.","One final item which is demonstrated by the \u201ccross-reference\u201d  column in  is that of the ability to over time accumulate cross-references  in the database  between potentially related and yet not definitionally equivalent terms . For example, the Figure demonstrates a link between different records in the ontology of terms related to the Apple Computer entries. A search for \u201cMacintosh\u201d in which Macintosh computers, rather than Macintosh apples, were the desired search results could somehow direct the user to additional references related to Apple Computer as a logical extension of the search.","Content Association:","At the heart of the present invention is a content association data structure  within the index , within which the association of particular electronic documents  with the particular definitions  of particular terms  appearing therein is contained. Extending the basic analogy or example from above related to differentiation between Apple Computer and apple fruit, by keeping a data structure within which various content items can specifically be associated with definitions of terms allows the Internet search user for example to effectively ask the question of a search engine \u201cfind me references related to macintosh apples\u201d which will then theoretically either ignore or demote in the search results items related to Apple Computer or other definitions of the term \u201capple\u201d. This is the key concept at the heart of the entire invention.","The content association database  of the overall text index  contemplated herein would effectively create a bridge between the text catalog  and the term association component . It is specifically contemplated that the content association database  would contain content association records  which would effectively match up the occurrence of particular terms  having particular definitions  within particular electronic documents . Mechanically it is contemplated that the content association database  would actually be populated by use of the search engine of the present invention by users\u2014upon execution of the query using the system of the present invention, described in further detail below, upon identification of certain electronic documents  by the user that are particularly relevant to the text search terms  chosen and the definitions  desired, content association records  would be created in the content association database  on this basis so that in the execution of a subsequent query by the same or another user seeking content related to a particular definition of a particular text search term, the association of that particular definition and text search term in the term association database  with respect to the particular electronic documents in question would have previously been catalogued and could be used to refine or serve back a targeted result to the search engine user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11","FIG. 7","FIG. 9","FIG. 3"],"b":["3","3","3","26","2","25","26","2","4","25","2","26","26","5","5","5","5"]},"Overview of System Components and Operation:","At the heart of the invention is a semantically associated text index, and its collection or aggregation by capturing the definitional associations of various text search terms appearing in various electronic documents identified within the index with a predefined list of definitions so a subsequent user selecting the same or other text search terms and relating to the same definition will be able to identify similar content It is also contemplated within the scope of the present invention that the use of that index  as a component of a search engine is explicitly contemplated herein, along with the use of that index as a component of a selective content serving platform.","Hardware:","In providing an example of one embodiment of a website search system in accordance with the present invention we will generally speaking outline a single hardware configuration for the operation of a search engine system in accordance with the present invention relying upon an externally hosted text catalog . There are virtually endless ways of configuring different hardware and software combinations to render or practice the search method and information aggregation method of the present invention and as such the outline of a single hardware configuration here is not intended to provide any restriction on the scope of the allowable subject matter of the present invention insofar as any such modification to the design of the infrastructure of such an embodiment does not depart from the overall scope or intention of the present invention and its use in the provision of semantically oriented search services.","Referring to the embodiment of a search engine website system demonstrated in , there is shown a typical data processing system or environment which will be understood to those skilled in the art of website and web infrastructure design. There are firstly shown a plurality of client computers at  which would each be equipped with a browser capable of accessing content served from the website system  of the present invention as well as from other websites or servers connected to the Internet. The network connection of those client computers  to the system  of the present invention and elsewhere is demonstrated by the TCP\/IP cloud shown at .","As indicated above, the particular embodiment of the website system  of the invention shown in this Figure is reliant upon an externally provided text catalog \u2014as outlined above, it is explicitly contemplated that one of the primary applications of the service provided by the website of the present invention will be to effectively act as an \u201coverlay\u201d on top of an existing search engine such as Google, Yahoo or the like. In this particular case the externally hosted text catalog , and a related server  are shown also in communication with the website search engine system  of the present invention. It is contemplated that the externally hosted text catalog  would be the text index of a pre-existing search engine such as Google or the like, who has designed and opened an application programming interface for access to their text index to third parties.","Within the actual website system  there is shown in the embodiment of this  servers. There is shown a content server , which includes a content store , and which would be, within the scope of the remainder of the infrastructure of the website and search engine in question, responsible for serving templates and content related to searches and other interactions of users and their computers  with the website . There is also shown a search server , which contains the necessary computer software components  to interact with user computers  as well as to interact with the semantically associated text index  which is also shown.","The user computer  would browse to the website  and would interact by serving of content from the servers  and . For example a search form could be presented at the user computer  by the server , through which the user of the computer  could interact with the searching tool of the present invention by providing and associating particular text search terms  with definitions , and reviewing search results etc.","The software components  on the server  would be capable of communication with the database components accessible thereto including the semantically associated text index  as well as potentially the content store  and the text catalog  by way of communication with the external text catalog server .","User Interface:","The website system  of the present invention could actually be a search engine on its own, connected to a text catalog  internally or externally along with the remaining tools outlined elsewhere herein and components necessary to acquire the parameters for a search from a user at a user computer , execute the search against a text catalog  and a semantically associated text index , and to serve back the results of that search to the user.","The other more likely implementation of the method of the present invention is to provide the access to the semantically associated text index  of the present invention as an overlay or an enhancement to a pre-existing search engine. Basically what is contemplated is in the case of search engines that have opened an API to developers to allow for integration of third-party components or software with their search engines, a browser plug-in or the like would basically add the functionality of the method of the present invention into the browser of the user while they conducted a search on the website of their chosen search provider.","For example, if the user was partial to using Google to do their text searching, it is possible to design the software of the present invention as a browser plug-in which can access or integrate with the Google search engine through their application programming interface and can basically rely upon the Google engine to conduct the text catalog  aspect of the search and serve back the results of the text portion of the search to the plug-in for modification or application of the method of refining the search results based upon the contents of the semantically associated text index  of the present invention. Both approaches, namely the standalone software outlined above as well as practicing the method of refining text searches using a semantically associated text index  using a plug-in or overlay to a pre-existing search engine through an application programming interface are contemplated within the scope of the present invention.","The data processing system of the present invention where it was delivered as a website system would comprise at least one processor, memory operatively connected to the at least one processor [likely in the Web server], display device operative to display data which would potentially be a client browser, and the program modules stored in the memory and operative for providing instructions to the processor\u2014this would basically be the software components resident on the Web server in the website system or client\/server context. The program module would be capable of accessing and delivering semantically associated text search results as outlined in accordance with the remainder of the invention, and would access the data structure as outlined elsewhere herein in terms of the electronic documents catalogued and the association of text terms appearing therein with particular semantic definitions.","In the context of a freestanding software installation, the memory and processor referenced in the claims could refer to a desktop or other type of a personal computer of the user with a freestanding software installed thereon. In order to deliver the maximum benefit in terms of a better populated text index, in the instance where the software was run locally on a local computer rather than in a client\/server website model, it is likely the case that the data structure or text index itself would be resident on a server which would be operatively connected with that local computer for communication purposes.","The system could create new content association records between particular electronic documents and terms appearing therein either manually upon the triggering of the creation of a content association record by the user [i.e. in the display of the search results, a flag or something could be provided which the user could click or otherwise interact with to indicate their ranking or de-ranking of that particular search result, which would result in the creation of a content association record in association with the electronic document and text search terms in question]. It could also be the case that the software of the present invention could be programmed to automatically sense interaction with particular search results by the user and automatically create content association records in the system of the present invention in the background. In either case, broadening the population of the text index itself will deepen the utility of the system and the database of the present invention and any type of a particular means of the triggering of creation of content association records within the database in question as is obvious to one skilled in the art of database and website programming are contemplated within the scope of the present invention.","For the sake of describing the remainder of the subject matter herein, we will speak of an embodiment in which we have designed a plug-in to implement the method of the present invention in terms of categorizing electronic documents  for cataloging and subsequent use in the content association database  of the index  of the present invention, as well as applying the refinement of the semantically associated text index  of the present invention to a purely text-based search result. We specifically to date have tested this with the Google search engine although subject to modifying the programming of the plug-in to interact with different types of browsers or search engine APIs it will be understood to one skilled in the art that those mechanical modifications do not depart from the intention and scope of the present invention.","Use of the Index in Search:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},"Looking first at Step -, the user would enter their selected text search terms  into the search interface. Entry of their selected text search terms  would require them to also associate each of their text search terms , or selected of their text search terms , with one of the predefined definitions  of those terms  as identified in the term association database . An ideal interface for the user in this respect is to provide the user with a pick list of definitions for each term in a drop-down fashion or the like so that as the user enters a word, a drop-down list with a pre-qualified and predetermined list of associated definitions shows below the term and the user can simply select one [or if they wished to not define a particular term in the query they could also be provided with the option to not do so].","The user could be provided with the ability to provide \u201coperators\u201d along with the text search terms in normal fashion as might be understood by those familiar with the use of search engines or querying languages. For example the use of \u201cand\u201d, \u201cor\u201d or \u201cnot\u201d, to expand or restrict the results set, could be allowed within the language and set up of the interface of the system of the present invention.","Following through in , Step - shows the searching of the text catalog  for the text search terms  selected by the user. Basically the text catalog  would be searched for a raw results set  which would basically contain identification of all of the electronic documents  contained within the text catalog  which contained the selected text search terms . At this point the text search terms  would have only been identified from the text catalog  based on their spelling or their presence in the search results.","The next step, shown at -, is to process the raw results set  based on the definitional associations of the text search terms  which were previously selected by the user. This step would entail the comparison of the located electronic documents  to electronic documents  identified by content association records  in the content association database  to ascertain whether or not any of the results returned in that raw results set  had been previously identified within the semantically associated text index  as having used the text search term or text search terms  in question in association with the definitions  selected by the user at the time of entry of the query. For example, had some previous user already populated the content association database  with a pointer indicating that a particular electronic document  that used the word \u201capple\u201d referred to apples as fruit rather than apples as computers. If this type of a content association record  already existed in the content association database  and it was the \u201capples as fruit\u201d definitional association which the user was seeking when they entered their query and associated their selected text search terms with definitions from the term association database , the \u201cprocessing\u201d of the raw results set  might entail the elevation or ranking of those particular identified assets  at the top of the search results as potentially being most relevant. As the system of the present invention is used and the population of the content association database  increases, the relevance and utility of the search engine and the semantically associated text index  of the present invention will be enhanced.","Step - in  refers to the display of the processed results set  to the user. As outlined above, what this contemplates is that if the content association database  results in the identification of certain items within the raw results set  is being particularly definitionally relevant to the selected text search terms and definitions for the query those would be elevated or highlighted in the search.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 15"],"b":["7","14","1","8","9","8","9","10","4","9","8","10","9"]},"They could then go on to enter more text search terms  or if they were finished entering text search terms  to move on with the execution of their search. Also as outlined above where more than one text search term is being entered standard query operators and language could be used to expand or restrict the scope of the results set. Where query operators were used to expand or restrict the results set, those could either be used to simply expand or restrict the results of the text search on the text catalog , or they could be applied to the definitional selections of the text search terms  which would result in an even more surgical expansion or restriction of the results set based upon the text search terms  selected insofar as the operators would also be centered upon, to the extent that the necessary content association records  were available on the content association database  the text search terms in question having the appropriate definitions  in addition to simply being present within the electronic documents  in question.","One of the additional strengths of the method of the present invention is that it allows for the development over time of a dataset within the term association database  which can identify different terms which share the same definition\u2014for example the \u201ctoilet\u201d\/\u201cwater closet\u201d example. One of the things which could be done by the system of the present invention would be to feed those alternate terms to the search engine through the API at the time that the remainder of the search is conducted, to enhance the contents of the results.","Display Query Results:","Displaying the search results once processed, as mentioned at Step -, could comprise the ordering or ranking of the raw results set  based upon the existence or application of certain content associations from the content association database  to the raw results. There are also other means by which the results of the refinement or application of the contents of the semantically associated text index  of the present invention to the raw results  could be shown to the user, including display of visual indicators, highlights etc. of certain references in the results set etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0104"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":["16","5"]},"Population of the Content Association Database:","The content association database  could be, to a degree, pre-populated with content association records  corresponding to a basic quantity of electronic documents . However, whether or not the content association database  is pre-populated, it is contemplated that the primary method of population of the content association database  will be by the capture or creation of content association records  in that database  by the system  of the present invention as the system  is used by users to generate searches and relevant electronic documents  corresponding to certain definitions of certain text search terms are identified by those users.","One of the primary aspects of the method of the present invention which will enhance its utility over time to all users is that as users conduct searches using the system of the present invention resulting in the creation of further content association records  in the content association database , the accuracy and utility of the processing ability of the method of the present invention, to reorder, rank or prioritize pure text results in a raw results set  based on actual definitional associations of text search terms by users will increase. Every time that a particular electronic document  or Web page is located using the search interface of the present invention, a content association record  can be created in the content association database  for each text search term  and its related definition  that was selected by the user in the query result in the location of that particular webpage. For example, if at Step - the user enters and associates six text search terms  with specific definitions  from the terms association database , and the user finds the first eight search results from that processed results set  to have been useful or relevant to their query, that can result in the creation of perhaps  new content association records  within the content association database  [in the circumstance where each of the six selected text search terms and their definitions were indicated by the user to be relevant to each of those eight records\u2014basically there would all of a sudden be the ability to say that each of the text search terms where used in each of those eight specific electronic documents  had a specific definition.] Step - in this figure shows that the capture of further content associations to the content association database  would take place during the display or review of the processed results set . The capture of these content associations during search transactions by users is key to the expansion of the population of the content association database  and enhancing over time the efficiency and efficacy of the semantically associated text index  of the present invention as a search refining tool.","Capture of content associations for the creation of additional content association records  within the content association database  could take place in numerous ways. The user could be presented with the ability to manually by clicking their mouse or selecting an option profile a particular electronic document  into the content association database  in association with their selected text search terms \u2014in this type of approach, the user could also be presented with the option to only associate certain of their selected text search terms  with the electronic document  in question so if for example the user determined that the definition of one of the terms that they had wished to incorporate into the query was not satisfied by the result but the other five, in the example of six being provided, then five content association records could be created in the content association database  without creating a content association record  in respect of the one term which the user did not feel was accurately defined or represented within the content of the asset  in question.","Beyond a manual capture method such as this, whereby upon selection of an option within the browser the user could cause the profiling of a particular asset  into the content association database  it will also be understood that different types of fully or partially automated capture could be created. For example, if the assumption is made that a search result that is viewed for longer than an introductory period of time, i.e. suggesting or indicating that the user when they clicked into that result from the results set spent enough time looking at it that it can be assumed that they found it useful, it could also be possible to create content association records  in the content association database  in respect of that result based on the presence of the user's browser on that particular results page for a period of time. In a more elaborately ranked ontology it may be the case that manually ranked pages were given a heavier weighting than the automatically ranked pages. It may also be the case that the weighting of rankings assigned by particular users could be adjusted to be higher or lower based on the quality or quantity of their interaction with the system of the present invention.","Alternate Delivery Environments:","As outlined elsewhere herein it is possible that the semantically associated text index  and the system and method of the present invention could be used in various environments either including the delivery of an Internet search engine or search environment, which is the primary immediate intention or goal here, or also the method of the present invention could in another foreseeable iteration be developed for deployment in an internal or closed environment where the necessary tools for the aggregation of semantic association information and the provision of search services might be deployed on an internal or closed network.","Serving Semantically Accurate Content:","One of the key aspects of the present invention is that, beyond the obvious utility of the semantically associated text index  in a personal search context, the aggregation of that index  and specifically the content association records  therein will result in a tool which is of great commercial value in other applications in the Internet context as well. It is for example specifically contemplated that the use of an ontology such as this in the background in the identification and serving of appropriate and relevant advertising content is a key part of the present invention. It can be foreseen that there would be an embodiment of the software of the present invention which could even be developed or implemented by the provider of the text search engine to an aggregated data structure such as that outlined or advocated herein for the purpose of providing targeted and accurate advertising content based on the content of the remainder of the page being served. It is contemplated that the aggregation of the content association database  component in the context of the operation of a personal search engine provides perhaps the search engine at no cost to the public, with the benefit of providing an enhanced search experience, and the data which is harvested or gained from the use of that engine by the users could then be used in addition to providing enhanced search services to individuals also to provide at a cost to advertisers or web providers the ability to target or refine the serving of advertising content in conjunction with webpages based upon the contents of the index .","Combination of Query Results from Multiple Search Engines:","One additional aspect of the present invention is a method of the combination of search results from multiple search engines using a single user interface. It is contemplated that the execution of searches against multiple search engines or content databases, yielding multiple search results, would be simplified and made easier for a user to interact with and to use if it was possible to execute this type of the searching strategy by single entry of the search parameters in a single search engine, with all of the results being returned and combined for solitary displayed to the user at the interface of that first search engine.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},"Referring to , at -, the user would enter their search query parameters through the interface or computer software of the present invention. It is primarily contemplated that the user interface in this case would be a browser plug-in incorporated into the user interface of a pre-existing search engine although it could also as outlined above with respect to the remainder of this invention be a freestanding computer software. In any event, the user would enter their desired query parameters at this step in the process.","The next step in the process, demonstrated at -, would be the execution of the search using the query parameters entered by the user against a first content database. The first content database would potentially be the content database or catalog of the first search engine through which user interface the browser plug-in or other software would be used to obtain user input and provide user output\u2014the first content database in any event could be a search engine or it could be the semantically defined text index of the present invention.","The next step in the process following the execution of the search against the first content database is the passing of the same search parameters to additional search engines or search catalogs\u2014this is shown in the next step - in this Figure. Basically what is contemplated is that the search query parameters would be passed along electronically to the search engines or software engines associated with the additional content database or database against which it was desired to run the search for inclusion or combination with the contents of the first content database\u2014while it is explicitly contemplated that the combination of two search results from two search engines could be accomplished is also contemplated that more than two search engines could also be searched to provide this type of behavior a result. Searches would be executed against each additional search engine or database, shown at -.","The additional result sets returned from each of the additional search engines or databases searched would be returned in some way to the first search engine system for combination with the first result set. The return of the results set could either be a return of the league to a more exhaustive data file resident upon the additional engine or website system, or it could be a more detailed set of information which was properly formatted or parsed for reading and action by the software of the present invention and\/or the software of the first content database for search engine.","The results set from the first search or first content database, and the results sets from the additional content databases, would be combined into a single and search result. Single and search result could then be re-ordered, sorted or otherwise prioritized in advance of its final displayed to the end user. Combination, reordering and display of this information is shown at steps - through -.","It is explicitly contemplated that this search result combination method, whereby results from multiple search engines would be combined and displayed together in a single user interface, is applicable beyond the scope of the semantic search index outlined elsewhere herein, although it is also explicitly contemplated that the semantic search index herein could be used in combination with the search results from one or more additional search engines to provide for a combined or ranked or prioritized search results as well. The use of this method of combining search results within the context of the semantically defined text index of the present invention, or beyond the semantically defined text index of the present invention, is explicitly contemplated within the scope of the present invention.","The foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention.
