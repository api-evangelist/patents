abstract: In a communication system, a subscriber unit includes a storage device storing an application program to determine for transmission a current reserved bandwidth and a transmission parameter based on a quality of based on a quality of service profile, and an adapter to communicate data over a wireless network (e.g., a general packet radio service network) that supports a service, satisfying a reliability requirement for the service. The adapter may dynamically adjust the transmission parameter for the transmission before retransmitting one or more packets of data, e.g., at a rate and retransmission times commensurate with the current reserved bandwidth, and the reliability requirement in addition to the a current quality of service profile, ensuring a service level which otherwise cannot be provided by an infrastructure negotiated quality of service, especially in relatively shorter flows of data.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention relates generally to content transmission over networks, and more particularly to transmitting data for services over a general packet radio service wireless network.","A service may involve transmission or exchange of information, in the form of packets of data over a communication network, between a service provider and a subscriber unit, cooperatively communicating based on a network protocol, such as a Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) stack. In a network protocol stack, among other layers, a transport layer may be responsible for reliably transferring data between two endpoints using source and destination addresses. Although many factors including available bandwidth determine the transmission or flow of data associated with a service, a network may render different quality of services or class of service agreements for several users in myriad applications. Different user applications may transfer data using a quality of service (QoS) that may be negotiated based on available general packet radio service (GPRS) network resources.","In some situations, however, the negotiated QoS alone may not meet one or more requirements of user or upper layer applications. For example, an upper layer application of the TCP\/IP network protocol stack, which requires the packet loss rate less than 0.001, cannot be satisfied with a service reliability class of the general packet radio service in which the packet loss rate of 0.01 is guaranteed. In some services, short transfers of data result in idle connections that may introduce latency, making the TCP\/IP network protocol stack even more unsuitable in the delivery of short flows of data. Therefore, a gap exists between an application requirement for providing a service and the negotiated QoS.","Thus, there is a continuing need for better ways to transmit data for services over a general packet radio service wireless network.","A communication system , shown in , includes a subscriber unit  capable of subscribing to a service supported by a data transport network  in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The communication system  further includes a service provider  that may render at least one service to the subscriber unit  over the data transport network . A host of services including telecommunication services may be provided in one embodiment. The subscriber unit  and the service provider  may be physically located at different locations, however, both may cooperatively communicate using the data transport network , exchanging communications associated with the service. Although, a client-server architecture is illustrated for the communication system , other suitable architectures, such as a distributed architecture may be deployed in some embodiments of the present invention.","In some embodiments, one or more network or service operators may offer their customers, for example, a bearer service, which provides a transport mechanism capable of exchanging information over a bearer network, i.e., the data transport network . The service requirements that transmission of data may meet while providing a bearer service on the data transport network  may include an allocation of certain bandwidth. For example, various services and their users may indicate a specific bandwidth demand on the data transport network . However, end user requirements may determine the service parameters, such as a quality of service (QoS) while communicating data for a service user or subscriber between the subscriber unit  and the service provider  over the data transport network .","As one example, increasing number of services and service operators create a relatively large demand for bandwidth, such as during the transmission of packet-based data over a general packet radio service (GPRS). Moreover, the information flow of data traffic may display burstiness between a highest and an average data traffic values. The data exchange between clients (e.g., personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobile phones) and a server providing a service may be inefficient because the data may be transferred in short transfers which may be spaced out by long idle durations. Such short transfers and idle durations may introduce undesired latency, making delivery of short flows of data on the data transport network  unsuitable.","Using a relatively more reliable, fast end-to-end retransmission and a resource reservation protocol (RSVP) based quality of service (QoS) negotiation, a packet-switched bearer service may support short flows of data with a desired quality of service over the data transport network  in one embodiment. Consistent with one embodiment, for the purposes of providing data delivery service over GPRS wireless network (GPRS, defined by European Telecommunications Institute (ETSI), is a kind of wireless network infrastructure), transport and control (a real-time transport protocol (RTP), a real-time transport control protocol (RTCP)) and reservation protocols defined in RFC 1889 and RFC 2205 specifications may be deployed. Both the RFC 1889 and RFC 2205 specifications are set forth by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Audio\/Video Transport Working Group in specifications entitled \u201cRTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications, Internet Official Protocol Standards, STD 1,\u201d RFC 1889, published in January 1996 and \u201cResource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP)\u2014Version 1 Functional Specification, Internet Official Protocol Standards, STD 1,\u201d RFC 2205, published in September 1997.","Over the data transport network , which in one embodiment may be a general packet radio service (GPRS) wireless network, a service subscriber using the subscriber unit  may communicate with the service provider  to exchange media content including voice, video and\/or data at a rate that matches a transmission metric, such as reserved bandwidth during transmission in one embodiment. The reserved bandwidth for the transmission may be determined based on a quality of service profile in one embodiment. While communicating one or more packets of data over the data transport network  within the reserved bandwidth, at least one transmission parameter for the transmission may be dynamically adjusted, satisfying a service requirement in addition to the quality of service profile. For example, transmission rate and transmission times may be dynamically determined for the packets of data by current network conditions of the data transport network  in one embodiment.","Essentially, a service characteristic, such as a quality of service (QoS) indicative of at least one of a desired service level, reliability and class may be received in a quality of service (QoS) profile at the subscriber unit . For the purposes of transmitting data, the reserved bandwidth may be determined from a QoS profile negotiation between a service subscriber and the data transport network  in one embodiment of the present invention. During the transmission, for example, one or more packets of data may be adaptively communicated over the data transport network , matching the rate of transmission with the reserved bandwidth.","For provisioning a service, the service provider  comprises a control unit  coupled to a storage device  that stores a service provider module  with an associated service database  according to one embodiment of the present invention. The service provider module  may be executed either automatically by the control unit  to operate the service provider , or alternatively in response to user inputs entered at a service provider interface . The service database  may maintain and\/or track the types of services available or provided by the service provider  in addition to storing information concerning one or more end users who may be registered in the service database , availing a particular service.","In one embodiment, the service provider  includes a server engine  that enables communications with the subscriber unit  through a provider network interface . The provider network interface  may be any one of conventional network interface cards (NICs) in one embodiment.","Consistent with one embodiment, the server engine  includes a provider application  to cooperatively interact with a counterpart located at the subscriber unit . For transferring voice, video, and\/or data pertaining to a particular service, the server engine  may use a protocol stack including a provider real-time transport protocol (RTP)\/a real-time transport control protocol (RTCP) layer engine . The RTP\/RTCP layer engine  and a provider resource reservation protocol (RSVP)  may use a transportation service provided by a combination of user datagram protocol (UDP) and an Internet protocol (IP) provider stack  in one embodiment. While the RTCP provides a reception feedback to indicate to a data sender which RTP packets are correctly received, the RSVP is responsible for an end-to-end QoS profile negotiation between a service subscriber and a GPRS network for each session, as an example. A provider network device driver  may further be provided for the server engine  to controllably adapt the provider network interface , handling transmission and reception of voice, video and\/or data over the data transport network . Any unacknowledged packets of data may be immediately retransmitted based on an automatically generated RTCP feedback, which indicates the sequence number of unacknowledged packets in some embodiments.","To use a service, the subscriber unit  includes a processor  and a memory  storing a service adapter module  to which one or more quality of service (QoS) profiles  that may be dynamically negotiated are provided in one embodiment of the present invention. Using the service adapter module , the processor  may operate the subscriber unit  within a communication or service session according to a currently negotiated quality of service profile  for that service session. The subscriber unit  further comprises a service user interface  to interactively receive inputs and\/or present outputs in one embodiment of the present invention. Besides the service user interface , the subscriber unit  may further include a client engine  to cooperatively interface with the server engine  located at the service provider . For example, both the client engine  and the server engine  may enable communications in response to an activation of a communication or service session associated with a service. A user application  may cooperatively communicate with the provider application  according to one operation of the present invention.","From a negotiated quality of service profile , at the subscriber unit , the service adapter module  may determine for transmission a reserved bandwidth that is to be made available in a particular communication or service session. To transfer one or more packets of data to the service provider , the user application  may derive a rate of transmission of the packets of data. Thereafter, during the transmission, the packets of data may be communicated over the data transport network  at the rate that matches the reserved bandwidth. The service adapter module  may determine packet transmission times and a bit rate of transmission based on the reserved bandwidth, a reliability class indicated in the currently negotiated QoS profile , and a predefined service reliability parameter for the user application .","Like the server engine , the client engine  may include a user RTP\/RTCP layer engine  and a user RSVP module . While the RTCP provides a reception feedback to indicate to a data sender which RTP packets are correctly received, the RSVP is responsible for an end-to-end QoS profile negotiation between a service subscriber and a GPRS network for each session, as an example. A combination of user datagram protocol (UDP) and an Internet protocol (IP) user stack  may provide a transportation service to the user RTP\/RTCP layer engine  and the user RSVP module  in one embodiment. While interfacing with the data transport network , a user network interface  may be controlled by a user network device driver  in some embodiments of the present invention. In one embodiment, the user network interface  may be any one of conventional modulator and demodulators (MODEMs). As another example, a wireless network interface capable of wirelessly communicating with the data transport network  may be provided in some embodiments without departing from the spirit of the present invention.","An end-to-end QoS profile negotiation, bandwidth reservation in network infrastructure or establishment may be accomplished by the RSVP and QoS signaling available with GPRS, in one case. Regardless, the dynamically negotiated quality of service profiles  or any updates thereof may be communicated to the service database  in the service provider  in some situations. Based on the resources available to the service provider  (e.g., depending upon a network operator in one embodiment), the service provider module  may enable a service to the subscriber unit  over the data transport network . Using the service adapter module , the user data transportation service may be adapted to at least meet one or more requirements of the user application .","In doing so, the subscriber unit  may negotiate with the data transport network  infrastructure for the QoS reservation establishment, tracking a service criterion for the service against a quality of service profile . In one embodiment, the service criterion may indicate one or more requirements of the user application . To meet or exceed such requirements of the user application , the service adapter module  may adapt the rate of the transmission of the packets of data and packet transmission times based on the service criterion and a current QoS profile in one embodiment of the present invention.","To transfer the data packets, user data are encapsulated by the user RTP layer engine  (i.e., the sequence number of RTP packets is assigned uniquely, as one example) and the user UDP\/IP stack  one after another, before being sent to the service provider  as IP packets by the service subscriber unit . On arrival of these IP packets, the service provider  extracts RTP sequence number and the user data in a reverse order. At the same time, a RTCP receipt indication, in which the sequence number of RTP packets may be specified may be sent to the subscriber unit  by the service provider  to acknowledge the correct reception of corresponding RTP packets. Furthermore, a buffer may be allocated to store each outgoing but unacknowledged packets at the service subscriber unit .","Specifically, in response to the receipt indication, any unacknowledged packets of data may be identified at the subscriber unit . The stored but unacknowledged packets of data may be immediately retransmitted from the subscriber unit  to the service provider  after a subscriber sends out all the packets and no new packets are generated, significantly improving the reliability and speed of the transmission, meeting the requirements of the user application  according to one embodiment of the present invention. However, the stored packets cannot be freed until they are acknowledged or the service subscriber unit  has used up all the retransmission opportunities, in one embodiment.","Consistent with one embodiment of the present invention, an end-to-end transport architecture , as shown in  includes the client engine  that connects to the server engine  over the data transport network  (FIG. ), ensuring a reliable service, which cannot be otherwise provided by an infrastructure negotiated quality of service (QoS). In one embodiment, the infrastructure negotiated QoS is a quality of service profile which may not meet the requirements of the user application .","By deploying the end-to-end transport architecture  for use with the data transport network  which may be a general packet radio service (GPRS) network, communication of data between the client engine  and server engine  may be adapted for a communication or service session in one embodiment of the present invention. Over the GPRS network, with a quality of service (QoS) support, a reliable and relatively faster end-to-end delivery service particularly for short flows of data may be provided by dynamically adapting transmission, such as a transmission rate, and\/or provisioning an immediate retransmission of any incomplete transmission, in some embodiments.","To this end, the client engine  may comprise the user application  that includes a client service negotiator , enabling a user to subscribe to and subsequently use a service, such as a packet-based or packet-switched end-to-end delivery service. The client engine  may further include a client application programming interface (API)  which may allow the user application  to initiate a QoS negotiation for a communication or service session according to one embodiment of the present invention. A client resource reservation protocol (RSVP) module  may be responsible for this quality of service negotiation with intermediate nodes (e.g., routers) over the data transport network  and the server engine  and then set up the QoS based network resource reservation including the reserved bandwidth.","However, the QoS profiles  may be updated during the data transmission in some embodiments of the present invention. As described above with respect to , both the client engine  and the server engine  may utilize protocol stacks including RTP, UDP, IP protocols according to one embodiment of the present invention.","According to one operation of the present invention, the user application  may pass user data to the user RTP layer engine  and, in turn, to the user UDP\/IP stack . The user RTP layer engine  may comprise a client-side real-time transport protocol (RTP) , a buffer  to store each outgoing and unacknowledged packet and a client-side real-time transport control protocol (RTCP)  which is a companion protocol to the real-time transport protocol . Likewise, the user UDP\/IP stack  may include a user datagram protocol (UDP)  and an Internet protocol (IP) , providing a data delivery service for upper layers, such as for the user application .","Upon initialization, the client engine  may be loaded into a storage device, such as the memory . During packet transmission, the user application  may provide a control parameter signal  corresponding to one or more control parameters (e.g., including the currently negotiated QoS profile , the number of packets to be sent, and the predefined service reliability requirement parameter) to a transmission adapter , which may dynamically adjust one or more transmission parameters associated with a current communication or service session according to the current network conditions in the data transport network . In response to the control parameter signal , one or more transmission parameters, such as a retransmission times signal and a sending rate signal may be adjusted before being provided to the user RTP . That is, in response to the control parameter signal , the transmission adapter  may dynamically adjust at least one of the retransmission times signal and the sending rate signal for the communication or service session based on the current network conditions of the data transport network .","For the server engine , the provider application  may comprise a server service negotiator , negotiating a quality of service (QoS) profile in one embodiment of the present invention. In addition, a server application programming interface (API)  operably couples to a server RSVP module  to further interface with the provider UDP\/IP stack . The server engine  may include the provider RTP layer engine  comprising a server-side real-time control protocol (RTCP)  and a server-side real-time transport portocol (RTP) . The provider UDP\/IP stack  may additionally comprise a user datagram protocol (UDP)  and an Internet protocol (IP)  to enable communication over the data transport network , in some embodiments.","In operation, the transmission adapter  may dynamically adjust transmission parameters, such as a sending rate and transmission times, according to current available network resources and an application's service requirement. In this manner, the transmission adapter  may provide for a highly reliable data delivery service, meeting reliability requirements of some applications, such as in speech data transfer while making full use of the network resources.","Specifically, the user application  at the client engine  (data sender in ) passes the user data to a transport protocol stack including the RTP  (the sequence number of the RTP packet is assigned uniquely), UDP  and IP . At the server engine , the user data is extracted and provided to the provider application  (data receiver in FIG. ). Afterwards, the server engine  sends the RTCP feedback packets, specifying sequence numbers of acknowledged RTP packets to the client engine . Furthermore, the buffer  may store each outgoing packet at the client engine .","After all the packets are sent out to the server engine  and no new user data are produced at the client engine , the client engine  records the total number of the packets to be sent and sets the maximum number of times each packet can be retransmitted. Thereafter, the client engine  retransmits the stored packet that is not acknowledged by its corresponding RTCP packet until all the packets are acknowledged or the client engine  has used up all the retransmission opportunities. In the user data transmission, the client engine  may send packets at a bit rate that matches to the reserved bandwidth, making full use of the network resources reserved based on the currently negotiated QoS profile .","More specifically, the transmission adapter  may dynamically adjust the transmission parameters, such as the data sending rate (e.g., a bit rate) and the data transmission times according to the control parameters. A data sending rate may be a rate at which the client engine  transfers data packets and dynamically depend on current reserved bandwidth so as to fully utilize current available network resources. Data transmission times is the data packet retransmission opportunity that determines how many times a packet may be delivered to the receiver and is dynamically determined by a reliability class in the current QoS profile and a predefined reliability parameter. The control parameters are passed to the transmission adapter  by the user application . One function of the transmission adapter  is to ensure a highly reliable data delivery service that may meet the reliability requirement of the user application  and efficient utilization of network resources.","In one embodiment, n packets may be transmitted k times over a channel with a packet loss rate of p, then the loss rate of a single packet is p. According to probability theory, the probability for all the packets to be correctly received may be derived using equation (1) as set forth, in one embodiment. \n\n","A client may retransmit packets k\u22121 times (k\u22121 retransmission opportunity) to satisfy a reliability requirement (R) if n packets are to be sent while the current network packet loss rate is p. Accordingly, delivery of short flows may be accomplished beyond a QoS that is guaranteed beforehand in some embodiments of the present invention.","First, the reserved bandwidth may be determined for transmission based on a quality of service profile in one embodiment. Before communicating the packets of data over a network at a rate that matches the reserved bandwidth, at least one transmission parameter may be adjusted for the transmission. An adjustment of a transmission parameter may include receiving a service requirement of an application and the quality of service profile negotiation for a data sender and a data receiver. For the application, a service session profile may be negotiated between the service subscriber unit  and the service provider . In this way, the service reliability requirement and other service parameters may be derived from the service session profile.","According to one packet delivery procedure consistent with one embodiment of the present invention, an exchange of packets of data including RTP and RTCP packets may take place between a sender and a receiver. For sending RTP data packets, the sender may count the total number of RTP data packets during each packet transportation session. After all the packets are sent out (whether or not correctly received) and no new user data is generated, the sender may get the total number of the packets to be delivered, and then set the retransmission times according to equation (1). Since each outgoing but unacknowledged packet is stored in a buffer, the sender may retransmit those RTP packets immediately until all of them are acknowledged or their retransmission opportunities are used up (the retransmission times decremented for each round of retransmission). However, the RTCP acknowledgement packets may arrive at the sender at any time, triggering the stored packets to be freed.","For sending a data packet, such as a RTP packet, the sender's behavior may include communicating each RTP packet and storing it in the buffer, counting the total number of the RTP packets to be delivered, setting the retransmission times according to equation (1), retransmitting the stored but unacknowledged RTP packets, decrementing retransmission times by one each time, freeing the stored RTP packets if they are acknowledged (it may happen at any time in the communication session), and checking if all of the RTP packets are acknowledged or their retransmission opportunities are used up. Likewise, the receiver's behavior for sending one or more acknowledgment RTCP packets involves receiving the RTP packets and sending corresponding RTCP acknowledgement packets to the sender.","According to one operation consistent with one embodiment of the present invention, at block , in  a user may initiate a QoS profile negotiation using RSVP and GPRS QoS signaling. Based on the QoS profile negotiation, the packet transmission rate may be determined at block . At block , a service criterion, such as a reliability requirement, may be negotiated for an application (i.e., the user application, over the data transport network  () (e.g., a GPRS wireless network)) based on the service provisioned between a client and a server. Using the currently negotiated QoS profile , a current reserved bandwidth for transmission may be determined.","A check at diamond  may determine whether or not the service criterion (e.g., set forth by the user application ) has to be met for the service. If no service criterion is to be fulfilled during the transmission, each packet of data may be communicated at the rate matching with the current reserved bandwidth at block , and the current communication or service session terminates. Conversely, if a particular service criterion indicating a certain reliability requirement of the user application  for the service, as an example, may desired to be fulfilled, then each RTP packet may be communicated and stored in a buffer at block . For the purposes of transmission, the packet transmission rate may be determined for packets of data such that the rate matches with the current reserved bandwidth of a current communication or a service session at block .","After all the RTP packets are communicated to the server engine  and no new user data are produced at the client engine , the client engine  counts the total number of the packets to be delivered, at block . Then the client engine  may update the retransmission times counter according to equation (1), in one embodiment, at block . In this way, the packet retransmission times may be updated according to the equation (1).","In order to meet the service criterion, the packet transmission rate of the packets of data may be dynamically adapted based on a currently negotiated QoS profile at block . Once the packets of data are transmitted over the data transport network , an RTCP receipt indication acknowledging a reception of each RTP packet of data may be provided to the server engine  at block  by the client engine . In one case, a RTCP acknowledgement packet each corresponding to a received RTP packet may indicate to the sender (e.g., the subscriber unit ) of any unacknowledged packets of data at the receiver (i.e., in this case the service provider ) within a particular communication or service session.","Thereafter, retransmission opportunities may be checked at diamond  in case some packets of data may be determined to be pending. When a next retransmission opportunity is detected to be available at the diamond , the stored and unacknowledged packets of the data may be retransmitted at the block  at the rate commensurate with the current reserved bandwidth. However, if all the packets of data are indicated to be reliably communicated, then the transmission of data for the current communication or service session terminates. That is, if all the packets are acknowledged or their transmission opportunities are exhausted, then the session terminates.","At the data sender, any unacknowledged packets of data may be identified based on the RTCP acknowledgement packet. At block , such stored but unacknowledged packets of data may be automatically and immediately retransmitted from the sender to the receiver if no new data are generated at the client, enabling the service to meet the service criterion, e.g., a reliability criteria satisfying a quality of service beyond one or all of the quality of service profiles  in some embodiments of the present invention. In this way, timely and reliable delivery of packets of data which cannot be otherwise provided by infrastructure negotiated QoS may be advantageously provided. Accordingly, a reliable service may be ensured for upper applications including the user application  and the provider application  shown in FIG. . At block , the retransmission times counter may be decremented.","A general packet radio service (GPRS) network , as shown in  enables a client  to communicate with a server , exchanging cellular data in one or more packets over a packet-based radio service in one embodiment. Examples of the client  include a mobile station, cellular phone, PDA, portable device, handsets and handheld wireless devices. The packet-based radio service may be adapted for an end-to-end delivery of a relatively short flows of packets of cellular data in one case. The server  may be associated with the service provider , connecting to a local area network (LAN)  that links to a router  for a network connection with the data transport network  (FIG. ).","In a cell , forming a cellular network with other cells (not shown), a base transceiver station (BTS)  may be controlled by a base station controller (BSC)  while communicating to and from the client . Specifically, the client  may comprise an antenna  to wirelessly communicate with an antenna  connected to the BTS  for cellular wireless data services on a general packet radio service (GPRS) channel over an air interface  in one embodiment. An example of the antenna  is a dipole antenna.","To support the packet-based radio service, the data transport network  may incorporate a packet data network (PDN) and a GPRS backbone . While the PDN may be the Internet and\/or Intranet, the GPRS backbone may be a public land mobile network (PLMN) for a global system for mobile communications (GSM) in some embodiments of the present invention. In particular, a gateway GPRS support node (GGSN)  may provide an interface between the GPRS backbone and the PDN . For the delivery of the packets of cellular data to and from the client , a serving GPRS support node (SGSN)  is responsible within a service area. An interface (Gi)  may connect the PDN to the GGSN . Likewise, while one interface (Gn) may connect the GPRS backbone to the SGSN , the other interface (Gn) may connect the GGSN  to the GPRS backbone . A hypothetical routing path  is indicated to illustrate transmission of packets of cellular data within a service or communication session over a GPRS service, such as the packet-based radio service.","Quality of service (QoS) requirements (e.g., the negotiated QoS profiles  and service criterion requirements may be specified for a particular service over GPRS wireless network) for mobile packet data applications (e.g., user application  and provider application ), governing the operation of the client  and the server . Examples of the QoS requirements include service precedence to indicate a service priority, reliability classes, mean or certain percentile delays, and throughput parameters to indicate peak or mean bit rates. Examples of the mobile packet data applications include real-time multimedia streaming, Web browsing, and e-mail.","For mobile users including the client , different one or more reliability requirements, such as quality of service (QoS) classes including reliability and delay classes may be specified in some embodiments depending upon service agreements. Using these QoS classes, QoS profiles may be negotiated between the mobile user, i.e., the client  and the GPRS network  for each service session, depending upon the QoS demand from the service provider  and current available network resources or conditions. This represents, an infrastructure negotiated QoS in one embodiment. As described above, by adapting one or more transmission parameters during transmission, a service requirement, which otherwise cannot be provided by this infrastructure negotiated QoS may be provided, especially in relatively shorter flows of packets of cellular data between the client  and server .","A hypothetical chart showing transmission metrics of cellular data transmission in the GPRS network  of  is shown in  according to one embodiment of the present invention. A bit rate of transmission is adapted to match with reserved bandwidth derived from a quality of service profile. To show transmission of each packet a \u201csent sequence number\u201d may be used, and to acknowledge each packet \u201can acknowledgement (ACKED) sequence number\u201d may be used in reception indications. In the chart shown in , all fifteen packets  are received appropriately even after sending some packets four times , to meet a reliability requirement of a user or upper layer application, e.g., the user application  shown in FIG. . Four packets may be sent only once as they may be acknowledged after a first transmission itself.","A TCP protocol stack is used widely in many wireless data applications, however, after an idle period, a TCP-based sender may enter into a slow-start period and initialize a current sending window size to two segments, introducing significant latency to the delivery of short transfers of data, leading to inefficient utilization of network resources. In case of short TCP transfers, the sending window size is often not large enough to make full use of bandwidth reserved. Furthermore, the TCP-based sender may not be able to distinguish the packet loss due to network congestion from the packet loss because of transmission error. Some TCP-based senders, triggered by a packet loss due to a transmission error falsely and frequently may reduce their data sending rate.","Unlike a TCP-based sender, a bit rate of data transmission may not be restricted by current congestion window in some embodiments of the present invention. Since the client  is aware of reserved bandwidth after QoS negotiation, it may send packets of cellular data at a bit rate that matches with reserved bandwidth during the data transmission, resulting in highly efficient network resource utilization and relatively less latency in some embodiments of the present invention. In some situations, a service requirement of application may be satisfied beyond the negotiated QoS because the gap between the application requirement and the negotiated QoS may be appropriately bridged.","Moreover, retransmission of acknowledged packets greatly improves the reliability, meeting one or more requirements (e.g., service criterion) of upper layer applications, i.e., user application . The retransmission mechanism may improve the reliability of data transmission, meeting the reliability requirement of upper applications over the GPRS network . In this way, a relatively faster and reliable transmission than most TCP-based transmission schemes having QoS support may be provided for a reliable data delivery service, efficiently utilizing network resources.","In one embodiment, the client  and server  may meet the one or more requirements in the presence of significant levels of non-congestion loss, a kind of phenomena very common in a s link due to the transmission error, which otherwise falsely triggers a TCP-based sender to slow-down the data sending rate. A fast-start mechanism may obviate much latency and inefficient utilization of network resources into the delivery of short transfers in one embodiment. The bit rate may be determined by the bandwidth reserved, instead of a congestion window size. Therefore, reserved bandwidth is fully used and the effect of transmission error on the performance is reduced in some cases.","In one embodiment, using resource reservation and currently negotiated quality of service profile for real-time services with a host of interconnect technologies for the data transport network  (FIG. ), different forms of data may be routed between a variety of data computers or servers in application processing and enterprise computing environments. As an example, in a packet-based input\/output communication a data packet, such as a unicast and\/or a multicast packet may be routed. While the unicast packet is forwarded to a predefined destination port, the multicast packet is transmitted to more than one destination ports.","More specifically, the real-time transport protocol (RTP) may provide end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services. The data transport may be augmented by the real-time transport control protocol (RTCP) that allows monitoring of the data delivery. Because the RTP and RTCP may be devised to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers, use of RTP-level translators, and mixers may be supported as well.
