Later, when a controller of the indoor device, such as the controller  of , selects the operating conditions for the identified user, the selected operating conditions may include operating conditions corresponding to the designated operation mode input in the user registration process, the preferred operation mode, or operating conditions corresponding to the individual operation mode directly input by, for example, a voice command for the user, and any one of these modes is selected. Further, the selected operating conditions may be transmitted to the indoor device, and the indoor device may be driven according to the transmitted operating conditions.","Hereinafter, a user registration method, a user presence checking or sensing method, a user discrimination or identification method, and an operating conditions selection method will be described in detail with reference to flow charts. The method of transmitting the operating conditions to the indoor device has been described above and therefore, its description has been omitted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-2"],"b":"10"},"In more detail, the user may select a user registration menu through the control panel, in step S. Further, if the user registration menu is activated, the user may input a user identification sign, in step S. The user identification sign may be, for example, an Arabic digit number, an English or Korean name of the user, or a character. Various other methods are also available.","If the identification sign of the user is input, an image capturing device, such as a camera, disposed at the front of the indoor device may be turned on, in step S, and at the same time, may enter a Standby state. Further, if the user presses the touch screen or the button to input a capturing command, an image, for example, a face of the user, may be captured, in step S. The captured image may be stored in a memory, such as the memory  of , connected to a controller, such as controller  of the indoor device  of , in step S.","Further, when storing of the image is completed, a recorder disposed at the front of the indoor device may be turned on, in step S, and a voice recording may be prepared. Further, the user may perform the voice recording, in step S. When the recording is completed, the user may press a stop button to store the recorded voice information in the memory, in step S. The user's voice recording may be used to identify the user and may be recorded by, for example, a user reading aloud his or her name or a specific word. When the user later speaks the name or word recorded using this process at the front of the indoor device, the indoor device may recognize it and automatically perform the user identification process to operate the indoor device.","When the voice recording for identifying the user is completed, input of designated operating conditions may be performed, in step S. The designated operating conditions may be specific operating or driving conditions desired by the registering user, such as an interior temperature, interior humidity, and\/or a wind volume of a fan, and may be input via voice. The wind volume of the fan may be input via voice using step by step set wind volumes, such as strong wind, moderate wind, or weak wind. The interior temperature and humidity may be input by, for example, saying 20 degrees and 50%, respectively. Then, the indoor device may record the operating conditions and perform voice interpretation algorithms, and match the operating conditions corresponding to the interpreted voice, to automatically convert the matched driving conditions into electrical signal. The designated operating conditions may also be input through a key input, such as key input  or key input  of .","When the designated operating conditions are input, the input operating conditions may be stored in the memory, in step S.

Then, when a user registration menu is displayed, the user may select the registration menu by, for example, a touch or button input, in step S. Further, similar to the embodiment described above, the user identification sign input process for inputting the designated operating conditions and storing the same, steps S\u02dcS, may be performed on a screen of the portable terminal.","The process may include inputting the user identification sign by a key input including a touch screen or button input, capturing an image, for example, the face, of the user by an image capturing device, such as a camera, recording a voice of the user using an voice input, such as a recorder, and inputting designated operating conditions via voice or key input.","The step S of inputting the user identification sign through the step S of storing the operating conditions may be the same or similar to those described above with respect to ; however, these steps are performed on the screen of the portable terminal, and therefore, repetitive description has been omitted.","When the designated operating conditions are stored, in step S, the stored user registration information may be transmitted to a controller, such as controller  of the indoor device  of , in step S. The transmission method may use wireless transmission using a wireless communication module. Further, the user registration information transmitted to the controller of the indoor device may be stored to the memory of the indoor device, in step S.","When the user information registration process ends, preparation for operating the indoor device of the air conditioning apparatus is completed. Hereinafter, when the user moves near the indoor device, the method may recognize the user and discriminates or identify the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["210","211","1","2","212"]},"In more detail, the image difference comparison method may be a method that obtains image data for a subject, calculates a difference in the obtained image data, and extracts or detects movement of the subject. With this method, a difference between a previously captured image and a currently captured image may be calculated to obtain an image difference frame, excluding a common region, that is, pixels having no image change. Further, the obtained image difference frame may be analyzed to determine whether movement or motion of the subject is present. Since image difference comparison methods are well known to those skilled in the art, description thereof has been omitted. With this embodiment, a number of images captured consecutively with the image capturing device may be compared and analyzed to determine movement of the subject, thereby determining whether a user approaches near the indoor device.","When it is determined that movement of the user is present using the image difference comparison method, in step S, the method may proceed to the user discrimination or identification process, in step S, identifying the user. In addition, the image captured by the image capturing device may be used again in the user discrimination or identification method, described in detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"In more detail, the sensor may include an infrared ray sensor that senses movement of the user or may include various other sensors. The sensor may be turned on or may be maintained continuously in an on state, in step S. The sensor may sense the user, in step S. When sensing the approach of the user, the image capturing device at the front of the indoor device may be turned on, in step S. Further, the image capturing device may capture an image, for example, a face, of the user, in step S.","In general, when the user approaches near the indoor device to operate the indoor device, the user's eyes face the indoor device, such that it is not difficult to capture the face of the user. If the face of the user is not exposed to the image capturing device, for example, the face is not exposed to the image capturing device when the user is simply passing by the front of the indoor device, the user discrimination process may not be performed. In other words, when the user is simply passing by the front of the indoor device, the indoor device may not be operated. Thus, it is possible to operate the indoor device only if the face of the user is captured. In order to prevent unnecessary power consumption, when the user intends to drive the indoor device, the user need only expose his or her face as a precondition.","On the other hand, when the face of the user is captured with the image capturing device, the captured image information may be stored in the memory of the indoor device. Then, the method may proceed to the user discrimination or identification process, in step S.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"]},"First, the user captured image information obtained as described with respect to  and  may be uploaded, in step S. Next, a degree of similarity may be determined by comparing and analyzing the captured image information obtained as described with respect to  and  and the captured image information obtained in the user registration process, in step S. The degree of similarity may be calculated numerically between the images of the user obtained in the user registration process and obtained as described with respect to  and .","Further, when the degree of similarity for the images is determined, it is determined whether a voice input of the user is present, in step S. The voice input may be, for example, a voice command for the operating conditions of the indoor device, or a voice command for preparing operation of the indoor device.","On the other hand, if it is determined that a voice command of the user has not been input, then only the degree of similarity confirms who the user is in the controller of the indoor device. That is, a registered user having a highest degree of similarity value for the degree of similarity obtained in the degree of similarity determination process may be selected, and it may be determined that the selected registered user approaches near the indoor device. Further, the operating conditions selection process suitable for the selected registered user may be performed, in step S.","Whereas, when a voice command of the user is input, all voice information obtained for the user in the user registration process may be uploaded, in step S. Further, the degree of similarity for the voice may be determined by comparing the input voice and the voice of the user obtained in the user registration process, in step S. Further, a user having a highest degree of similarity for the information may be selected, in step S, by comparing values for the degree of similarity of the captured image information and the voice information, in step S. Furthermore, the operating conditions selection process, in step S, to select operating conditions suitable for the selected user may be performed.","In more detail, the highest values of values of the degree of similarity for voice information and for captured image information may be calculated, respectively, and a registered user having a further highest values of values of the degree of similarity may be selected. For example, if a man called A is a registered user and has the highest value of the degree of similarity for the voice information, and a man called B is a registered user and has the highest value of the degree of similarity for the captured image information, the degree of similarity for voice information may be higher than the degree of similarity for the captured image information.

When it is determined that a voice command inputting the operating conditions has not been separately input, the indoor device may be operated by the designated operating mode input in the user registration process, in step S.","Whereas, when it is sensed that a voice command of the user has been input, a Voice Application Programming Interface (SAPI) may be operated to analyze the input voice command, in step S. Further, the process may interpret the analyzed voice command, in step S.","That is, the process may determine whether the interpretation result is operating conditions (for example, temperature, humidity, wind velocity, and wind direction) of the indoor device directly input by the user, or a command to execute a preference operating mode, in step S. If it is determined that the user directly input a numerical value for the interior temperature, interior humidity, and wind volume, the operating conditions corresponding to the analyzed voice command may be selected, in step S. The indoor device may be operated according to the selected operating conditions, in step S.","Whereas, when it is interpreted that the preference operating mode command is input by the user, an operating item having a high weight value among the operating conditions input by the user may be extracted, in step S, and the indoor device may be operated according to the extracted operating mode, in step S. The method forming the preference operating mode will be described in detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10"]},"In more detail, the operating conditions may be input by a user, in step S.

Further, the operating conditions may be mechanically input via a control panel, may be input via the portable terminal, and\/or may be input in voice.","The input operating conditions may be received and stored in the memory, in step S. Further, from the moment operation of the indoor device is started using the input operating conditions, a timer may operate, in step S. The timer may measure the time consumed to change the operating conditions from the initial operating conditions. The measured time may be used as a determination factor for the preference operating conditions, by identifying whether the user changes the operating conditions after a certain amount of time has lapsed from the initial operating conditions.","During this process in which the timer operates to count time, the controller of the indoor device may sense whether an operating conditions command change is input by the user, in step S. When the command changing the operation conditions is not input, the air conditioning apparatus is continuously operated using the initial operating conditions, and simultaneously, the timer continuously counts time.","On the other hand, when a command changing the operating conditions is input, the time consumed to change the operating conditions and the changed operating conditions may be received and stored. Simultaneously, operation of the timer may be stopped to re-initialize, in step S. In addition, when the operating stop command is not input, in step S, the timer may count time again and the process may determine whether the command changing the operating conditions is input again. Further, when the operating stop command is input, operation of the indoor device may be ended.","A weight value may be given for operating conditions having a largest selection frequency of the accumulated operating conditions. Further, when the user selects the preference operating mode, the operating conditions having the largest weight value may be selected as the preference operating mode, and the indoor device may be controlled to be driven using the selected operating mode.","The control method for an air conditioning apparatus as discussed above may have at least the following advantages.","First, if a user approaches a location, in which the indoor device is disposed, by storing user information and operating conditions using the indoor device of the air conditioning apparatus, the indoor device may be automatically operated using selected operating conditions, thereby not necessitating operating separately.","Second, it is possible to automatically operate the indoor device to perform the operating conditions of the indoor device as the designated operating conditions without a remote controller or special input device, such that a situation in which the indoor device is not operated does not occur due to loss of the remote controller.","Third, whenever the user inputs the operating conditions of the indoor device, the operating conditions may be received and stored to automatically select a preference operating mode or operating conditions for each user, thereby providing a pleasant indoor environment for each user operating the indoor device.","Embodiments disclosed herein provide a control method for an air conditioning apparatus that enables an indoor device of the air conditioning apparatus to be remotely controlled using a smart phone or a control panel disposed in the air conditioning apparatus.","Further, embodiments disclosed herein provide a network system that may include a portable terminal capable of downloading a program through the Internet; and an air conditioning apparatus that communicate with the portable terminal.
