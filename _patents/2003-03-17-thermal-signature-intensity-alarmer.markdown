abstract: A system for processing thermal signature data is provided. The system provides a thermal signature data processor that analyzes one or more pixels to determine whether an aspect of an alarm-worthy event has occurred. In one example, the system additionally analyzes visual data in relation to the thermal signature data to determine whether an alarm-worthy event (e.g., intrusion) has occurred.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","Lexicon","Flexible Sequences and Functionally Equivalent Circuits","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The systems, methods, application programming interfaces (API), graphical user interfaces (GUI), and computer readable media described herein relate generally to intrusion detection and more particularly to analyzing thermal signature data.","Motion detection by visual processing is well known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,504,479 discloses various systems and methods for motion detection. Similarly, thermal imaging via infrared (IR) is well known in the art. For example, an intruder alert system that employs IR is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,825,413. Each, however, suffers from drawbacks that produce sub-optimal motion detection and\/or intruder alert systems.","Conventional systems, particularly those employed in a visually noisy environment, may generate false positives (e.g., false alarms). For example, a motion detector outside a barn door may trigger an alarm due to the activity of a raccoon, or, on a windy night, when a tarpaulin covering a nearby woodpile flaps in the wind. Similarly, a heat detector inside a warehouse may trigger an alarm due to the activity of a rat, or a motion detector may alarm when the air conditioning system engages and blows scrap paper across the detection system field of view. False alarms may also be generated due to changing light conditions that produce apparent motion and\/or thermal signature changes. By way of illustration, the rising sun may generate a thermal signature change directly and\/or in items reflecting the sun. Furthermore, shadows and refractions may cause thermal signature changes.","The following presents a simplified summary of methods, systems, computer readable media and so on for analyzing thermal signature data to facilitate providing a basic understanding of these items. This summary is not an extensive overview and is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the methods, systems, computer readable media, and so on or to delineate the scope of these items. This summary provides a conceptual introduction in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","In one example, a system operates with IR camera signals to provide thermal signature intensity alarming. In another example, a system operates with IR camera signals to provide motion detection. In yet another example, a system combines IR camera signal thermal signature intensity alarming with IR camera signal motion detection. In yet another example, intrusion detecting systems and methods combine visual processing with thermal signature processing.","Certain illustrative example methods, systems, computer readable media and so on are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These examples are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the methods, systems, computer readable media and so on may be employed and thus are intended to be inclusive of equivalents. Other advantages and novel features may become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","As used in this application, the term \u201ccomputer component\u201d refers to a computer-related entity, either hardware, firmware, software, a combination thereof, or software in execution. For example, a computer component can be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program and a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be computer components. One or more computer components can reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a computer component can be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers.","\u201cComputer communications\u201d, as used herein, refers to a communication between two or more computer components and can be, for example, a network transfer, a file transfer, an applet transfer, an email, a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) message, a datagram, an object transfer, a binary large object (BLOB) transfer, and so on. A computer communication can occur across, for example, a wireless system (e.g., IEEE 802.11), an Ethernet system (e.g., IEEE 802.3), a token ring system (e.g., IEEE 802.5), a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a point-to-point system, a circuit switching system, a packet switching system, and so on.","\u201cLogic\u201d, as used herein, includes but is not limited to hardware, firmware, software and\/or combinations of each to perform a function(s) or an action(s). For example, based on a desired application or needs, logic may include a software controlled microprocessor, discrete logic such as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or other programmed logic device. Logic may also be fully embodied as software. Where multiple logical logics are described, it may be possible to incorporate the multiple logical logics into one physical logic. Similarly, where a single logical logic is described, it may be possible to distribute that single logical logic between multiple physical logics.","\u201cSignal\u201d, as used herein, includes but is not limited to one or more electrical or optical signals, analog or digital, one or more computer instructions, a bit or bit stream, or the like.","\u201cSoftware\u201d, as used herein, includes but is not limited to, one or more computer readable and\/or executable instructions that cause a computer, computer component, and\/or other electronic device to perform functions, actions and\/or behave in a desired manner. The instructions may be embodied in various forms like routines, algorithms, modules, methods, threads, and\/or programs. Software may also be implemented in a variety of executable and\/or loadable forms including, but not limited to, a stand-alone program, a function call (local and\/or remote), a servelet, an applet, instructions stored in a memory, part of an operating system or browser, and the like. It is to be appreciated that the computer readable and\/or executable instructions can be located in one computer component and\/or distributed between two or more communicating, co-operating, and\/or parallel processing computer components and thus can be loaded and\/or executed in serial, parallel, massively parallel and other manners. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the form of software may be dependent on, for example, requirements of a desired application, the environment in which it runs, and\/or the desires of a designer\/programmer or the like.","An \u201coperable connection\u201d (or a connection by which entities are \u201coperably connected\u201d) is one in which signals, physical communication flow, and\/or logical communication flow may be sent and\/or received. Usually, an operable connection includes a physical interface, an electrical interface, and\/or a data interface, but it is to be noted that an operable connection may consist of differing combinations of these or other types of connections sufficient to allow operable control.","\u201cData store\u201d, as used herein, refers to a physical and\/or logical entity that can store data. A data store may be, for example, a database, a table, a file, a list, a queue, a heap, and so on. A data store may reside in one logical and\/or physical entity and\/or may be distributed between two or more logical and\/or physical entities.","Some portions of the detailed descriptions that follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated.","It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like. It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussions, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms like processing, computing, calculating, determining, displaying, or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.","It will be appreciated that some or all of the methods described herein involve electronic and\/or software applications that may be dynamic and flexible processes so that they may be performed in sequences different than those described herein. It will also be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that elements embodied as software may be implemented using various programming approaches such as machine language, procedural, object oriented, and\/or artificial intelligence techniques.","The processing, analyses, and\/or other functions described herein may also be implemented by functionally equivalent circuits like a digital signal processor (DSP), a software controlled microprocessor, or an ASIC. Components implemented as software are not limited to any particular programming language. Rather, the description provides the information one skilled in the art may use to fabricate circuits or to generate computer software and\/or computer components to perform the processing of the system. It will be appreciated that some or all of the functions and\/or behaviors of the example systems and methods may be implemented as logic as defined above.","The example systems and methods described herein concern processing IR signals, alone and\/or in combination with other signals like visual image data, pressure sensing data, sound sensing data, and so on. In one example, the systems and methods operate on an IR signal, examining the thermal signature of one or more items in a field of view, comparing them with user specifiable parameters concerning thermal signatures, and determining whether the field of view contains an item within thermal alarm limits. If so, an alarm may be generated. The thermal signature may be based, for example, on the difference of the thermal intensity of an object compared to the background thermal intensity in a field of view.","Thus,  illustrates an example thermal signature intensity alarming system . The system  includes a thermal signature processing logic  that receives a thermal image data . The thermal image data  may come, for example, from an infrared (IR) camera. The thermal signature processing logic  processes the thermal image data  to identify an object of interest via its thermal signature. The system  may also include an intensity logic  that determines the relative intensity of the object of interest. For example, the background of a field of view may have a first thermal intensity. One or more objects in the field of view may have thermal signature intensities different from the first thermal intensity. If the thermal signature intensity differs from the background intensity and falls within a pre-determined, configurable range of intensities, then the system  may identify the object as being an object of interest. Then, alarm logic  may examine potential objects of interest and subject them to comparisons with various other pre-determined, configurable attributes to determine whether an alarm signal should be generated. Thus the system  includes an alarm logic  that determines whether an alarm-worthy event has occurred based on the thermal signature processing logic  analysis of the thermal image data  and\/or the intensity logic  analysis of the relative thermal intensity of the object of interest.","One output from the example thermal signature target recognition system is an alarm. The alarm may be based on a probability function for identifying a given target. For example, the system may produce a determination that there is an x% likelihood that the target is one for which an alarm should be generated. By way of illustration, the system may generate an output that it is 75% likelihood that the item for which a thermal signature was detected is a human and a 10% likelihood that the item is a small animal.","In one example, the alarm logic  determines whether an alarm-worthy event has occurred based on values produced by the thermal signature processing logic  and\/or the intensity logic  where the values are produced by processing the value of an individual pixel or a set of pixels. The following examples illustrate single pixel processing as compared to average effect processing. A region thermal threshold may be examined to determine whether an object changed the average thermal signature in the image enough to raise an alarm. For example, a human who is a mile from an example system may register as a single pixel in an image. Although the single pixel may be within the object thermal threshold (e.g., z% thermal intensity difference), the overall effect on the average thermal signature of the image may be too small to warrant an alarm. In this way, large warm objects that are beyond a desired range of interest (e.g., not within 50 yards of the sensor) can be ignored and not produce false alarms. Similarly, a small rodent (e.g., rat) inside the range of interest may be detected. Its thermal image may place it within the object thermal threshold (e.g., z% thermal intensity difference), and, it may affect more than one pixel, but again, its overall effect on the average thermal signature of the image may be too small to warrant an alarm. In this way, small warm objects that are within the desired range of interest may also be ignored and not produce false alarms.","Thus, in another example, the system  has alarm logic  determine whether an alarm-worthy event has occurred based on values produced by the thermal signature processing logic  and\/or the intensity logic  where the values are produced by processing the effect an individual pixel or set of pixels has on an average value for a region of interest.","The system  may be implemented, in some examples, in computer components. Thus, portions of the system  may be distributed on a computer readable medium storing computer executable components of the system . While the system  is illustrated with three separate logics, it is to be appreciated that the processing performed by the logics can be implemented in a greater and\/or lesser number of logics, and\/or in a greater and\/or lesser number of computer components.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","220","210","210","220","210","200","230","200","240","200","240","220","210","230"]},"In one example, the alarm logic  determines whether an alarm-worthy event has occurred based on values produced by the thermal signature processing logic  and\/or the motion logic  where the values are produced by processing the value of an individual pixel or a set of pixels. In another example, the system  has alarm logic  determine whether an alarm-worthy event has occurred based on values produced by the thermal signature processing logic  and\/or the motion logic  where the values are produced by processing the effect an individual pixel or set of pixels has on an average value for a region of interest.","The system  may be implemented, in some examples, in computer components.

This determination can be made in a manner similar to that described above in conjunction with FIG. . The alarm logic  facilitates determining whether an alarm-worthy event has occurred based on the thermal signature processing logic  analysis of the thermal image data , the motion logic  analysis of the motion of the object of interest, and\/or the intensity logic  analysis of the relative thermal intensity of the object of interest.","In one example, the alarm logic  determines whether an alarm-worthy event has occurred based on values produced by the thermal signature processing logic , the motion logic , and\/or the intensity logic  where the values are produced by processing the value of an individual pixel or a set of pixels. In another example, the alarm logic  determines whether an alarm-worthy event has occurred based on values produced by the thermal signature processing logic , the motion logic , and\/or the intensity logic , where the values are produced by processing the effect an individual pixel or set of pixels has on an average value for a region of interest.","The system  may be implemented, in some examples, in computer components. Thus, portions of the system  may be distributed on a computer readable medium storing computer executable components of the system . While the system  is illustrated with four separate logics, it is to be appreciated that the processing performed by the logics can be implemented in a greater and\/or lesser number of logics, and\/or in a greater and\/or lesser number of computer components.","Some example systems and methods described herein may combine processing of visual and IR camera signals. This facilitates forming a composite image where items with an interesting thermal signature, and\/or items with an interesting thermal signature that moved can be identified and presented to a user while visual imaging continues. This facilitates providing and\/or enhancing both day and night surveillance in a field of view. The visual image data acquired by an optical camera can be combined through a mathematical function with thermal image data acquired by a thermal camera to produce a motsig data. The motsig data thus captures elements of both the visual image and the thermal image. By creating a composite visual and IR image, the visual daytime capability of a visual camera is enhanced. The composite visual and IR image can be created by overlaying relevant IR data over visual data. Relevant IR data can be data that is, for example, acquired from an object within user specifiable intensity thresholds.","To illustrate combination processing, a warm object (e.g., small rodent) may move across a region of interest in a field of view. Thermal signature processing can identify that an item within specified thermal intensity parameters is in the field of view. Then, visual frame difference analysis can determine that the item with the interesting thermal signature moved, its path, location, and so on. Thus, combination processing can determine whether to generate an alarm signal. For example, an object thermal threshold may be examined to determine whether an object is warm enough to be of interest without being too warm (e.g., x% warmer than the background in the field of view without being y% warmer).","By way of further illustration, an example system or method may determine, via visual processing, that something moved in a region of interest in the field of view. Rather than immediately generating an alarm signal condition and\/or taking some other action (e.g., turning on a security light), the example system engages in additional thermal signature processing to determine not only that something moved, but also the heat signature of what moved and whether it is of interest to the system. It is to be appreciated that the additional thermal signature processing can be performed in serial and\/or substantially in parallel with the visual processing. Additionally, and\/or alternatively, an example system may determine, via thermal signature processing, that an object of potential interest is in a region of interest in the field of view. Then, additional visual processing may be employed to determine whether the object is actually of interest. For example, the outline of the object with the interesting thermal signature may be acquired using image processing. Then, target tracking, for example, may be applied to the detected and outlined object.","The combination processing can also facilitate producing a true positive (e.g., real alarm) where a conventional system might not. For example, a large warm object (e.g., human intruder) may, in some cases, foil a motion detection system by moving very slowly across a field of view. Thus, a visual processor may not detect the very slowly moving object. However, a visual processor working together with a thermal signature processor may detect this stealthy intruder due, for example, to the change in the overall thermal signature in the region of interest in the field of view. Similarly, a human who masks their heat signature may, in some cases, foil a detection system based solely on thermal signature processing. Thus, a thermal signature processor, working together with a visual processor may detect this intruder and properly raise an alarm.","It is to be appreciated that the thermal signature processing and the visual processing can occur individually, substantially in parallel, and\/or serially, with either the thermal or visual processing going first and selectively triggering complimentary combination processing. Furthermore, the weight accorded to each type of processing can be adjusted based, for example, on operator settings and\/or detected environmental factors. For example, in a first set of atmospheric conditions (e.g., windless 100 degree day), more weight may be accorded to visual analysis than thermal signature analysis when determining whether to raise an alarm while in a second set of atmospheric conditions (e.g., windy 24 degree day), more weight may be accorded to thermal signature analysis.","Thus,  illustrates an example thermal signature intensity and visual image alarming system . The system  includes a visual processing logic  that analyzes a visual image data . For example, processing like edge detection, sshape detection, and so on may occur. The system  also includes a thermal signature processing logic  that analyzes a thermal image data  in manners analogous to those described above. The system  also includes a combination logic  that analyzes a combination of the visual image data  and the thermal image data . In one example, the combination logic  determines one or more relationships between one or more objects in the visual image data  and the thermal image data .","The system  also includes an alarm logic  for determining whether an alarm-worthy event has occurred based on one or more of the visual processing logic  analysis of the visual image data , the thermal signature processing logic  analysis of the thermal image data  and the combination logic  analysis of the combination of the visual image data  and the thermal image data  or relationships between objects in them.","In one example, the visual processing logic  is operably connected to a frame capturer that captures between 10 and 60 frames per second. The frame capturer may be, for example, a PCI frame grabber. While a PCI frame grabber is described, it is to be appreciated that other types of frame grabbers (e.g., USB) can be employed. Similarly, while 10 to 60 frames per second are described, it is to be appreciated that other rangers can be employed. The visual image data  may be acquired from a single frame and\/or from two or more frames. The PCI frame grabber may sample data at a resolution of between 128\u00d7128 pixels and 1024\u00d71024 pixels with a color depth of between 4 and 16 bits per pixel. While 128\u00d7128 to 1024\u00d71024 pixels are described, it is to be appreciated that other ranges can be employed.","In one example, the visual processing logic  includes a visual image data transforming logic. The visual image transforming logic may perform actions including, but not limited to, blurring, sharpening, and filtering the visual image data .","The alarm logic  may determine whether an alarm-worthy event has occurred by evaluating the value of one or more pixels in the visual image data  or the thermal image data  on an individual basis. Additionally and\/or alternatively, the alarm logic  may determine whether an alarm-worthy event has occurred by evaluating values of a set of pixels in the visual image data  or the thermal image data  on an averaged basis. In another example, the alarm logic  determines whether an alarm-worthy event has occurred by comparing a motsig data to a pre-determined, configurable range for the motsig data.","The system  may be implemented, in some examples, in computer components. Thus, portions of the system  may be distributed on a computer readable medium storing computer executable components of the system . While the system  is illustrated with four separate logics, it is to be appreciated that the processing performed by the logics can be implemented in a greater and\/or lesser number of logics, and\/or in a greater and\/or lesser number of computer components.","The system  can be employed to implement an intrusion detector. In one example, an infrared and visual intrusion detector includes an intruder infrared (IIR) module and a computer component on which associated application software will run. The infrared and visual intrusion detector may then be operably connected to other components including, but not limited to, a pan and tilt system that facilitates acquiring image and\/or thermal data from a desired region of interest and a display system that facilitates displaying acquired and\/or transformed image and\/or thermal data.","Similarly, an IIR module and computer components for running associated application software may cooperate to produce a display. The display may be presented, for example, on a computer monitor and\/or on a television. Thus, the IIR module and computer components for running associated application software may be operably connected by, for example, a National Television System Committee (NTSC) connection to a television. Similarly, the IIR module and computer components for running associated software may be connected to, for example, a computer monitor. The computer monitor and the television may display substantially similar images at substantially the same time but with different resolutions and image size, for example.","In one example, an IIR module has two logical processes. One process manages matters including, but not limited to, image acquisition, processing, and distribution while a second process facilitates actions including, but not limited to, commanding and controlling the IIR module and interfacing with a pan and tilt unit that houses an optical and\/or thermal (e.g., IR) camera from which the images are acquired. While an infrared image acquisition is described, it is to be appreciated that other forms of thermal imagery can be employed.","In one example, image processing can include various logical activities. Although four activities are described, it is to be appreciated that a greater and\/or lesser number of activities can be employed. Furthermore, while the activities are described sequentially, it is to be appreciated that the activities can be performed substantially in parallel.","One activity concerns frame capturing. In one example, image data may be acquired at approximately 30 frames per second (FPS) using a PCI frame grabber. Data may be sampled at a resolution of 320\u00d7240 pixels with a color depth of 8 bits per pixel (BPP). While approximately 30 FPS are described, it is to be appreciated that a greater and\/or lesser number of FPS can be employed. Similarly, while a resolution of 320\u00d7240 is described, varying resolutions (e.g., 1024\u00d71024) can be employed. Furthermore, while a color depth of 8 BPP is described, it is to be appreciated that different color depths can be used. Further still, while a PCI frame grabber is described, other frame grabbers (e.g., USB) can be employed.","Another activity concerns image transformation. Image transformation can include, but is not limited to, blurring image data, sharpening image data, and filtering image data through, for example, low pass, high pass, and\/or bandpass filters. Image transformation can also include performing edge detection operations. In one example, for efficiency, transformations are processed in a spatial domain using 3\u00d73 kernels, although other kernel sizes may be employed.","Another activity concerns alarm testing. Alarm testing can concern, for example, a combination of three parameters. One parameter, the mode parameter, facilitates determining whether data to be evaluated is taken from a single frame, distinct frames, and\/or differences between frames (frame deltas). Another parameter, the evaluation mechanism parameter, facilitates determining whether an alarm will be triggered based on pixel data from, for example, an individual pixel, a set of pixels, and\/or an average pixel value from a region of interest. Another parameter, value range, facilitates establishing and\/or maintaining boundaries for an alarm range. For example, in a mammal intrusion system, a temperature value range may be established to facilitate generating alarms only for items with a thermal intensity greater than a lower threshold and\/or less than an upper threshold. In an industrial pollutant intrusion system where certain toxic chemical byproducts may be produced, a thermal intensity range may be established that corresponds to a relative difference of approximately 100 degrees Celsius. Similarly, in a missile intrusion system programmed to detect re-entering ballistic missiles, the thermal intensity range may be established to correspond to a relative difference of approximately 1,000 degrees Celsius. In combination systems, an associated tracking velocity and\/or motion displacement may also be established. For example, parameters can be established and\/or manipulated to account for a branch gently swaying back and forth in a breeze with a warm bird perched on the branch. Though there is motion, and a thermal signature, this is not the type of event for which an alarm signal is desired. Thus, so long as the velocity of the warm object remains within a certain range and so long as the distance moved by the object remains below a certain threshold, no alarm signal will be generated. The alarm testing may be applied to one or more arbitrary regions of interest (ROI). An ROI may have its own alarm parameters.","Another activity concerns image distribution. Image data may be colorized according to a pre-determined, configurable palette and distributed to display components like a computer monitor and\/or television. Upon the occurrence of actions including, but not limited to, an alarm and a request from an associated application, image data may be stored in a data store and\/or on a recordable medium. For example, an image may be sent to disk and\/or videotape. Since the image data may traverse a computer network in a computer communication, the image data may be compressed using, for example, a Coarse Sampling and Quantization (CSQ) method. It is to be appreciated that other compression techniques may be employed.","Various application software can be associated with the systems and methods described herein. For example, application software including, but not limited to, software that facilitates controlling visual and\/or thermal imagers, controlling a pan\/tilt unit, controlling imaging, and controlling alarming can be associated with the example systems and methods.","An example image controller software facilitates, for example, adjusting imager focus, adjusting imager field of view, establishing and\/or adjusting automatic settings, establishing and\/or adjusting manual settings, adjusting gain, adjusting filter levels, adjusting polarity, adjusting zoom, and so on. Information associated with image controlling may be presented, for example, via a graphical user interface using a variety of graphical user interface (GUI) elements (e.g., graphs, dials, gauges, sliders, buttons) in a variety of formats (e.g., digital, analog). Some example GUI elements are illustrated in .","An example pan\/tilt controller application facilitates manually and\/or automatically panning and\/or tilting a unit on which an optical camera and\/or a thermal camera are mounted. A pan\/tilt controller may facilitate establishing parameters including, but not limited to, panning and\/or tilting speeds, cycle rates, panning and\/or tilting patterns, and so on. Information associated with pan\/tilt control may be presented, for example, via a graphical user interface using a variety of graphical user interface elements in a variety of formats.","An example imaging control application facilitates establishing and\/or maintaining parameters associated with transforming acquired data. For example, color palettes may be established and\/or maintained to facilitate colorizing data. Again, information associated with imaging control applications can be presented through a GUI.","In view of the exemplary systems shown and described herein, example methodologies that are implemented will be better appreciated with reference to the flow diagrams of . While for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the illustrated methodologies are shown and described as a series of blocks, it is to be appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of the blocks, as some blocks can occur in different orders and\/or concurrently with other blocks from that shown and described. Moreover, less than all the illustrated blocks may be required to implement an example methodology. Furthermore, additional and\/or alternative methodologies can employ additional, not illustrated blocks. In one example, methodologies are implemented as computer executable instructions and\/or operations, stored on computer readable media including, but not limited to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a compact disc (CD), a digital versatile disk (DVD), a random access memory (RAM), a read only memory (ROM), a programmable read only memory (PROM), an electronically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM), a disk, a carrier wave, and a memory stick.","In the flow diagrams, rectangular blocks denote \u201cprocessing blocks\u201d that may be implemented, for example, in software. Similarly, the diamond shaped blocks denote \u201cdecision blocks\u201d or \u201cflow control blocks\u201d that may also be implemented, for example, in software. Alternatively, and\/or additionally, the processing and decision blocks can be implemented in functionally equivalent circuits like a digital signal processor (DSP), an ASIC, and the like.","A flow diagram does not depict syntax for any particular programming language, methodology, or style (e.g., procedural, object-oriented). Rather, a flow diagram illustrates functional information one skilled in the art may employ to program software, design circuits, and so on. It is to be appreciated that in some examples, program elements like temporary variables, initialization of loops and variables, routine loops, and so on are not shown.
