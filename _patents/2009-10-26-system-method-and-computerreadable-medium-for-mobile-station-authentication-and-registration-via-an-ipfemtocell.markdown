title: System, method, and computer-readable medium for mobile station authentication and registration via an IP-femtocell
abstract: A system, method, and computer readable medium for facilitating mobile station registration and authentication via a femtocell system are provided. A femtocell system receives a registration request from a mobile station and transmits a registration request to a core network on behalf of the mobile station. The registration request transmitted by the femtocell system preferably includes a register identifier generated by the femtocell system. The convergence server may be located in an Internet Protocol core network and may be configured to emulate a mobile switching center. On receipt of a registration request from the femtocell system, the convergence server may engage in a registration and authentication procedure with a radio access network Home Location Register and/or Authentication Center on behalf of the mobile station. Alternatively, the convergence server may be located in an Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) core network in which the convergence server is configured as an IMS application server. In this configuration, the femtocell system transmits the register request to a serving-call session control function that initiates a third-party registration process with the convergence server.

The RAN may be implemented as, for example, a CDMA2000 RAN, a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) RAN, a Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) RAN, or another suitable radio access network implementation. The MSs may comprise, for example, a mobile terminal such as a mobile telephone, a laptop computer featuring mobile telephony software and hardware, a personal digital assistant (PDA), or other suitable equipment adapted to transfer and receive voice or data communications with the radio access network.","A RAN covers a geographical area comprised of any number of cells each comprising a relatively small geographic area of radio coverage. Each cell is provisioned by a cell site that includes a radio tower, e.g., a base transceiver station (BTS), and associated equipment. BTSs communicate with MSs over an air interface within radio range of the BTSs.","Numerous BTSs in the RAN may be communicatively coupled to a base station controller (BSC), also commonly referred to as a radio network controller (RNC). The BSC manages and monitors various system activities of the BTSs serviced thereby. BSCs are typically coupled with at least one core network.","BTSs are typically deployed by a carrier network in areas having a high population density. The traffic capacity of a cell site is limited by the site's capacity and affects the spacing of cell sites. In suburban areas, sites are often up to two miles apart, while cell sites deployed in dense urban areas may be as close as one-quarter of a mile apart. Because the traffic capacity of a cell site is finitely limited, as is the available frequency spectrum, mobile operators have a vested interest in technologies that allow for increased subscriber capacity.","A microcell site comprises a cell in a mobile phone network that covers a limited geographic area, such as a shopping center, hotel, airport, or other infrastructure that may have a high density mobile phone usage. A microcell typically uses power control to limit the radius of the microcell coverage. Typically a microcell is less than a mile wide.","Although microcells are effective for adding network capacity in areas with high mobile telephone usage, microcells extensively rely on the RAN, e.g., a controlling BSC and other carrier functions. Because contemporary BSCs have limited processing and interface capacity, the number of BTSs\u2014whether microcell BTSs or typical carrier BTSs\u2014able to be supported by the BSC or other RAN functions is disadvantageously limited.","Contemporary interest exists in providing enterprise and office access, including small office\/home office (SOHO) radio access, by an even smaller scale BTS. The radio coverage area of such a system is typically referred to as a femtocell. In a system featuring a femtocell, an MS may be authorized to operate in the femtocell when proximate the femtocell system, e.g., while the MS is located in the SOHO. When the MS moves beyond the coverage area of the femtocell, the MS may then be serviced by the carrier network. The advantages of deployment of femtocells are numerous. For instance, mobile users frequently spend large amounts of time located at, for example, home, and many such users rely extensively on cellular network service for telecommunication services during these times. For example, a recent survey indicated that nearly thirteen percent of U.S. cell phone customers do not have a landline telephone and rely solely on cell phones for receiving telephone service. From a carrier perspective, it would be advantageous to have telephone services provisioned over a femtocell system, e.g., deployed in the user's home, to thereby reduce the load and effectively increase the capacity on the carrier RAN infrastructure. However, no efficient mechanisms have been provided for efficiently providing a convergence of femtocell and macrocellular systems in a manner that facilitates registration and authentication of mobile stations via a femtocell system.","Therefore, what is needed is a mechanism that overcomes the described problems and limitations.","The present invention provides a system, method, and computer readable medium for provisioning radio access via a femtocell system. A femtocell system may generate a register identification of a mobile station from one or more mobile station authentication parameters. On receipt of a registration request from a mobile station, the femtocell system may transmit a registration request to a core network on behalf of the mobile station. The registration request transmitted by the femtocell system preferably includes the register identification generated by the femtocell system. In an embodiment, the convergence server may be located in an Internet Protocol core network. In this configuration, the convergence server may be configured to emulate a mobile switching center. On receipt of a registration request from the femtocell system, the convergence server may engage in a registration and authentication procedure with a radio access network Home Location Register and\/or Authentication Center on behalf of the mobile station. In another implementation, the convergence server may be located in an Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) core network. In this configuration, the convergence server is emulated as an IMS application server. The femtocell system transmits the register request to a serving-call session control function (S-CSCF) that, in turn, initiates a third-party registration process with the convergence server on behalf of the mobile station. The convergence server then performs authentication and registration procedures with the radio access network HLR and\/or AC and notifies the femtocell system of either success or failure of the mobile station authentication and registration.","In accordance with an embodiment, a method of providing mobile station registration and authentication services in a network system is provided. A convergence server located in a first core network receives a session initiation protocol registration request for a mobile station transmitted to the first core network, receives authentication parameters of the mobile station, and performs authentication and registration procedures with a radio access core network on behalf of the mobile station.","In accordance with another embodiment, a computer-readable medium having computer-executable instructions tangibly embodied thereon for execution by a processing system, the computer-executable instructions for facilitating mobile station registration and authentication services in a network system is provided. The computer-executable instructions, when executed, cause the processing system to generate a registration identifier that is associated with a mobile station from at least one of a plurality of authentication parameters of the mobile station, receive, by a convergence server located in a first core network, a session initiation protocol registration request for the mobile station transmitted to the first core network, receive, by the convergence server, the plurality of authentication parameters of the mobile station, and perform, by the convergence server, authentication and registration procedures with a radio access core network on behalf of the mobile station.","In accordance with another embodiment, a network system that provides mobile station registration and authentication services is provided. The network system includes a first core network that includes a convergence server, a radio access core network, and an Internet Protocol-based femtocell system that provides a radio access point for one or more mobile stations. The femtocell system periodically transmits an overhead message train that includes a random number generated by the femtocell system. A mobile station receives the overhead message train, calculates a registration authentication result from data including the random number, and transmits a registration request including the registration authentication and a plurality of authentication parameters. On receipt of the registration request from the mobile station, the femtocell system generates a registration identifier that is associated with the mobile station from at least one of the plurality of authentication parameters of the mobile station. The convergence server receives a session initiation protocol registration request for the mobile station transmitted to the first core network and the plurality of authentication parameters of the mobile station. The convergence server performs authentication and registration procedures with the radio access core network on behalf of the mobile station.","It is to be understood that the following disclosure provides many different embodiments or examples for implementing different features of various embodiments.

BSC  manages the allocation of radio channels, receives measurements from mobile terminals, controls handovers, as well as various other functions as is understood. BSC  is interconnected with a Mobile Switching Center (MSC)  that provides mobile terminal exchange services. BSC  may be additionally coupled with a packet data serving node (PDSN)  or other gateway service that provides a connection point between the CDMA radio access network and a packet network, such as Internet , and provides mobility management functions and packet routing services. MSC  may communicatively interface with a circuit switched network, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN) , and may additionally be communicatively coupled with an interworking function (IWF)  that provides an interface between cellular network  and PSTN .","System  may also include a signaling system, such as a signaling system #7 (SS7) network . SS7 network  provides a set of telephony signaling protocols which are used to set up the vast majority of the world's PSTN telephone calls. SS7 network  is also used in cellular networks for circuit switched voice and packet-switched data applications. As is understood, SS7 network  includes various signaling nodes, such as any number of service control points (SCPs) , signal transfer points (STPs) , and service switching points (SSPs) .","BTSs -deployed in cellular network  may service numerous network  subscribers. Cell cites provided by BTSs -commonly feature site ranges of a quarter to a half mile, e.g., in densely populated urban areas, to one to two miles in suburban areas. In other remotely populated regions with suitable geography, site ranges may span tens of miles and may be effectively limited in size by the limited transmission distance of relatively low-powered MSs.

Femtocells comprise cellular access points that connect to a mobile operator's network using, for example, a residential Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or cable broadband connection. Femtocells -provide a radio access point for MS  when the MS is within range of a femtocell system with which the MS has authorized access. For example, femtocell system may be deployed in a residence of the user of MS . Accordingly, when the user is within the residence, mobile telecommunications may be provided to MS  via an air-interface provided by femtocell system . In this instance, MS  is effectively offloaded from the macro BTS, e.g., BTS , and communications to and from the MS are carried out with femtocell system over Internet . Thus, femtocell systems -may reduce the carrier radio resource demands by offloading MSs from macrocells to femtocells and thereby provide for increased subscriber capacity of cellular network .","In contemporary implementations such as that depicted in , a femtocell system comprises a transceiver without intelligence and is thus required to be connected and managed by BSC .

The CS  may be communicatively coupled with the SS7 network  and a Packet Data Interworking Function (PDIF) , e.g., via Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) communications. The CS  provides SIP registration functions and a central interface point to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) elements and the softswitch\/MGCF .

The MGW  may be communicatively coupled with the SS7 network  and the PDIF  in addition to the softswitch\/MGCF . The MGW  may convert data between real-time transport protocol (RTP) and pulse code modulation (PCM), and may also be employed for transcoding. Resources of the MGW  may be controlled by the softswitch\/MGCF .","In accordance with an embodiment, the system  may include a Security Server (SS)  that interfaces with the SS7 network , e.g., via IS-41, and the PDIF , e.g., via a Wm interface. The PDIF  facilitates access to the IP core network  via WiFi access points and may be responsible for such services as, for example, security, access, authentication, policy enforcement, user information collection, and IP address allocation as well as other services. The PDIF  may interface, e.g., via SIP communications, with the CS , and may have Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) communications with the MGW . Further, the PDIF  may have secured IP communications, e.g., IPsec, established with one or more femtocell systems, e.g., a femtocell system  deployed at a user premise, such as a home office. The secured communications may be established between the PDIF  and the femtocell system  over, for example, a broadband network  interface such as a residential DSL or cable broadband connection. The femtocell system , in turn, provides a radio access point for one or more MSs  when the MS  is within range of the femtocell system  with which the MS  has authorized access.","In accordance with an embodiment, a femtocell system  may include integrated BTS and BSC functions and may feature additional capabilities available in the provided femtocell site coverage area. Femtocell system  provides an IP-accessible radio access network, is adapted for operation with IP core network , and provides radio link control functions. Femtocell system  may be communicatively coupled with broadband network  via any variety of backhaul technologies, such as an 802.11x link, a 10\/100 BaseT LAN link, a T1\/E1 Span or fiber, cable set top box, DSL modem connected with a central office digital subscriber line access multiplexer, a very small aperture terminal (VSAT), or another suitable backhaul infrastructure.","In an embodiment, femtocell system  includes a session initiation protocol (SIP) adapter that supports a SIP client pool and provides conversion of call set-up functions to SIP client set-up functions.

In accordance with an embodiment, the IMS core network  includes a CS , a MGCF , an MGW , an X-Call Session Control Function (X-CSCF) , and a Home Subscriber Server (HSS)  among other components. The X-CSCF  processes SIP signaling packets and provides a centralized interface for control and signaling including SIP registration functions in accordance with disclosed embodiments. The X-CSCF  may provide Interrogating-CSCF (I-CSCF) services, Proxy-CSCF (P-CSCF) services, and Serving-CSCF (S-CSCF) services. The X-CSCF  comprises various SIP servers or proxies that process SIP signaling packets in the IMS core network . P-CSCF services provided by X-CSCF may include provisioning a first point of contact for an IMS-compliant MS. In such a situation, the X-CSCF may be located in a visited network or in an MS's home network if the visited network is not fully IMS-compliant. An MS may discover the X-CSCF , e.g., by using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), or by assignment in a packet data protocol context.

The CS  provides SIP registration functions and is the central interface point to the softswitch\/MGCF  and VOIP elements.","In an IMS network such as network system  depicted in , the CS  functions as an IMS application server, and the IMS infrastructure provides the centralized interface control and signaling including SIP registration functions. In this environment, the femtocell system  itself, or alternatively the femtocell system  acting as a proxy for the MS , sends a SIP:REGISTER (e.g., via other CSCFs) to the S-CSCF which performs a third-party registration of the MS  with the CS  based on initial filter criteria stored in the HSS .","In an embodiment, the femtocell system  may be configured to support \u201cGlobal Challenge\u201d based authentication on all system access (e.g., Registration, Call Origination, Call Termination, and Data Burst messages). The femtocell system may indicate a Global Challenge request by setting an authentication bit (e.g., AUTH=1) in the overhead message train (OMT). The femtocell system  may also include a global random challenge value (RAND) used in generating the authentication result by both the MS and the HLR\/AC.","The femtocell system preferably establishes an IPsec tunnel over the broadband network with the PDIF  or, alternatively, a P-CSCF before sending any SIP traffic to the CS . The IPsec tunnel may be established immediately after the femtocell system  is powered on or when an MS  attempts to establish a connection with the femtocell system . In this implementation, the CS  is not involved in establishing the IPsec tunnel.","In an embodiment, the CS  may be configured to receive CDMA-1x authentication data at the end of a SIP registration message using a SIP:MESSAGE received from the femtocell system . In this manner, the CS  conveys the result of the 1x authentication and, if needed, performs various authentication procedures, such as a unique challenge, SSD update, and a call history count.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3A"],"b":["600","300","350","602","350","325","325","350","350","350"]},"Based on the values in the OMT, the MS determines that a new serving system has been encountered and that authentication is required based on the authentication bit value (AUTH=1). Subsequently, the MS  attempts to obtain the random number (RAND) to be used for the authentication from the OMT. If the random number is not available, a zero value may be used by the MS as prescribed by TR-45 authentication procedures. The MS  then generates an authentication result (AUTHR). For example, the MS  may generate an authentication result from a shared secret data key (SSD-A) stored by the MS , the ESN or p-ESN, the MIN, and the RAND value obtained from the OMT. The authentication result may be generated, for example, by execution of the well known CAVE algorithm by the MS . The MS then transmits a registration request to the femtocell system  (step ). The register message may include the MS's MIN, ESN or p-ESN, the authentication result (AUTHR), a CallHistoryCount (COUNT), and a random confirmation (RANDC) derived from the random number (RAND) used to compute the authentication result (AUTHR).","On receiving the registration request from the MS , the femtocell system  sends a SIP:REGISTER message to the CS  (step ) in accordance with an embodiment. Optionally, the femtocell system  may establish an IPsec tunnel with the PDIF . The CS  then acknowledges receipt of the SIP:REGISTER message by transmitting a  OK SIP response to the femtocell system  (step ).","A registration phase is then invoked by the femtocell system  transmitting 1x authentication parameters received from the MS  at step  to CS  in a SIP: MESSAGE(LOCATION_UPDATING_REQUEST) (step ). The location updating request message includes the random number (RAND) rather than the random number confirmation (RANDC). The location updating request message additionally may include parameters, such as a Register ID, ESN, MEID, MIN, IMSI, etc. Using the Register ID, the CS  may associate the location updating request with the preceding SIP:REGISTER request received thereby from the femtocell system  in step . If the location updating request message includes a P-Access-Network-Info (PANI) header that may specify information about the access technology, the CS  may save the PANI information.","The CS  acknowledges receipt of the location updating request message by transmitting a  OK SIP response to the femtocell system  (step ). Network authentication and registration then occurs via exchanges between the CS  and HLR\/AC (step ). As part of the authentication response, the HLR\/AC may trigger Unique Challenge, SSD update, or CountUpdate procedures.","The CS  informs the femtocell system  of the authentication and registration results by transmitting a SIP location updating response message to the femtocell system  (step ). In the event of an authentication or registration failure, the CS  may send a SIP:MESSAGE containing, for example, an XML-encoded message body that facilitates deregistration of the femtocell system . The femtocell system  acknowledges receipt of the authentication and registration results by sending a  OK SIP response to the CS  (step ). In the event of either a registration or authentication failure, a deregistration process  is invoked by the femtocell system  transmitting a deregistration message, e.g., a SIP: REGISTER message with an expire value \u201c0\u201d, to the CS  (step ).

A femtocell system may generate a register identification of a mobile station from one or more mobile station authentication parameters. On receipt of a registration request from a mobile station, the femtocell system may transmit a registration request to a core network on behalf of the mobile station. The registration request transmitted by the femtocell system preferably includes the register identification generated by the femtocell system. In an embodiment, the convergence server may be located in an Internet Protocol core network. In this configuration, the convergence server may be configured to emulate a mobile switching center. On receipt of a registration request from the femtocell system, the convergence server may engage in a registration and authentication procedure with a radio access network Home Location Register and\/or Authentication Center on behalf of the mobile station. In another implementation, the convergence server may be located in an Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) core network. In this configuration, the convergence server is emulated as an IMS application server. The femtocell system transmits the register request to a serving-call session control function (S-CSCF) that, in turn, initiates a third-party registration process with the convergence server on behalf of the mobile station. The convergence server then performs authentication and registration procedures with the radio access network HLR and\/or AC and notifies the femtocell system of either success or failure of the mobile station authentication and registration.","The illustrative block diagrams depict process steps or blocks that may represent modules, segments, or portions of code that include one or more executable instructions for implementing specific logical functions or steps in the process.
