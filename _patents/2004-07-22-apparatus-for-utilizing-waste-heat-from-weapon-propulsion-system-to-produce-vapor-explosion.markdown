title: Apparatus for utilizing waste heat from weapon propulsion system to produce vapor explosion
abstract: The apparatus of the present invention uses waste heat generated by a weapon propulsion system to melt and ultimately superheat metal. Upon termination of the weapon mission, the apparatus explodes thereby causing molten and superheated metal to be instantly introduced to the liquid medium through which the weapon travels. The reaction of the molten and superheated metal with the liquid medium produces a vapor explosion that significantly enhances the effectiveness and lethality of the weapon.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to an apparatus that uses waste heat generated by a weapon propulsion system to produce a vapor explosion.","2. Description of the Related Art","Prior art rocket powered torpedoes are generally configured as shown in . Torpedo  travels through ambient fluid (e.g. ocean water)  in the direction indicated by arrow . Rocket casing  houses a rocket (not shown) and is in direct contact with ambient fluid  at the aft of torpedo . Thrust is produced by expelling gas through nozzle . The rocket produces waste heat that is dissipated by forced convection over the rocket casing  and the discharge of the exhaust into the ambient fluid . The remaining portion of torpedo  is constructed in sections and has a homing array (not shown) located in nose section , electronics section , warhead section  and exercise section . These sections are typically separated by bulkheads , ,  and . Torpedo  also has an outer shell  which does not extend over rocket casing  in order to facilitate heat transfer of heat generated by the rocket to ambient fluid . In other configurations, a heat shield (not shown) is added to bulkhead  in order to prevent overheating of the forward sections of torpedo . Warhead section  contains high explosives that are detonated at the end of the torpedo's run (i.e. mission termination) in order to produce an explosion of which the most destructive effects are a shock wave and a vapor bubble. The amount of waste heat generated by the rocket is a considerable portion of the total energy contained in the rocket fuel. What is needed is an apparatus and method for utilizing the waste heat generated by the weapon's propulsion system to enhance the lethality of the weapon.","The prior art discloses several weapon propulsion systems and devices in Jenkins, U.S. Pat. No. 4,406,863; Short, U.S. Pat. No. 4,680,934; Hartman et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,070,786; Duva, U.S. Pat. No. 5,253,473; Buzzett et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,728,968; Woodall et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,308,607; and Longardner, U.S. Pat. No. 6,400,896. However, such prior art systems do not utilize waste heat generated by the weapon propulsion system to enhance the lethality of the weapon.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus can be integrated into a weapon and which significantly enhances the lethality of the weapon.","It is another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus that is integrated into a weapon and utilizes the heat from the weapon's propulsion system to produce a secondary explosion upon termination of the weapon's mission.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the ensuing description.","Thus, the present invention is directed to an apparatus for utilizing waste heat from a weapon's propulsion system to increase the lethality of the weapon. Specifically, the present invention stores waste heat and coverts such waste heat into kinetic energy at the termination of the weapon's travel. The apparatus of the present invention effects storage of heat instead of exchanging the heat with ambient fluid as is done with prior art weapon propulsion systems. The stored heat is then used to melt and ultimately superheat metal. The detonation of the weapon warhead will scatter the molten metal in the presence of ambient fluid thereby resulting in a secondary vapor explosion. The secondary vapor explosion enhances the effectiveness and lethality of the weapon.","In one aspect, the present invention is directed to an apparatus for utilizing the waste heat energy of a weapon propulsion system to produce a vapor explosion. The apparatus comprises a metal structure having a body portion fabricated from a first metal having a first predetermined melting temperature, and a plurality of layers fabricated from a second metal embedded within the body portion and spaced apart from each other. The second metal has a second predetermined melting temperature that is less than the first predetermined melting temperature such that the second metal melts and attains superheat before the first metal. The body portion has a space sized to receive a propulsion device such that the body portion envelopes a substantial portion of the propulsion device. The space in the body portion has an opening from which an exhaust nozzle of the propulsion device can extend. The apparatus further includes an explosive device embedded in the body portion, and an electrical link connected to the explosive device to detonate the explosive device. The electrical link extends from the body portion.","Referring to , there is shown a partial view of a weapon  that utilizes apparatus  of the present invention. Weapon  can be a torpedo or similar weapon that travels through a liquid medium such as ocean water. Weapon  has bulkhead  that separates apparatus  from the other sections of the weapon. Apparatus  comprises outer shell  that cooperates with bulkhead  to form a chamber or compartment . Chamber  has a port  through which a propulsion exhaust device, such as a rocket nozzle , can extend. This feature is further described in the ensuing description. Outer shell  has seams , ,  and  that will easily rupture when exposed to an internal explosion. Apparatus  comprises metal structure  that envelopes a substantial portion of a propulsion device of weapon . Metal structure  is described in detail in the ensuing description. The propulsion device includes rocket casing  and rocket  which is housed within rocket casing . Rocket  includes nozzle . In order to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of apparatus , rocket casing  is preferably fabricated from a metal that has an extremely high melting point and good thermal conductivity to maximize radiation of waste heat therefrom. Suitable metals for fabricating rocket casing  include titanium; however, other suitable metals having the desired melting temperature and thermal conductivity can be used as well. Although weapon  is described as utilizing a rocket-type propulsion system, it is to be understood that apparatus  can be used with other types of weapon propulsion systems.","Referring to , in accordance with the invention, apparatus  further includes heat shield  that is positioned between metal structure  and outer shell . Heat shield  extends over aft bulkhead . Heat shield  may be fabricated form a variety of ceramic and evacuated layers. Heat shield  holds the waste heat generated from rocket  within compartment . Thus, heat shield  effects an increase in temperature in compartment  which enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of apparatus  as will be explained in the ensuing description.","Referring to , metal structure  comprises body portion  that is fabricated from a first metal that does not react with water (i.e. non-reactive), and a plurality of layers  formed of a second metal that does react with water (i.e. reactive). This two metal structure  gives some benefit during a short weapon run while maintaing structural integrity. After a longer run more of the body portion  will become molten. Layers  are embedded in body portion  and are spaced apart. In one embodiment, layers  are generally parallel to one another or concentric. Body portion  is configured to envelope rocket casing . In a preferred embodiment, some of layers  are embedded in body portion  in such a manner these layers  contact rocket casing . Metal structure  can be configured to have any type of shape, square, circular, etc. In a preferred embodiment, metal structure  occupies substantially all the available space within the confines of heat shield . Layers  can be arranged and positioned within body portion  in any one of a variety of geometrical arrangements. In one embodiment, layers  are arranged so as to generally form a matrix. The number of layers  can be varied depending upon the particular application and the desired magnitude of the vapor explosion. As shown in , metal structure  has explosive device  embedded therein. Electrical link  is connected to explosive device . Electrical link  can be a wire or cable that is capable of carrying electrical voltage signals. Electrical link  extends from metal structure , heat shield  and bulkhead  through appropriate sized bores, channels or openings (not shown). Electrical link  is electrically connected to weapon control module  (see ). Upon mission termination, weapon control module  emits an electrical signal that detonates explosive device . In a preferred embodiment, heat shield  is positioned between explosive device  and metal structure  in order to thermally isolate explosive device .","Referring to , in accordance with the invention, the melting temperatures of the metals forming body portion  and layers  are significantly less than the melting temperature of the metal used to fabricate rocket casing . In accordance with the invention, the melting temperature of the metal forming body portion  is greater than the metal temperature of the metal that forms each of layers . Thus, the metal forming layers  will melt and reach superheat before the metal forming body portion . Suitable metals for layers  include lithium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and lead. Such suitable metals include metals that will physically react with water by causing flash boiling, and metals that will cause an explosive chemical reaction upon contact with water; however, other suitable metals can be used as well. Suitable non-reactive metals for body portion  include aluminum and steel alloys. However, other suitable non-reactive metals can be used as well. At ambient temperature and at weapon launch, the metals used to form body portion  and layers  are in the solid state.","Referring to , the manner in which apparatus  is kept inert depends upon the type of metals used to fabricate body portion  and layers . For example, if the metal used to form body portion  is aluminum and the metal used to form layers  is magnesium, then apparatus  can be kept inert if apparatus  is kept cool. In another example, if the metal used to form body portion  is aluminum and the metal used to form layers  is lithium, then apparatus  can be kept inert if apparatus  is kept dry.","Referring to , during operation of weapon , rocket  is fired to provide weapon thrust. Weapon  typically includes weapon control module , deployable cavitator , and ventilation system . Weapon control module  outputs an electrical signal over electrical link  to detonate explosive charge  upon termination of the mission. The configuration of weapon , as shown in , allows weapon  to operate in ventilated cavity . Ventilated cavity  has a cavity closure-point  that is located downstream of exhaust plume . As weapon  travels though a liquid medium (e.g. ocean water), the waste heat generated by rocket  and transferred by rocket casing  causes the temperature of metal structure  to increase. Heat shield  facilitates increase of the temperature of metal structure . Operation of weapon  in ventilated cavity  facilitates further increase in temperature of metal structure . As a result, the temperature of the metals forming body portion  and layers  quickly increase and approach superheat as the weapon mission time (e.g. torpedo run-time) increases. Since the melting temperature of the metal forming layers  is less than the metal forming body portion , layers  melt first and become a superheated liquid or molten metal. This superheated liquid or molten metal is extremely volatile. For example, if the metal forming body portion  is aluminum and the metal forming layers  is lithium, even a relatively short weapon mission time would cause complete melting of the lithium layers  due to the relatively low melting temperature of lithium, 179 degrees Celsius. However, if the weapon mission time is relatively long, melting and superheating of both the lithium and aluminum would occur. At termination of the weapon's mission, weapon control module  generates an electrical signal on electrical link  that detonates explosive charge . The explosion of explosive charge  explodes metal structure  and ruptures seams , ,  and  of outer shell  thereby causing a rapid introduction of the liquid or molten metal into the liquid medium (e.g. ocean). The interaction of the liquid or molten metal with the liquid medium produces several vapor explosions and chemical reactions that produce shock waves, vapor bubbles, and molten metal shrapnel. These vapor explosions are in addition to the main explosion caused by the warhead carried by the weapon.","Although a particular embodiment of the invention has been described, it is to be understood that modifications and other embodiments are possible. For example, the details of metal structure  can be varied. Instead of having layers , body portion  can be made from a single metal. The metals used in metal structure  can be varied depending upon the thermal properties of rocket  and the expected time for completion of the weapons' mission. Non-reactive metals such as steel alloys can be used to maximize effectiveness of the weapon when impact with a relatively large surface target is required. Apparatus  can be used with or without a conventional warhead. Thus, apparatus  can be operated without a conventional warhead, thereby relying only on the impact of the weapon on the target and the vapor explosion so as to control or minimize the amount of damage done to a target. Metal structure  can be configured to be used with a conventional non-rocket powered weapon. Apparatus  can be configured to have a protective sub-compartment that envelopes metal structure  to prevent contact of the liquid or molten metal with heat shield .","Thus, apparatus  of the present invention provides many advantages. Specifically, apparatus  significantly enhances the lethality of the weapon with which it used. The vapor explosion created by apparatus  at mission termination significantly enhances the effectiveness of the weapon against large surface targets (e.g. ships or other vessels) as well as multi-hulled vessels. Explosive charge  does not require any special arming device or arming procedure and simply relies on an electrical signal from weapon control module for detonation.","The principles, preferred embodiments and modes of operation of the present invention have been described in the foregoing specification. The invention which is intended to be protected herein should not, however, be construed as limited to the particular forms disclosed, as these are to be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive. Variations in changes may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention.
