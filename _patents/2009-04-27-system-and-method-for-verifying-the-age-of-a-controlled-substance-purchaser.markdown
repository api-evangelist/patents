No. 61\/128,097; filed on May 16, 2008; by the same inventor.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. The following notice applies to the software and data as described below and in the drawings that form a part of this document: Copyright 2008-2009, Michael Haugh, All Rights Reserved.","1. Technical Field","This disclosure relates to information exchange using networked systems. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a system and method for verifying the age of a controlled substance purchaser.","2. Related Art","While most goods can be freely sold to any purchaser having the required funds available to pay the purchase price, some products are identified as \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d or \u201cage-restricted products\u201d that cannot be freely sold. Some such controlled substances are restricted as to the age of the purchaser. For instance, alcoholic beverages can only be purchased in many states if the purchaser is at least twenty-one years old. In many States, cigarettes and other goods have related age sufficiency requirements for a purchase transaction to lawfully occur.","When individuals who do not meet the required age for making the purchase still desire to purchase such controlled substances, various different illicit techniques have been developed to unlawfully dupe the cashier at a retail store into believing that the purchaser has the requisite age to complete the purchase. One common method for deceiving the cashier is to utilize a false identification (ID) or a valid ID of a person other than the purchaser. The purchaser presents the incorrect ID when prompted by the cashier. Only if the cashier can accurately recognize that the photo on the ID is not the person attempting to purchase the controlled substance, can the cashier prevent the transaction. Often such ID photos are sufficiently small and the variability in human appearance is sufficiently great that a cashier will not notice this discrepancy. Furthermore, as the cashier is generally desirous of avoiding confrontation with purchasers and maximizing the number and amount of transactions concluded, the cashier is not incentivized to prevent the transaction from occurring.","In other cases, an individual will take an accurate and proper identification card and alter the date of birth section (and\/or the photo) to indicate an earlier date of birth than actually exists. In such a case, the photo would appear accurate to the cashier, but the small numbers depicting the date of birth would have been altered. Unless the cashier accurately notes that the date of birth numbers are too recent to substantiate the required age, the transaction will be improperly completed.","Other forms of false identification cards can also be generated which can successfully convince the cashier that the purchaser is older than the required age, when the purchaser is in fact not older than the required age. In each case, the purchaser ends up gaining access to the controlled substance in violation of law. Statistics tell a grim tale of the effects of alcohol on underage drivers. The mix of driver inexperience with degraded perception induced by the alcohol, contribute to automobile accidents being one of the significant causes of death or serious injury for young people, and particularly those under the legal drinking age. Related problems for society accompany distribution of controlled substances improperly to those who have not yet attained the required age.","U.S. Patent Publication No. US 2003\/0177102 describes a system and method of biometric-based age verification for authorizing presenter access of age-restricted good or services between an age presenter and an age verifier. System Presenters register at least one biometric identifier, at least one identification number, personal age-verifying data, and personal identity-verifying data. A presenter presents a biometric sample obtained from the presenter's person and the presenter's system ID number to conduct age verifications for purchase of or access to age-restricted goods or services. This data is used to authenticate the presenter's age and authorize access to purchase or obtain age-restricted goods or services by matching the presented transaction biometric with at least one registered biometric template and without the use of a man-made identity token.","U.S. Patent Publication No. US 2007\/0260491 describes a system for delivery and monitoring the administration of controlled substances which includes one or more databases including a national database of controlled substance users, a database including physician\/pharmacy information, a controlled substance delivery device and a docking station for use together with a network and software for communication between the various components of the system.","U.S. Patent Publication No. US 2006\/0001524 describes a system for checking the authenticity of a form of identification; a local reader for reading a form of authentication; a transmitter associated with the local reader for transmitting the information to a central location; a system at the central location for verifying the information with an authority which has issued the identification and for transmitting back to the local reader an indication that the form of identification is valid.","U.S. Patent Publication No. US 2004\/0238629 describes a system and method of conducting sales transactions. More particularly, the system includes a first station at which a customer may obtain a portable scanning device. This scanning device may be readily transported about a store and may be utilized to both scan and purchase the items selected by the customer. In addition, the invention generally includes a processor assembly that is wirelessly communicable with the portable scanning device. This feature may be characterized as enabling the customer to make a purchase from virtually any location in the store. After the desired items are purchased, an exit audit may be conducted in which an electronic scale assembly that is communicatively interconnected with the processor assembly is utilized to audit the purchase.","U.S. Patent Publication No. US 2006\/0273155 describes a system and method providing for an independent provider of electronic \u201cstored value\u201d credit to enable a consumer of products and services to apply cash or cash equivalents to fund an electronic account, i.e., a stored value account (SVA), managed by an independent stored value provider (ISVP) in a network of ISVPs. The consumer is typically a customer of the ISVP. The applied funds may be used by the customer to purchase products and services from any of several merchants that have established a transactional business association with the ISVP. The merchants may also be any type of on-line e-commerce business and\/or a traditional in-store business. Moreover, a customer may transfer funds from one SVA to another SVA. Customers may add funds to a SVA, in person, at a Retail Financial Service Provider (RFSP) who verifies the identity of the consumer.","Accordingly, a need exists for a more robust system to ensure that only purchasers who have attained the required legal age can properly purchase controlled substances. Such a system should not penalize the cashier or retail store operator, but rather be a system that is easy for the store to implement. Also, such a system should be minimally intrusive upon the privacy concerns of individuals in our society. Thus, a system and method for verifying the age of a controlled substance purchaser are needed.","A system and method for verifying the age of a controlled substance purchaser are disclosed. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth. However, it is understood that embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known processes, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure the clarity of this description. Various embodiments are described below in connection with the figures provided herein.","As described for various embodiments herein, a system is provided for verifying the age of a purchaser of a controlled substance, such as alcoholic beverages, from a retail store. An example embodiment of system  is illustrated in . As shown in , typically a cash register or other form of point of sale terminal  is provided at the location in the store where the retail transaction takes place (i.e., the point of sale or POS location). Also, a conventional bar code scanner (not shown) is often provided to automatically scan bar codes on purchased goods. Using one of the various embodiments described herein, an additional item is provided at the point of sale location in the form of a conventional biometric data capture device (e.g., fingerprint scanner) . The biometric data capture device utilizes conventional machine vision technology to convert at least portions of the fingerprint  of the purchaser into a digital file which is capable of being read, transmitted and compared to other fingerprint files in a database . A central computer  can match the scanned fingerprint file with fingerprint records within associated databases  in a manner described in more detail below. The conventional machine vision technology can use charge coupled devices (CCD's) or arrays of optical switches or infrared scanning technology, or any other known technology to generate a unique data file for a scanned fingerprint that can be matched and compared to other scanned fingerprints (or data files representative of other fingerprints).","The point of sale terminal (e.g., cash register) , and possibly the biometric data capture device , can be coupled (either wirelessly or through a physical connection, such as a telephone line) to a central computer  via a data network, such as the Internet . If wireless data communication technology is used, the point of sale terminal  can include an antenna  for wireless data communication to a wireless router or the like. In this manner, the point of sale terminal  can establish networked data communications with the central computer . The point of sale terminal  can also be directly coupled to the biometric data capture device  as shown in . In a typical configuration, the point of sale terminal  can be configured as a client device and the central computer  can be configured as a network server. Conventional client\/server data communication protocols can be used. The central computer  has access to a database  of personal information files , which may include fingerprint data or other biometric data for individuals who have established a record with the administrator of the central computer . One such administrator of the central computer  can be a Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) computer and database of driver's license holders and DMV Identification (ID) card holders. Other examples of an administrator of the central computer  and database  can include the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), military agencies, other government agencies, corporations or other public or private organizations who may retain and control access to personal biometric data. In a typical implementation, the personal information files  include fingerprint data or other biometric data for individuals along with the individual's name, date of birth (DOB), address, gender\/sex, height and weight (Hgt\/Wgt), photo image, and a variety of other personal information related to a particular individual.","This basic example system  shown in  and associated processes of an example embodiment illustrated in  can be utilized in the following fashion. First, when a purchaser presents a controlled substance for purchase at the point of sale location (, process block ), either the cashier recognizes that the item is controlled, or upon scanning the item with a bar code scanner, the point of sale terminal  communicates to the cashier that the item is a controlled substance (, process block ). The cashier can then prompt the prospective purchaser to place their thumb or some other finger onto the biometric data capture device  (, process block ). The biometric data capture device  can then scan the fingerprint  and create a corresponding fingerprint digital file (, process block ). The fingerprint digital file is transferred to the point of sale terminal  or generated by the point of sale terminal  in concert with the biometric data capture device .","This fingerprint digital file, created at the point of sale location, can be augmented with additional information to form an age verification request, which can be sent to the central computer  via network  (, process block ). The age verification request can be augmented, for example, to include a required age or product code associated with the age-restricted product presented for purchase by the consumer. The central computer  has access to a database  of fingerprint data (e.g., a DMV computer in the State where the purchase is taking place). The central computer  can compare the fingerprint  in the fingerprint digital file that was sent from the biometric data capture device  via the point of sale terminal  to the fingerprints in the personal information files  within database  of fingerprint data accessible to the central computer  (, process block ). Software in the central computer  can control this comparison and matching procedure, as described in more detail below. If no match is found or the match that is found is for an individual with an age less than the required age, a signal or response message can be sent by the central computer  via network  back to the point of sale terminal  of a retail store to prevent completion of the transaction to the underage customer (, process block ). This signal or response message can be in the form of data that causes a visual display including a message such as \u201ctransaction denied\u201d or \u201cunderage.\u201d As another alternative, the signal or response message can interact and cooperate with the point of sale terminal  to automatically prevent the particular item from being included in the purchase. The cashier can then instruct the purchaser as to their underage status and the purchaser can typically have a second opportunity to provide compelling proof of sufficient age (, process block ). If the central computer  searches database  and identifies a personal information file  with a fingerprint corresponding with the scanned fingerprint sent from the point of sale terminal  of the retail store location, and the age or date of birth information extracted from that personal information file  can be used to determine that the age of the purchaser is sufficient to complete the transaction, a signal or response message is communicated to the retail store indicating \u201ctransaction approved\u201d or \u201cage sufficient.\u201d (, process block ) The cashier can then complete the transaction (, process block ).","As a purchaser might be purchasing multiple items, which are of a controlled nature, the system  can be configured so that the purchaser would only need to have their fingerprint scanned once and for this information to be remembered for the entire transaction, rather than requiring the purchaser to again provide a fingerprint multiple times during the transaction.","While individual State governments typically maintain separate databases for license holder information, a system in a particular embodiment can operate within each State individually or the databases can be linked to expand this system to operate nationally. This embodiment is described in more detail below in connection with . Furthermore, the system can expand to being an international system should the personal information databases of separate countries be in a form which facilitates such searching of multiple international databases concurrently.","The system of various embodiments does not need to divulge any confidential or private information to the cashier or anyone else. Rather, the system can be configured to only provide to the cashier an indication of whether or not the age of the prospective purchaser is sufficient to complete the transaction. The actual age or date of birth of the prospective purchaser does not have to be disclosed; rather, information merely indicative that the age is either above or not above the required age to complete the transaction is disclosed. By the purchaser presenting their finger for scanning, the purchaser can be considered to imply that their fingerprint should be in the database of individuals having a sufficient age to complete such transactions.","As a prerequisite, this database of fingerprint data  must necessarily have been previously created by a fingerprint data repository system having a fingerprint data collection (e.g., the DMV), which is accessible to the central computer . Hence, the purchaser already trusted the fingerprint data repository system (e.g., the DMV) with their fingerprint information. Thus, no new information is required to be presented by the prospective purchaser. Rather, the purchaser fingerprint is merely representing data that was submitted previously, for comparison purposes. If desired, the digital file containing fingerprint data sent to the fingerprint data repository system can be encoded in the same manner that credit card numbers and other sensitive information is encoded in a secure remote transaction.","Software already exists by which outlying DMV offices utilize a fingerprint scanner  at the outlying offices to verify that the individual present is the same individual for whom an individual record exists in the DMV's central computer . For example, the California Department of Motor Vehicles uses such a fingerprint scanner  at its various local offices. Software in the point of sale terminal  for capturing the purchaser fingerprint at the biometric data capture device , creating a corresponding fingerprint data file in an age verification request, and sending the age verification request to the central computer  is described in more detail below.","To implement a particular embodiment, database searching and matching software of the central computer  can be generated or modified to perform the fingerprint search and compare function. This matching software in central computer  is described in more detail below. Such central computer  software can be generated or modified to, in a first step, match the sent fingerprint data file with the personal information files  in the database  to identify the matching personal information file, if any. Second, the date of birth field in the matched personal information file  can be extracted and compared to the present date to determine an age of the purchaser. Next, the age calculated by the central computer  software can be compared to an age required for the purchase of an item presented for purchase by the consumer at the point of sale location. The required age can be stored in a data file with the central computer  (e.g., DMV computer) for the central computer  software of a particular embodiment to access or the required age can be transmitted by the point of sale terminal  along with the fingerprint data file sent from the retail store site. In another alternative embodiment, the age calculated by the central computer  software can be sent to the point of sale terminal  and the point of sale terminal  can compare the age calculated by the central computer  software to an age required for the purchase of an item presented for purchase by the consumer at the point of sale location. If the age calculated by the central computer  software is less than the required age, the \u201cunderage\u201d condition exists and an indication of this condition is sent back to the point of sale terminal  at the retail store location. If the age calculated by the central computer  software is greater than or equal to the required age, a \u2018sufficient age\u2019 signal is sent to the point of sale terminal  at the retail store location approving the transaction.","Typically, the cashier at the point of sale location can also have a code which can be entered into the point of sale terminal  to bypass this age verification security should it be necessary. For instance, an international traveler might only have a passport or a driver's license from some other country that does not have electronic records including fingerprint information linked to the retail store. In such cases, the cashier can demand photo ID, such as a passport, and verify that the age is appropriate in a non-automated manner. In an alternative embodiment, the system of a particular embodiment can require entry of a passport number or other jurisdiction ID card number to at least verify that a genuine number is being presented. However, for a vast majority of purchases, a driver's license is held by the purchaser and the database associated with the driver's license includes the date of birth or other age-determining information. Hence, for nearly all purchasers, the result of the fingerprint scan can be dispositive on the ultimate issue of whether or not the purchase can take place.","Details of example embodiments are provided below. Figures are also provided to depict the example embodiments and to further depict the general arrangement of equipment at the point of sale location and the general configuration of the central computer and personal information file database at a separate location.","Description of the Age Verification Processor of an Example Embodiment","Referring now to , as described in various embodiments described herein, central computer  can be considered a network-accessible server, server farm, web site, or the like that can enable network access to and from POS (point of sale) client systems  and  via a network  (e.g. the Internet).  illustrates an example embodiment  of a networked system in which various embodiments may operate. As shown in , a central computer  is in data communication with one or more POS client systems  and  via a conventional network , such as the Internet. POS client systems  and  can be used by cashiers or merchants at point of sale locations who can log in to the central computer  via browsers and the network  and activate the Age Verification service enabled by the various embodiments described herein. In a particular embodiment shown in , an Age Verification processor  can be provided in or by each of the POS client systems  and . The Age Verification processor  is described in more detail below in connection with . A Central Matching processor  can also be provided in or by central computer . The Central Matching processor  is described in more detail below in connection with .","It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that an equivalent configuration could include multiple central computer sites, each managing a portion of the functionality provided by the Central Matching processor  described herein. A particular embodiment can include an additional layer, called the Partner Sites, wherein each Partner Site is hosted on a separate server and each Partner Site communicates with the Central Matching processor , described in more detail below. In this embodiment, each Partner Site can collect portions of the personal information files for particular purchasers.","Another alternative embodiment is illustrated in . In alternative system  shown in , database , which contains the personal information files , is located separately from central computer  at a database site . Database site  can be coupled to network  and accessed by central computer  via network .  represents a more distributed arrangement of the database  of personal information files . In the system embodiment  shown in , the database  of personal information files  is directly connected to central computer  and isolated from network . Such a configuration may provide a higher level of security for the information stored in the database . In contrast, the system embodiment  shown in  provides a configuration in which the central computer  may access a plurality of distributed databases  of personal information files  maintained at a plurality of network accessible database sites . In this manner, the central matching processor  can access personal information files  stored in a plurality of network accessible databases  located in different States, different countries, or different governmental or private agencies located domestically or internationally.","Further, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that another equivalent configuration can include a portion of the functionality provided by the Central Matching processor  being downloaded to POS client systems  and  and executed locally at the point of sale locations. In any of these alternative configurations, the Age Verification service described herein enables and supports an automated system for capturing purchaser biometric information and performing age verification prior to the purchase of an age-restricted product at a point of sale location.","Referring now to , an example embodiment showing the functionality components of the Age Verification processor  of a POS client system is shown. As illustrated in , a central computer  is in networked data communication with one or more POS client systems  and  via a conventional network , such as the Internet. Additionally, the Age Verification processor , as executed in POS client systems  and , can gather biometric information for cashiers or merchants from a plurality of consumers who present age-restricted products for purchase at a point of sale location. The functionality provided by the Age Verification processor  of a particular embodiment to support the cashiers or merchants can be partitioned into a set of functional components  and . It will be understood that these functional components can be implemented in software executing in POS client systems  and . As described above, other equivalent configurations can also be implemented.","Referring still to  in a first functional component, a point of sale component  is provided as part of Age Verification processor . The point of sale component  provides the functionality with which biometric information can be gathered from consumers who present age-restricted products for purchase at a point of sale location. The point of sale component  includes a user interface with which the cashier or merchant at a point of sale location can configure the Age Verification processor  for use at a particular location. The user interface can also be used to configure the POS client  to automatically prevent an underage product transaction or merely display a transaction approval or transaction denial message to the cashier. The user interface can be further used to configure an override code with which a cashier may override an automatically prevented product transaction. As described above, a cashier may be prompted to request identification from a purchaser if a fingerprint-based age verification process results in denial of the purchase transaction. The user interface of the point of sale component  can also receive a response message from the central computer  via the central computer interface component  that indicates whether a particular age verification process results in approval or denial of the purchase transaction. Upon receiving such a response message, the point of sale component  can notify the cashier and\/or automatically prevent the transaction as pre-configured in the manner described above. A series of transactions by the same purchaser can, also be grouped so the fingerprint verification is only performed once for a particular purchaser.","The point of sale component  also includes an interface to the biometric data capture device . Biometric data capture devices (e.g., fingerprint scanners)  are well known in the art. Conventional biometric data capture device  can capture a fingerprint image and either send the full image to point of sale component  or reduce the fingerprint image to a set of fingerprint minutiae data representations that can be sent to the point of sale component . Once the fingerprint image or minutiae data representations are received by the point of sale component , an age verification request including a fingerprint data file can be created by the point of sale component . The age verification request can include the fingerprint image or minutiae data representations provided by the scan of the consumer's digit, a required age or product type presented for purchase, a date\/time stamp, a location or merchant identifier, and other information of use to the central computer . The age verification request can be passed to the central computer interface component  for transfer via network  to the central computer .","Referring still to  in a second functional component, a\u2032central computer interface component  is provided as part of Age Verification processor . The central computer interface component  provides the functionality with which the age verification request can be sent to the central computer  for matching of fingerprint data in databases  or . The central computer interface component  can also be configured to receive a response message from the central computer  when the matching process has been completed. This response message can be as simple as an approve or deny indication that either, 1) indicates approval of the purchase transaction if the purchaser was matched with a personal information file  indicating the required age is satisfied, or 2) indicates denial of the purchase transaction if the purchaser was either unmatched or matched with a personal information file  indicating the consumer is underage. In an alternative embodiment, the central computer interface component  can receive an indication of the age or birthdate of the consumer from the central computer  and the central computer interface component  can use the age or birthdate information provided by the central computer  to generate the approve or deny indication described above.","Referring now to , an example embodiment showing the functionality components of the Central Matching processor  of a central computer system  is shown. As illustrated in , the central computer  is in networked data communication with one or more POS client systems  and  via a conventional network , such as the Internet. Additionally, the Age Verification processor , as executed in POS client systems  and , can send age verification requests including biometric information data files to the central computer  as described above. The functionality provided by the Central Matching processor  of a particular embodiment to support the cashiers or merchants at point of sale locations can be partitioned into a set of functional components -. It will be understood that these functional components can be implemented in software executing in central computer . As described above, other equivalent configurations can also be implemented.","Referring still to  in a first functional component, a point of sale interface component  is provided as part of Central Matching processor . The point of sale interface component  provides the functionality with which the age verification requests including biometric information data can be received from POS client systems  and  via network . The point of sale interface component  can include a dispatching function that receives an age verification request from a POS client and initiates a fingerprint matching operation by signaling the central database interface component  and matching component  that a new request for age verification has been received. The point of sale interface component  can also receive results data in a response message from the matching component  when the fingerprint matching operation has been completed. The point of sale interface component  can then forward the response message to the appropriate POS client system, which originated the corresponding age verification request. The point of sale interface component  can also include a user interface with which an administrator at the central computer  location can configure the central matching processor  for use by particular POS client systems and for use with a particular configuration of database(s)  and\/or .","Referring still to  in a second functional component, a central database interface component  is provided as part of Central Matching processor . The central database interface component  provides the functionality with which the personal information files  can be accessed by the central computer  for matching of fingerprint data in databases  and\/or . As described above, the central computer  can be configured to access personal information files  locally in database  or remotely in databases  at database sites . The central database interface component  provides the functionality to access the configured database using the appropriate pre-configured access protocol and network routing.","Referring still to  in a third functional component, a matching component  is provided as part of Central Matching processor . The matching component  provides the functionality with which biometric information from a particular purchaser at a POS client location can be compared with biometric data in the personal information files  in databases  and\/or . As described above, an age verification request, including purchaser biometric information, can be sent to the matching component  from the age verification processor  via network  and point of sale interface component . The matching component  can extract the purchaser biometric information (e.g., fingerprint data) from the age verification request received from a POS client system. The matching component  can also use the central database interface component  to open a pre-configured database of personal information files . The matching component  can then begin comparing the purchaser biometric information with the biometric information in each of the personal information files  in database(s)  and\/or . In order to save time and system resources, this comparison operation may be configured to limit a search to a particular subset of available personal information files  based on, for example, a number of configurable parameters, such as the location of the POS client system, the regions associated with a particular product presented for purchase, and the like. The matching component  can flag an indication if a matching one of the personal information files  is not found. If a matching one of the personal information files  is found based on a match between the purchaser biometric information and the biometric information in a matched one of the personal information files , the age or date of birth information from the matched one of the personal information files  can be extracted. The extracted date of birth information can be used with the current date to compute a current age of the purchaser. The current age of the purchaser can be compared with a required age received in the age verification request from a POS client system. The result of this comparison can either be that, 1) the current age of the purchaser is less than the required age (i.e. underage condition), or 2) the current age of the purchaser is greater than or equal to the required age (i.e. compliant or sufficient age condition). In either case, the matching component  can generate a response message or signal indicating the result of the age comparison. This response message or signal can be conveyed back to the POS client that originated the age verification request via the point of sale interface component  and network . In an alternative embodiment, the matching component  can generate a response message or signal simply indicating the current age or date of birth of the purchaser as extracted from the corresponding personal information file . This response message or signal can also be conveyed back to the POS client that originated the age verification request via the point of sale interface component  and network . In this case, the POS client can perform a comparison between the current age or date of birth of the purchaser and the required age for the proposed consumer transaction.","Referring now to , another example embodiment  of a networked system in which various embodiments may operate is illustrated. In the embodiment illustrated, the central computer  is shown to include the Central Matching processor  as described above. The Central Matching processor  is shown to include the functional components -. In a particular embodiment, the central computer  may also include a web server , having a web interface with which merchants and\/or system administrators may interact with the central computer  via a user interface or web interface and network . The central computer  may also include an application programming interface (API)  with which the central computer  may interact with other network entities (e.g., database sites , or POS clients \/) on a programmatic or automated data transfer level. The API  and web interface  may be configured to interact with the Central Matching processor  either directly or via an interface . The Central Matching processor  may be configured to directly access the personal information files  in database  via interface  or to remotely access the personal information files  in database  at database site  via interfaces  or  and network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["800","800","810","812","814","816","818"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":"700"},"The example computer system  includes a processor  (e.g., a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU), or both), a main memory  and a static memory , which communicate with each other via a bus .

In other embodiments, the \u201cmodule\u201d may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., within a special-purpose processor) to perform certain operations. A module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a module mechanically, in the dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g. configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations. Accordingly, the term \u201cmodule\u201d should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired) or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner and\/or to perform certain operations described herein. While the machine-readable medium  is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium, the term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d or \u201cmachine-useable medium\u201d should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a central or distributed database, and\/or associated caches and servers) that store the one or more sets of instructions. The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d or \u201cmachine-useable medium\u201d shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying a set of instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present description. The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d or \u201cmachine-useable medium\u201d shall accordingly be taken to include, but not be limited to, solid-state memories, and optical and magnetic media. As noted, the software may be transmitted over a network using a transmission medium. The term \u201ctransmission medium\u201d shall be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying instructions for transmission to and execution by the machine, and includes digital or analog communications signal or other intangible medium to facilitate transmission and communication of such software.","The illustrations of embodiments described herein are intended to provide a general understanding of the structure of various embodiments, and they are not intended to serve as a complete description of all the elements and features of apparatus and systems that might make use of the structures described herein.
