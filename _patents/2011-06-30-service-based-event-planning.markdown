title: Service based event planning
abstract: Services are queried for resources to be used at an event. For example, service based event planning may be used in conjunction with directory services, social networking services, custom databases, web services, email servers and address book services. Service based event planning may apply constraints to the resources obtained over services. The service based event planning may also be used in conjunction with email or other messaging services to share representations of events with attendees or other interested parties. Both recipients and senders of the event may be able to dynamically modify event details in event representations.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["To be successful, events need to be planned and representations of the events may be shared. When organizing an event, various resources, including equipment, rooms, layout, and other items may need to be gathered and the details of these items coordinated along with invitees in order to make the event successful. The resources for an event may be gathered from disparate source services, such as, for example, from social networking sites, directory services, internet and\/or intranet web resources, and other sources. Each resource may have timing constraints on availability. After the event is planned, the details of the event may need to be distributed and shared to attendees or other participants (such as people helping to setup the event) in order to make the event successful. Representations of events may be generated, and when the representations are complete, descriptions and illustrations of events may be sent to attendees or other interested parties.","The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding to the reader.

For example, device  may also include additional storage (e.g., removable and\/or non-removable) including, but not limited to, magnetic or optical disks or tape. Such additional storage is illustrated in  by storage . In one embodiment, computer readable instructions to implement embodiments of the invention may be stored in storage . Storage  may also store other computer readable instructions to implement an operating system, an application program (such as an event planning application), and the like.","Embodiments of the invention will be described in the general context of \u201ccomputer readable instructions\u201d being executed by one or more computing devices. Computer readable instructions may be distributed via computer readable media (discussed below). Computer readable instructions may be implemented as program modules, such as functions, objects, application programming interfaces (APIs), data structures, and the like, that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Typically, the functionality of the computer readable instructions may be combined or distributed as desired in various environments.","The term \u201ccomputer readable media\u201d as used herein includes computer storage media. \u201cComputer readable storage media\u201d includes volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data.

Those skilled in the art will also realize that all or a portion of the computer readable instructions may be carried out by a dedicated circuit, such as a Digital Signal Processor (DSP), programmable logic array, and the like.","Business Event Planning","Embodiments of the invention provide a mechanism for planning and sharing event representations using services. Event representations may include diagrams\/layouts of events as well as descriptions of details about the events.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"300"},"At step , a type of event and\/or other parameters are selected. For example, types of event may include a corporate meeting, a social event such as a speech or a wedding. Other parameters may be received that constrain the event. For example, in step , a date and time for the event may be selected.","At step , based on the type of event, the computer-implemented method may query disparate data sources for resources that are available for the type of event. At step , constraints associated with the resources may be queried and received. For example, the resources may be available based on timing and schedule for the event. As one example, a meeting room may only be available during a certain date. At step , the event planner user interface may be populated based on resources suitable for the type of event and suitable for the scheduling of the event. At step , a view may be displayed with the resources and constraints available.","Still referring to , at step , indications of resources used for the event are received. For example, a user may provide indications by dragging and dropping resources on to a depiction of the venue for the event. At step , an indication of one or more attendees to the event, or other participants, may be received. A user may continuously modify resources and\/or attendees in step  and , and the event planner application may update the display representation of the event based on the received modifications in step . As such, steps ,  and  are illustrated as being part of a loop that may be executed any number of times. It is to be appreciated that other steps may also be performed repeatedly. As one example, there could be multiple queries for resources\/constraints.","At step , the event details, including resources, timing, and the like may be persisted to a file, a database, or other storage. At step , the details of the event, including any depiction of the event may be forwarded to any one of the attendees.","The computer-implemented method may be operated in any software and\/or hardware. As a first example, the computer-implemented method may be an option in a drawing program that interoperates with services, including directory services, custom databases, as well as calendar software such as email servers or address book servers. As one example, a drawing program could be MICROSOFT VISIO. In another embodiment, the computer-implemented method may be operated in calendar or email software application that allows for planning events. As an example, a calendar software application could be MICROSOFT OUTLOOK.","By way of further illustration of the computer-implemented method depicted by , an example usage may be described. The event planner system may receive an indication of a type of event in step . For example, a business event type may be selected. At step , in response to the type of the event, the event planner may determine a first service to query for a first resource at step . For example, a directory service may be queried for possible meeting room resources. At step , event planner may also query and receive one or more constraints associated the resource. At step  the event planner is populated with received resources and constraints, and at step  a representation of the event is displayed. At step , an indication that a first instance of a first resource is present at the event may be received. For example, this may occur if a user drags an instance of the resource to the display representation of the event. At step  the first instance of the first resource may be displayed at a location in association with the event.","As described previously, the computer-implemented method may use any combination of services to populate resources and\/or constraints of the resources available for an event. For example the first service in the example may be a directory service, a web service, a social networking service or an address book listing attendees.","After the event has been planned, a user may save the event in step . In addition, a user may send a representation of the event via email to one or more participants. Participants may include attendees or those helping with logistics of the event. A feature of the event planner may include the ability to modify details of the event in an email program. Depending on permissions, either a sender or receiver of an email may modify details about an event. For example, a user may modify an attendee in the event in email, before sending the event representation out. Under those circumstances, the event planner data may be saved or updated when a resource instance is modified in the event planning. Details of the event may be saved in a database or file.","As previously described, the event planner may receive one or more indications of constraints associated with the resources of an event. For example, constraints may be received over XML web services, via text, via binary data exchange, or other network protocols. The constraints may limit the use of resources in event planning. For example, constraints may include availability information of resources, such as dates\/times when an attendee may be able to attend an event, or as another example, the locations in which an attendee can attend during certain timeframes. As yet another example, services may indicate a limited quantity of a resource. For example, a directory service may indicate that only one resource of a certain type is available. The event planner method may include modifying details of the event based on constraints associated with the event, such as by modifying the date of the event. The event planner method may also include modifying resources, such as facilities of the event.","The details of the event may be displayed on the local computer or displayed remotely on a client device. If displayed remotely, a representation of the event may be sent using HTML, XML, other markup languages, or binary data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","404","400","406","408","410","412","414","416","418","404","420","422","424","426","428","430","404","400","404","400"]},"The resources to be used in the user interface  may be populated from a local file of resources, or as described previously, the resources may be dynamically populated from various data sources and network services. For example, the category  may be dynamically populated from a directory service that may maintain devices available within an enterprise. Similarly, equipment may be listed from a directory service, a custom database or other source. Attendees or other participants may be retrieved from an email address book service, an active directory, a database, a social networking service, or other network service. Furniture, snacks or other categories of resource may be retrieved from a custom database, directory service or other data source.","Still referring to , business event planner user interface  shows instances of resources on the event planning view representation. More than one instance of a resource may be present on a view. For example,  illustrates a first instance of a chair  and a second instance of a chair . The planned position of a person  is shown. Instances of a tablet personal computer , personal computer , a laptop  and mobile device  are depicted. Instances of resources on an event representation may be moved around the user interface  to indicate the desired position of the resource during an event. As one example, a user may move resources around a screen using a mouse, a touch from a finger or stylus, or other pointing device. In addition, instances of resources may be copied and pasted in the view indicating that another instance of the resource is present.","The instances of resources may be constrained via services. For example, a directory service may restrict how many instances of a person can appear in a view. As an example, a constraint may exist such that only one instance of a person may be placed on the view. The constraints may be customized locally on the event planning view computer, or they may be downloaded from any one of the network services in conjunction with the resources or they may be downloaded as separate items to the resources.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["504","516","518","509","520","522","524","526"]},"The computer-implemented event planning application may employ logic to parse details about people from the format shared out by the social networking site or the social networking site may adhere to a standard for sharing out resources.  also illustrates attendees  and  in the toolbox.
