The contents of the above Applications are all incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made with Government support under GM069847 awarded by National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights to this invention.","The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to chemical conjugates and their use in therapy and diagnosis and, more particularly, but not exclusively, to chemical conjugates of a polymer, an anti-angiogenesis agent and a targeting moiety, which are useful, for example, in the treatment and monitoring of bone related diseases and disorders such as bone cancer and bone metastases.","Osteosarcoma is the most common type of primary bone cancer and classified as a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm in which the tumor directly produces defective osteoid (immature bone). It is a highly vascular and extremely destructive malignancy that most commonly arises in the metaphyseal ends of long bones. Over the past two decades, multimodality treatment consisting of aggressive chemotherapy combined with radical surgical resection, has been the mainstay of osteosarcoma management, with achievable 5 year survival rates of 50% to 70% in patients who do not have metastatic disease at presentation. Several strategies were proposed, such as immune-based therapy, tumor-suppressor or suicide gene therapy, or anticancer drugs that are not commonly used in osteosarcoma [Quan et al. 2006; 10: 707-713]. However, still one-third of patients die from this devastating cancer, and for those with unresectable disease there are no curative systemic therapies.","Prostate cancer is the most common cancer of males in industrialized countries and the second leading cause of male cancer mortality. Mortality in these patients is not due to primary tumor growth, but rather due to complications caused by metastases to vital organs. Prostate cancer predominantly metastasizes to bone, but other organ sites are affected including the lung, liver, and adrenal gland.","Breast cancer also often metastasizes to bones.","Bone metastases incidence in patients with advanced metastatic disease is approximately 70%. Bone metastases are associated with considerable skeletal morbidity, including severe bone pain, pathologic fracture, spinal cord or nerve root compressions, and hypercalcemia of malignancy. Chemotherapy agents, hormonal deprivation and bisphosphonates are the common treatments for advanced metastatic disease. However, with time, the disease progresses to a phase when the standard therapy fails to control the malignancy and further progresses to a highly chemotherapy-resistant state.","Tumor progression and metastases are highly dependent on oxygen and nutrients supplied by new blood vessels, which formation is stimulated by the tumor itself and its environment. Anti-angiogenic therapy combined with conventional treatment holds great potential for osteosarcoma management and metastatic risk reduction. Angiogenesis inhibitors, such as TNP-470 [Folkman, 2004; 112: 496-507], its non-toxic N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer-conjugated form, caplostatin [Satchi-Fainaro et al. 2005; 7: 251-261], and Avastin [Hurwitz et al. 2004; 350: 2335-2342] are emerging as a new modality of anticancer drugs.","There are currently eight approved anti-cancer therapies with recognized antiangiogenic properties. These agents, which interrupt critical cell signaling pathways involved in tumor angiogenesis and growth, can be divided into two primary categories: (1) monoclonal antibodies directed against specific proangiogenic factors and\/or their receptors; (Avastin, Erbitux, Vectibix, Herceptin) and (2) small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of multiple proangiogenic growth factor receptors (Tarveca, Nexavar, Sutent). Inhibitors of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) represent a third, smaller category of antiangiogenic therapies with one currently approved agent (Torisel). In addition, at least two other approved anti-angiogenic agents may indirectly inhibit angiogenesis through mechanisms that are not completely understood (Velcade, Celgene)","The first FDA-approved angiogenesis inhibitor, Bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech), a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has recently been approved for metastatic colon cancer treatment in conjunction with standard conventional chemotherapy.","The largest class of drugs that block angiogenesis are the multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the VEGF receptor (VEGFR). These drugs such as sunitinib (Sutent, Pfizer), Sorafenib (Nexavar, Bayer\/Onyx Pharmaceuticals) and Erlotinib (Tarveca, Gennentech\/OSI\/Roche) have the advantages of hitting multiple targets, convenient oral administration, and cost effectiveness. While these drugs exhibit promising efficacy, their use is limited by their lack of target specificity, which leads to unexpected toxicity [Cabebe et al. 2007; 8:15-27].","Novel targeted angiogenesis inhibitors, for use with or without other anti-neoplastic agents have therefore been sought for. A major impediment towards this effort has been the inability to determine therapeutic efficacy, the lack of reliable surrogate markers of tumor angiogenesis, and the complexity of interactions between multiple host cells and malignant cells involved in tumor angiogenesis, which may limit the use of a single anti-angiogenic agent. Another significant obstacle is that the vast majority of clinically used anti-cancer and anti-angiogenic drugs are small molecules that exhibit a short half-life in the bloodstream and a high overall clearance rate. These low-molecular weight drugs diffuse rapidly into healthy tissues and are distributed evenly within the body. As a consequence, relatively small amounts of the drug reach the target site, and therapy is associated with low efficacy and severe side effects.","TNP-470 is a low molecular weight synthetic analogue of fumagillin, which is capable of selectively inhibiting endothelial growth in vitro. In clinical trials, this drug was found to slow tumor growth in many patients with metastatic cancer and exhibited a promising efficacy when used in combination with conventional chemotherapy. However, at the doses required for tumor regression, many patients experienced neurotoxicity. Due to its dose-limiting neurotoxicity, no further clinical studies were conducted for using TNP-470 per se. It has been concluded that clinical uses of TNP-470 should be performed with this agent being targeted to tumor tissue, in order to increase its site specificity and reduce side effects.","Water-soluble polymers such as N-(2-Hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymers (HPMA) are biocompatible, non-immunogenic and non-toxic carriers that enable specific delivery into tumor tissue [Satchi-Fainaro et al. 2004; 10: 255-261]. These macromolecules do not diffuse through normal blood vessels but rather accumulate selectively in the tumor site because of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. This phenomenon of passive diffusion through the hyperpermeable neovasculature and localization in the tumor interstitium is observed in many solid tumors for macromolecular agents and lipids. Conjugation of anti-cancer drugs such as TNP-470 with copolymers, such as HPMA, should enable selective targeting of these drugs to tumor tissue and thus reduce side effects. Furthermore, such copolymer-drug conjugates should restrict the passage through the blood brain barrier and would prolong the circulating half-life of the drugs, hence inhibiting the growth of tumor endothelial and epithelia cells by exposing the cells to the conjugated drugs in the circulation for a longer time compared to the free drugs.","An example of the favorable characteristics obtained by conjugation of an anti-angiogenesis agent such as TNP-470 to HPMA has been described by Satchi-Fainaro et al. in WO 03\/086382. This patent application teaches conjugates of water-soluble polymers and TNP-470, and their use as anti-tumor agents, in particular their use as carriers of TNP-470 into tumor vessels, and their effect on the neurotoxicity of TNP-470. According to the teachings of WO 03\/086382, an exemplary such conjugate, HPMA-(TNP-470) conjugate (caplostatin), exhibited superior antitumor activity together with a reduced level of toxicity, as compared with TNP-470 alone. WO 03\/086382 further suggests incorporation of a targeting ligand, such as RGD or antibodies.","The use of HPMA-TNP-470 conjugate for the treatment of angiogenesis related conditions has also been described in WO 03\/086178.","Another example of the increased activity yet reduced toxicity obtained by conjugation of anti-tumor drugs to water-soluble polymers is presented in U.S. Pat. No. 6,884,817.","An HPMA copolymer conjugate of paclitaxel has been described by Meerum Terwogt et al. [2001; 12:315-323]. This conjugate was aimed at improving drug solubility and providing controlled release of paclitaxel. In this conjugate, the paclitaxel is linked to the HPMA copolymer through an ester bond, and is hence released from the polymer by non-tissue specific hydrolytic or enzymatic (esterases) degradation of the ester bond, thereby inducing the commonly observed toxicities of paclitaxel.","Bisphosphonates (BPs) such as alendronate are compounds with a chemical structure similar to that of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), an endogenous regulator of bone mineralization. Several bisphosphonates are established as effective treatments in clinical disorders such as osteoporosis, Paget's disease of bone, myeloma, and bone metastases. Bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid, have been shown to inhibit angiogenesis [Wood et al. 2002; 302: 1055-1061]. The pharmacokinetic profile of bisphosphonates, which exhibit a strong affinity to bone mineral under physiological conditions, their low toxicity and anti-angiogenic activity are advantageous for targeting to tumors confined to bony tissues.","Alendronate is considered potent for the treatment of bone related diseases and cancer-associated hypercalcemia. It was shown to have antitumor effect in several in vivo cancer models through several different mechanisms [Tuomela et al. 20088:81; Molinuevo et al. 2007562:28-33; Hashimoto et al. 200565: 540-545]. In addition, alendronate was found to have anti-angiogenic activity through (i) suppression of VEGF-induced Rho activation in an ovarian cancer model [Hashimoto et al. 2007354: 478-484], (ii) inhibition of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, in the mevalonate pathway [Russell R G 2007119 Suppl 2: S150-162]; and (iii) regulation of cellular level of MMP-2 expression in osteosarcoma cell lines [Cheng et al. 200442; 410-415].","Other bone targeting agents are oligopeptides of Aspartate. Wang et al. describe fluorescein-labeled bone-targeted model conjugates for detection purposes bearing 1% loading of D-Asp(SEQ ID NO:1) on HPMA copolymer [Wang et al. 2003 14:853-859]. The bone-targeting potential of this conjugate was tested in vitro and in vivo and was found to selectively accumulate in bone tissue [Wang et al. 2006, 3:717-725].","WO 2004\/062588 teaches water soluble polymeric conjugates for bone targeted drug delivery with improved pharmacokinetics parameters and better water solubility of the loaded drugs. The polymeric drug delivery systems taught by this application are based on hydroxypropyl methacrylamide (HPMA) conjugates of bone-targeting drugs such as alendronate and D-Asptogether with a bone-related therapeutic agent. The loading of alendronate and D-Asp(SEQ ID NO:1) onto the HPMA copolymer was 0.494 mmol\/gram and 0.762 mmol\/gram respectively.","PK2 (FCE28069) is a HPMA copolymer-doxorubicin-galactosamine conjugate, which was designed as a treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma or secondary liver disease [Seymour et al. 2002; 20:1668-1676]. Doxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic with limited solubility in physiological fluids, and is a well established anti-neoplastic drug. Galactosamine binds to the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) thus serving as a specific hepatic targeting moiety. These components are linked to the HPMA polymer via an enzymatically biodegradable linker which permits the release of free doxorubicin within the liver, thus increasing the drug concentration in its site of action. The enzymatic degradable linker is a tetrapeptide spacer (Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly) (SEQ ID NO:2), designed for cleavage by lysosomal cathepsins.","O'hare et al. [1993; 1:217-229] have synthesized HPMA copolymers containing doxorubicin and melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) as a melanoma specific targeting moiety. Both the doxorubicin and the melanocyte stimulating hormone were linked to the HPMA polymer via an enzymatically biodegradable linker.","Hruby et al. [2006; 101: 3192-3201] have prepared and synthesized novel polymeric drug-delivery systems designed for bone targeting of anti-neoplastics based on biocompatible HPMA copolymers containing hydroxybisphosphonate targeting moieties and the model drugs radiotherapeutics I, imaging agent In, or the anticancer drug Doxorubicin. The percentage of hydroxybisphosphonate loaded onto the HPMA copolymers was in the range of 1.3-4 mol %.","Currently known agents used for treating bone related cancer and other angiogenesis-related conditions, at doses where anti-tumor activity is achieved, are characterized by high toxicity, which limits their use. In a search for modes of modifying currently known anti-angiogenesis agents so as to enable higher therapeutic efficacy thereof together with a reduced level of side effects, the present inventors have designed and successfully prepared and practiced a novel polymeric conjugate of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer, TNP-470 and the bone targeting agent alendronate (ALN), wherein the TNP-470 and alendronate molecules are conjugated to backbone units of the HPMA polymeric backbone via biodegradable linkers and the percent of alendronate loaded onto the HPMA polymeric backbone is higher than in currently known alendronate-polymer conjugates (e.g., is greater than 3 mol % of the polymeric conjugate).","The present inventors have further devised and successfully practiced a novel process for preparing the conjugates described herein, while obtaining a high load of alendronate in the polymer as well as a homogenous size distribution, i.e. low polydispersity, of the polymer. This process can be beneficially performed in a controlled manner at 30\u00b0 C.","The present inventors have designed and successfully prepared and practiced a novel conjugate of a polymer (e.g., a N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer), an anti-angiogenesis agent (e.g., TNP-470) and a bone targeting agent being D-Asp8 (SEQ ID NO:1).","According to an aspect of some embodiments of the present invention there is provided a conjugate comprising an N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide)-derived polymeric backbone having attached thereto TNP-470 and alendronate, wherein a load of the alendronate in the polymer is greater than 3 mol %","According to some embodiments of the invention, the load of the alendronate in the polymer is greater than 5 mol %.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the load of the alendronate in the polymer is about 7 mol %.","According to some embodiments of the invention, at least one of the TNP-470 and the alendronate is attached to the polymer via a linker.","According to some embodiments of the invention, each of the TNP-470 and the alendronate is attached to the polymer via a linker.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the linker is a biodegradable linker.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the biodegradable linker is selected from the group consisting of a pH-sensitive linker and an enzymatically cleavable linker.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the biodegradable linker is an enzymatically cleavable linker.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the enzymatically cleavable linker is cleaved by an enzyme which is expressed in tumor tissues.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the enzymatically cleavable linker is cleaved by an enzyme which is overexpressed in tumor tissues.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the enzyme is selected from a group consisting of Cathepsin B, Cathepsin K, Cathepsin D, Cathepsin H, Cathepsin L, legumain, MMP-2 and MMP-9.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the enzyme is Cathepsin K.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the linker comprises an oligopeptide group containing from 2 to 10 amino acid residues.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the oligopeptide is -[Gly-Gly-Pro-Nle]- (SEQ ID NO:3).","According to some embodiments of the invention, the TNP-470 is linked to the polymer or to the linker via a spacer.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the spacer has the formula G-(CH)n-K, wherein n is an integer from 1 to 4;

The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.","As discussed hereinabove, currently known agents used for treating bone related cancer and other angiogenesis-related conditions, at doses where anti-tumor activity is achieved, are characterized by high toxicity, which limits their use.","The present inventors have now devised and successfully prepared and practiced novel conjugates of a copolymer having attached thereto an anti-angiogenesis agent and a bone targeting moiety.","More specifically, but not exclusively, the present inventors have devised and successfully practiced novel processes of preparing such conjugates, in which the bone targeting moiety is alendronate or an oligoaspartate.","The present inventors have devised and successfully practiced novel processes of preparing such conjugates in which alendronate is present in a relatively high load within the copolymer.","The present inventors have surprisingly uncovered that alendronate and TNP-470 can act in synergy in inhibition of angiogenesis. Taken together with the dose-dependent anti-angiogenesis activity of alendronate, the alendronate high-loaded conjugates described herein are therefore characterized as highly potent agents for treating bone-related diseases and disorders.","As demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, the present inventors have successfully prepared and practiced a novel polymeric conjugate of a N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer, having attached thereto TNP-470 and the bone targeting agent, alendronate (ALN), wherein the TNP-470 and alendronate are conjugated to backbone units of the HPMA-derived polymeric backbone via biodegradable linkers and the mol percent of alendronate loaded onto the conjugate is higher than in currently known alendronate-polymer conjugates (e.g., is greater than 3 mol % of the polymeric conjugate).","This polymeric conjugate exhibited an enhanced inhibition of angiogenesis and bone cancer as compared with un-conjugated, i.e., free, TNP-470 and ALN, administered at equivalent doses. Specifically, this HPMA copolymer-ALN-TNP470 conjugate was capable of binding to bone mineral (see, ), and exhibited a superior activity, as compared to non-conjugated ALN and TNP-470, with regard to inhibition of osteosarcoma cell proliferation (see, ), inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and migration (see,  respectively), inhibition of endothelial cell ability to form capillary tube structures (see, ), and in reducing vascular hypermeability and osteosarcoma tumor growth in-vivo (see, ).","The present inventors have further designed and successfully prepared and practiced a novel conjugate of a polymer (e.g., a N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA)-derived co-polymer) having attached thereto an anti-angiogenesis agent (e.g., TNP-470) and a bone targeting agent being D-Asp8 (SEQ ID NO:1).","Thus, according to one aspect of some embodiments of the invention there is provided a polymeric conjugate comprising an N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide)-derived polymeric backbone having attached thereto TNP-470 and alendronate, wherein a load of the alendronate in the polymeric conjugate is greater than 3 mol %.","N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) polymers are a class of water-soluble synthetic polymeric carriers that have been extensively characterized as biocompatible, non-immunogenic and non-toxic. HPMA polymers can be tailored through relatively simple chemical modifications, in order to regulate their respective drug and targeting moiety content. Further, the molecular weight and charge of these polymers may be manipulated so as to allow renal clearance and excretion from the body, or to alter biodistribution while allowing tumor targeting.","The tumor targeting capacity of HPMA polymers is attributed, at least in part, to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of such polymers. Thus, HPMA conjugates are characterized by a limited diffusion and\/or extravasation through normal blood vessels, due to the high molecular weight and hydrodynamic diameter thereof, and therefore accumulate selectively at the tumor site, which is characterized by leaky blood vessels having abnormal form and architecture and wide fenestrations, pores and vesicular vacuolar organelles (VVO). Due to the poor lymphatic drainage from tumor, macromolecules tend to be retained in the tumor microenvironment. Conjugating drugs to polymers such as HPMA is also expected to restrict the passage of the conjugate through the blood brain barrier, thus prolonging the circulating half-life of the drugs and abrogating neurotoxicity associated with many chemotherapeutic and anti-angiogenic drugs.","A polymeric conjugate, comprising an N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide)-derived polymeric backbone having attached thereto TNP-470 and alendronate, that has a molecular weight higher than 10 kDa typically exhibit an EPR effect, as described herein, while polymeric substances that have a molecular weight of 100 kDa and higher have relatively long half-lives in plasma and an inefficient renal clearance. Accordingly, a molecular weight of the polymeric conjugate can be determined while considering the half-life in plasma, the renal clearance, and the accumulation in the tumor of the conjugate. The molecular weight of the polymeric conjugate can be controlled, at least to some extent, by the degree of polymerization (or co-polymerization).","In some embodiments, the conjugate described herein has a MW that ranges from 100 Daltons to 800 kDa. In some embodiments, the conjugate described herein has a MW that ranges from 10 kDa to 800 kDa. In some embodiments, the conjugate has a MW that ranges from 10 kDa to 60 kDa.","In some embodiments of the invention, the conjugates described herein comprise an HPMA polymeric backbone comprised of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide-derived backbone units (a polymeric backbone formed by polymerizing N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide monomers), whereby TNP-470 molecules are attached to a portion of these backbone units and alendronate molecules are attached to another portion of these backbone units, as described herein. Those backbone units within the polymeric backbone that are not linked to another moiety (e.g., TNP-470, alendronate, or any of the other moieties described herein) are referred to herein as \u201cfree\u201d or \u201cnon-functionalized\u201d backbone units.","Since the polymeric backbone in the conjugates described herein is composed of some backbone units that have alendronate attached thereto, some backbone units that have TNP-470 attached thereto, and optionally some free backbone units, these conjugates represent HPMA-derived co-polymers.","As discussed hereinabove, TNP-470 is a potent anti-angiogenesis agent. Its use as a free drug has been limited by its low solubility and dose-dependent neurotoxicity.","The phrase \u201canti-angiogenesis agent\u201d, which is also referred to herein interchangeably as \u201canti-angiogenic agent\u201d or \u201cangiogenesis inhibitor\u201d, describes an agent having the ability to (a) inhibit endothelial cell proliferation or migration; (b) kill proliferating endothelial cells; and\/or (c) inhibit the formation of new blood vessels in a tissue.","As further discussed hereinabove, alendronate (4-amino-1-hydroxybutylidene)bisphosphonic acid) is a bisphosphonate which exhibits a strong affinity to bone minerals under physiological conditions.","Herein, the term \u201calendronate\u201d also encompasses any pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and\/or hydrates thereof, as defined hereinafter.","It has been previously shown that alendronate exhibits anti-angiogenesis activity in a dose dependent manner. For example, Cheng et al. have shown that alendronate reduces the mRNA level and cellular level of Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) enzyme in osteosarcoma cell lines in a time and dose-dependent manner [Cheng et al. 200442; 410-415].","As demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, the anti-angiogenesis activity of alendronate is dose dependent, as assessed by the extent of HUVEC and Saos-2 human osteosarcoma cell line proliferation inhibition, whereby the extent of inhibition is proportional to the alendronate concentrations, i.e., at higher alendronate concentration a stronger anti-angiogenesis activity could be observed.","Conjugating alendronate and an anti-angiogenesis agent to polymers is highly beneficial for producing an agent that is characterized by both selectivity, due to the EPR effect attributed to the polymer, and the bone-targeting effect attributed to the alendronate, and a potent therapeutic activity, due to the presence of a potent anti-angiogenesis agent.","However, such conjugates, which are further characterized by a high load of alendronate, as described herein, are even more potent, due to the dual targeting and anti-angiogenesis effect that can be potentially exhibited by the alendronate.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the conjugates described herein are characterized by an alendronate loading which is higher than 3 mol %.","Herein, the phrase \u201cloading\u201d, or simply \u201cload\u201d, and any grammatical diversion thereof, is used to describe the amount of an agent that is attached to the polymeric backbone of the conjugates described herein, and is represented herein by the mol % of this agent in the conjugate, as defined hereinafter.","As used herein, the term \u201cmol %\u201d describes the number of moles of an attached moiety per 1 mol of the polymeric conjugate, multiplied by 100.","Thus, for example, a 3 mol % load of alendronate describes a polymeric conjugate composed of 100 backbone HPMA units, whereby 3 HPMA backbone units have alendronate-containing monomer units attached thereto, and the other 97 HPMA backbone units are either free or have other agents attached thereto.","In the conjugates described herein, the load of alendronate can be, for example, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5 and even as high as 10 mol %.","In some embodiments, the load of the alendronate in the polymer is greater than 5 mol %.","In some embodiments, the load of the alendronate in the polymer is about 7 mol %.","Herein, the phrase \u201cabout\u201d describes \u00b11%.","Thus, the phrase \u201cabout 7 mol %\u201d describes a mol percentage ranging between 6 mol % and 8 mol %, or between 6.5 mol % and 7.5 mol %. For example, this phrase encompasses 6.5 mol %, 6.6 mol %, 6.7 mol %, 6.8 mol %, 6.9 mol %, 7 mol %, 7.1 mol %, 7.2 mol %, 7.3 mol %, 7.4 mol % and 7.5 mol %.","As demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, at such high loads, alendronate can exhibit both a bone targeting effect and an anti-angiogenesis effect.","As further demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, it has been further surprisingly uncovered that a combined therapy of TNP-470 and alendronate results in a synergistic anti-angiogenic activity, when alendronate is utilized at a high concentration.","As demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, the anti-angiogenesis activity of alendronate and TNP-470, when administered together, as demonstrated by their inhibitory effect on the proliferation of endothelial cells, was superior to the cumulative anti-angiogenesis activity of each agent when administered alone (see, ). This synergistic activity could be observed only at high alendronate concentration whereas at low alendronate concentration (lower than 100 nM), no synergistic activity could be detected. These results show that the synergistic activity between alendronate and TNP-470 is dose-dependent. As further demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, the in vivo inhibition of osteosarcoma tumor growth in mice was significantly enhanced when conjugating both TNP-470 and alendronate to HPMA, with a high load of alendronate (see, ), as compared to the inhibition observed when equivalent concentration of free alendronate and free TNP-470 were administered (i.e., unconjugated). It can therefore be clearly deduced that the synergistic anti-angiogenesis activity results from the relatively high concentration (load) of alendronate within the conjugate.","Since alendronate exhibits a dose-dependent anti-angiogenesis activity, and further since it is shown herein that alendronate and TNP-470 can act in synergy in inhibition of angiogenesis, such high-loaded conjugates can be beneficially utilized in the treatment of bone-related diseases and disorders such as those conditions that are associated with angiogenesis.","Thus, in some embodiments of the invention, the TNP-470 and alendronate that are attached to the polymer in the conjugates described herein act in synergy.","The phrase \u201csynergy\u201d or \u201csynergistic activity\u201d, as used herein and in the art, describes a cooperative action encountered in combinations of two or more biologically active agents in which the combined effect exhibited by the two agents when used together exceeds the sum of the effect of each of the agents when used alone.","\u201cSynergy\u201d or \u201csynergistic activity\u201d is therefore often determined when a value representing an effect of a combination of two active agents is greater than the sum of the same values obtained for each of these agents when acting alone.","A synergy between two anti-angiogenesis agents may be determined by methods well known in the art.","In each of the conjugates described herein, the alendronate and the TNP-470 can each be linked to the polymeric backbone directly, or indirectly, through a linker moiety (also referred to herein as a linker, a linker group or a linking group), whereby, in some embodiments, the direct\/indirect linkage is designed as being cleavable at conditions characterizing the environment of a desired bodily site (e.g., by certain enzymes or pH), as detailed hereinbelow.","Hence, according to some embodiments of the invention, at least one of the TNP-470 and the alendronate is attached to the polymeric backbone via a linker. In some embodiments, each of the TNP-470 and the alendronate is attached to the polymeric backbone via a linker. The linker linking the TNP-470 to the polymer and the linker linking the alendronate to the polymeric backbone may be the same or different.","The linker described herein refers to a chemical moiety that serves to couple the TNP-470 and\/or the alendronate to the polymeric backbone while not adversely affecting either the targeting function of the alendronate or the therapeutic effect of the alendronate and\/or the TNP-470.","In some embodiments, the linker is a biodegradable linker.","The phrase \u201cbiodegradable linker\u201d, as used herein, describes a linker that is capable of being degraded, or cleaved, when exposed to physiological conditions. Such physiological conditions can be, for example, pH, a certain enzyme, and the like.","In some embodiments, the linker is capable of being cleaved by pre-selected cellular enzymes, for instance, those found in osteoblasts, osteoclasts, lysosomes of cancerous cells or proliferating endothelial cells. Alternatively, an acid hydrolysable linker could comprise an ester or amide linkage and be for instance, a cis-aconityl linkage. Such linkers further enhance the therapeutic activity and reduced toxicity of the conjugates described herein, by allowing the release of the anti-angiogenesis drug and\/or the alendronate only at the desired bodily site.","Accordingly, according to some embodiments, the biodegradable linker is a pH-sensitive linker or an enzymatically-cleavable linker.","A pH-sensitive linker comprises a chemical moiety that is cleaved or degraded only when subjected to a certain pH condition, such as acidic pH (e.g., lower than 7), neutral pH (6.5-7) or basic pH (higher than 7).","Such a linker may, for example, be designed to undergo hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions, and thus, the conjugate remains intact and does not release the agents attached to the polymer in the body, until its reaches a physiological environment where a pH is either acidic or basic, respectively.","Exemplary pH-sensitive linkers include, but are not limited to hydrazone bond, ester (including orthoesther) bonds, amide bonds of a cis-aconytil residue, a trityl group, acetals, ketals, Alanine ester, Gly-ester and a -[Gly-Phe-Gly]- moiety (SEQ ID NO:4).","In some embodiments, the biodegradable linker is an enzymatically-cleavable linker. Such a linker is typically designed so as to include a chemical moiety, typically, but not exclusively, an amino acid sequence, that is recognized by a pre-selected enzyme. Such an amino acid sequence is often referred to in the art as a \u201crecognition motif\u201d. A conjugate comprising such a linker typically remains substantially intact in the absence of the pre-selected enzyme, and hence does not cleave or degrade so as to the release the agent attached thereto until it reaches an environment where this enzyme is present at a substantial concentration.","In some embodiments, the enzymatically cleavable linker is cleaved by an enzyme which is expressed in tumor tissues. A conjugate comprising such a linker ensures, for example, that a substantial amount of the conjugated TNP-470 is released from the conjugate only at the tumor tissue, thus reducing the side effects associated with the non-selective administration of the drug.","In some embodiments, the enzymatically cleavable linker is cleaved by an enzyme which is overexpressed in tumor tissues.","Exemplary enzymes which are suitable for use in the context of these embodiments include, but are not limited to, Cathepsin B, Cathepsin K, Cathepsin D, Cathepsin H, Cathepsin L, legumain, MMP-2 and MMP-9.","Suitable linkers include, but are not limited to, alkyl chains; alkyl chains optionally substituted with one or more substituents and in which one or more carbon atoms are optionally interrupted by a nitrogen, oxygen and\/or sulfur heteroatom.","Other suitable linkers include amino acids and\/or oligopeptides.","Such alkyl chains and\/or oligopeptides can optionally be functionalized so as allow their covalent binding to the moieties linked thereby (e.g., the polymeric backbone and the alendronate, the polymeric backbone and the TNP-470). Such a functionalization may include incorporation or generation of reactive groups that participate in such covalent bindings.","In some embodiments, the linker is a biodegradable oligopeptide which contains, for example, from 2 to 10 amino acid residues.","In some embodiments, the linker is a Cathepsin K-cleavable linker.","Cathepsin K is a lysosomal cysteine protease involved in bone remodeling and resorption and is predominantly expressed in osteoclasts. Its expression is stimulated by inflammatory cytokines that are released after tissue injury and in bone neoplasms [Pan et al. 200614:425-435; Husmann et al. 200847: 66-73]. An exemplary linker having Cathepsin K cleavable sites is -[Gly-Gly-Pro-Nle]- (SEQ ID NO: 3).","In some embodiments, the linker comprises the amino acid sequence -[Gly-Gly-Pro-Nle]- (SEQ ID NO: 3).","In some embodiments, the linker consists of the amino acid sequence -[Gly-Gly-Pro-Nle]- (SEQ ID NO: 3).","Other Cathepsin K cleavable sites are those that include a -[Gly-Pro-Nle]- moiety (SEQ ID NO: 5). Another example include [-Gly-Gly-NH\u2014C6-Gly-Pro-Nle]- (SEQ ID NO: 6).","As demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, a Cathepsin K cleavable linker being -[Gly-Gly-Pro-Nle]- (SEQ ID NO:3) was used, linking both alendronate and TNP-470 to the HPMA polymeric backbone (see, ). As further demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, a HPMA copolymer-ALN-TNP-470 conjugate comprising such linker moieties successfully inhibited proliferation of endothelial cells as well as Saos-2 and MG-63-Ras human osteosarcoma cells. The involvement of Cathepsin K in the release of the TNP-470 and alendronate from the polymer could be deduced from the reduced activity of the conjugate when incubated together with a cathepsin K inhibitor whereby the conjugate inhibited the proliferation of HUVEC at a 4-logs higher concentration in the presence of cathepsin K inhibitor III than in its absence (see, ).","An oligopeptide linker which contains the pre-selected amino acid sequence (recognition motif) can also be constructed such that the recognition motif is repeated several times within the linker, to thereby enhance the selective release of the attached agent. Various recognition motifs of the same or different enzymes can also be incorporated within the linker. Similarly, the linker may comprise multiple pH sensitive bonds or moieties. Linkers comprising such multiple cleavable sites can enhance the selective release of the anti-angiogenesis agent at the desired bodily site, thereby reducing adverse side effects, and further enhance the relative concentration of the released drug at the bodily site when it exhibits its activity.","In cases where the TNP-470 and\/or the alendronate is bound directly to the polymeric backbone, the bond linking these moieties can also be biodegradable, for example, an enzymatically-cleavable bond or a pH-sensitive bond (e.g., an acid-hydrolyzable bond). Such a bond can be formed upon functionalizing backbone units of the polymeric backbone, the alendronate and\/or the TNP-470, so as to include compatible reactive groups for forming the desired bond.","In some embodiments, the TNP-470 is linked to the polymer or to the linker via a spacer. In some embodiments, the alendronate is linked to the polymer or to the linker via a spacer. The spacers can be the same or different.","The term \u201cspacer\u201d as used herein describes a chemical moiety that is covalently attached to, and interposed between, the polymeric backbone and the linker, the TNP-470 and\/or the alendronate, thereby forming a bridge-like structure between the polymeric backbone and the linker, the TNP-470 and\/or the alendronate. In some embodiments, the spacer does not actively participate in a biological process, and is present in the conjugate for the purpose of facilitating its synthesis and\/or improving its performance in terms of, for example, steric considerations, as is detailed hereinbelow.","Suitable spacers include, but are not limited to, alkylene chains, optionally substituted by one or more substituents and which are optionally interrupted by one or more nitrogen, oxygen and\/or sulfur heteroatom.","Other suitable spacers include amino acids and amino acid sequences, optionally functionalized with one or more reactive groups for being coupled to the polymeric backbone, TNP-470 and\/or alendronate.","In some embodiments, the spacer has the formula G-(CH)n-K, wherein n is an integer from 1 to 10; and G and K are each a reactive group, as defined herein, such as, for example, NH, O or S. In some embodiments, G and K are each NH and n is 2.","In some embodiments, the spacer is an amino acid sequence, optionally an inert amino acid sequence (namely, does not affect the affinity or selectivity of the conjugate). Such a spacer can be utilized for elongating or functionalizing the linker.","In some cases, a spacer is utilized for enabling a more efficient and simpler attachment of the alendronate and\/or the TNP-470 to the polymeric backbone or linker, in terms of steric considerations (renders the site of the polymeric backbone to which coupling is effected less hindered) or chemical reactivity considerations (adds a compatible reactive group to the site of the polymeric backbone to which coupling is effected). In some cases, the spacer may contribute to the performance of the resulting conjugate. For example, the spacer may render an enzymatically cleavable linker less sterically hindered and hence more susceptible to enzymatic interactions.","The spacer may also be used in order to attach other agents (e.g., a labeling agent, as described hereinbelow) to the conjugate.","The spacer may be varied in length and in composition, depending on steric and chemical considerations, and may be used to space the TNP-470 and alendronate form the polymeric backbone and\/or the linker.","As demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, the present inventors have successfully synthesized a conjugate wherein the TNP-470 is linked to the HPMA polymeric backbone via a cathepsin K cleavable linker being -[Gly-Gly-Pro-Nle]- (SEQ ID NO: 3) and a spacer being \u2014NH\u2014(CH)\u2014NH\u2014 (see, ).","As discussed hereinabove, the degree of loading of the TNP-470 and alendronate may be expressed as mole %, as defined herein.","The optimal degree of loading of TNP-470 is determined empirically based on the desired properties of the conjugate (e.g., water solubility, therapeutic efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, toxicity and dosage requirements), and synthetic considerations (e.g., the amount of the drug that can be attached to the backbone units in a certain synthetic pathway).","In some embodiments, the loading of TNP-470 in the polymer is greater than 1 mol %.","In some embodiments, the loading of the TNP-470 in the conjugate ranges from 1 mol % to 90 mol %, from 1 mol % to 50 mol %, from 1 mol % to 20 mol %, from 1 mol % to 10 mol %, or from 1 mol % to 5 mol %.","The number of backbone units in the polymeric backbone having TNP-470 attached thereto is defined herein as \u201cy\u201d, the number of backbone units in the polymeric backbone having alendronate attached thereto is herein defined as \u201cw\u201d and the number of free backbone units in the polymeric backbone (which are not bound to an additional moiety) is herein defined as \u201cx\u201d.","Accordingly, in some embodiments, the conjugate described herein can be represented by the general formula II:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0187","num":"0184"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"43.10mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08703114-20140422-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"x is an integer having a value such that x\/(x+y+w) multiplied by 100 is in the range of from 0.01 to 99.9;","y is an integer having a value such that y\/(x+y+w) multiplied by 100 is in the range of from 0.01 to 99.9; and","w is an integer having a value such that w\/(x+y+w) multiplied by 100 is in the range of from 3 to 99; B is TNP-470;","D is alendronate; and","each of Land Lis independently the linker, as described herein.","In some embodiments, the conjugate has the following structure:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0194","num":"0191"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"121.50mm","wi":"129.79mm","file":"US08703114-20140422-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein x, y and z are as defined herein.","According to some embodiments of the invention, x is an integer having a value such that x\/(x+y+w) multiplied by 100 is in the range of from 70 to 99.9; y is an integer having a value such that y\/(x+y+w) multiplied by 100 is in the range of from 0.01 to 15; and w is an integer having a value such that w\/(x+y+w) multiplied by 100 is in the range of from 5 to 20.","For example, x\/(x+y+w) multiplied by 100 may be 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 99.9; y\/(x+y+w) multiplied by 100 may be 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15; and w\/(x+y+w) multiplied by 100 may be 5, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6, 5.8, 6, 6.2, 6.4, 6.6, 6.8, 7, 7.2, 7.4, 7.6, 7.8, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20.

Such suitable polymerization initiators and chain transfer agents can be readily identified by a person skilled in the art.","As demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, the copolymerization of alendronate containing HPMA-derived monomers+HPMA-derived monomers terminating with a reactive group (e.g., ethylenediamine)+free HPMA monomers, and optionally + an HPMA-derived monomer comprising FITC (step (b) in the process described hereinabove), was performed via two methodologies: (1) the \u201cclassical\u201d thermopolymerization methodology using, as an example, 4,4\u2032-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) as a polymerization initiator; and (2) the \u201creversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer\u201d (RAFT) polymerization technique, using, as an example, 2,2\u2032-Azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane]dihydrochloride as a polymerization initiator and S,S\u2032-bis(\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-dimethyl-\u03b1\u2033-acetic acid)trithiocarbonate as a chain transfer agent (TTC).","Using these two synthetic approaches, it was shown that the load of alendronate in the conjugate, as well as other parameters of the obtained copolymer, can be finely controlled.","Using the RAFT approach further enables to perform the copolymerization at room temperature or at temperatures as low as 30\u00b0 C.","The \u201creversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer\u201d (RAFT) polymerization technique typically involves the use of thiocarbonylthio compounds, such as dithioesters, dithiocarbamates, trithiocarbonates, and xanthates in order to mediate the polymerization via a reversible chain-transfer process. This allows access to polymers with low polydispersity and high functionality.","As exemplified in the Examples section that follows, weight average molar mass (M) was determined for the conjugates synthesized from their SEC profiles and the Polydispersity index (PDI) was calculated according to the formula M\/M. It has been shown that conjugates polymerized by RAFT were well-dispersed, exhibiting a considerably low and narrower PDI value of about 1.2, with a mean size distribution of 100 nm (see, ).","Therefore, in some embodiments, the co-polymerizing is performed via the Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) technique.","In some embodiments, the process is performed such that the conjugate has a polydispersity index ranging from 1 to 1.4.","In some embodiments, the process is performed such that the conjugate has a mean size distribution lower than 150 nm.","Generally, the TNP-470 or alendronate can be attached to the monomeric units that form the polymeric backbone, or to the backbone units of the copolymer, by means of a functional group that is already present in the native molecule and\/or the monomeric units of the polymer, or otherwise can be introduced or generated by well-known procedures in synthetic organic chemistry without altering the activity of the agent. For example, in the case of alendronate, a terminal carboxylic group can be generated within a monomeric HPMA, in order to form an amide with the amine functional group of alendronate. A carboxylic functional group can be generated, for example, by oxidizing the hydroxy group of the HPMA. Alternatively, a carboxylic functional group (reactive group) is generated by attaching to an HPMA monomer a spacer or a linker that terminates with a carboxylic group.","Similarly, an alkylhalide can be generated within the HPMA polymeric backbone or within HPMA monomers, in order to readily couple TNP-470. Such an alkylhalide can be generated by means of a spacer and\/or linker, as described herein.","HPMA monomeric, oligomeric and polymeric units that have been modified so as to generate a reactive group are therefore referred to herein as HPMA-derived units or as methacrylamide units terminating by a reactive group.","Accordingly, in some embodiments, the process further comprises introduction of a linker to at least some of the HPMA monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric units participating in the co-polymerization.","In some embodiments, introducing the linker is performed subsequent to the co-polymerization.","Similarly, in some embodiments, the process further comprises introduction of a spacer to at least some of the HPMA monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric units participating in the co-polymerization.","In some embodiments, introducing the spacer is performed subsequent to the co-polymerization.","In some embodiments, a plurality of functionalized HPMA monomeric units is first prepared.

Hence, the polymeric backbone of the conjugate described herein may be constructed by copolymerizing the functionalized monomeric units, as described hereinabove, together with non-functionalized monomeric or oligomeric units that compose the backbone.","In some embodiments, each of the functionalized monomeric units can first be polymerized, so as to form a functionalized oligomer bearing a plurality of the first reactive groups and a functionalized oligomer bearing a plurality of the second reactive groups, and these oligomers can be co-polymerized with each other and with the non-functionalized oligomeric or monomeric units.","In some embodiments, only one of the functionalized monomeric units is polymerized so as to form a functionalized oligomer, which is then co-polymerized with the other functionalized monomeric units and non-functionalized monomeric or oligomeric units.","As used herein throughout, the term \u201cfunctionalized\u201d describes a monomer or an oligomer that terminates with one or more reactive groups.","As used herein throughout, a \u201creactive group\u201d describes a chemical group that is capable of reacting with another group so as to form a chemical bond, typically a covalent bond. Optionally, an ionic or coordinative bond is formed.","A reactive group is termed as such if being chemically compatible with a reactive group of an agent or moiety that should be desirably attached thereto. For example, a carboxylic group is a reactive group suitable for conjugating an agent or a moiety that terminates with an amine group, and vice versa.","A reactive group can be inherently present in the monomeric units, oligomeric units and\/or bone targeting moiety and the anti-angiogenesis agent, or be generated therewithin by terms of chemical modifications of the chemical groups thereon or by means of attaching to these chemical groups a spacer or a linker that terminates with the desired reactive group, as described herein.","Co-polymerizing the monomers or oligomers described herein can be effected by any of the polymerization methods known in the art, using suitable polymerization initiators or any other catalysts known in the art.","As discussed hereinabove, it has been shown that co-polymerization via the Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) technique yields conjugates having a low polydispersity index and small mean size distribution.","Therefore, in some embodiments, the co-polymerization is performed via the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) technique, as exemplified in the Examples section that follows.","In some embodiments, the anti-angiogenesis agent is conjugated to the polymer prior to the conjugation of the bone targeting moiety.

The neutral forms of the compounds are preferably regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in a conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the compound for the purposes of the present invention.","The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salts\u201d is meant to encompass salts of the moieties and\/or conjugates which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When conjugates according to embodiments of the invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral (i.e., non-ionized) form of such conjugates with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amino, or magnesium salt, or a similar salt. When conjugates according to embodiments of the invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such conjugates with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include, but are not limited to, those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, for example, Berge et al., \u201cPharmaceutical Salts\u201d, Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 1977, 66, 1-19). Certain specific conjugates of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the conjugates to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.","The neutral forms of the conjugates are preferably regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent conjugate in a conventional manner. The parent form of the conjugate differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the conjugate for the purposes of the present invention.","In an example, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of alendronate is utilized. An exemplary such salt is sodium alendronate. An alendronate-containing conjugate can therefore comprise a sodium salt of alendronate.","In another example, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of aspartate is utilized.","The term \u201cprodrug\u201d refers to an agent, which is converted into the active compound (the active parent drug) in vivo. Prodrugs are typically useful for facilitating the administration of the parent drug. The prodrug may also have improved solubility as compared with the parent drug in pharmaceutical compositions. Prodrugs are also often used to achieve a sustained release of the active compound in vivo.","The conjugates described herein may possess asymmetric carbon atoms (optical centers) or double bonds; the racemates, diastereomers, geometric isomers and individual isomers are encompassed within the scope of embodiments of the invention.","As used herein, the term \u201cenantiomer\u201d describes a stereoisomer of a compound that is superposable with respect to its counterpart only by a complete inversion\/reflection (mirror image) of each other. Enantiomers are said to have \u201chandedness\u201d since they refer to each other like the right and left hand. Enantiomers have identical chemical and physical properties except when present in an environment which by itself has handedness, such as all living systems.","The conjugates described herein can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to unsolvated forms and are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.","The term \u201csolvate\u201d refers to a complex of variable stoichiometry (e.g., di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and so on), which is formed by a solute (the conjugate described herein) and a solvent, whereby the solvent does not interfere with the biological activity of the solute. Suitable solvents include, for example, ethanol, acetic acid and the like.","The term \u201chydrate\u201d refers to a solvate, as defined hereinabove, where the solvent is water.","Certain conjugates of the present invention may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In general, all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated by the present invention and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.","As discussed hereinabove, the conjugates described herein (also referred to herein throughout as polymeric conjugates) comprise a bone targeting moiety being either alendronate or an oligopeptide of aspartate, which enables the targeting of the conjugate to bone and bone related structures. Due to the anti-angiogenesis\/anti-proliferative activity exhibited by the moieties attached to the polymer and the formed conjugate as a whole, each of the conjugates described herein can be beneficially used for treating bone and bone related disease and disorders.","Hence, according to another aspect of some embodiments of the present invention there are provided methods of treating a bone related disease or disorder in a subject in need thereof. These methods are effected by administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of any of the conjugates described herein.","Accordingly, according to another aspect of some embodiments of the present invention there are provided uses of any of the conjugates described herein as a medicament. In some embodiments, the medicament is for treating a bone-related disease or disorder.","According to another aspect of some embodiments of the present invention, the conjugates described herein are identified for use in the treatment of a bone related disease or disorder.","As used herein, the term \u201cmethod\u201d refers to manners, means, techniques and procedures for accomplishing a given task including, but not limited to, those manners, means, techniques and procedures either known to, or readily developed from known manners, means, techniques and procedures by practitioners of the chemical, pharmacological, biological, biochemical and medical arts.","The phrase \u201ca bone related disease or disorder\u201d describes a disease or disorder wherein bone formation, deposition, or resorption is abnormal, especially those characterized by excessive angiogenesis. The phrase \u201cbone related disease or disorder\u201d also encompasses disease and disorders occurring in bodily sites other than bone which evolved from a bone related disease or disorder such as, for example, metastasis of bone cancer in another organ and diseases and disorders which evolved in other bodily sites and affect bone tissues.","Bone-related diseases disorders include, but are not limited to, bone cancer and bone cancer metastases, osteopenia due to bone metastases, periodontal disease, periarticular erosions in rheumatoid arthritis, Paget's disease, malignant hypercalcemia, osteolytic lesions produced by bone metastasis, bone abnormalities caused by cancer therapeutics and hyperostosis.","As used herein, the term \u201ctreating\u201d includes abrogating, substantially inhibiting, slowing or reversing the progression of a condition, substantially ameliorating clinical or aesthetical symptoms of a condition or substantially preventing the appearance of clinical or aesthetical symptoms of a condition. When the treatable disease is bone cancer, this term encompasses any inhibition of tumor growth or metastasis, or any attempt to inhibit, slow or abrogate tumor growth or metastasis.","It is noted herein that by targeting an anti-angiogenesis agent via the methodologies described herein, the toxicity of the anti-angiogenesis agent is substantially reduced, due to the conjugate selectivity towards bone tissues. Consequently, besides the use of the conjugates described herein in a clinically evident disease, optionally in combination with other drugs, these conjugates may potentially be used as a long term-prophylactic for individuals who are at risk for relapse due to residual dormant cancers. The use of non-toxic targeted conjugates for the treatment of asymptomatic individuals who are at risk for relapse of osteosarcoma, as an example, may lead to a major paradigm shift in cancer treatment from current methods where treatment is generally not initiated until a bone related disease such as osteosarcoma becomes clinically evident.","The term \u201csubject\u201d (alternatively referred to herein as \u201cpatient\u201d) as used herein refers to an animal, preferably a mammal, most preferably a human, who has been the object of treatment, observation or experiment.","As demonstrated in the Examples section that follows and discussed elaborately hereinabove, it has been shown that the conjugates described herein inhibit angiogenesis as well as cell proliferation and therefore can be utilized for the treatment of bone related disease and disorders characterized by pathologically excessive angiogenesis wherein the inhibition of angiogenesis and\/or cell proliferation is beneficial.","Hence, in some embodiments the bone related disease or disorder is associated with angiogenesis.","Tumor growth and metastasis are particularly dependent on the degree of angiogenesis. Tumor angiogenesis is the proliferation of a network of blood vessels that penetrate into cancerous tumors in order to supply nutrients and oxygen and remove waste products, thus leading to tumor growth. Tumor angiogenesis involves hormonal stimulation and activation of oncogenes, expression of angiogenic growth factors, extravasation of plasma protein, deposition of a provisional extracellular matrix (ECM), degradation of ECM, and migration, proliferation and elongation of endothelial capillaries. Inhibition of further vascular expansion has therefore been the focus of active research for cancer therapy.","Hence, in some embodiments, the bone related disease or disorder is selected from the group consisting of bone cancer metastases and bone cancer.","The terms \u201ccancer\u201d and \u201ctumor\u201d are used interchangeably herein to describe a class of diseases in which a group of cells display uncontrolled growth (division beyond the normal limits). The term \u201ccancer\u201d encompasses malignant and benign tumors as well as disease conditions evolving from primary or secondary tumors. The term \u201cmalignant tumor\u201d describes a tumor which is not self-limited in its growth, is capable of invading into adjacent tissues, and may be capable of spreading to distant tissues (metastasizing). The term \u201cbenign tumor\u201d describes a tumor which is not-malignant (i.e. does not grow in an unlimited, aggressive manner, does not invade surrounding tissues, and does not metastasize). The term \u201cprimary tumor\u201d describes a tumor that is at the original site where it first arose. The term \u201csecondary tumor\u201d describes a tumor that has spread from its original (primary) site of growth to another site, close to or distant from the primary site.","The term \u201cbone cancer\u201d describes tumors that arise from the tissues of the bone. The term \u201cbone cancer\u201d, as used herein, further encompasses tumors in tissues located in proximity to bone structures and associated with bone such as cartilage, bone cavity and bone marrow. The term \u201cbone cancer\u201d further encompasses cancer which evolved from bone cells (i.e. primary tumor), as well as cancer cells which have \u201cbreaken away\u201d, \u201cleaked\u201d, or \u201cspilled\u201d from a primary tumor located in bone, entered the lymphatic and\/or blood vessels, circulated through the lymphatic system and\/or bloodstream, settled down and proliferated within normal tissues elsewhere in the body thereby creating a secondary tumor. For example, metastases originating from osteosarcoma can be frequently found in the lungs and in other organs. These lesions produce an osteoid and therefore can be targeted with bone targeting moieties, as described herein.","Bone cancer is found most often in the bones of the arms and legs, but it can occur in any bone.","Bone cancers are also known as sarcomas. There are several types of sarcomas of bone, depending upon the kind of bone tissue where the tumor developed. Exemplary types of bone cancers that are treatable according to embodiments of the invention include, but are not limited to, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, chondrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, malignant giant cell tumor, and chordoma.","Osteosarcoma is the most common type of primary bone cancer and classified as a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm in which the tumor directly produces defective osteoid (immature bone). It is a highly vascular and extremely destructive malignancy that most commonly arises in the metaphyseal ends of long bones. Several strategies were proposed, such as immune-based therapy, tumor-suppressor or suicide gene therapy, or anticancer drugs that are not commonly used in osteosarcoma [Quan et al. 2006; 10: 707-713]. However, still one-third of patients die from this devastating cancer, and for those with unresectable disease there are no curative systemic therapies.","The term \u201cbone metastases\u201d describes cancer evolving form a primary tumor located in bodily site other than bone but metastasizing to the bone (i.e. a secondary tumor). Cancers that commonly metastasize, or spread, to the bones include breast cancer, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, prostate cancer, some brain cancers and cancers of the kidney.","For example, prostate cancer is the most common cancer of males in industrialized countries and the second leading cause of male cancer mortality. Prostate cancer predominantly metastasizes to bone, but other organ sites are affected including the lung, liver, and adrenal gland. Bone metastases incidence in patients with advanced metastatic disease is approximately 70%. Bone metastases are associated with considerable skeletal morbidity, including severe bone pain, pathologic fracture, spinal cord or nerve root compressions, and hypercalcemia of malignancy.","As discussed hereinabove, the conjugates described herein may be further utilized for monitoring bone related disease or disorders. In such a case the conjugate further comprises a labeling agent, as defined herein, for easy detection of the conjugate in the body of the patient, using well known imaging techniques. For example, in the case of the bone related disease or disorder being bone cancer the detection of the conjugate, as assessed by the level of labeling agent signal, can serve to detect bone cancer metastases in bodily sites other than bone.","Hence, according to another aspect of some embodiments of the invention, there are provided methods of monitoring a bone related disease or disorder in a subject. The method according to these embodiments of the invention is effected by administering to the subject any of the conjugates described herein, having a labeling agent attached to the polymer, as described herein, and employing an imaging technique for monitoring a distribution of the conjugate within the body or a portion thereof.","Accordingly, according to another aspect of some embodiments of the present invention there are provided uses of any of the conjugates described herein, having a labeling agent as described herein, as diagnostic agents and\/or in the manufacture of a diagnostic agent for monitoring a bone related disease or disorder.","According to another aspect of some embodiments of the present invention, each of the conjugates described herein, which comprises a labeling agent, is identified for use as a diagnostic agent, for monitoring a bone related disease or disorder.","Suitable imaging techniques include, but are not limited to, positron emission tomography (PET), gamma-scintigraphy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) computed axial tomography (CAT) scans, ultrasound, fluoroscopy and conventional X-ray imaging. The choice of an appropriate imaging technique depends on the nature of the labeling agent, and is within the skill in the art. For example, if the labeling agent comprises Gd ions, then the appropriate imaging technique is MRI; if the labeling agent comprises radionuclides, an appropriate imaging technique is gamma-scintigraphy; if the labeling agent comprises an ultrasound agent, ultrasound is the appropriate imaging technique, etc.","According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as an active ingredient, any of the conjugates described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier","Accordingly, in any of the methods and uses described herein, any of the conjugates described herein can be provided to an individual either per se, or as part of a pharmaceutical composition where it is mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","As used herein a \u201cpharmaceutical composition\u201d refers to a preparation of one or more of the conjugates described herein (as active ingredient), or physiologically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof, with other chemical components including but not limited to, physiologically suitable carriers, excipients, lubricants, buffering agents, antibacterial agents, bulking agents (e.g. mannitol), antioxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite), anti-inflammatory agents, anti-viral agents, chemotherapeutic agents, anti-histamines and the like. The purpose of a pharmaceutical composition is to facilitate administration of a compound to a subject.

The conjugate polymerized by the classical polymerization method had a PDI of \u02dc1.62 with a mean size distribution of 241 nm whereas the conjugate polymerized by \u201cliving polymerization\u201d RAFT was well-dispersed exhibiting a considerably lower and narrower PDI of \u02dc1.2 with a mean size distribution of 100 nm (). The values of mean size distribution of the first conjugates, synthesized by the classical polymerization method, clearly indicate that associates formed under the experimental conditions used.","Prior to conjugation of ALN and TNP-470 to HPMA copolymer backbone, the nature of the inhibitory effect of ALN and TNP-470 as a combined therapy on endothelial cells proliferation in vitro was evaluated. HUVEC were challenged with free or combined ALN and TNP-470. The results, presented in  show that combination treatments of ALN and TNP-470 decreased the IC's of the drugs as single treatments. ALN inhibited cell proliferation at inhibitory concentration ICof 10, 50, 90 \u03bcM, respectively, and TNP-470 inhibited cell proliferation at ICof 0.00025, 0.1, 1000 nM, respectively. Combination treatments I (serial concentrations of ALN and TNP-470 0.01 nM) and II (serial concentrations of TNP-470 and ALN 10 \u03bcM) inhibited HUVEC proliferation at ICof 0.2, 10, 30 \u03bcM and 0.00001, 0.004, 40 nM, respectively.","Combination index (CI)-isobologram equation allowed quantitative determination of drug interactions, where CI<1, =1, or >1 indicated synergism, additive effect, or antagonism, respectively. Next, data from combination treatments were calculated according to CI equation and were used to generate isobolograms at ICof HUVEC proliferation by ALN-TNP-470 combinations.

Combination treatment II had synergistic effect at ICwith CI of 0.23, 0.121 and additive effect at ICwith CI of 1.025.","One of the main characteristics of ALN besides its anti-angiogenic and antitumor activities is its pharmacokinetic profile which exhibits a strong affinity to bone mineral under physiological conditions. To determine if the activity of ALN is retained following polymer-conjugation, the affinity of the conjugate to bone mineral was evaluated by in vitro hydroxyapitate binding assay and FPLC analysis using Hitrap desalting column. As shown in , unbound conjugates eluted as a single peak with a retention time of 1.9 minutes. AUC decreased in correlation with hydroxyapitate incubation time. Following 2 minutes of incubation with hydroxyapitate, 50% of the HPMA copolymer ALN-TNP-470 conjugate in the solution was bound to hydroxyapitate (see, ). This rapid binding rate to hydroxyapitate decreased after 10 minutes and finally reached a plateau after 175 minutes of incubation time with 92% of the HPMA copolymer ALN-TNP-470 conjugate bound to hydroxyapitate.","Following chemical characterization, the ability of FITC-labeled HPMA copolymer ALN-TNP-470 conjugate to internalize into endothelial and human osteosarcoma cells and the mechanism by which it internalizes was studied. HUVEC and Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells were incubated with the conjugate, fixed, permeabilzed and stained with the nuclei marker propidium iodide (PI). Confocal microscopy was performed by separately multi-channel tracking for PI (red) and FITC-labeled conjugate (green).","As shown in , following 12 hours of incubation, the conjugate accumulated mostly in the cytoplasm of HUVEC and of Saos-2 cells as observed in the single plane image.","To evaluate the conjugate cellular localization and to eliminate optical artifacts, Z-stack of 5.7 \u03bcm with 28 slices and X, Z slice was captured and analyzed. As shown in , the conjugate was found to be located at the same focal plane as the nuclei, confirming its intracellular uptake.","Further examination of the conjugate cellular internalization was preformed using phalloidin (red) for actin filaments staining and DAPI for nuclei staining. As shown in , the staining revealed accumulation of the conjugate mainly around the nuclei in HUVEC () and Saos-2 cells ().","The conjugate was capable of internalizing into HUVAC and Saos-2 cells as demonstrated by colocalization of 82% of the conjugate with transferrin in HUVEC cells () and of 71% in Saos-2 cells (). These high percentages of colocalization suggest a lysosomotrophic pathway of cellular uptake via clathrin-coated vesicles.","To determine whether HPMA copolymer ALN-TNP-470 conjugate is active in vitro and that the bound drugs retained their antitumor and anti-angiogenic activity following polymer-conjugation, the inhibitory effect of the conjugate on HUVEC, Saos-2 and MG-63-Ras human osteosarcoma cell proliferation was examined.","The results, presented in , show that endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS)-induced proliferation of HUVEC was inhibited similarly by the combination of free ALN+free TNP-470 and the HPMA copolymer-ALN-TNP-470 conjugate at ALN and TNP-470 equivalent concentrations, exhibiting an ICof 0.7 and 1 nM, and had cytotoxic effect at doses higher than 1 and 10 nM, respectively.","Saos-2 human osteosarcoma cell proliferation was inhibited similarly by free and conjugated ALN and TNP-470 combinations at ICof 30 \u03bcM.","MG-63-Ras human osteosarcoma cell proliferation was inhibited similarly by free and conjugated ALN-TNP-470 at ICof 10 \u03bcM.","HPMA alone was inert in vitro and in vivo (data not shown), in agreement with previously published data [Duncan et al. 2001; 74: 135-146].","In order to validate that HPMA copolymer-ALN-TNP-470 conjugate is active mainly upon the release of ALN and TNP-470 by cathepsin K cleavage mechanism, the inhibition of HUVEC proliferation by HPMA copolymer-ALN-TNP-470 conjugate in the presence of cathepsin K inhibitor III was evaluated. HPMA copolymer-ALN-TNP-470 conjugate inhibited the proliferation of HUVEC at a 4-logs higher concentration in the presence of cathepsin K inhibitor III than in its absence. Following 72 hours, there was probably some free ALN and TNP-470 released hydrolytically from HPMA copolymer-ALN-TNP-470 conjugate which led to the inhibition of proliferation of HUVEC at concentrations higher than 4 \u03bcM ALN-equivalent concentrations.","The effect of HPMA copolymer ALN-TNP-470 conjugate on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced HUVEC migration was examined. Migration was assessed by counting the number of cells that migrated through the membranes towards the chemoattractant VEGF during a 4 hour period following 4 hours of treatment with a combination of free ALN+free TNP-470 or conjugated HPMA-ALN-TNP-470.","As shown in , treatments with free or conjugated ALN\/TNP-470 at equivalent concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10 nM dramatically inhibited the chemotactic migration response to VEGF by 23% (p=0.038), 41% (p=0.003), 58% (p=0.013), and 18% (p=0.037), 35% (p=0.032) and 61% (p=0.0006) respectively. HUVEC basal migration in the absence of VEGF was 33% compared to VEGF induced cells.","The ability of HPMA copolymer-ALN-TNP-470 conjugate to inhibit capillary-like tube formation of HUVEC was examined.","As shown in , the combination of free ALN+free TNP-470 and the conjugated HPMA-ALN-TNP-470 at equivalent concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1 nM inhibited capillary-like tube length compared with control (untreated) by 34% (p=0.031), 53% (0.007), 73% (p=0.004), and 29% (p=0.021), 54% (p=0.008) and 64% (0.014), respectively.","Both conjugates synthesized by classical and by RAFT polymerization reactions exhibited similar effects on the in vitro assays described hereinabove. Therefore, the narrowly dispersed and smaller in diameter RAFT-polymerized conjugate was chosen for all in vivo studies due to an expected improved biodistribution.","To determine whether HPMA copolymer-ALN-TNP-470 conjugate is able to reduce microvessel hyperpermeability a modified Miles assay was used. Evans blue dye was injected to the retro-orbital plexus and immediately thereafter the vascular permeability-induced factor VEGF was injected into the shaved flank of Balb\/c mice. Evans blue binds to plasma proteins and therefore extravasates along with them at sites of increased permeability. VEGF-induced extravasation of Evans blue dye was remarkably inhibited in mice treated with free combination of ALN and TNP-470 and with HPMA copolymer-ALN-TNP-470 conjugate compared to vehicle treated mice by 87% (P=0.002) and 92% (P=0.001), respectively (see,  respectively).","SCID male mice bearing s.c. mCherry-labeled MG-63-Ras human osteosarcoma showed decreased tumor growth rates when treated with free and conjugated ALN and TNP-470 (1:1, 30 mg\/kg q.o.d. 3 times). The superiority of administering both drugs when conjugated to the polymer compared to a cocktail of both free drugs becomes evident when injected in vivo (). HPMA copolymer-ALN-TNP-470 conjugate exhibited superior antitumor activity compared to free ALN and TNP-470 combination treatment. On day 19 when control mice were euthanized, HPMA copolymer-ALN-TNP-470 conjugate inhibited tumor growth by 96% (p=0.001) compared with 45% (p=0.012) of free ALN and TNP-470 (n=5 mice per group; (). Confocal microscopy analysis of mCherry-labeled tumors dissected from mice treated with FITC-labeled HPMA copolymer-ALN-TNP-470 conjugate revealed high accumulation of the conjugate at the tumor site ().","H & E staining of tumor sections of MG-63-Ras human osteosarcoma tumors treated with combination of free TNP-470 and ALN or with the conjugate revealed that tumor sections from control mice consisted of poorly differentiated tumor cells invasive through the muscle layer with central calcified areas allowing the HA-targeting of the conjugate with ALN. Conjugate-treated tumors were almost regressed showing cholesterol deposits with connective tissue and giant cells and macrophages around them as signs of regression (). CD34 staining (used as an endothelial cell marker) showed reduction of 39% (p=5.5\u00d710) in microvessel density (MVD) of combination of free ALN with TNP-470 (76\u00b114 microvessels\/mm) and 74% (P=4.7\u00d710) reduction in MVD of conjugate-treated tumors (32\u00b19 microvessels\/mm) vs. control group of mice (125\u00b116 microvessels\/mm) (n=5 mice per group; ).","Fluorescence imaging of organs dissected from mice treated with FITC-labeled HPMA copolymer-ALN-TNP-470 conjugate showed greater intensity of FITC-fluorescence spectrum (composed images of unmixed multispectral cubes) in bone tissues then in the spleen, heart, lungs, kidneys and liver ().
