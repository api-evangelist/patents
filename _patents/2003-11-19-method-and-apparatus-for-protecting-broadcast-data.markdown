{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION","BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF REFERENCE NUMERALS"],"p":["The invention relates to a digital broadcasting system, using an MPEG (Moving Picture Coding Experts Group) 2 system, a receiving apparatus, and a protecting method and a receiving method of broadcast data and, more particularly, to protection of a copyright of a still image.","An MPEG2 system (ISO\/IEC 13818-1 GENERIC CODING OF MOVING PICTURES AND ASSOCIATED AUDIO: SYSTEMS Recommendation H.222.0) is used in a digital broadcast (digital satellite broadcast, digital terrestrial broadcast, and digital CATV (Cable Television)) in Japan. Such a system has been formed on the basis of the standard of ARIB (Association of Radio Industrial and Businesses).","The MPEG2 system specifies a system for multiplexing each of individual streams such as encoded video data, audio data, additional data, and the like and reproducing while synchronizing them. There are two kinds of systems such as MPEG2-PS (Program Stream) and MPEG2-TS (Transport Stream).","Since the MPEG2-PS has been made by presuming an application to transmission and storage of data in an environment where no errors occur and redundancy can be reduced, it is used in a digital storage media such as a DVD (Digital Versatile Disc) or the like using a powerful error correction code.","Since the MPEG2-TS has been made by presuming an application to an environment such as broadcast, communication network, or the like where a transmission error of data occurs and a plurality of programs can be constructed in one stream, it is used in a digital broadcast or the like.","In the MPEG2-TS, a plurality of TS (Transport Stream) packets of a fixed length of 188 bytes are collected and the transport stream is formed. The length of TS packet of 188 bytes has been determined in consideration of matching performance with an ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) cell length.","The TS packet is constructed by a packet header of a fixed length of 4 bytes and an adaptation field and a payload each having a variable length. A PID (packet identifier) and various flags are defined in the packet header. A kind of TS packet is identified by the PID.","A PES (Packetized Elementary Stream) packet in which the individual streams of video, audio, and the like have been enclosed is divided into a plurality of TS packets having the same PID number and transmitted. For example, the MPEG2 system is used for encoding the video data. For example, in a BS (Broadcast Satellite) digital broadcast, an MPEG2-AAC (MPEG2 Advanced Audio Coding) system is used for encoding the audio data.","A PES packet in which data such as subtitles or the like is enclosed is also divided into a plurality of TS packets and transmitted in a manner similar to the packet of the video data or audio data.","Further, a packet of information described by a table in a section format such as PSI (Program Specific Information) or SI (Service Information) is included in the transport stream. The PSI is information which is necessary in a system which selectively receives a desired broadcast channel. A PAT (Program Association Table), a PMT (Program Map Table), an NIT (Network Information Table), a CAT (Condition Access Table), and the like can be given as PSI.","The PID or the like of the PMT corresponding to the program number is described in the PAT. A video image, an audio sound, and additional data included in the corresponding program and a PID of a PCR are described in the PMT. Detailed information regarding the whole broadcasting system is described in the NIT. For example, information of all programs included in a network and information showing at which carrier frequency a target program is transmitted are described. Information regarding identification of a limited receiving system and the individual information such as contract information and the like is described in the CAT. The SI indicates a section which is used for services of a broadcast industrial company. There are an EIT (Event Information Table) and an SDT (Service Description Table) as SI. Detailed information, a broadcasting time, and the like of the program are described in the EIT. The EIT is used for an EPG (Electronic Program Guide) and a recording reservation.","As a digital broadcast of such an MPEG2 system, a digital CS (Communication Satellite) broadcast and a digital BS (Broadcast Satellite) broadcast have already been started in Japan. In the digital BS broadcast, besides an ordinary SDTV (Standard Definition Television), a broadcast of an HDTV (High Definition Television) is being performed. Execution of a digital terrestrial broadcast is also being examined.","To protect a copyright of a motion image which is transmitted by such a digital broadcast, a digital copy control descriptor (digital_copy_control_descriptor) has been defined in ARIB STD-B10 (refer to ). The digital copy control descriptor (digital_copy_control_descriptor) is inserted into the PMT, EIT, and SDT. In the case of copying the motion image which is transmitted by the digital broadcast, copying is restricted by such a descriptor.","Two bits of digital_recording_control_data in the digital copy control descriptor (digital_copy_control_descriptor) are used for copy control. When those two bits are equal to \u201c00\u201d, it indicates \u201cCopy Freely\u201d (the copy can be freely performed), \u201c11\u201d indicates \u201cCopy Never\u201d (the copying is inhibited), and \u201c10\u201d indicates \u201cCopy One Generation\u201d (the copy of only one generation is permitted). That is, those two bits are used to make the copy control of a CGMS (Copy Generation Management System). The copy control by the CGMS has been disclosed in, for example, Patent Document (JP-A-2000-123480).","Further, a content availability descriptor (content_availability_descriptor) is defined for the motion image (refer to ). In the content availability descriptor (content_availability_descriptor), resolution can be restricted in the case of outputting the stored image or a recording time when a copy-inhibited image is temporarily recorded into a video recording and reproducing apparatus can be restricted.","In the content availability descriptor (content_availability_descriptor), image_constrain_token is used to restrict the resolution in the case of outputting the stored image in an analog manner. retention_mode shows whether to restrict a recording time when the copy-inhibited image is temporarily recorded or not. retention_state shows a recording restricting time when the copy-inhibited image is temporarily recorded. When retention_mode is equal to \u201c0\u201d, the image can be temporarily stored only for the time shown by retention_state. encryption_mode shows whether to encrypt the data of contents and output it from a high-speed digital terminal or not.","In recent years, the video recording and reproducing apparatus using an HDD (Hard Disk Drive) has been proposed. The video recording and reproducing apparatus using the HDD has a function to store the motion image which is being received, and when the user has a visitor or the like, freeze a receiving display screen and when the visitor has left, follow-up reproduce the motion image recorded in the HDD from the frozen position. retention_state of the content availability descriptor (content_availability_descriptor) is effective, particularly, in the case where copy restriction of copy-inhibited contents is made in the video recording and reproducing apparatus having such a function.","As mentioned above, the protection of the copyright of the motion image is realized by inserting the digital copy control descriptor (digital_copy_control_descriptor) or the content availability descriptor (content_availability_descriptor) into the PMT.","However, a system which transmits copyright information of a still image in the broadcast does not exist. Therefore, a violation act of a copyright law is still performed. The still image has rights such as copyright, right of portrait, and the like and it is demanded to establish a system which transmits and manages the copyright information of the still image contents.","As a still image with a possibility of being illegally used, there are a still image obtained by freezing the motion image and extracting a part of the motion image and a still image which is transmitted by a data broadcast service.","That is, the motion image is fundamentally a continuation of still images. In the digital broadcast, there are the following video formats: 1080i (1920\u00d71080, interlaced scan); 480p (720\u00d7480, progressive scan); 480i (720\u00d7480, interlaced scan); 720p (1280\u00d7720, progressive scan); (1080p 1920\u00d71080, progressive scan); and the like. The still image is obtained by freeze-reproducing the motion image. In the case of a signal of the video format such as 1080i, 1080p, or 720p, the still image obtained by freezing the motion image also has a fairly high picture quality.","The data broadcast service can be executed in the digital broadcast. In the data broadcast service, multimedia contents such as motion image, still image, characters, figure, subtitles, and the like can be handled. By using a browser, those multimedia contents can be linked and viewed. The still image encoded by a JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) system or the like is derived from the data broadcast service.","As mentioned above, also with respect to the still image extracted as a part of the motion image or the still image which is transmitted by the data broadcast service, it is necessary to protect the copyright and prevent the still image from being illegally copied, illegally printed, or illegally attached to a homepage or the like.","It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide a broadcasting system and a receiving apparatus which can protect a copyright of a still image which is transmitted by a digital broadcast and to provide a protecting method and a receiving method of broadcast data.","The invention provides a broadcasting system comprising: a transmitting apparatus for transmitting a digital broadcast by a stream of an MPEG system; and a receiving apparatus for receiving the stream transmitted from the transmitting apparatus, wherein the transmitting apparatus allows copyright information of a still image to be included in a predetermined table in the stream and transmits the obtained stream and the receiving apparatus refers to the copyright information of the still image in the predetermined table in the stream transmitted from the transmitting apparatus and executes a copyright protecting process of the still image on the basis of the copyright information of the still image in the predetermined table.","The invention provides a broadcasting system comprising: a transmitting apparatus for transmitting a digital broadcast by a stream of an MPEG system;

Thus, a burden on the transmitting side of the digital broadcast can be reduced.","According to the invention, in the case where the still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) and the digital copy control descriptor of the motion image cannot be referred to, when the copyright information is not sent, the copy control descriptor of the still image is set on the basis of the predetermined copyright information of the still image. Thus, the burden on the transmitting side of the digital broadcast can be reduced.","When the program is reserved, the copyright of the still image can be protected by inserting the still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) into the EIT and\/or the SDT.","An embodiment of the invention will be described hereinbelow with reference to the drawings.  shows an example of a receiving system of a digital satellite broadcast to which the invention is applied.","In , a signal of the digital broadcast is transmitted from a broadcasting station .

In the case of the limited reception, descrambling is executed by the descrambler  by using the received ECM and EMM and the information in the IC card .","A modem  is provided. Charge information is sent to a broadcasting center of the program by a telephone line through the modem .","The transport stream descrambled by the descrambler  is sent to a demultiplexer .","The demultiplexer  separates the stream of a desired packet from the received transport stream. A packet identifier (PID) is described in a header portion of the packet. In the demultiplexer , the packet is separated to the video PES (Packetized Elementary Stream) packet, audio PES packet, data packet, PSI (Program Specific Information) packet, and SI (Service Information) packet of a desired program on the basis of the PID.","The video PES packet of the desired program is sent to a video decoder  and the audio PES packet is sent to an audio decoder . The stream from the demultiplexer  is sent to the microprocessor  through a bus .","The video decoder  receives the video PES packet from the demultiplexer , executes a decoding process of the MPEG2 system, and reproduces the video signal.

There produced audio signal is outputted from an output terminal .","An operation input is given by an input key . For example, various keys or switches arranged on a panel of the receiving apparatus are used as an input key . The operation input can be executed by an infrared remote controller . A photosensing unit  for receiving an infrared command signal from the infrared remote controller  is provided. A signal from the photosensing unit  is sent to the microprocessor .","Various setting states are displayed on a display unit . For example, a liquid crystal display or an LED (Light Emitting Diode) device which is arranged on the panel can be mentioned as a display unit . Further, a display signal from the microprocessor  is supplied to an OSD (On Screen Display) circuit . An output of the OSD circuit  is synthesized to the video signal by an adder . Thus, the various setting states can be multiplexed and displayed to the receiving display screen.","An HDD (Hard Disk Drive)  for recording and reproducing the received motion image is built in the receiver. The transport stream from the demultiplexer  is supplied to the HDD  through the bus  and an HDD controller . This stream is recorded on the HDD . Upon reproduction, the stream reproduced from the HDD  is sent to the demultiplexer  through the HDD controller  and the bus .","An IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 1394 interface  for inputting and outputting the data is provided for the receiver. The transport stream from the demultiplexer  can be outputted through the bus  and the IEEE 1394 interface  or through a signal line connected to the demultiplexer . Transport stream transferred from another apparatus through the IEEE 1394 interface  can be inputted.","A video recording and reproducing apparatus such as digital VCR, HDD video recording and reproducing apparatus, or the like is connected to the IEEE 1394 interface  and the motion image sent by the broadcast can be recorded by the video recording and reproducing apparatus such as digital VCR, HDD video recording and reproducing apparatus, or the like. It is also possible to connect a printer to the IEEE 1394 interface , fetch the still image from the motion image which is being broadcasted, and print the still image. Further, it is also possible that a personal computer is connected to the IEEE 1394 interface  and the still image extracted from the motion image or the still image sent by the data broadcast is stored in the personal computer or copied into another recording medium such as a memory card or the like.","In the microprocessor , when the motion image transmitted from the broadcasting station  is recorded by the built-in HDD  or the video recording and reproducing apparatus connected to the interface , the digital copy control descriptor (digital_copy_control_descriptor) and the content availability descriptor (content_availability_descriptor) sent by the PMT are discriminated. The copyright process such as copy restriction or the like is executed on the basis of the description of the digital copy control descriptor (digital_copy_control_descriptor) and the content availability descriptor (content_availability_descriptor).","When the still image extracted from the motion image sent by the broadcast or the still image sent by the data broadcast is recorded by the built-in HDD  or the video recording and reproducing apparatus connected to the interface  or the still image is printed by the printer connected to the interface , the copyright process such as print restriction, recording restriction, or the like is executed in accordance with the still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) sent by the PMT.","When the program is reserved, the apparatus is notified of the copyright information of the motion image and the still image by the digital copy control descriptor (digital_copy_control_descriptor) and the still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) sent by the EIT and the SDT. The reservation setting process is executed in accordance with the copyright information.","The example of the receiver of the digital BS broadcast has been described here. However, even in the receiver of the digital terrestrial broadcast or the digital CATV, its fundamental construction is similar to that of the above receiver although the modulating system and the error correcting system are different from those of the above receiver. In the case of the digital terrestrial broadcast, an OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex) is used as a modulating system. In the digital CATV, a multivalue QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) is used as a modulating system.","The still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) shown in  will now be described in detail. The still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) is described in the PMT, EIT, or SDT. The PMT is constructed as shown in . The EIT is constructed as shown in . The SDT is constructed as shown in .","The still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) can be arranged in a first loop and an ES loop of the PMT.","In the case of arranging the descriptor into the first loop of the PMT, this restriction can be applied to all of the still images included in the designated program. In the case of arranging the descriptor into the ES loop of the PMT, the restriction of the descriptor can be applied only to the still image of the designated ES. It is assumed that in the case where the descriptor is arranged in both of the first loop and the ES loop, with respect only to the designated ES, the restriction of the descriptor of the ES loop is preferentially applied than the descriptor of the first loop. In this case, it is assumed that in the case where no descriptor exists in another ES loop, the restriction of the descriptor of the first loop is applied.","In the case of arranging the still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) to the EIT, it is described in the program information of the EIT.","In the case of arranging the still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) to the SDT, information of the still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) is applied to all programs in the channel.","It is assumed that in the case where the descriptor is arranged in both of the EIT and the SDT, the information of the EIT is applied to the designated program. It is assumed that if there is no descriptor in the EIT and the descriptor is arranged only in the SDT, the information of the descriptor of the SDT is applied to the program.","As shown in , the still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) includes flags (image_resolution_control, recording_control, print_control, expiration_date_flag, component_flag) and control after an if sentence to each of the flags. When \u201c1\u201d is set to the flag, the subsequent if sentence is validated and it is necessary to control the still image in accordance with the condition of the if sentence. component_flag and component_tag are arranged only in the case of arranging the descriptor to the EIT and the SDT.","The image_resolution_control bit is used to restrict the resolution (the number of pixels) of the display. When the image_resolution_control bit is set to \u201c1\u201d, it is necessary to restrict the number of pixels to the designated value in all conditions other than those of the display device to which the receiver is connected (the display screen of the television receiver serving as a monitor in the case where the receiver and the television receiver are separate; the display screen of the television receiver in the case where the television having the receiver therein is the receiver). Therefore, in the case of outputting the still image in order to record it by the printer or record it onto a recording medium, it is necessary to restrict the number of pixels to the maximum pixel size defined by the if sentence. When the image_resolution_control bit is set to \u201c0\u201d, the if sentence does not appear in the descriptor. If a size of original image is smaller than the designated pixel size, even if such restriction has been designated, there is no need to perform the restriction. The bits are assigned every 16 bits to maximum_horizontal_pixel_number and maximum_vertical_pixel_number of the if sentence. The maximum pixel size to be restricted is described by the hexadecimal notation. For example, if the user wants to set an upper limit of the output image of the still image to the SVGA (Super Video Graphic Array) size, a value of 0x320 is described in maximum_horizontal_pixel_number and a value of 0x0258 is described in maximum_vertical_pixel_number.","In the still image sent by the data broadcast, it is also possible to construct in such a manner that the restriction of the resolution is not applied only to a graphics signal of characters or the like in which there is no need to restrict the resolution.","The recording_control bit is used to restrict the recording to the recording medium. When the recording_control bit is set to \u201c1\u201d, in the case of recording the still image onto the recording medium in which the receiver is built or to which the receiver is externally connected, it is necessary to make control in accordance with the bits defined by the if sentence. When the bit is set to \u201c0\u201d, the lower if sentence (if(recording_control==0)) does not appear. When the recording_prohibited bit is set to \u201c1\u201d, this means that the recording to the recording medium is inhibited. In this case, the subsequent recording_security and print_prohibited bits are invalidated even if they are set to any value.","When \u201c0\u201d is described in the record_prohibited bit, the recording is permitted and the subsequent recording_security and print_prohibited bits are validated.","When the recording_security bit is set to \u201c1\u201d, the recording can be executed only in the limited case where a security technique has been implemented in the recording medium. In this case, the recording cannot be executed to a memory device without the security technique. Specifically speaking, there is a memory stick (registered trademark) as a recording medium in which the security technique has been implemented. A memory stick of Magic Gate (registered trademark) in which the security has been implemented and a memory stick (registered trademark) in which the security has not been implemented can be given as a memory stick (registered trademark). When the recording_security bit is set to \u201c0\u201d, the security technique is not requested for the recording of the still image.","The next print_prohibited bit is a bit for restricting the print-out of the recorded image. When \u201c1\u201d is written in print_prohibited, the print-out is inhibited. When \u201c0\u201d is written, the printing is permitted. This bit means that when the recording_security bit is set to \u201c1\u201d, there is a print-out restriction in the still image recording security technique and the recording is permitted only to the device which can succeed to this bit and record. Therefore, the recording is not permitted to the recording media in which there is not a print-out restriction in the security technique. This bit is validated only when the recording security bit is set to \u201c1\u201d.","recording_constrain_bit is a bit showing whether to validate the designation of the number of permitting times of the recording or not. If recording_constrain_bit is set to \u201c1\u201d, the recording can be performed only the number of times shown by the number_of_record bits. The number of recording times can be directly defined to 8 bits of the number_of_record bits. For example, if the recording can be performed 10 times, 0\u00d70A is written. If the number of recording times is not restricted, recording_constrain_bit is set to \u201c0\u201d and an area of 8 bits of the subsequent number_of_record bits is invalidated.","When the print_control flag is set to \u201c1\u201d, the lower if sentence is validated. When it is set to \u201c0\u201d, the lower if sentence (if(print_control==1)) does not appear. When print_prohibited bit in the if sentence is set to \u201c1\u201d, it is inhibited to print the still image by the printer which is built in the receiver or the printer which is externally connected to the receiver. Only when this bit is set to \u201c0\u201d, the printing is permitted and subsequent print_constraint_bit and the number_of_print bit are validated. When print_constraint_bit is set to \u201c1\u201d, this means that a restriction regarding the printing is added. It is inhibited that the printing is executed the number of times larger than the number of times designated in subsequent number_of_print. When this bit is set to \u201c0\u201d, the printing can be permitted without limit. number_of_print indicates the limited number of times in the case of printing. For example, 0\u00d702 is written in the case of outputting two prints as a maximum value.","expiration_date_flag is a bit to restrict the term. When expiration_date_flag is set to \u201c1\u201d, the lower if sentence is validated. When it is set to \u201c0\u201d, the lower if sentence (if(expiration_flag==1)) does not appear. expiration_date of 40 bits in the if sentence is defined by ARIB STD-B10 and is the same definition as that of the Japan Standard Time which is used in JST_Time in a TOT (Time Offset Table). The Japan Standard Time (JST) is defined as \u201cUTC (Universal Time of Convention)+9\u201d. When expiration_date is defined, the printing and recording functions are validated until the defined time. When the defined time is expired, the printing and the recording must not be performed. For example, in the case where a data recording media such as an HDD or the like is built in the receiver and the contents can be held, such restriction time is validated. It is assumed that this restriction is succeeded with respect to the recording media in which the restriction time can be designated.","component_flag is a bit to designate the ES. When component_flag is set to \u201c1\u201d, the lower if sentence is validated. When it is set to \u201c0\u201d, the lower if sentence (if(component flag==1)) does not appear. This flag is not used in the case of arranging the descriptor into the PMT. It is used to designate the ES when the copyright information of the still image is sent to the ES in the case of describing the descriptor into the EIT or SDT for reservation or the like. By inserting the designated value of the ES into comonent_tag, this flag can be used for reservation of the printing or reservation of the recording of the still image.","If the still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) is certainly inserted, the sender of the contents has to insert the digital copy control descriptor (digital_copy_control_descriptor) for the copyright protection of the motion image and the still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) for the copy control of the still image, so that it is considered that such an operation becomes a large burden on the transmitting side of the digital broadcast. To reduce the burden on the transmitting side of the digital broadcast, it is demanded that the copyright of the still image is protected even in the case where the still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) is not arranged in the PMT.","Processes in the case where the still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) is not arranged in the PMT as mentioned above will now be described.","If the still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) is not arranged in the PMT, there are a case where it is defined that the printing and recording functions can be executed without limit and a case where a default value is defined by the copyright information of the digital copy control descriptor (digital_copy_control_descriptor). This selection is defined by the broadcast industrial company. For example, in the case of the BS digital broadcast, a case where the default value is defined by the copyright information of the digital copy control descriptor (digital_copy_control_descriptor) can be selected.","When the still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) is not arranged in the PMT, in the case of defining the default value by the copyright information of the digital copy control descriptor (digital_copy_control_descriptor), it is defined as follows.","For example, when the digital copy control descriptor (digital_copy_control_descriptor) is not arranged in the PMT or in the case where although the digital copy control descriptor has been arranged in the PMT, digital_recording_control_data in the descriptor is equal to \u201c00\u201d, the copyright information of the motion image indicates \u201cCopy Freely without any restricting condition\u201d. Therefore, also with respect to the printing and the recording of the still image, it is assumed that the wording is changed to a different reading \u201cthe printing and the recording can be performed without any restricting condition\u201d.","When digital_recording_control_data is equal to a value \u201c10\u201d, the copyright information of the motion image indicates \u201cCopy One Generation\u201d. Therefore, with respect to the printing, it is defined that only one sheet can be printed (print_prohibited=0, print_constraint_bit=1, number_of_record=000001) and, with respect to the recording, it is defined that the recording is possible only to the recording media in which the security has been defined (record_prohibited=0, recording_security=1, print_prohibited=0, number_of_record=1).","If digital_recording_control_data=11 and the copyright information of the motion image indicates \u201cCopy Never\u201d, it is defined that the printing is inhibited (print_prohibited=1) and the recording is inhibited (record_prohibited=1). Also in the case where digital_recording_control_data is equal to an arbitrary value, the wording is changed to a different reading \u201cthere is no restriction of image_resolution and expiration_date\u201d. Such a wording change to the different reading is one example and the industrial company can set wording change conditions with respect to each of digital_recording_control_data. The setting of the wording change can be also changed not only by the value of digital_copy_control_data of the digital copy control descriptor but also by the values of copy_control_type and API_control_data and the values of image_constraint_token, retention_mode, retention_state, and encryption_mode of the content availability descriptor.","If the case where the still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) does not exist in the PMT, EIT, and SDT, it is substituted by the CGMS of the digital copy control descriptor (digital_copy_control_descriptor). However, it is assumed that, if the still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) and the digital copy control descriptor (digital_copy_control_descriptor) do not exist in the PMT, EIT, and SDT, a default value is set to the still image copy control.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0136","num":"0135"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},"Whether or not the still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) has been arranged in the PMT is discriminated (step S).","If the still image copy control descriptor (still_image_copy_control_descriptor) has been arranged in the PMT, whether or not printing_control is equal to \u201c1\u201d is discriminated (step S).
