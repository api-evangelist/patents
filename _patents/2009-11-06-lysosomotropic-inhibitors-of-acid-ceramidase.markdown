No. 61\/111,852, filed Nov. 6, 2008, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This presently disclosed subject matter was made with U.S. Government support under Grant No. P01 CA097132 awarded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute. Thus, the U.S. Government has certain rights in the presently disclosed subject matter.","The presently disclosed subject matter relates to amphiphilic lysosomotropic acid ceramidase inhibitors. In some embodiments, the inhibitors do not induce permanent lysosomal destabilization or proteolytic degradation of acid ceramidase. The inhibitors include N-(\u03c9-aminoacyl)aminophenylalcohols as well as aminoester prodrugs of N-acylaminophenyl alcohols. The inhibitors can be used to treat and\/or prevent diseases related to undesirable ceramidase and ceramidase-related activities, including cancer and other proliferative diseases.","The stimulus-controlled pathways of sphingolipid metabolism provide a rich network of bioactive molecules with pivotal roles in the regulation of diverse cell functions. Sphingolipid metabolites, namely ceramide (Cer) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), are increasingly being recognized for their role as signaling molecules involved in regulation of survival, proliferation and cell death. In particular, the cellular balance between Cer and S1P seems to play a role in a cell's decision to either undergo apoptosis or proliferate, two events which are implicated in tumor development and growth. Whereas Cer possesses pro-apoptotic capacity in many cell types, S1P acts as a counter player able to induce cell proliferation and protect cells from undergoing apoptosis. Therefore, tipping the balance in favor of Cer production, i.e., by inhibiting ceramidase (CDase) or sphingosine kinase (SK) activities has potential to support its pro-apoptotic action and represents a promising rational approach to effective cancer therapy. See Ogretmen and Hannun, 4, 604-616 (2004); and Huwiler and Zanaemeister-Wittke, 63, 150-159 (2007).","Acid ceramidase (ACDase or AC), a lysosomal enzyme, catabolizes Cer into sphingosine (Sph), a substrate for SK, and free fatty acids at an optimal pH of approximately 4.5, distinguishing it from other CDases. Sph released by the action of ACDase can serve as a substrate for SK to form S1P or as a substrate for ceramide synthases to resynthesize new Cers. See Bielawska et al., 16, 1032-1045 (2008). ACDase represents a new target for cancer therapy because of its role in regulating the Cer-Sph-S1P inter-metabolism. Levels of ACDase have been shown to be elevated in many tumor cell lines. See Elojeimy et al., 15, 1259-1263 (2007). Inhibition of ACDase activity leads to elevation of intracellular C-, C, and C-Cers, decrease of Sph and S1P, and stimulation of apoptotic cell death. See Bielawska et al., 16, 1032-1045 (2008). Thus, ACDase has become a target in cancer therapy, and its inhibitors act as chemotherapeutic agents on several types of cancers. See Liu et al., 13, 2293-2298 (2008); and Szulc et al., 16, 1015-1031 (2008).","Accordingly, there is an ongoing need for novel ACDase inhibitors, ideally having one or more of the following properties: easily delivered to cells, accumulate preferentially in the lysosomal compartment where ACDase is present, and do not cause permanent damage to the lysosomal compartment.","The presently disclosed subject matter provides, in some embodiments, a compound for inhibiting acid ceramidase wherein the inhibiting can be free of permanent lysosomal destabilization and\/or proteolytic degradation of the acid ceramidase, wherein the compound has a structure of Formula (Ia):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"24.30mm","wi":"61.81mm","file":"US08697379-20140415-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"n is an integer from 0 to 13;","Ris selected from the group comprising NH, NHR, NRR, and N-heterocycle;","Ris selected from the group comprising H and alkyl;","Ris selected from the group comprising H, OH, NO, NHand NHR;","Ris selected from the group comprising H, CH, CHOH, and CHO\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014CH(R)NRR;","Ris selected from the group comprising H, OH, \u2550O, and OC(\u2550O)CH(R)NRR","each R, R, and Ris independently selected from the group comprising H, alkyl, aralkyl, and aryl;","Ris C(\u2550O)\u2014(CH)R, wherein m is an integer from 5 to 10;","Ris H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, or heterocycle;","X is selected from the group comprising O, NH, and S; and","Y is CHor NH;","or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.","In some embodiments, X is O.

Lysomotropic Acid Ceramidase Inhibitors","Ceramides are known to regulate anti-proliferative responses, such as apoptosis, growth arrest, differentiation, and senescence in various human cancer cell lines. Many important biological targets and events related to ceramide actions in cells have been identified, namely, activation of phosphatases, kinases, and caspases; inhibition of the telomerase enzyme complex; induction of the transmembrane signaling pathways and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Among the shortcomings of the use of ceramides as perspective anticancer agents are very low water solubility, low cellular uptake, uncontrolled delivery, release, and intracellular targeting. Ceramidase is an enzyme which hydrolyzes ceramide and decreases its level in cells. Inhibition of ceramidase increases the level of endogenous ceramide and inhibitors of this enzyme are exploited as candidates for drug discovery.","The family of ceramidases includes acid, neutral, and alkaline species See Koch et al., 271, 33110-33115 (1996); E I Bawab et al., 274, 27948-27955 (1999); and Mao et al., 276, 26577-26588 (2001). Human acid ceramidase maps to 8p22, which is frequently altered in prostate cancer (PCa). This enzyme catalyses the hydrolysis of ceramide to sphingosine and free fatty acids, the overall effect of which is downregulation of ceramide signaling (i.e., decreased apoptosis) and increased pools of sphingosine, which can be phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase to generate S1P. S1P interacts with the endothelial differentiation gene family (Edg\/S1P receptors) to promote endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. Thus, a cell (e.g., a tumor cell) that over-expresses ceramidase can generate an anti-apoptotic phenotype and a potential increase in angiogenesis in its microenvironment.","The PCa cell lines DU145, PC3, and LNCaP all show elevated levels of ceramidase mRNA by Northern blotting. Prostate tumors, obtained from radical prostatectomies, demonstrated that 4.1.6% had increased levels of acid ceramidase mRNA, 55.5% had no change, and 2.7% had a decrease in acid ceramidase mRNA when analyzed for acid ceramidase expression by a competitive PCR approach. Thus, a significant fraction of tumors in prostate cancer have the potential to assume an anti-apoptotic phenotype.","In most cancer cells, including PCa cells, ceramide causes activation of caspases, DNA fragmentation, and other characteristics and hallmarks of apoptosis, induction of the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK\/JNK), inhibition of phospholipase D, dephosphorylation and inactivation of protein kinase C (PKC), enhanced release of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, release of cytochrome c, and activation of PP1, which dephosphorylates SR proteins leading to a more pro-apoptotic phenotype.","Mechanistically, a coordinated picture of cell growth regulation involving ceramide and other key regulators of cell cycle progression and apoptosis is emerging. Thus, the formation of ceramide in response to TNF and other, but not all, inducers requires activation of upstream caspases (e.g., caspase 8), which are inhibited by YVAD and by Crm A. However, inhibitors of downstream caspases fail to prevent ceramide formation and yet ceramide activates downstream caspases (e.g., caspase 3) but not upstream caspases. Moreover, the ability of ceramide to induce apoptosis is blocked by inhibitors of the executioner caspases but not effector caspases placing ceramide formation between the two sets of enzymes. Also, studies with Bcl-2 show that Bcl-2 is downstream of ceramide in the same pathway. Thus, ceramide regulates phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and the action of ceramide on cell death is inhibited by Bcl-2 over expression.","In all these actions, short chain ceramides (C-C) can exhibit a level of potency consistent with levels of endogenous ceramides (i.e., long-chain ceramides, C-C). The action of ceramide analogs can exhibit significant specificity. For, example, the closely related neutral lipid, diacylglycerol (DAG), not only does not mimic the action of ceramide, but more often antagonizes it. Dihydroceramide, which is the metabolic precursor to ceramide and differs from it only in that it lacks the 4-5 trans double bond, exhibits no activity in cellular studies, although it shows similar levels of uptake. See Bielawska et al., 268, 26226-26232 (1993); and Bielawska et al., 267, 18493-18497 (1992).","In contrast, short chain ceramides can be poor effectors of other key actions associated with TNF and other inducers of ceramide formation. Notably, ceramide is not active in inducing NF-\u03baB, a transcription factor that plays a role in the inflammatory and anti-apoptotic function of TNF. Also, ceramide is a poor activator of erk members of the MAP kinase family, especially when compared with sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate. This restricted action of short chain ceramides to a subset of biochemical targets in cytokine responses provides further impetus to the emerging hypothesis of a more specific function for ceramide in the regulation of apoptosis in cancer.","Multiple lines of evidence point to a role for ceramide in mediating Fas-induced apoptosis. First, ceramide generation has been demonstrated to be an integral part of Fas-induced apoptosis. See Cremesti et al., 276, 23954-23961 (2001). Second, Fas activation has been shown to activate acid sphingomyelinase (ASmase), which was demonstrated to be involved in propagation of Fas-generated apoptotic signaling. See Raisova et al., 473, 27-32 (2000). Third, Fas-induced ceramide formation acts in conjunction with caspase activation and is not a consequence of apoptosis. See Tepper et al., J. Bio. Chem., 272, 24308-24312 (1997). Fourth, Fas-resistant cells demonstrate insignificant changes in ceramide levels yet have normal receptor expression and intact downstream signaling. See Tepper et al., 92, 8443-8447 (1995). Fifth, a role for ceramide synthesis has also been established in Fas-induced apoptosis (see Chalfant et al., J. Bio. Chem., 276, 44848-44855 (2001)) suggesting two possible \u201cpools\u201d of ceramide can affect Fas signal transduction. Sixth, acid sphingomyelinase null hepatocytes are insensitive to J02-induced capping but are sensitized with a 25 nM dose of C-ceramide.","Although not necessarily directly causative for prostate cancer development, acid ceramidase elevation in 41% of human tumors (60% of Gleeson grade 7 and only 38% of grade 6 tumors) would suggest that its expression provides a selective advantage for tumor growth. The mechanism is likely manifested in two ways. First, reduced levels of ceramide have an anti-apoptotic effect and downregulation of apoptosis is clearly a hallmark of some cancer, including the prostate. Second, S1P production, via increased sphingosine kinase, has an angiogenic and growth effect as well as promoting endothelial cell migration in the prostate.","The presently disclosed subject matter relates in some embodiments to amphiphilic, lysosomotropic ACDase inhibitors and related prodrugs for targeting cellular ACDase.

For review, see Hannun et al., 10, 73-80 (2000); and Mathias et al., 335, 465-480 (1998). Several extracellular agents and stress stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), chemotherapeutic agents, and heat are known to cause ceramide accumulation. One approach to cause accumulation of ceramide is accomplished by regulating the activities of enzymes such as ceramidase which is involved in the metabolism of ceramide. The changes in the ceramide concentration are sufficient to reproduce many of the biological effects of cytokines and stress inducers that are coupled to ceramide accumulation. The accumulation of ceramides also reproduces many of the features of cell senescence. In many cell types, ceramides cause cell differentiation, both morphologically and through the activation of biochemical programs of cell differentiation. Ceramide also induces apoptosis in most cancer cells, which can be accompanied by cell-cycle arrest. Thus, according to the presently disclosed subject matter, modulation of the levels of ceramide or sphingosine through the methods and compositions of the presently disclosed subject matter can bring about treatment and prevention of diseases that are related to stress response and apoptosis. Several exemplary diseases and disorders are disclosed below which can be treated or prevented by the methods of the presently disclosed subject matter.","Without being bound by any particular theory or theories, compounds of the presently disclosed subject matter can act as a modulator of one or more ceramidases (e.g., ACDase) or a ceramidase-related activity present in a cell or in an organelle of a cell. In some embodiments, the organelle is a positively charged organelle, such as but not limited to a lysosome. Regardless of the underlying mechanisms, the presently disclosed compounds can induce cell death.","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a method of increasing the level of ceramide in a cell comprising contacting the cell with a compound that inhibits the ceramidase activity.","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a method of inhibiting the formation of sphingosine in a cell comprising contacting the cell with a compound that inhibits the ceramidase activity such that the amount of sphingosine formed as a result of conversion from ceramide is reduced.","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a method of increasing the intracellular levels of a ceramide in a subject comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound that inhibits the ceramidase activity of the ceramidase protein in the subject's cells.","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a method of inhibiting the intracellular formation of sphingosine in a subject comprising administering to said subject an effective amount of compound that inhibits the ceramidase activity of the ceramidase protein in the subject's cells.","In some embodiments, the composition that inhibits ceramidase function is administered to a subject therapeutically and\/or prophylactically: (1) in diseases or disorders involving an increased (relative to normal or desired) level of ceramidase protein or function, for example, in subjects where ceramidase protein is biologically overactive or overexpressed; or (2) in diseases or disorders wherein in vitro (or in vivo) assays indicate the utility of ceramidase inhibitor administration. The increased level in ceramidase protein or function can be readily detected, e.g., by obtaining a tissue sample from a subject (e.g., from biopsy tissue) and assaying it in vitro for RNA or protein levels, structure and\/or activity of the expressed ceramidase RNA or protein. Many methods standard in the art can be thus employed, including but not limited to ceramidase enzyme assays, immunoassays to detect and\/or visualize ceramidase protein (e.g., Western blot, immunoprecipitation followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunocytochemistry, etc.) and\/or hybridization assays to detect ceramidase expression by detecting and\/or visualizing ceramidase mRNA (e.g., Northern assays, dot blots, in situ hybridization, etc.), etc.","According to the presently disclosed subject matter, disorders involving cell hyperproliferation and\/or dysfunctional sphingolipid signal transduction are treated and\/or prevented by administration of a composition that inhibits ceramidase function to a subject.

One of the adverse reactions to vascular intervention include endothelial and smooth muscle cell proliferation which can lead to hyperplasia, or more specifically, restenosis which is the re-clogging of the artery, occlusion of blood vessels, reperfusion injury, platelet aggregation, and calcification. In this model, an injurious stimulus induces expression of growth-stimulatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor. See Libby et al., 86, III47-III52 (1992). There is evidence which shows that ceramide inhibit the growth of endothelia and smooth muscle cells of the coronary artery.","Various therapies have been attempted to treat or prevent stenosis or restenosis. However, there remains a great need for therapies directed to the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases caused by hyperplasia of endothelia and smooth muscle cells. Since it has been shown that ceramide inhibit the growth of endothelia and smooth muscle cells of the coronary artery, it therefore can be desirable to raise the level of ceramide for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Recently, Kester and co-workers showed that ceramide used in angioplasty prevents restenosis. See Kester et al., 87, 282-288 (2000). Alternative, and more effectively, one aspect of the presently disclosed subject matter provides treatment and prevention of restenosis by adjusting the level of ceramide through administering a compound of the presently disclosed subject matter.","Accordingly, it therefore can be desirable to raise the level of ceramide for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. This can be accomplished by adjusting the intracellular level of ceramide by using the compositions and methods of the presently disclosed subject matter. The outcome of a treatment is to at least produce in a treated subject a healthful benefit, which in the case of cardiovascular diseases, includes, but is not limited to a reduced risk of re-clogging of arteries after a vascular intervention procedure and improved circulation.","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a method for preventing, treating, managing, and\/or ameliorating an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder or one or more symptoms thereof, said method comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a prophylactically and\/or therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the presently disclosed subject matter and a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of one or more immunomodulatory agents.","Interleukin-1 is a major inducer of inflammation and TNF is an important regulator of the reaction. Both cytokines can activate ceramidase, and thus inhibiting the activity of ceramidase can result in an anti-inflammatory effect. This can involve the prevention of the formation of sphingosine and sphingosine phosphate which have pro-inflammatory effects. Also, inhibition of ceramidase can prevent the hyperproliferation of immune cells that are important for inflammation. There is evidence which suggests that an increase in ceramide and a decrease in sphingosine lead to a decrease in sphingosine phosphate. Preliminary data show that in mouse fibroblast cells, L929, TNF-\u03b1 increases ceramide levels and leads to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release from these cells. The release of PGE2 is also shown to be inhibited by D-erythro-2-(N-myristolyamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol), D-MAPP, which is an inhibitor of one of the ceramidase. This observation might be important for inhibiting inflammatory reactions that occur in conditions, such as but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, it is possible to treat and\/or prevent inflammation by regulating the level of cellular ceramide using the method of the presently disclosed subject matter. As discussed above, ceramide level can be increased by administering compounds of the presently disclosed subject matter that can inhibit mitochondrial ceramidase.","Examples of autoimmune disorders include, but are not limited to, alopecia greata, ankylosing spondylitis, antiphospholipid syndrome, autoimmune Addison's disease, autoimmune diseases of the adrenal gland, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune oophoritis and orchitis, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, Behcet's disease, bullous pemphigoid, cardiomyopathy, celiac sprue-dermatitis, chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Churg-Strauss syndrome, cicatrical pemphigoid, CREST syndrome, cold agglutinin disease, Crohn's disease, discoid lupus, essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, fibromyalgia-fibromyositis, glomerulonephritis, Graves' disease, Guillain-Barre, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), IgA neuropathy, juvenile arthritis, lichen planus, lupus erthematosus, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, mixed connective tissue disease, multiple sclerosis, type 1 or immune-mediated diabetes mellitus, myasthenia gravis, pemphigus vulgaris, pernicious anemia, polyarteritis nodosa, polychrondritis, polyglandular syndromes, polymyalgia rheumatica, polymyositis and dermatomyositis, primary agammaglobulinemia, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Raynauld's phenomenon, Reiter's syndrome, Rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, stiff-man syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, lupus erythematosus, takayasu arteritis, temporal arteristis\/giant cell arteritis, ulcerative colitis, uveitis, vasculitides such as dermatitis herpetiformis vasculitis, vitiligo, and Wegener's granulomatosis.

Some autoimmune disorders are associated with an inflammatory condition. Thus, there is overlap between what is considered an autoimmune disorder and an inflammatory disorder. Therefore, some autoimmune disorders can also be characterized as inflammatory disorders.","The presently disclosed subject matter provides methods of preventing, treating, managing, and\/or ameliorating an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder and\/or one or more symptoms thereof, said methods comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a compound of the presently disclosed subject matter and one or more immunomodulatory agents.

Non-limiting examples of anti-inflammatory agents include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-agonists, anticholingeric agents, and methyl xanthines. Examples of NSAIDs include, but are not limited to, aspirin, ibuprofen, celecoxib (CELEBREX\u2122), diclofenac (VOLTAREN\u2122), etodolac (LODINE\u2122), fenoprofen (NALFON\u2122), indomethacin (INDOCIN\u2122), ketoralac (TORADOL\u2122), oxaprozin (DAYPRO\u2122), nabumentone (RELAFEN\u2122), sulindac (CLINORIL\u2122), tolmentin (TOLECTIN\u2122), rofecoxib (VIOXX\u2122), naproxen (ALEVE\u2122, NAPROSYN\u2122), ketoprofen (ACTRON\u2122) and nabumetone (RELAFEN\u2122). Such NSAIDs function by inhibiting a cyclooxygenase enzyme (e.g., COX-1 and\/or COX-2). Examples of steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs include, but are not limited to, glucocorticoids, dexamethasone (DECADRON\u2122), cortisone, hydrocortisone, prednisone (DELTASONE\u2122), prednisolone, triamcinolone, azulfidine, and eicosanoids such as prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes.","The presently disclosed subject matter also relates to the treatment of disorders involving deficient cell proliferation (growth) and\/or in which cell proliferation is otherwise desired (e.g., degenerative disorders, growth deficiencies, lesions, physical trauma) by administering compounds that agonize, (promote) ceramidase function (e.g., ceramide-1-phosphate and sphingosine-1-phosphate). Other disorders that can benefit from activation of ceramidase are neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), and disorders of aging such as immune dysfunction.","As discussed above, like treatment of neoplastic conditions, successful treatment of cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, or the above-mentioned diseases can be brought about by techniques which serve to decrease ceramidase activity.","General techniques that can be employed for the determination of effective doses and administration of such compounds are known to the skilled artisan. Any technique which serves to selectively administer chemicals to a cell population of interest can be used, for example, by using a delivery complex. Such a delivery complex can comprise an appropriate chemical and a targeting agent. Such targeting agents can comprise, for example, sterols, lipids, viruses or target cell specific binding agents.","V. Pharmaceutical Preparation and Methods of Administration","The compounds described herein can be administered to a subject at therapeutically effective doses to treat or prevent diseases and disorder discussed above. A therapeutically effective dose refers to that amount of a compound sufficient to result in a healthful benefit in the treated subject. See the  (53ed., 1999).","The term \u201csubject\u201d as used herein refers to a member of any invertebrate or vertebrate species. The methods of the presently disclosed subject matter are particularly useful for warm-blooded vertebrates. Thus, the presently disclosed subject matter concerns mammals and birds. More particularly provided is the treatment of mammals such as humans, as well as those mammals of importance due to being endangered (such as Siberian tigers), of economic importance (animals raised on farms for consumption by humans) and\/or social importance (animals kept as pets or in zoos) to humans, for instance, carnivores other than humans (such as cats and dogs), swine (pigs, hogs, and wild boars), ruminants (such as cattle, oxen, sheep, giraffes, deer, goats, bison, and camels), and horses. Also provided is the use of the disclosed methods and compositions on birds, including those kinds of birds that are endangered, kept in zoos or as pets, as well as fowl, and more particularly domesticated fowl, e.g., poultry, such as turkeys, chickens, ducks, geese, guinea fowl, and the like, as they are also of economic importance to humans.","Thus, the subject to which a compound of the presently disclosed subject matter is administered is in some embodiments an animal, including but not limited to mammal such as non-primate (e.g., cows, pigs, horses, chickens, cats, dogs, rats, etc.), or a primate (e.g., a monkey such as acynomolgous monkey or a human). In some embodiments, the subject is a human. The composition of the presently disclosed subject matter can be utilized for the prevention of a variety of cancers, e.g., in individuals who are predisposed as a result of familial history or in individuals with an enhanced risk to cancer due to environmental factors.","The methods and compositions of the presently disclosed subject matter can be used in subjects who are treatment na\u00efve and\/or in subjects who have previously received and\/or are currently receiving treatment with other pharmaceutical agents or combinations, including but not limited to anti-cancer agents. Other subjects can include subjects that have metastasis or no metastasis.","The methods and compositions of the presently disclosed subject matter are useful not only in untreated subjects but are also useful in the treatment of subjects partially or completely un-responsive to other treatments. In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides methods and compositions useful for the treatment of diseases or disorders in subjects that have been shown to be or might be refractory or non-responsive to therapies comprising the administration of other agents.","An absence or decreased level in ceramide level or function can be readily detected, e.g., by obtaining a subject tissue sample (e.g., from biopsy tissue) and assaying it in vitro for ceramide.","V.A. Effective Dose","Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of compositions can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals (e.g., for determining the LD(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population)). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD\/ED. In some embodiments, compounds that exhibit large therapeutic indices are employed. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects can be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.","The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies in some embodiments within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. For example, the dosage can range from in some embodiments 10 nM to 100 \u03bcM and in some embodiments 1 to 10 \u03bcM or greater. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any composition used in the methods of the presently disclosed subject matter, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC(i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma can be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.","Suitable daily doses for the treatment or prevention of a disorder described herein can be readily determined by those skilled in the art. A recommended dose of a composition of the presently disclosed subject matter is from about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg per day, given as a single once-a-day dose in the morning or as divided doses throughout the day. In some embodiments, a daily dose is from about 2 mg to about 25 mg per day and in some embodiments a daily dose is from about 5 mg to about 10 mg per day.","The anti-cancer activity of the methods and compositions used in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter also can be determined by using various experimental animal models of such as cancer animal models such as scid mouse model or nude mice with human tumor grafts known in the art and described in Yamanaka et al. (45, 507-514 (2001)).","In some embodiments, the methods and compositions of the presently disclosed subject matter are tested in vitro, and then in vivo, for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in a subject (e.g., a human). For example, in vitro assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific therapeutic protocol is indicated, include in vitro cell culture assays in which a subject tissue sample is grown in culture, and exposed to or otherwise administered a protocol, and the effect of such protocol upon the tissue sample is observed. A lower level of proliferation or survival of the contacted cells indicates that the composition is effective to treat the condition in the subject. Alternatively, instead of culturing cells from a subject, compositions can be screened using cells of a tumor or malignant cell line. Many assays standard in the art can be used to assess such survival and\/or growth; for example, cell proliferation can be assayed by measuring H-thymidine incorporation, by direct cell count, by detecting changes in transcriptional activity of known genes such as proto-oncogenes (e.g., fos, myc) or cell cycle markers; cell viability can be assessed by trypan blue staining, differentiation can be assessed visually based on changes in morphology, etc.","Prior to testing in humans, compositions for use in the presently disclosed methods can be tested in suitable animal model systems, including but not limited to in rats, mice, chicken, cows, monkeys, rabbits, etc. The principle animal models for cancer known in the art and widely used include mice, as described in Hann et al. (13, 778-784 (2001)), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Further, any assays known to those skilled in the art can be used to evaluate the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic utility of the methods and compositions disclosed herein for treatment, prophylaxis, management, and\/or amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with a disease or disorder as described herein.","Efficacy in treating inflammatory disorders can be demonstrated by detecting the ability of the compounds of the presently disclosed subject matter or a composition of the presently disclosed subject matter to reduce or inhibit inflammation in an animal and\/or to ameliorate or alleviate one or more symptoms associated with an inflammatory disorder. The treatment is considered therapeutic if there is, for example, a reduction is in inflammation and\/or amelioration of one or more symptoms following administration of the compound or composition of the presently disclosed subject matter.","V.B.

In some embodiments, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans.","The term \u201ccarrier\u201d refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water is an exemplary carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations, and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in (1990). Such compositions will contain in some embodiments a therapeutically effective amount of the ACDase inhibitor or related prodrug in purified form, together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the subject. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.","In some embodiments, the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition can also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lidocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline.

Formula: CHNO, MS 424.15 [M+].","As shown in , the presently disclosed prodrug compounds can be prepared from B13 (or a primary or secondary alcohol-containing analog thereof) and N,N-dimethyl glycine (or another suitable carboxylic acid). For example when B13 and N,N-dimethyl glycine are mixed under suitable conditions for esterification (e.g., with carbonyldiimidazole or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)) in a 1:1 ratio, a prodrug comprising a single ester (formed at the primary alcohol) can be prepared. When B13 and N,N-dimethyl glycine are mixed in the presence of a molar excess (e.g., greater than 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more) of the carboxylic acid, the diester can be formed (i.e., esters are formed at the primary and secondary alcohols). Using a suitable protection strategy for the primary alcohol of B13, mono-ester prodrugs wherein the secondary alcohol are esterified can be obtained. For example, the primary alcohol of B13 can be protected as a tetrahydropyranyl (THP) ether by reacting B13 with dihydropyran in the presence of an acid. Then the secondary alcohol of B13 can be esterified by reaction with N,N-dimethyl glycine. Finally, the THP ether can be removed treating the molecule with pyridimium p-toluenesulfonate (PPTS).

Also, effects of these compounds on ACDase degradation and on lysosomal stability were investigated.","The in vitro assay was carried out according to a previously described procedure (see Zeidan et al., 281, 24695-24703 (2006)) using [H] C-Cer as a substrate and MCF-7 cell lysate as an enzymatic source. Briefly, cell lysate was prepared under acidic conditions (i.e., pH 4.5, 50 mM sodium acetate, 5 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM EDTA and 0.5% Triton X-100), and protein level was determined using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, Ill., United States of America). ACDase activity was determined based on the amount of the released radioactive palmitic acid counted by LS 6500 multi-purpose scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, Calif., United States of America). The results are presented as percentage of control.","Effects of the inhibitors on the cellular activity of ACDase were determined using cell lysate from the cultured cells previously treated with increasing concentrations of drugs. For this type of assay, the drugs are allowed to enter the cell for a specific time, then cell lysates were prepared by homogenization and assays performed as described above. Effects on endogenous Cers and Sph were determined using LC-MS\/MS analysis as previously described. See Bielawska et al., 16, 1032-1045 (2008); and Bielawska et al., 39, 82-91 (2006). Final results were expressed as the level of the particular sphingolipid (SPL)\/phospholipids (Pi) determined from the Bligh and Dyer lipid extract and expressed as SPLs\/Pi (pmol\/nmol).","Effects of Class E inhibitors on ACDase protein degradation were determined by Western blotting as previously described. See Bielawska et al., 16, 1032-1045 (2008); Liu et al., 13, 2293-2298 (2008); and Holman et al., 61, 231-242 (2008). Lysosomal stability and mitochondrial stability were determined by FACS analysis using LYSOTRACKER\u2122 red (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg., United States of America) or JC-1 mitochondrial dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg., United States of America) as previously described. See Holman et al., 61, 231-242 (2008).","The inhibitory effects of the Class E compounds compared to the action of B13 are shown in . Results at 50 \u03bcM inhibitor concentration showed the highest inhibitory effect of unmodified B13 (\u02dc90% inhibition). Under identical conditions, most of the Class E compounds acted as potent inhibitors of ACDase, with LCL464 showing the highest effect, 55% of inhibition.","As shown in , at the cellular level (2 h of treatment), all tested compounds showed higher potential ACDase inhibition compared to their extracellular in vitro data. The highest inhibition (65%) was detected for LCL464. A previously studied, non-Class E compound, LCL204, i.e., (1R,2R)-15 D-threo-2-N-tetradecylamino-1-(4\u2032-nitrophenyl)-1,3-propandiol, caused about 35% inhibition. Interestingly, B13, the most potent inhibitor in vitro, did not show any ACDase inhibition at the cellular level. Based on both the in vitro and the cellular level results for ACDase inhibition, LCL464 appears to be the most potent inhibitor of ACDase of the Class E analogs tested.","To connect the observed effects of the inhibitors on the cellular activity of ACDase to the cellular level of sphingolipids, the effects on levels of endogenous Cer species (C-Cer) and Sph were investigated further. The results showed that 10 \u03bcM concentrations of the Class E compounds after 2 h of treatment efficiently decreased (50%-70%) levels of cellular Sph. See . The compounds did not effectively change the level of total Cer (98%-104%), however they did specifically increase levels of C-Cer to 233%-400% and of C-Cer up to 155%. See . This characteristic early effect on C-Cer\u2014Sph balance was also observed for 50 \u03bcM LCL464. See . The effect on C-Cer was higher (\u02dc240%) as compared to the 10 \u03bcM treatment. LCL464 also caused a time dependent and very efficient elevation of C-Cer levels, reaching \u02dc900% of control at 24 hours. This effect on C-Cer was observed for concentrations above 20 \u03bcM LCL464. See . Interestingly, changes in Sph and C-Cer levels were correlated, however with large variations in SD (higher increase in C-Cer corresponded to a lower level of Sph and vice versa). Without being bound to any one theory, these results appear to indicate an additional activatory effect of LCL464 on ceramide synthase 1 (CerS1). Both observed activities, an early inhibition of ACDase specific to C\/C-Cers followed by the activation of ceramidase synthase 1 (CerS1), can cause elevation of the pro-apoptotic C-, C- and C-Cers.","The effects of the Class E inhibitors on ACDase expression were determined by Western blot. See . 10 \u03bcM concentrations of Class E compounds did not degrade ACDase, as shown for 5 hr treatments. This was in contrast to previously studied ACDase inhibitors, such as LCL204. See Bielawska et al., 16, 1032-1045 (2008). Furthermore, even when the concentration of the Class E compounds was increased up to 50 \u03bcM, they still did not show any effects on ACDase degradation.","As shown in , 10 \u03bcM LCL464 did not cause lysosomal dysfunction. This result is also observed for B13. Although, as noticed for the higher concentration, 30 \u03bcM LCL464 has potential to destabilize the lysosomes (40%\/1 h), this dysfunction had recovered by the extended incubation time (61%\/5 h, >100%\/24 h). Permanent destabilization of the lysosomes was only observed for previously studied non-Class E inhibitors, like LCL204 (lowering lysosomal stability to \u02dc90% as compared to the control). See Bielawska et al., 16, 1032-1045 (2008).","The Class E prodrugs were evaluated as inhibitors of ACDase in vitro and at the cellular level as described hereinabove in Example 4. As shown in , LCL521 inhibited acid ceramidase in vitro. At the cellular level, LCL521 appeared to cause a decrease in the cellular levels of the alpha-subunit of ACDase, somewhat similar to LCL204, while LCL522 and B13 did not. See . LCL521 also appears to be delivered to the lysosomes, while LCL522 was not. See . LCL521 decreased the cellular level of Sph and S1P and increased levels of pro-apoptotic C16- and C18-Cer, as well as total ceramide. See . In contrast, LCL522 behaved similarly to B13 with regard to regulation of cellular sphingolipids. See . Without being bound to any one theory, the data suggests that LCL522 breaks down under the various assay conditions to form B13, while LCL521 is slowly metabolized to the mono-ester LCL581 and B13.","Class E compounds were administrated to cells capable of undergoing differentiation in amounts effective to induce differentiation of several cancer cell lines: MCF-7, PPC1, SCC14a, A549, and J3DR4. Cell viability assay was performed by the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cells were seeded into 96-well plate overnight before treatment with increasing drug concentrations (0-100 \u03bcM) as previously described. See Hansen et al., 119, 203-210 (1989). After treatment, plates were incubated for an additional period of time (24-72 h). Changes in cell numbers were determined and expressed as a percentage of the untreated controls.","The results indicate that the presently disclosed compounds significantly decrease the number of viable cancer cells at a low micromolar range. Concentration dependent inhibitory effects in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells after 48 hours of treatment with Class E inhibitors are shown in . The ICprofile (50% of surviving cells as compared to the control) of the Class E compounds is shown in . Almost all Class E compounds, except for LCL449, showed increased inhibitory effects compared to those of B13. The most active analogs from Class E were LCL463, followed by LCL464. The ICvalues of these analogs ranged from \u02dc6.0-15.5 \u03bcM, except for LCL449 (49.9 \u03bcM). Results for B13 showed the ICvalue of 20.0 \u03bcM.","The anti-proliferate effect of LCL464 was also investigated in several additional types of tumor cell lines: SCC14a (human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma) Du145 (human prostate carcinoma, epithelial-like cell lines) J3DR4 (human melanoma), A549 (human alveolar epithelial cell), and PPC1 (human prostate carcinoma).  shows the inhibitory effects of LCL464 in the additional cancer cell lines as compared to its effect in the MCF-7 cells after 48 and 72 hour treatments. LCL464 showed the highest effect on growth of MCF-7 cells with the ICvalues of 10.2 \u03bcM and 7.2 \u03bcM, respectively, for 48 and 72 hr treatments. Coincidentally, these effects corresponded to the levels of ACDase with the MCF-7 cells having the highest ACDase protein expression evaluated against the same amount of total protein (data not shown).","The apoptotic effect of LCL464 was also investigated in MCF-7 cells via its effect on Caspase 3\/7, a group of cysteine proteases that mediate execution. This can be activated by apoptotic signals from both death receptor and intracellular\/mitochondrial pathways. Briefly, MCF-7 cells were seeded at a density of 5\u00d710\/50 \u03bcL\/well overnight in 96 well plates. Then cells were treated with vehicle or diluted LCL464. After 8 and 24 hours incubation, Caspase 3\/7 activities were measured using the Apo-ONE Homogeneous Caspase 3\/7 Assay Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, Wis., United States of America). LCL464 causes a dose dependent induction of apoptosis following 24 h incubation, causing increase of Caspase 3\/7 activities to 140% and 200% for 10 \u03bcM and 20 \u03bcM, respectively. See .","Class E prodrugs were administrated to MCF-7 cells capable of undergoing differentiation in amounts effective to induce differentiation. Cell viability assay was performed by the MTT assay. Cells were seeded into 96-well plate overnight before treatment with increasing drug concentrations (0-100 \u03bcM) as previously described. See Hansen et al., 119, 203-210 (1989). After treatment, plates were incubated for an additional period of time (24-72 h). Changes in cell numbers were determined and expressed as a percentage of the untreated controls. 50% inhibitory concentrations were determined by comparing cell number changes in prodrug treated samples to control samples.","Dose-dependent cell viability results for LCL521 are shown in . Table 1, below, shows the time dependent ICs (24, 48, or 72 hour) of LCL521 measured via the MTT cell viability assay in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. Also shown in Table 1 is the 24 hour ICfor LCL522. For comparison, the time dependent ICs for B13 are provided. Both LCL521 and LCL522 showed increased inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells as compared to B13 after 24 hours. Thus, based on these preliminary results, it appears that the presently disclosed prodrug approach can increase the therapeutic index of ACDase inhititors. In particular, it appears that the prodrug approach of LCL522 results in increased B13 delivery and potency.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0432","num":"0431"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Time Dependent ICs of Class E Prodrugs."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["compound","IC(\u03bcM)","IC(\u03bcM)","IC(\u03bcM)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["B13","60.8","25.8","23.9"]},{"entry":["LCL521","8.9","8.67","7.45"]},{"entry":["LCL522","6.5"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"It will be understood that various details of the presently disclosed subject matter may be changed without departing from the scope of the presently disclosed subject matter.
