title: Retrieving performance data from devices in a storage area network
abstract: A system and method for retrieving performance data from different devices in a storage area network (SAN) use a performance interface to communicate with different types of SAN devices in a heterogeneous SAN environment. The performance interface instructs a device plug-in (DPI) associated with each SAN device to retrieve performance metrics data from the corresponding SAN device. The performance interface determines a minimum polling interval and a maximum polling interval for polling each SAN device for the performance metrics data. The performance interface further provides each DPI with an address of the corresponding SAN device.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The technical field relates to storage area networks, and, in particular, to improvements in monitoring the performance of a storage area network.","A storage area network (SAN) is a network of elements including multiple servers, multiple storage devices (such as disk arrays and tape libraries), and a high-speed network of interconnecting elements (such as fiber channels, switches, hubs, and bridges) that establishes direct and indirect connections between the servers, between the storage devices, and between the servers and the storage devices.","SANs are, however, typically made of heterogeneous modules. As a result of their versatility and popularity, a number of different SAN devices exist on the market, each having its own protocols and requirements. Further, current SAN management tools are often vendor-dependent and system-dependent. Since each SAN device may be produced by a different vendor, and each SAN device may have its own proprietary communication systems and information, the management of SAN resources is a difficult task for storage administrators.","A method for using a performance interface to retrieve performance data from SAN devices in a storage area network (SAN) includes instructing a device plug-in (DPI) to retrieve performance metrics data from a corresponding SAN device, determining a minimum polling interval for polling the SAN device for the performance metrics data, determining a maximum polling interval for polling the SAN device for the performance metrics data, and collecting the performance metrics data from the DPI using the performance interface.","A system and method for retrieving performance data from different devices in a storage area network (SAN) use a performance interface to communicate effectively with different types of SAN devices in a heterogeneous SAN environment. The performance interface instructs a device plug-in (DPI) associated with each SAN device to retrieve performance metrics data from the corresponding SAN device. The performance interface determines a minimum polling interval and a maximum polling interval for polling each SAN device for the performance metrics data. The performance interface further provides each DPI with an address of the corresponding SAN device.","The performance interface may be implemented with a storage area manager (SAM) and a storage optimizer, such as the OPENVIEW\u00ae SAM and storage optimizer. The SAM supports enterprise storage utility services with integrated tools that help information technology (IT) departments reduce storage management costs, protect existing storage investments, efficiently utilize resources, and deliver guaranteed quality of service to customers, partners, and employees. The SAM enables system administrators to simplify and automate management of multivendor storage resources across disk, tape, direct-attach, and networked storage infrastructures. The SAM can also centrally manage and monitor availability, performance, usage, growth, and cost across a distributed enterprise. Further, the SAM enables system administrators to optimize resource utilization and operations, and to seamlessly integrate storage and storage services with the enterprise-wide IT service management system.","The storage optimizer may, from a single management station, monitor the performance of storage network components, including hosts, infrastructure and storage. The storage optimizer also collects data and provides a complete reporting structure for evaluating, monitoring and managing the quality and cost of IT services. System administrators can receive automatic notification of impending performance problems before the problems become serious, and can track performance of the system components over time. The storage optimizer helps system administrators predict problems and improve efficiencies while optimizing investment in networked storage. The combination of performance monitoring, historical tracking, and trend analysis makes the storage optimizer a powerful tool for analyzing and upgrading storage infrastructure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","120","130","120","130","130","120","160","130","120","130","120","120","125","130","125","120"]},"With continued reference to , the SAN  is managed by the SAN management application . The SAN management application  includes corresponding abstract data sources  for each SAN device  and a performance application . The abstract data source  may be Java code. The performance application  collects performance metrics data from the SAN devices  in the SAN . Examples of performance metrics data include a number of device write operations, read operations, and cache hits. Each abstract data source  within the SAN management application  has a one-to-one relationship with each SAN device . The abstract data source  uses the methods defined within performance interface  (shown in ) to communicate with the SAN device  through the corresponding DPI .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["130","130","140","141","142","140","130","150","150","120","150","130","140","120","120","140","170","120","110"]},"The performance interface  includes a function indicator  that instructs the DPI  to retrieve performance data from the corresponding SAN device . When the performance application  collects performance metric data from a given SAN device , the corresponding abstract data source  may make a request to the corresponding DPI . The DPI  implements the methods in the performance interface , which instructs the DPI  to retrieve the requisite performance metric data from the corresponding SAN device . The performance interface  allows the individual DPI  to utilize whatever means necessary to gather the information from the corresponding SAN device . For example, the DPI  may perform a task to collect performance data. Examples of the task include: reading log files maintained by a SAN device , navigating the structure of internal counters maintained by the SAN device , and implementing specific application programming interface (API) calls into management software for the SAN device .","The performance interface  further includes a minimum polling indicator  and a maximum polling indicator . The performance application  may periodically \u201cpoll\u201d all SAN devices  to obtain performance metric data. The minimum polling indicator  determines a minimum polling interval for polling a SAN device  for performance data. The minimum polling interval is the shortest time between performance metric collection that should occur. The minimum polling interval may vary from SAN device  to SAN device  according to the rate a SAN device  updates its performance data. The minimum polling interval may be a matter of seconds (such as for an Interconnect device) or as long as an hour (such as for a disk array device).","The maximum polling indicator  determines a maximum polling interval for polling a SAN device  for performance data. The maximum polling interval is the longest time between performance metric collection that should be allowed to occur. The maximum polling interval may vary from SAN device  to SAN device  similar to the minimum polling interval. The performance interface  determines the minimum polling interval and the maximum polling interval for each SAN device , enabling each SAN device  to be accurately polled by the performance application  at a rate between the minimum and the maximum polling intervals.","The performance interface  further includes an address indicator  that automatically provides the DPI  with the address of the SAN device . For example, if the SAN device  communicates with the corresponding DPI  through a host machine, the host machine  typically maintains the database that stores performance data for the corresponding SAN device . The performance interface  may provide the DPI  with the address on the host machine  to retrieve the performance metrics data for the corresponding SAN device . The performance application  does not need to \u201cknow\u201d whether a DPI  communicates with the corresponding SAN device  directly or through a host machine .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["120","110","140","120","310","320","140","130","120","330","140","130","120","350","130","120","120","120","170","140","360"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","120","110","400","420","418","400","402","412","414","416","410","408"]},"The memory  may include random access memory (RAM) or similar types of memory.
