title: Method for data management in a collaborative service-oriented workshop
abstract: A method for managing data in a collaborative service-oriented workshop, which is adapted to treat objects associated with data representative of real or process data, is provided to share data and resources in an architecture of a workspace. The architecture is adapted to design complex objects and manipulate information technology objects that represent data, which may be representative of a real object or a process based on metadata representing characteristic data. The metadata includes a generic part that is common to all data, a specific part that is inherent to the type of data, and links to other objects. The links make it possible to establish, at a later time, the traceability of the data, or in other words the traceability between the different data produced or used during execution of processes.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention concerns information technology architectures for collaborative work and more particularly a method for data management for a collaborative service-oriented workshop.","Optimization of the study and design phases for objects such as vehicles for the purpose of reducing the development costs and time generally necessitates the employment of a specific information technology environment.","For example, the aerodynamic study of an aircraft involves numerous specialists working on different aspects of the same data, which aspects may or may not be related to one another. These specialists generally use different information technology tools as well as different machines for execution of the processes being employed. In addition, these specialists may be situated at different geographic locations.","It is therefore proving advantageous to employ an environment based on an open architecture that permits sharing of data and information technology resources, especially calculating resources. Preferably, such an environment should be adapted to a range of heterogeneous machines and operating systems.","It is also advantageous to use an interface that it makes it possible to access separate and different existing tools. Such a common interface should be adapted in particular to manage data that have to be exchanged between these tools as well as to permit easy selection of and access to the data.","In addition, the environment preferably should permit easy adaptation to future needs, such as integration of new tools, management of new types of data and production of new types of results.","Furthermore, there exists a need for data traceability in order to determine the origin of the produced data as well as their life cycle during the different modifications and uses in calculation or other processes.","To some extent, these problems are solved independently of one another.","For example, there exist software applications such as SynfiniWay, developed by the Fujitsu Corporation (SynfiniWay and Fujitsu are trademarks), that permit optimization of the execution of tasks in a heterogeneous environment. The SynfiniWay application makes it possible in particular to virtualize the global resources and to present the applications in the form of services linked by data sequences and dependences in order to automate the information technology processes.","Furthermore, there exist script languages such as Python and Java (Python and Java are trademarks) that make it possible to automate certain tasks and to call up existing tools. Python is a high-level, interpreted and object-oriented programming language. It may be used in numerous contexts and be adapted to numerous uses by means of specialized libraries.","For its part, data traceability is generally determined by the processes that led to the data. For example, in the applications of PDM type (initials for Product Data Management in English terminology), the user must follow predetermined processes without being able to deviate from them. The origin of a datum is therefore determined by the process that made it possible to obtain the datum.","However, a centralized and optimized environment does not exist for the study and design of systems in a heterogeneous open collaborative environment.","The invention makes it possible to solve at least one of the problems mentioned in the foregoing.","The object of the invention is therefore a method for data management in a collaborative service-oriented workshop, adapted to treat objects associated with data representative of real or process data, this method comprising the following steps:","accessing at least one datum representative of real or process data, stored in memory in a remote device;","extracting at least one information item characteristic of the said at least one datum according to a predetermined parameter; and","storing in memory the said at least one characteristic information item and a link to the said at least one datum in an object associated with the said at least one datum, the said object being stored in memory in a centralized storage zone.","The method according to the invention therefore makes it possible to manage data independently of their inherent characteristics, such as their nature, their storage location and their size, to permit global management thereof.","Advantageously, the method additionally comprises a step of receiving at least one complementary information item, the said complementary information item being stored in memory in the said object associated with the said at least one datum, to characterize the said at least one datum.","According to a particular embodiment, the said at least one characteristic information item comprises at least one attribute common to a plurality of data.","According to yet another particular embodiment, the said at least one characteristic information item comprises at least one attribute specific to the said at least one datum.","Preferably, the said object additionally comprises a link to a second object, separate from the said object known as first object, making it possible to link the objects with one another and in this way to offer the means for following a gradual relationship among a plurality of objects.","Advantageously, the method additionally comprises a step of determining the consistency of the said first object according to the said link to the said second object, making it possible to characterize an object according to predetermined rules.","According to a particular embodiment, the method additionally comprises the following steps:","selecting at least one object associated with data representative of a process;","determining, in the said object associated with data representative of the said process, a link to an object associated with data representative of real data employed by the said process;","executing the said process;","storing in memory, in the said object associated with data representative of the said real data employed by the said process, a link to the said object associated with data representative of the said process; and","storing in memory, in the said object associated with data representative of the said process, a link to the said object associated with data representative of the said real data employed by the said process.","The method according to the invention is therefore capable of executing processes represented by objects and of establishing links between the objects associated with the executed processes and the objects associated with the real data employed by the processes, or in other words, for example, used or produced by the processes.","Advantageously, the method additionally comprises the following steps:","creating data representative of real data;","creating an object associated with the said created data;","storing in memory, in the said created object, a link to the said object associated with data representative of the said process; and","storing in memory, in the said object associated with data representative of the said process, a link to the said created object.","The method according to the invention is therefore capable of executing processes represented by objects, of producing new real data, of creating objects associated with these new real data and of establishing links between the objects associated with the executed processes and the created objects associated with the new real data.","According to a particular embodiment, at least one of the said objects is stored in memory in the form of at least one table or at least one XML file.","Another object of the invention is a computer program comprising instructions adapted to the employment of each of the steps of the method described in the foregoing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","105","110","115","120"]},"Data-access module  is connected to data-management module  as well as to a centralized database , such as a database of Oracle type (Oracle is a trademark). Data-management module  is connected to centralized database , to execution engine  and to an assembly  representing distributed storage zones which can be organized in different ways, such as in the form of files or databases. Execution engine  is itself connected to assembly  of storage zones and to process-management module .","Although this architecture is particularly adapted to the design of complex objects such as aircraft, the following description is based on a simple example for reasons of clarity and conciseness. This example is given for illustrative purposes.","Architecture  is adapted to manipulate information technology objects representing data in the broad sense of the term, since these data may be representative of a real object such as an aircraft or of a process such as an aerodynamic drag calculation process. In simplified manner, the collaborative service-oriented workshop works on data represented by information technology objects, themselves based on metadata representing characteristic data.","The data, known as framework data or FD in English terminology, are therefore physical data stored in memory, for example in the form of files in a storage zone . These data characterize a real object, such as the grid or the structure of a chair, or a process, such as the steps of a furniture-removal process. The size of these data is not limited, and may be several hundreds of megabytes. All the data used may be stored in memory in separate physical locations.","The objects, known as framework objects or FO in English terminology, represent objects having a particular significance in the application sense. As indicated in the foregoing, these objects are used to represent everything that can be manipulated by the collaborative service-oriented workshop. The objects are based on metadata sets that may be thought of as base elements or characteristic elements. One metadata set is therefore associated with each object. Each type of metadata set may be associated with a plurality of objects. The qualification of a type of metadata set makes it possible to form an object. If, for example, a type of metadata set is associated with a chair, one qualification of the chair forming an object may be a child's chair.","In the interests of clarity, the information technology implementations of objects, known as framework object proxies or FO proxies in English terminology, are assimilated here with the objects themselves.","The objects include the instantiated process models, known as instantiated process templates or IPT in English terminology. The instantiated process models are instances of process models, or in other words process models applied to one or more objects. The process models, known as process templates or PT in English terminology, are generic. For example, they relate to a process of constructing a room starting from several chairs and a table, a process of renovating a house or a furniture-removal process. The instantiated process models are represented in the form of objects and may be manipulated as such in the collaborative service-oriented workshop.","The metadata, known as framework metadata or FMD in English terminology, correspond to particular information items of the data. They make it possible to characterize the data in order to facilitate their manipulation. One datum may be associated with a plurality of metadata sets. The metadata are advantageously stored in memory in centralized database  in the form of tables or of XML files (initials for Extensible Markup Language in English terminology). One type is associated here with each metadata set. The metadata comprise generic information items such as an identifier, a creation date and a name of the creator, and specific information items, inherent to the associated datum, such as the material, the color or the weight of a chair. The metadata also comprise links to objects, thus making it possible in particular to determine how the data were obtained and\/or how they have been used. These links make it possible to define data models, or in other words data tree structures.","The consistency of an object is verified via the links defined in the metadata set associated with it. For example, a data model of a table may be determined in such a way that a table is linked to a chair. If an object of table type is effectively associated with an object of chair type, then the object of table type is said to be consistent in the sense of the data model defined via its links.","The metadata are described, for example, by means of a language of XML type, according to the structure presented in the Annex under the heading \u201cCode excerpt 1\u201d.","The generic part of the metadata is common to all data, and it is therefore defined during employment of the collaborative service-oriented workshop. Even if this part does not have any reason a priori to be modified, its definition may nevertheless evolve according to the needs. However, its evolution has an influence on all of the objects managed in the collaborative service-oriented workshop.","The specific part of the metadata is inherent to each type of data and consequently to each type of metadata set. This part is defined by the users of the collaborative service-oriented workshop. The information items of the specific part of the metadata are determined by the operations of automatic extraction that have to be performed on the data.","The generic and specific metadata are advantageously used to search for and sort data contained in the collaborative service-oriented workshop.","The example given in the Annex under the heading \u201cCode excerpt 2\u201d illustrates the description of XML type of a type of metadata used to describe a chair.","As described in the foregoing, the metadata advantageously comprise a generic part and a specific part. In the present case, the generic part comprises in particular the following elements:","a key for managing control of access to the datum;","a description of the type of object;","a comment describing the datum;","a creation date;","an identifier of the datum, which may be a key or a URL via which the datum may be accessed;","a unique identifier of the datum;","an information item concerning the user who created the datum;","the physical location of the datum, with its geographic situation; and","its state, which makes it possible to know if a modification is in progress, and by whom.","The second part of the metadata, specific to the object being manipulated, in the present case a chair, comprises the following attributes in this example:","the number of feet;","the thickness;","the color;","the material; and","the weight.","Naturally the generic and specific parts may comprise other types of information items.","The identifier or address of a metadata set makes it possible to retrieve the data with which it is associated.","The qualification of a metadata set representing a chair may be in particular \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cadult\u201d, making it possible to end up with two different objects.","In the same way, it is possible to define metadata and objects for tables. During importation of an object defining a table, it is possible to define, at the level of a data model, that this object is consistent only if it is linked to at least one object of chair type. Such a relation between objects is defined by the links defined in the metadata. These links may also be represented in XML format or in a table. During importation of an object of table type, links of data model type must be established between the object of table type and the objects of chair type in order to make this object consistent with the data model defined in this way.","Alternatively, the metadata may be represented in the form of tables. For example, a table may be associated with each type of datum. The columns of the table represent the metadata while each of its rows represents an object. Table 1 presented in the Annex illustrates a simplified example of representation of a type of metadata set that can be associated with data of chair type. It should be noted here that the links are not included in the table representing the metadata. According to this example, the links are stored in memory in a table of links.","A table of links may be represented, for example, in the form of the table presented in the Annex as Table 2, in which each column represents a pair of identifiers of objects between which a link is established.","Thus the information items stored in memory in the metadata tables and in the table of links make it possible to manipulate all of the present and future data of the collaborative service-oriented workshop as well as to construct data models.","It may be noted here that the representation of metadata in the form of tables is equivalent to an XML representation and that it is possible to use a conversion tool to switch from one representation to another.","Representation of data characterizing physical objects or processes is therefore achieved at several levels:","the raw data;\n\n","the consistent objects, which are objects linked to other objects.","It should be noted here that, according to this structure, it is not necessary to employ synchronization methods in the collaborative service-oriented workshop.","Data-access module  makes it possible in particular for a user to access, in selective and centralized manner, metadata stored in memory in centralized database , especially in order to visualize these metadata, to construct views on these metadata, permitting effective sorting over all of the data accessible in the collaborative service-oriented workshop, as well as to follow, if necessary, the links uniting certain of these data.","Module  also makes it possible to record metadata in centralized database . Thus it is possible for a user to enter metadata via a man-machine interface (MMI) in order to specify information items that would not appear in the data stored in memory in storage zones . To access and record metadata, the user interface may use, in particular, requests of SQL type (initials for Structured Query Language in English terminology). This manual recording of metadata proves advantageous with regard to addition of specific information items that are not amenable to automatic extraction from the datum during importation of the object into the workshop.","Similarly, data-access module  makes it possible for a user to access, in selective and centralized manner, the data stored in memory in storage zones  via data-management module  as well as to record data. To access and record data, the user interface advantageously uses specific APIs (initials for Application Programming Interface in English terminology) and web services.","Data manager  is used as interface between data-access module , centralized database , storage zones  and execution engine , adapted in particular to apply processes to data. Data manager  also makes it possible to control the access rights of the users.","According to a particular embodiment, data manager  is composed of a client part and a server part. The client part may be implemented in a language of Python type to make it possible to access web services accessible in the server part. All the standard functions of data management, such as importation, exportation, publication, collaboration and management of rights are preferably available. This list is not exhaustive. All of the functions used in the course of the life cycle of the datum are available via this API.","The server part may be implemented, for example, in language of the Java or Python type to permit interfacing with the different databases and storage zones. Advantageously, this part is also in charge of the mechanisms for extracting metadata from data stored in memory in distributed storage zones  to centralized database  containing the metadata.","Execution engine  permits the execution of processes by way of process models based, for example, on discipline-specific applications. An interface between execution engine  and storage zones  permits access directly or via an API to the data during the execution of processes. Execution engine  is preferably linked to a calculation grid, for example of SynfiniWay type, which manages the submission of different processes on a distributed infrastructure as well as the movement of data during execution.","Preferably, execution engine  also comprises an interface with applications using flows of jobs (workflows in English terminology), such as the ModelCenter applications (ModelCenter is a trademark) or SynfiniWay, or in other words task execution or sequencing engines.","Process manager  permits the creation of high-level workflows known as composite processes, which encapsulate unitary treatments. These workflows may be subjected to parametric studies and to studies of sensitivities to parameters and may permit the creation of behavior models. These functionalities may therefore be used in connection with multidisciplinary optimization studies.","Thus the treatment of non-unitary processes, or in other words processes relying on several different functions, is managed by the process manager in such a way, for example, that they are decomposed into unitary processes, which are then executed by the execution engine.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0104"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"a ","b":"110"},"Data are created in the different databases (not illustrated) by means, for example, of a file interface or of an interface of Corba type (acronym for Common Object Request Broker Architecture in English terminology; Corba is a trademark).","A mechanism  for extraction, transformation and loading, known as ETL (initials for Extract, Transform and Load in English terminology) is then employed in order to extract the metadata from data stored in memory in storage zones . They are stored in centralized database . This database therefore collects the information items of the physical data created in the different distributed storage zones .","It should be noted here that the extraction mechanism is employed when the data are created, modified or deleted. It is specific to each type of data and metadata.","A qualification function  makes it possible to qualify the extracted metadata to form objects that can be stored in memory in centralized database . Following qualification, verification of the consistency of the object is performed. This consistency may be assured via links, which may or may not be stored in memory together with the metadata, which links may be of different natures, such as the version, the configuration, the data model and the user.","A set of links between objects, defining a data model, may be used to determine links between several objects. The links are associated with metadata. As described in the foregoing, they are stored in memory with the latter or in separate manner, for example in a table of links stored in memory in centralized database .","The links make it possible to establish, at a later time, the traceability of the data, or in other words the traceability between the different data produced or used during execution of processes. Several types of links exist, especially the following:","the user links determined manually by the user between two data;","the model links, which make it possible to define a data model. These links are determined generically during creation of a data model;","the configuration links, which make it possible to establish a link between a set of objects in order to manage their configuration, or in other words to permit the application of identical functions, such as functions for exportation, importation and change of rights;","the version links, which make it possible to manage the same object according to different versions; and","the production links, which make it possible to establish an execution link between a set of objects. This type of link is created automatically during the phase of publication of data during or at the end of execution of an instantiated process (IPT).","The set of these links placed in pairs makes it possible to obtain the traceability carried by the datum: the data contain all of the histories, especially as regards the execution of processes, the version, the configuration, the users and the models.","In this way it is possible to construct complete trees of objects linked to one another by metadata and specific links. In the example of the chair and the table, a tree making it possible to know the metadata (color and location) of the table verifies the data model linking it to chairs having a specific color as metadata. In this way it is possible to reconstruct, gradually, complete trees for obtaining data.","It should be noted here that the data models, or in other words the data tree structures, are specific to the data being manipulated in the collaborative service-oriented workshop. However, although the data models may be derived from links between the objects, they do not exist as such in the collaborative service-oriented workshop. They are implicitly created during the definition of objects, or in other words metadata sets corresponding to particular data types.","As illustrated in , a function  of data manager  makes it possible to access links and objects in order to form a view of consistent objects, or in other words a view presenting the relations between objects, which view may be transmitted to a user in the form of data-model views .","Similarly, the user may visualize objects and relations in the form of object views  and of relation views , such as lists.","Thus, according to this embodiment, the user, or in other words the client part of data manager , has available the following three types of views:","a view via the metadata onto the objects contained in the different databases;","a view onto the data models created in architecture ; and","a view that makes it possible to navigate between the different objects via links defined in the metadata database or associated therewith, such as the version links, the user links, the configuration links and the production links that permit traceability.","A description of XML type of objects of object proxy type containing all of the metadata associated with each datum is advantageously created for use, for example, by execution engine , in order to access the data stored in memory in storage zones  in the course of execution of processes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0125","num":"0126"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"b "},"After a first object has been selected (step ), for example via a man-machine interface, a link to a second object contained in this first object is accessed (step ). Then a link to a third object contained in this second object is accessed (step ), in order to make it possible to establish a link between the first and the third object (step ) or between the data associated with the first object and those associated with the third object.","Alternatively, a link to a third object contained in the first object is accessed (step ), in order to make it possible to establish a link between the second and third object (step ) or between the data associated with the second object and those associated with the third object.","As suggested by the dashed arrow, these steps may be repeated iteratively in order to determine a data tree, wherein the leaves represent the data (or the objects associated with the data) and the branches represent the links between the data (or between the objects associated with the data).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0130"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["115","115","300"]},"Instantiated process model  is analyzed in a syntax analyzer  of XML type, known as XML parser in English terminology, in order to extract from it the information items that permit execution of the process. In particular, the parameters, the code and the information items concerning the data necessary for execution of the process are extracted from the XML document. Similarly, the data used by the process, forming the inputs of the process, are retrieved by means of links to the objects in question. All of the information items necessary for execution of the process and extracted from the XML document are transmitted to core  of the execution engine.","The code of instantiated process model , or in other words the data associated with the object representing the instantiated process model, corresponds to instructions that can be directly executed by the execution engine, to instructions that can be executed via a specific interface, for example of code of Python type, or to external functions or modules called on by the execution engine, such as ModelCenter functions.","The execution of the process associated with instantiated process model  may lead to creation of new objects , forming the output of the process. These objects are treated in the same way as the objects described in the foregoing. In particular, metadata and links stored in memory in centralized database  as well as data stored in storage zones  are associated with these objects. Alternatively or in complementary manner, the input of the process may be modified in the course of execution thereof. The modified inputs forming an output of the process are known as inputs\/outputs.","Core  of the execution engine preferably relies on an execution environment , also known as execution context, of the instantiated process module. The purpose of the execution environment is in particular to preserve a history of execution of the process (), to make the data accessible in the format of the execution engine (), for example in the form of objects of Python type, to monitor the execution of the process () and to furnish the interfaces  necessary for execution of external modules in the core of the execution engine.","When a process is executed, and in particular when new objects are created, one or more links is\/are automatically created in the metadata associated with the data used by the process (inputs, outputs and inputs\/outputs) as well as in the metadata associated with the instantiated process model.","Before a process is executed, the metadata associated with the instantiated process model comprise references to the objects associated with the data to be used, but do not contain any link. The links are therefore created in each object when the process is executed.","For example, when a process uses a datum to product a result, the following links are created in the course of execution of the process:","a link to the object associated with the process model is created in the object associated with the input datum;","a link to the object associated with the input datum is created in the object associated with the process model;","a link to the object associated with the output datum is created in the object associated with the process model; and","a link to the object associated with the process model is created in the object associated with the output datum.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0141","num":"0142"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","405","410"]},"Depending on the nature of the executable code and the implementation of the collaborative service-oriented workshop, the executable code is executed by the collaborative service-oriented workshop or by an external application. By way of illustration, the executable code is executed in this case by the collaborative service-oriented workshop if it is of Python type and by an external application if it is, for example, of ModelCenter (MC) type.","The execution of functions external to the collaborative service-oriented workshop is achieved according to a mechanism of encapsulation of external functions in process models.  illustrates an example of encapsulation of a ModelCenter model in a process model.","If the executable code is of Python type, the data necessary for execution of the code, comprising in particular the references to input and output data as well as to the execution environment, are formatted according to the Python format (module ). The process formatted in this way is then encapsulated (module ) in a process model that can be manipulated by the collaborative service-oriented workshop as a standard object (module ). As illustrated by the arrow connecting module  to module , the process model uses the Python interface when the process must be executed.","Similarly, if the executable code is of ModelCenter type, the data necessary for execution of the code, comprising in particular the references to input and output data as well as to the execution environment, are encapsulated according to the ModelCenter format (module ). The process formatted in this way is then encapsulated (module ) in a process model that can be manipulated by the collaborative service-oriented workshop as a standard object (module ). Once again, as illustrated by the arrow connecting module  to module , the process model uses the appropriate interface, which in this case is the ModelCenter interface, when the process must be executed, in order to permit execution of the process outside the collaborative service-oriented workshop.","As suggested by reference , other formats may be used.","By means of a man-machine interface, or in other words an interface between modules  and  and between modules  and  in this case, the instantiation of the process model may be achieved after encapsulation of the process.","The objective of encapsulation is in particular to adapt the process models according to a predetermined format. In particular, the encapsulation makes it possible to check the validity of data, to determine the necessary parameters and impose default values on missing parameters, and to copy and\/or generate the appropriate code. Optionally, the encapsulation also makes it possible to define execution directives, or in other words to define, for example, what are the machines on which the processes or certain parts of processes must be executed.","The encapsulation of external functions in a process model is preferably achieved by means of the following XML sections:","inputs and outputs: links to the objects associated with the data being managed in the collaborative workshop, permitting the use thereof in the external functions;","parameters: parameters used by the external functions; and","code: call to the external function.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0153","num":"0154"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","505","510"]},"Thus a process model can call up a function external to the collaborative service-oriented workshop. By virtue of the structure of the objects associated with the process models and in particular the links, traceability of the data used as input or output of process models that call up external functions is possible.","Similarly, it is also possible to encapsulate process models in external functions, for example in ModelCenter models. Thus process models developed in the collaborative service-oriented workshop may be used directly by external applications. Via this mechanism, it is possible to use and to link process models to other external functions while preserving, during execution, not only the use of data managed in the collaborative service-oriented workshop but also the associated traceability.","The execution of process models starting from an external application is achieved by the neutral execution module of the integration layer of the collaborative service-oriented workshop, known as SRUN, used to execute the instantiated process models.","In this way a process model can encapsulate external functions and be encapsulated in external functions.","In this double encapsulation mechanism, the degree of traceability of data is therefore determined by the functions executed by the collaborative service-oriented workshop and by external applications.","By way of illustration, if a process model A of the collaborative service-oriented workshop calls up functions B, C and D, where B and C are process models of the collaborative service-oriented workshop and D is a ModelCenter model that itself calls up functions E and F, where E is an external function and F is an encapsulated process model of the collaborative service-oriented workshop, it is possible to follow the links between B, C and D but not between E and F (simply between the input of E and the output of F), executed outside the collaborative service-oriented workshop. In this way it is possible to determine the level of granularity desired for traceability of the data.","As indicated in the foregoing, the data associated with objects characterizing instantiated process models may be represented in the form of files, for example in the form of a file of XML type. The descriptions of process models advantageously comprise several sections, specific to each type of information item.","The process models may themselves be composed of process sub-models, which may be stored in memory in sections of process models. The process sub-models in this case are references to process models accessible in the collaborative service-oriented workshop. In this way it is possible to create composite process models that reference several unitary process models or process models that themselves are composite.","The attributes of an instantiated process model are, for example, the following:","the version of the diagram of XML type that makes it possible to extract the information items from the process model;","the identifier, the name, the version and the type of the process model;","the identifier of the instantiated process model;","the identifier of execution of ModelCenter type if the instantiated process model references a function of ModelCenter type;","the access pathways to the mechanisms that permit execution of the process in secure manner (known as sandboxes in English terminology);","the state of execution of the process model, which specifies the current state of execution of the instantiated process model, for example submitted, in course of execution, executed successfully or executed with error;","the state of the process model defining its internal state, for example primary, partly instantiated, instantiated, in course of execution, or executed; and","comments.","The section relating to the inputs, the outputs, the inputs\/outputs and the parameters of an instantiated process model comprises, for example, the name, the type and the category. Other items of information may be associated with the inputs, the outputs, the inputs\/outputs and the parameters of an instantiated process model, such as the type of user concerned, a description and a help feature. One section is used for each input, output, input\/output and parameter.","The section relating to the execution context of an instantiated process model comprises a classification section specifying the tools used during execution of the instantiated process model. The section relating to the execution context of an instantiated process model also comprises a section for context creation, making it possible to store the execution context of the instantiated process model in memory, as well as a section for current execution context, specifying the configuration to be used to execute the process and making it possible to store the choices to be effected by the calculation grid controller in memory. The section relating to the execution context of an instantiated process model may also comprise an execution server section to specify the configuration of the calculation grid chosen during instantiation of the process model as well as an execution report section, filled out at the end of execution of the process and containing, for example, an error code or art-specific information items relating to the execution of the process.
