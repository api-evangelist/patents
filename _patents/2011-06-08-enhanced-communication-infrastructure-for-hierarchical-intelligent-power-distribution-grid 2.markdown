{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The subject specification generally relates to intelligent power distribution grids, and, more particularly, to enhanced communication infrastructure for a hierarchical intelligent distribution grid.","Power grids have not undergone significant architectural changes since use of electricity for power was realized more than a century ago. The idea of a \u201cSmart Grid\u201d was introduced in the late 1990s, however, today, power grids still only employ limited intelligence in managing and providing power to consumers. Energy distribution systems are currently at a crossroads, as they confront the significant problem of imbalances of various kinds. Not only is the gap between supply and demand continuing to increase due to global population growth, but there also is a geographic imbalance in energy production and consumption patterns. These imbalances and uncertainties could be exacerbated in the future considering the rapidly increasing energy demands of newly industrialized nations, such as China, India, Brazil, and Russia, as these and other nations will compete for more generating sources to meet expected energy demands. While incorporating a wide variety of renewable (non-fossil fuel) energy sources is part of the solution to the increasing energy demands, it is not likely that incorporating renewable energy sources will be a panacea for the impending energy issues. Thus, it is clear that there also will have to be significant changes in the power distribution network to help meet future energy needs.","Currently, communications is one area where changes are being made to power grids to create Smart Grids. Presently, emerging Smart Grid networks are deployed using a variety of communications technologies, including wired (e.g., fiber, microwave, power line, etc.) as well as public and private wireless networks (e.g., a communication network employing an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11-based protocol), using the licensed and unlicensed spectrum. In general, unlicensed wireless technologies, such as wireless technologies employing an IEEE 802.11-based protocol, can offer relatively low cost solutions for communication of information as compared to licensed wireless networks and wired networks, with the exception of power line carriers. However, both wireless and power line solutions face significant impediments with regard to Smart Grid communications, in terms of having to find an acceptable co-existence mechanism in the presence of increasing, diverse time and spatially varying interferences.","Historically, narrowband power line carrier (PLC) communications was developed for high voltage power lines within the transmission segment for long distances, using low frequencies (e.g., typically kHz range) and achieving very modest data rates (few kbps). Subsequently, the technique has been extended to the medium voltage distribution segment as well as in-home networks using higher frequency bands (e.g., around 1-30 MHz) and consequently achieving much higher signaling rates.","Utilities also have used unlicensed spectrum for automatic meter reading (AMR) applications, wherein a smart meter, which can be found at locations of both residential and commercial customers, allows electrical consumption information to be identified and transmitted to distribution-level control center (DCC), typically at periodic (e.g., monthly) times. Currently, new licensed spectrum allocation for SG does not appear to be on the horizon, leaving utilities to either use the unlicensed (e.g., 802.11-based technologies) or licensed cellular (e.g., Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMax) within 4G) technologies for the distribution secondary\/primary scales. Another recent proposition centers around the potential application of cognitive radios for SG applications.","One significant issue with the deployment of wireless communication technologies with Smart Grids is the current inability to provide desirable Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees (e.g., reliability, performance). Further, in general there are many points in conventional distribution power grids where collection and communication of data is wholly lacking Still another issue regarding SGs in general is, if there is an increase in communications in a SG, there also will be an exponential increase in data being generated and communicated throughout the SG; and currently there is no way of dealing with large amounts of data (e.g., terabytes of data) that can be generated throughout a power grid in a way that is useful to operation of the power grid.","Additionally, the flat control topography of the traditional electrical distribution system is likely to face hurdles with the incorporation of distributed power generation systems. Many electrical power sources in distributed generation systems are time variant. For example, wind turbines are subject to power fluctuation in time based at least in part on wind speed, solar power is time variant based at least in part on cloud cover, plug-in electrical vehicles with surplus power can be disconnected at a moment's notice, etc. Distributed power generation is therefore likely to introduce a need for high speed adjustments to portions of the electrical distribution system, as close to real time adjustment as possible, and simultaneously be likely to produce a flood of electrical consumption data. In a flat control topography, this additional data flow is likely to exacerbate the deficiencies of data throughput and processing. This can result in slower dynamic adjustment of the distribution network where, in fact, faster adjustment is desirable due to the increased demand for processing of such data.","Further, additional sensitivity to communications network faults can cause the flat topography control system to become increasingly perilous to grid control and can seriously affect downstream consumers. As more data passes directly to the DCC due to the proliferation of smart devices generating consumable data for grid control, the DCC can become more dependent on this additional data for proper grid control. Where the DCC is dependent on this increased data flow for proper grid control, even minor diminished communication bandwidth can impair the flat grid control system by reducing the amount of data accessible for proper control. Hyper-dependable communications systems over an entire distribution grid is desirable for a reliable electrical system, but is burdened under the sheer volume of smart data anticipated in the future electrical grid.","The above-described deficiencies of today's systems are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with the state of the art and corresponding benefits of some of the various non-limiting embodiments may become further apparent upon review of the following detailed description.","The following presents a simplified summary of the various embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosed subject matter. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the disclosed subject matter nor delineate the scope of the subject embodiments. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the disclosed subject matter in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","The disclosed subject matter comprises enhanced communication infrastructure for a multi-tier hierarchical electrical distribution network (EDN) (e.g., smart distribution grid (SDG)). The EDN comprises a specified number of distribution network node controller (DNNC) components employed to desirably control communications and power distribution between respective tiers of the EDN to facilitate efficient power distribution. When communication between a DNNC in one tier and another DNNC in another tier, is desired, the DNNC can identify available communication channels and respective communication conditions of the available communication channels, and can dynamically select a subset of available data and preferred communication channel, based at least in part on predefined control criteria, to control data transmission loads in the network and facilitate real time control of the EDN. Data can be communicated via the selected communication channel. Respective DNNCs can desirably control power distribution for respective tiers, minimizing upper tier involvement in lower tier power distribution.","In accordance with various aspects, the disclosed subject matter can comprise a system that includes a first power distribution node that is configured to distribute power to one or more consumer consumption nodes (CCNs), wherein the first power distribution node and the one or more CCNs are located in a lowest tier in a multi-tier EDN. The system can further include a first node controller component that is configured to be interfaced with the first power distribution node, control the distribution of power by the first power distribution node to the one or more CCNs, and control communication of data between the first node controller component and at least one other node controller component, in accordance with predefined control criteria.","In accordance with various other aspects, the disclosed subject matter can comprise a method that includes the acts of controlling distribution of power to one or more CCNs in a lowest level of a multi-level power distribution network (PDN) at the lowest level, wherein the multi-level PDN comprises the lowest level and at least one other level that is higher than the lowest level in the hierarchy of the multi-level PDN; and controlling data communications between a first network node controller component located in the lowest level and at least one other network node controller component to facilitate controlling the distribution of power in the lowest level, wherein the distribution of power and the data communications are respectively controlled in accordance with predefined control criteria.","In accordance with still other aspects, the disclosed subject matter can comprise a system that includes means for controlling distribution of power to one or more CCNs in a lowest level of a multi-tier EDN at the lowest level, wherein the multi-tier EDN comprises the lowest tier and at least one other tier that is higher than the lowest tier in the hierarchy of the multi-tier EDN. The system can further include means for controlling data communications between a lowest-tier network node controller component located in the lowest tier and at least one higher-tier network node controller component located in at least one higher tier in the multi-tier EDN to facilitate controlling the distribution of power in the lowest tier, wherein the distribution of power and the data communications are respectively controlled in accordance with predefined control criteria.","The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects of the disclosed subject matter. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the various embodiments may be employed and the disclosed subject matter is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other advantages and distinctive features of the disclosed subject matter will become apparent from the following detailed description of the various embodiments when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","The disclosed subject matter is described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments of the subject disclosure. It may be evident, however, that the disclosed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the various embodiments herein.","As used in this application, the terms \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201csystem,\u201d \u201cplatform,\u201d \u201cinterface,\u201d \u201cnode\u201d, \u201csource\u201d, and the like can refer to a computer-related entity or an entity related to an operational machine with one or more specific functionalities.

For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and\/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers. Also, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components may communicate via local and\/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets (e.g., data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and\/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems via the signal).","In addition, the term \u201cor\u201d is intended to mean an inclusive \u201cor\u201d rather than an exclusive \u201cor.\u201d That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from context, \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations.

The EDN comprises a specified number of distribution network node controller (DNNC) components employed to desirably control communications and power distribution between respective tiers of the EDN to facilitate efficient power distribution. When communication between a DNNC in one tier and another DNNC in another tier, is desired, the DNNC can identify available communication channels and respective communication conditions of the available communication channels, and can dynamically select a subset of available data and preferred communication channel, based at least in part on predefined control criteria, to control data transmission loads in the network and facilitate real time control of the EDN. Data can be communicated via the selected communication channel. Respective DNNCs can desirably control power distribution for respective tiers, minimizing upper tier involvement in lower tier power distribution. Aspects of the disclosed subject matter can be incorporate in legacy power systems or can be part of a new EDN.","Referring to the drawings,  is a block diagram of an example system  having a hierarchical communication and control architecture for an EDN in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. The system  can provide hierarchical and de-centralized control of and communication (e.g., two-way communication) relating to distribution nodes (e.g., power distribution sources (PDSs)) in the power grid in the EDN (which also can be referred to as a power distribution network (PDN)). In an aspect, the system  can include an upper level PDS  that can generate and\/or supply electrical power to one or more consumer consumption nodes (CCNs) (e.g., residential premises, commercial premises, etc.) associated with the upper level PDS .","In another aspect, the system  can comprise a lower level PDS  that can be electrically connected to the upper level PDS , wherein the lower level PDS  can be under the upper level PDS  in the hierarchy of the EDN and can be employed to distribute electrical power to the one or more CCNs associated with (e.g., electrically connected to) the lower level PDS . Typically, the upper level PDS  can provide power at a higher voltage level (e.g., greater than 100 kilovolts (kV)) (e.g., after the voltage of the electric power is stepped-up to facilitate efficient transmission) via electrical lines to the lower level PDS , and the lower level PDS  can convert (e.g., transform, step-down, etc.) the higher voltage level to a desired lower voltage level (e.g., 110 volts (V), 220 V, . . . , 4 kV, . . . , 13 kV, . . . ) suitable for use at the CCNs. For example, the upper level PDS  can be a power generation plant that serves a certain geographical area (e.g., city, county, district, or other defined area), and the lower level PDS  can be a distribution transformer (e.g., electromagnetic type of distribution transformer) that can be attached to a pole or a pad at or near a portion of the certain geographical area wherein the subset of CCNs associated with the lower PDS  are located to distribute the desired power to those associated CCNs. In an aspect, the upper level PDS  also can be associated with (e.g., electrically connected to or interfaced with) other upper level PDSs (not shown in  for reasons of brevity and clarity) in the EDN to facilitate transferring power between the upper level PDSs to enable the respective upper level PDSs to meet power needs in their respective portions of the EDN.","While the system  is illustrated herein to show that the lower level PDS  receives power from the upper level PDS  to supply power to the CCNs, the disclosed subject matter is not so limited, as in accordance with various embodiments, a CCN also can comprise or be associated with (e.g., electrically connected to) a local PDS (e.g., solar power generation system, wind power generation system, geothermal power generation system, hydroelectric power generation system, diesel-type power generation system, stored power (e.g., power stored in charged batteries of an electric or hybrid vehicle), etc.) that can produce and\/or otherwise provide power for use by the CCN to reduce or even eliminate the need for that CCN to obtain power from the power grid via the lower level PDS  and\/or can provide power to other CCNs associated with the power grid, such as, for example, CCNs that are associated with the same lower level PDS , when the power source of the CCN generates power in excess of the amount of power used and\/or stored by that CCN, as more fully disclosed herein. For instance, the local power source of the CCN can provide any excess power to another CCN(s) directly or, more typically, via the lower level PDS , wherein, for example, routing the power via the lower level PDS  can facilitate desired tracking of the amount of power being provided to the power grid by the local power source.","Conventionally, power distribution systems are \u201ctop down\u201d systems whereby power is distributed down from a central power generation system to transformers that transform the power and supply it to CCNs with limited communication of information (e.g., information limited to periodic (e.g., monthly) power usage information) from the lower nodes (e.g., CCNs via enhanced consumer meters (ECMs), such as smart meters or other meters employing advanced metering infrastructure (AMI)) in the power grid to the central power generation system. It is desirable to have improved communication between lower nodes and upper nodes in the EDN to more efficiently distribute power; however, there can be large amounts of data (e.g., multiple terabytes) generated relating to power conditions and communication conditions associated with the EDN, which is expected to increase in the future as more micro PDSs (e.g., solar power generation system, wind power generation system, etc.) associated with power consumers\/producers are connected to the EDN, particularly to the large amounts of data that is expected to be produced due to the time-variant nature of the power produced by or available from such micro PDSs, as it can be desirable to be able to control power distribution on a more refined level (e.g., on the order of seconds, milliseconds, or on an even more refined level) to account for the time-variant nature of the power produced by or available from the micro PDSs. Management of the communication of such data reliably and securely is desirable. Further, there are a number of available communication paths, both wired and wireless paths, employing disparate communication technologies, and it is desirable to be able to utilize such communication paths and technologies in an efficient manner (e.g., efficient with regard to reliability, security, cost, etc.). Today, there is no way to overcome these and other challenges and deficiencies in the conventional technology relating to power distribution.","To that end, in accordance with various aspects, the system  can provide an enhanced communication infrastructure to facilitate efficient power distribution to CCNs associated with the power grid that overcomes the deficiencies in the conventional technology relating to power distribution. In an aspect, the system  can employ a specified number of communication and\/or control nodes (e.g., distribution network node controller (DNNC) components) that can be respectively associated with distribution nodes, also referred to as distribution network nodes, in the EDN to facilitate efficiently controlling power distribution in a hierarchal and de-centralized manner. The disclosed subject matter can employ the communication control and power distribution control exercised by the lower level nodes to facilitate maximizing the net power consumption of the CCNs at the lower hierarchy level of the EDN so that there is reduced or minimal involvement of the upper level nodes of the EDN in the supplying of power to the CCNs associated with a lower level PDS and lower level DNNC component, as more fully disclosed herein. The upper level PDS  can be associated with (e.g., connected to or interfaced with) an upper level DNNC component  that can be employed to monitor conditions (e.g., power conditions, communication conditions, etc.) associated with the upper level PDS  and\/or node points below the upper level DNNC component  in the hierarchy at a desired level of granularity (e.g., monitor each second, each millisecond, or at another desired level of granularity) to facilitate real time, or at least near real time, control of power distribution and communications in the EDN. Based at least in part on the observed conditions, the upper level DNNC component  can (e.g., dynamically or automatically) control power distribution and\/or perform other actions with regard to the upper level PDS  or lower level PDS .","In an aspect, the upper level DNNC component  can be communicatively connected to a lower level DNNC component , which can be associated with (e.g., connected to or interfaced with) the lower level PDS . The lower level DNNC component  can monitor conditions (e.g., power conditions, communication conditions, etc.) associated with the lower level PDS  and\/or node points (e.g., CCNs, local power sources, etc.) below the lower level DNNC component  in the hierarchy to facilitate controlling power distribution on a more refined level for the portion of the power grid covered by the lower level DNNC component , so that power distribution can be dynamically and efficiently controlled. For instance, the lower level DNNC component  can monitor conditions in the lower tier of the hierarchy at a desired level of granularity (e.g., monitor each second, each millisecond, or at another desired level of granularity) to facilitate real time, or at least near real time, control of power distribution and communications in the EDN. In accordance with various aspects, the upper level DNNC component  also can be communicatively connected to one or more other upper level DNNC components (not shown in  for reasons of brevity and clarity) in the EDN to facilitate communicating data regarding power-related conditions in the EDN between the upper level DNNC components to facilitate efficiently controlling power distribution in the EDN.","In still another aspect, the DNNC components  and  respectively can include enhanced control component (ECC)  and ECC , each of which can obtain, aggregate, and process data relating to the conditions of the respective PDS(s) managed by them to facilitate controlling power distribution in the respective portions of the grid controlled by them. The ECC  and ECC  can control communications between the respective DNNC components  and  and other nodes in the EDN to enable real time or at least near real time communication of data between such nodes in the EDN (e.g., communication of data at the rate of one second or more, or at a subsecond rate (e.g., at a rate on the order of tenths of seconds, hundredths of seconds or milliseconds) to facilitate real time control of communications).","In one aspect, the ECC  can monitor conditions (e.g., power conditions, communication conditions, etc.) relating to the portion of the power grid for which the lower level PDS  distributes power and the lower level DNNC component  controls communication and power distribution. For example, there can be one or more sensors (not shown in ; as shown with regard to the sensor component disclosed in relation to ) that can be distributed at or near the lower level PDS  and\/or at other points in the portion of the power grid associated with the lower level PDS  and lower level DNNC component , wherein the one or more sensors can comprise various types of sensors (e.g., sensor(s), such as a power sensor, heat sensor, fault sensor, etc., to monitor power conditions (e.g., power levels, heat levels, etc.) and\/or faults; sensor(s) to monitor communication conditions (e.g., signal strength, data communication rates, quality of service (QoS), etc.); etc.). The ECC  can obtain data from the respective sensors and can process such data to facilitate determinations relating to controlling power distribution associated with the lower level PDS  and controlling communications and other control aspects associated with the lower level DNNC component  (e.g., the ECC can control power distribution and communications at the rate of one second or more, or at a subsecond rate (e.g., at a rate on the order of tenths of seconds, hundredths of seconds or milliseconds) to facilitate real time control of power distribution and communications). In an embodiment, the ECC  (and\/or ECC ) can comprise or can be associated with (e.g., communicatively connected to) a Frequency monitoring Network (FNET) that can be employed as a power system frequency measurement system that can accurately measure power system frequency, voltage and angle in real time (or at least near real time), and can facilitate desired real time (or at least near real time) control of power distribution in the EDN, wherein the FNET can be, for example, a phasor measurement unit (PMU) FNET (PMU\/FNET), wherein the PMU can be, for example, a frequency disturbance recorder (FDR).","For instance, the ECC  can analyze or evaluate the data, filter the data, abstract the data, or otherwise process the data from the sensors to make determinations for local (e.g., lower level) control of the associated portion of the power grid (e.g., power distribution in the portion of the power grid, provide for protection of system devices in the portion of the power grid in response to a detected fault or undesired parameter value, etc.), or to generate a subset of data (e.g., abstract or summary of the obtained or processed data) that can be communicated to the upper level DNNC component  for processing to facilitate making determinations for control of that portion of the power grid and\/or control of other portions of the power grid controlled by the upper level DNNC component .","The collection of data from sensors in the EDN (e.g., lower level of the EDN) at a desired fine level of granularity (e.g., on a second, millisecond, or even more refined granularity) along with the processing (e.g., analyzing) of such data and\/or other data, which can generate even more data, can result in a large amount of data (e.g., many gigabytes or terabytes of data) collected at the lower level of the EDN. It is to be appreciated and understood that transmitting all of the data (e.g., collected data, analysis-generated data, other data) from the lower level DNNC  to the upper level DNNC  can be undesirable for a number of reasons, as some of the data may not be needed by the upper level DNNC  since such data can relate to aspects or functions being controlled by the lower level DNNC  and not the upper level DNNC , and communication of such large amounts of data can or may overload the communication network and impair real time control of power distribution and communications in the EDN, especially when the upper level DNNC  is receiving respective large amounts of data from multiple lower level DNNCs (e.g., ) associated with the portion of the EDN controlled by the upper level DNNC , among other reasons.","In accordance with various aspects, the lower level DNNC , employing the ECC , can select a desired subset of data from the available data (e.g., collected data, analysis-generated data, other data), in accordance with the predefined control criteria, as more fully disclosed herein. For example, the ECC  can filter or abstract data obtained from sensors to facilitate reducing the amount of data communicated to the upper level DNNC component . For instance, the ECC  can monitor a particular power condition and can obtain measurements of that power condition for each sample time, which, for example, can be finely granularized to a desired level (e.g., on the order of milliseconds, seconds, minutes, . . . ). It may not be necessary for the upper level DNNC component  to have knowledge of all of the parameter values of the particular power condition parameter, but rather only desirable for the upper level DNNC component  to have knowledge of certain parameter values (e.g., a maximum power condition parameter value over a specified number of samples, a power condition parameter value that is outside of a predefined threshold acceptable parameter value or set of values, an average or mean parameter value and\/or standard deviation over a specified number of samples, etc.). The ECC  can evaluate and process the obtained data (e.g., perform calculations on the obtained data, filter out data from the obtained data) to generate a subset of data (e.g., a filtered subset of data that contains a parameter value(s) that is outside of the predefined threshold acceptable parameter value(s); or an abstract or summary of the data that includes an average or a mean of the parameter values obtained over a specified number of samples or period of time), in accordance with predefined control criteria (and corresponding predefined control rules), as more fully disclosed herein. The subset of data can be communicated from the lower level DNNC component  to the upper level DNNC component  via a desired communication channel (e.g., wired or wireless communication channel) using a desired communication technology (e.g., DSL, cellular, an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11-type protocol, etc.) for processing and evaluation by the ECC  to facilitate controlling power distribution over the portion of the grid controlled by the upper level PDS , wherein the desired communication channel can be automatically or dynamically selected in accordance with the predefined control criteria, as more fully disclosed herein. The disclosed subject matter can thereby control the amount of data being communicated via communication channels to limit the data to such data that is desired by the upper level DNNC component  or other upper level node(s) to control (e.g., reduce) the load on the communication channels and facilitate real time, or at least near real time, data communication between nodes in the EDN.","The ECC  can receive the subset of data from the lower level PDS , and can analyze, evaluate, and\/or otherwise process that subset of data to facilitate making determinations for controlling the portion of the power grid controlled by the upper level DNNC component , including controlling that portion of the power grid associated with the lower level DNNC component  and\/or other portions of the power grid associated with other lower level DNNC components (not shown) that are under the control of the upper level DNNC component . Based at least in part on the processing of the subset of data, the ECC  can generate control information (e.g., power-related parameter values, control information or commands for power distribution, etc.), which can be communicated via a desired communication channel to the lower level DNNC component , another lower level DNNC component (not shown) associated with the upper level DNNC component , or another upper level DNNC component , to facilitate desirably controlling power distribution in the EDN.","As disclosed herein, the system  can employ various types of communication channels and technologies (e.g., wireline communication channels, such as digital subscriber line (DSL)-type channels, Ethernet-type channels, broadband-type channels, cable communication channels, power line carrier (PLC)-type communication channels, wherein a PLC-type communication channel can include, for example, a Broadband over Power Lines (BPL)-type communication channel or a distribution line carrier (DLC)-type communication channel, etc.; and wireless communication channels, such as cellular communication channels, communication channels based on an IEEE 802.11-type protocol(s) (e.g., IEEE 802.11a protocol, IEEE 802.11b protocol, IEEE 802.11g protocol, IEEE 802.11n protocol, etc.), which can be used, for example, to implement a wireless local area network (WLAN) or a wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN), communication channels based on an IEEE 802.16-type protocol(s) (e.g., IEEE 802.16.2-2004, IEEE 802.16k-2007, IEEE 802.16-2009, IEEE 802.16j-2009, IEEE 802.16h-2010, IEEE P802.16m, IEEE P802.16n, IEEE P802.16p, etc.) (also can be referred to as wireless broadband), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMax)-type communication channels, femtocell communication channels, satellite communication channels, etc.), which can have respective communication conditions, costs, etc., associated therewith. For example, a wireless communication network employing an IEEE 802.11 type protocol typically can operate in the unlicensed 2.4 and 5 GHz radio bands, at an 11 Mbps (in accordance with IEEE 802.11b protocol) or a 54 Mbps (in accordance with an IEEE 802.11a protocol) data rate, for example, or with products that contain both bands (dual band), so the network can provide real-world performance similar to the basic \u201c10BaseT\u201d wired Ethernet networks used in many offices.","In an aspect, to facilitate desired data communications, the ECC  and\/or ECC  (or a communication component associated with a CCN) can dynamically or automatically select or switch to a specified communication channel or communication technology to facilitate communication of data between the upper level DNNC component  and lower level DNNC component , or between the lower level DNNC component and a communication component associated with a CCN, or between the upper level DNNC component  and another upper level DNNC component , based at least in part on the predefined control criteria, which can comprise predefined communication channel selection criteria. In identifying, determining, or selecting a communication channel or communication technology to utilize to communicate a particular set of data, the ECC  or ECC  can apply the predefined communication channel selection criteria (or corresponding predefined communication channel selection rules), which can relate to, for example, the amount of data to be communicated, the type of data (e.g. current power condition data, abstract or filtered subset of power condition data, fault data, power control data, communication control data, etc.), the priority of the data (e.g., high priority or emergency data, standard priority, low priority, etc.), the respective communication conditions (e.g., quality of service (QoS), data communication rates, communication channel congestion, etc.) of respective communication channels (e.g., wireline communication channel, wireless communication channel), respective costs of communication of the data for the respective communication channels, current availability of respective communication channels, time of day of data communication (e.g., peak-time communication times, off-peak communication times), etc.","For example, data that meets a predefined high level of priority threshold can be transmitted via one type of communication channel or technology over another type of communication channel or technology because the one type of communication channel or technology is more reliable or desirable (e.g., more desirable QoS and\/or faster data communication rate) than the other type, even if communication via the one type is more costly than communication via the other type, when the predefined communication channel selection criteria (or corresponding rule(s)) so specifies. As another example, the predefined communication channel selection criteria (or corresponding rule(s)) can specify that data is to be communicated via a wireless communication channel using an IEEE 802.11 type protocol or standard so long as the communication conditions for such wireless communication channel at least meet a predefined QoS level and data communication rate, or communicated via another communication channel (e.g., a wireline or other communication channel that meets the predefined QoS level and data communication rate) when that wireless communication channel does not meet the predefined QoS level and data communication rate.","In accordance with various other aspects, as more fully disclosed herein, the ECC  and ECC , respectively, can compress\/decompress data (e.g., the subset of data) being transmitted to\/received from the respective DNNC components  or , or other component (e.g., control or communication component associated with a consumer consumption point), in accordance with a specified compression\/decompression algorithm(s) (e.g., lossless compression algorithms, such as Lempel-Ziv (LZ) compression algorithm, LZ-Renau (LZR) compression algorithm, Huffman coding, DEFLATE, etc.; lossy compression algorithms, such as Mu-law Compander, A-law Compander, Modulo-N code, etc.), to facilitate reducing the amount of data bits being communicated thereby easing the communication load on the communication channel(s) between the upper level DNNC component  and the lower level DNNC component  or other component; encrypt data transmitted or decrypt data received from a DNNC component (e.g.,  or ) or other component, in accordance with a specified cryptographic algorithm(s) and protocols (e.g., data encryption standard (DES)-type algorithms, advanced encryption standard (AES)-type algorithms, symmetric key algorithms, etc.), to facilitate securing communicated data; employ desired data redundancy to facilitate recovery of data in case of data corruption; etc.","It is to be appreciated and understood that, while system  includes a single lower level DNNC associated with a single lower level PDS, the subject specification is not so limited, as in accordance with various embodiments, there can be one or more lower level DNNC components associated with a single lower level PDS, as desired. For example, one lower level PDS may serve 500 CCNs, wherein it can be desirable to break the group of 500 CCNs into a number of smaller sub-groups (e.g., 10 sub-groups of 50 CCNs each) which can respectively be associated with a corresponding number of lower level DNNC components. In accordance with various embodiments, one of the number of lower level DNNC components can act as a master lower level DNNC component in relation to the other lower level DNNC components, or there can be an additional lower level DNNC component that acts as a master lower level DNNC component, wherein the master lower level DNNC component can be interfaced with the lower level PDS, or the lower level DNNC components can coordinate with each other without a master DNNC component and can interface with the lower level PDS, as desired.","The disclosed subject matter, by controlling communications and power distribution in a multi-tier EDN in real time (or at least near real time), can desirably control operations of the EDN to achieve desirable demand response through desirable (e.g., optimal) management of the usage of high power appliances, reducing peak demand on the EDN and reducing the need for additional expensive power generation; can provide for integrated real and reactive power management by managing loss reduction in the system and volt\/volt-amperes reactive (volt\/var) control and recognizing that loss reduction and volt\/var control are intertwined with each other, since change of voltage affects both real and reactive flow in AC power systems; desirable (e.g., optimal) scheduling of micro power sources (e.g., distribution grids, such as solar power generation systems, wind power generation systems, etc.) and electric or hybrid vehicles (e.g., plug-in electric vehicles (PEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV)) or other large power consumption devices or appliances, based at least in part on the status of the EDN, in accordance with the predefined control criteria; can provide adaptive secondary distribution system protection to protect distribution transformers on the low voltage side, and can employ protection devices for the distribution transformers that can coordinate with the high voltage side on the primary side of the distribution system and each of the CCNs (e.g., at the ECM or main breaker) on the load side of the system, to facilitate improved reliability; can manage assets (e.g., PDSs, DNNCs, power lines, sensors, etc.) in accordance with the predefined control criteria to improve the life cycle of the respective assets, for example, by minimizing the transfer of power throughout the EDN and thereby minimize the use of system components to transfer power throughout the EDN to thereby reduce the wear and tear on such system components; etc.","Turning to , depicted is a block diagram of an example system  having a multi-tier (e.g., three-tier) hierarchical communication and control architecture for an EDN in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. The system  can be employed to facilitate real time, or at least near real time, communications and control of communications (e.g., communications and control of communications at a rate of second(s) or at a subsecond rate) between various control nodes at various levels in the hierarchy to facilitate real time, or at least near real time, control of power distribution to CCNs in the EDN (e.g., control of power distribution to CCNs in the EDN at a rate of second(s) or at a subsecond rate). In an aspect, the system  can comprise an upper (e.g., top) level PDS , middle (mid) or intermediate level PDS , and a lower (e.g., lowest) level PDS , wherein the upper level PDS  (e.g., power generation plant) and lower level PDS  (e.g., distribution transformer) each can be the same as or can comprise the same or similar functionality as respective components as more fully disclosed herein. The mid level PDS  can be associated with (e.g., electrically connected to) the upper level PDS  and lower level PDS , and can be, for example, a power sub-station in between the upper level PDS  and lower level PDS  in the power distribution chain. The mid level PDS  can receive higher voltage level electrical power from the upper level PDS  and can convert the higher voltage level of the electrical power to a middle voltage level that is lower than the higher voltage level, wherein the mid level PDS  can transfer the electric power having the mid voltage level to one or more lower level PDSs, such as lower level PDS , which can convert the mid voltage level of the electric power to a lower voltage level suitable for use by the CCNs, such as CCNs  and , associated with the lower level PDS(s) (e.g., ), and the power having the lower voltage level can be distributed to the CCNs, as desired.","In another aspect, the upper level PDS  can be associated with (e.g., connected to or interfaced with) an upper level DNNC component , the mid level PDS  can be associated with a mid level DNNC component , and the lower level PDS  can be associated with a lower level DNNC component .

The mid level DNNC component  can comprise the same or similar functionality as the upper level DNNC component  or lower level DNNC component , except that the mid level DNNC component  can be employed to facilitate controlling power distribution for the mid level PDS , for example, to one or more lower level PDSs (e.g., ) associated with the mid level PDS , and control communication of data between the mid level DNNC component  and other control nodes associated therewith (e.g., upper level DNNC component , lower level DNNC component ). In still another aspect, the upper level DNNC component  can include an ECC , the mid level DNNC component  can include ECC , and the lower level DNNC component  can include ECC , wherein the respective ECCs can be the same or similar as or can comprise the same or similar functionality as respective components, such as more fully disclosed herein.","The system  can be a multi-level (e.g., three-tier) integrated distribution management system (IDMS), that can comprise, for example, an upper level of the hierarchy of the EDN, comprising the upper level PDS  and associated upper level DNNC component , also can be referred to as a smart distribution management system (SDMS); a mid level of the hierarchy of the EDN, comprising the mid level PDS(s) (e.g., ) and associated mid level DNNC component(s) (e.g., ), also can be referred to as a smart mini distribution management system (SmDMS); and the lower level of the hierarchy of the EDN, comprising the lower level PDS(s) (e.g., ) and associated lower level DNNC component(s) (e.g., ), also can be referred to as a smart micro distribution management system (SmDMS).

In accordance with various aspects, the system  can manage data collection, archiving, and retrieval to facilitate reducing or minimizing communication latency of data flow between control nodes in various levels of the hierarchy. As more fully disclosed herein, the system  can employ two-way communication at each level of the hierarchy, wherein each level of the hierarchy can employ respective communication standards and protocols, as well as respective communication bandwidths.","It is to be appreciated and understood that, in accordance with various non-limiting embodiments, while the DNNCs and PDSs have respectively been referred to as upper level DNNC component, upper level PDS, mid level DNNC component, mid level PDS, lower level DNNC component, and lower level PDS, as desired, the respective components also can be referred to as a first level DNNC component, first level PDS, second level DNNC component, second level PDS, third level DNNC component, or third level PDS.

Further, the terms \u201cparent\u201d or \u201csenior\u201d can indicate a higher level DNNC component and the terms \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cjunior\u201d can indicate a DNNC component (e.g., lower level DNNC component) or PDS that is at a lower level in the hierarchy than the higher level (e.g., \u201cparent\u201d or \u201csenior\u201d) DNNC or PDS, and the term \u201ctier\u201d can be used as an alternative to the term \u201clevel\u201d, as desired.","In an aspect, the disclosed subject matter can employ the communication control and power distribution control exercised by the lower level nodes to facilitate maximizing the net power consumption of the CCNs at the lower hierarchy level of the EDN so that there is reduced or minimal involvement of the upper level nodes of the EDN in supplying of power to the CCNs associated with a lower level PDS and lower level DNNC component. The lower level DNNC  can control the power distribution associated with the lower level PDS  to the CCNs  and  with reduced or minimal involvement of the mid level PDS  and associated mid level DNNC component , and upper level PDS  and associated upper level DNNC component , in supplying of power to the CCNs associated with a lower level PDS and lower level DNNC component, in accordance with aspects disclosed herein. In another aspect, the mid level DNNC component  can control the power distribution associated with the mid level PDS  to the lower level PDSs (e.g., ) (and thereby the CCNs (e.g., , ) respectively associated therewith), with reduced or minimal involvement of the upper level PDS  and associated upper level DNNC component , in management of power distribution associated with a mid level PDS and mid level DNNC component, in accordance with aspects disclosed herein.","For example, the lower level DNNC component  can control power distribution by the lower level PDS  to route excess or available power from a local PDS, such as local PDS  (e.g., solar power generation system) (depicted in  with a dotted line to indicate the local PDS  may or may not be part of system  and\/or connected to lower level PDS ), associated with a CCN (e.g., ) from the local PDS  to another CCN (e.g., ) associated with the lower level PDS  via the lower level PDS  without having to involve the higher level PDSs (e.g., upper level PDS , mid level PDS ) or higher level DNNC components (e.g., upper level DNNC component , mid level DNNC component ) (e.g., without having to transfer power from the mid level PDS  to the other CCN  via the lower level PDS ), for example, when sufficient power is available from the local PDS , or can minimally involve the higher level PDS(s) to transfer only the amount of power to the other CCN  needed to make up for any amount of power that the local PDS  cannot supply to the other CCN . As a result, there can be a reduction in unnecessary and wasteful transferring of electrical power via power lines from the nodes higher up in the hierarchy in the EDN when there is more local electrical power available for distribution by the lower level nodes, which can reduce the undesired (e.g., unnecessary) costs incurred due to the undesired power transfers and wear and tear on assets (e.g., power lines, transformers, etc.) and reduce undesired energy losses due in part to the heating of assets which drains off energy while transferring that power.","As another example, the CCNs  and , and or other CCNs (not shown) in the lower level, may each have PEV or PHEV and attempt to plug them in to access the EDN at the same time, wherein the power demanded by the plugging in of all of these vehicles at the same time can be more power than the maximum power rating of the lower level PDS  (above which could result in damage or destruction of the PDS) or more power than is available from the various power sources (e.g., upper and or mid level PDSs, local PDSs) providing power to the portion of the EDN for which the lower level PDS  distributes power. The lower level DNNC , employing the ECC  and\/or other components (e.g., sensors) can detect that the amount of power demanded by the CCNs exceeds the amount of power that can be provided, and can desirably control power distribution to the CCNs, in accordance with the predefined control criteria, so that the lower level PDS  is not negatively affected (e.g., damaged or destroyed) and\/or available power is desirably distributed (e.g., apportioned) among the CCNs. For instance, the lower level DNNC  can send control information to the lower level PDS  to control power distribution of the lower level PDS  so that the lower level PDS  shares the available power among the CCNs (e.g., by distributing power in short time intervals to respective CCNs in accordance with a revolving round-robin scheduling algorithm), and\/or can send a request to one or more of the CCNs requesting that the respectively associated consumers discontinue charging their respective vehicles at that time (e.g., in accordance with a power consumption agreement with the consumer, which may or may not provide an incentive for discontinuing or reducing power consumption in response to a request to do so), for a specified period of time or until further instruction.","As still another example, if power to the lower level PDS  from the mid level PDS  or upper level PDS  is interrupted (e.g., due to power outage at the sub-station or power generation plant, or due to the transmission lines or other components associated with delivering power to the lower level PDS being impaired), the lower level DNNC  can identify whether there is any power available from local PDSs, such as local PDS , located in the lowest level of the multi-level EDN, and can allocate any available power in accordance with the predefined control criteria. For instance, power can be allocated to CCNs (e.g., , ) in accordance of priority of power needs of respective CCNs located within the portion of the lower level controlled by the lower level DNNC , where, for example, a CCN having a consumer (e.g., hospital, person with medical care needs living at his\/her residence) needing power for medical reasons (e.g., to operate electronic medical equipment) can have priority over other consumers in other CCNs with regard to allocation of the available power, when in accordance with the predefined control criteria.","In yet another example, the lower level DNNC  can identify a device, such as a PEV, PHEV, communication device (e.g., laptop computer, mobile phone), portable electrical appliance, etc., that is being plugged in to an outlet associated with a CCN (e.g., , ) that is remote from a home location (e.g., residence) of the consumer who owns the device using a data tag, device identifier (ID), authentication credentials, etc., associated with the device, in accordance with the predefined control criteria. For example, a consumer can plug his device (e.g., PEV, PHEV) into an outlet at a remote location (e.g., a CCN, such as a local restaurant) that provides a battery charging service and the DNNC associated with the remote outlet can detect the data tag, device ID, or authentication credentials (e.g., credentials stored on the device or received from the consumer) associated with the device, identify the consumer associated with the device based at least in part on the data tag, device ID or authentication credentials, and can bill the account of that consumer for power provided to the consumer's device by the outlet of that remote location, when in accordance with the predefined control criteria. Additionally or alternatively, a consumer can be required to provide payment (e.g., using credit, debit or gift card, cash) to the remote location in order to utilize the remote outlet of the remote location for charging the device.","It is to be appreciated and understood that, while not shown in , a CCN (e.g., , ) can comprise an enhanced consumer meter (ECM) (e.g., smart meter or other meter comprising AMI) (not shown) that can track consumption of power by the CCN (and\/or generation of power by a local PDS (e.g., ) associated with the CCN) and can communicate information related to power usage or generation to the associated lower level DNNC component  via a specified communication channel and communication technology (e.g., wireless or wireline communication), in accordance with predefined communication channel selection criteria, to facilitate enabling the lower level DNNC component  to desirably control power distribution by the lower level PDS , and\/or DNNC components higher up in the hierarchy to control power distribution of their respective portions of the EDN. Also, the CCN can comprise an intelligent climate control system (not shown) that can automatically control, or be employed to manually control, the climate conditions of the physical space of the CCN in response to control information received from the consumer or a DNNC (e.g., upper, mid, or lower DNNC received via the lower level DNNC).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","302","304","306","308","302","304","306"]},"In an aspect, the upper level DNNC component , mid level DNNC component , and lower level DNNC component  each can be associated with (e.g., connected to) a communication network  that can facilitate wired and wireless communication between the upper level DNNC component , mid level DNNC component , lower level DNNC component , and CCN , associated with the communication network .
