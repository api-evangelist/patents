The variable region binds to and interacts with a target antigen. The variable region includes a complementary determinusng region (CDR) that recognizes and binds to a specific binding site on a particular antigen. The constant region may be recognized by and interact with the immune system. An antibody can be of any type or class (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, and IgA) or subclass (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2). The antibody can be derived from any suitable species. In some embodiments, the antibody is of human or murine origin. An antibody can be, for example, human, humanized or chimeric.","As used herein, the terms \u201cspecifically binds\u201d and \u201cspecific binding\u201d refer to antibody binding to a predetermined antigen. Typically, the antibody binds with an affinity of at least about 1\u00d710M, and binds to the predetermined antigen with an affinity that is at least two-fold greater than its affinity for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., Bovine Serum Albumin, casein) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related antigen.","As used herein, the term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally-occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts and includes \u201cchimeric\u201d antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and\/or light chain is identical to or homologous with the corresponding sequence of antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical to or homologous with the corresponding sequences of antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. The modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method.","As used herein, an \u201cintact antibody\u201d is one which comprises an antigen-binding variable region as well as a light chain constant domain (C) and heavy chain constant domains, C, C, Cand C, as appropriate for the antibody class. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g., human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variants thereof.","As used herein, the term an \u201cintact antibody\u201d may have one or more \u201ceffector functions\u201d, which refers to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (e.g., a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include complement dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (AMCC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis.","As used herein, the term an \u201cantibody fragment\u201d comprises a portion of an intact antibody, preferably comprising the antigen-binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), and Fv fragments, di-abodies, tri-abodies, tetrabodies, linear antibodies, single-chain antibody molecules, scFv, scFv-Fc, multi-specific antibody fragments formed from antibody fragment(s), a fragment(s) produced by a Fab expression library, or an epitope-binding fragments of any of the above which immuno specifically bind to a target antigen (e.g., a cancer cell antigen, a viral antigen or a microbial antigen).","As used herein, the term \u201cvariable\u201d in the context of an antibody refers to certain portions of the variable domains of the antibody that differ extensively in sequence and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. This variability is concentrated in three segments called \u201chypervariable regions\u201d in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the Framework Regions (FRs). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs connected by three hypervariable regions.","As used herein, the term \u201chypervariable region\u201d when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues from a \u201ccomplementarity determining region\u201d or \u201cCDR\u201d (e.g., residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (L3) in the heavy chain variable domain, and\/or those residues from a \u201chypervariable loop\u201d (e.g., residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (142) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain. FR residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.","As used herein, a \u201csingle-chain Fv\u201d or \u201cscFv\u201d antibody fragment comprises the Vand Vdomains of an antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Typically, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the Vand Vdomains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding.","As used herein, the term \u201cdi-abody\u201d refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a variable heavy domain (V) connected to a variable light domain (V) in the same polypeptide chain. By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites.","As used herein, \u201cHumanized\u201d forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.","As used herein, \u201cisolated\u201d means separated from other components of (a) a natural source, such as a plant or animal cell or cell culture, or (b) a synthetic organic chemical reaction mixture. As used herein, \u201cpurified\u201d means that when isolated, the isolate contains at least 95%, and in another aspect at least 98%, of a compound (e.g., a conjugate) by weight of the isolate.","As used herein, an \u201cisolated\u201d antibody is one which has been identified and separated and\/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.","As used herein, an antibody which \u201cinduces apoptosis\u201d is one which induces programmed cell death as determined by binding of annexin V, fragmentation of DNA, cell shrinkage, dilation of endoplasmic reticulum, cell fragmentation, and\/or formation of membrane vesicles (called apoptotic bodies). The cell is a tumor cell, e.g., a breast, ovarian, stomach, endometrial, salivary gland, lung, kidney, colon, thyroid, pancreatic or bladder cell. Various methods are available for evaluating the cellular events associated with apoptosis. For example, phosphatidyl serine (PS) translocation can be measured by annexin binding; DNA fragmentation can be evaluated through DNA laddering; and nuclear\/chromatin condensation along with DNA fragmentation can be evaluated by any increase in hypodiploid cells.","As used herein, the term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount of a medicant effective to treat a disease or disorder in a mammal. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the medicant may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and\/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the medicant may inhibit the growth of and\/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and\/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can, for example, be measured by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and\/or determining the response rate (RR).","As used herein, the term \u201csubstantial amount\u201d refers to a majority, i.e. greater than approximately fifty per cent (50%) of a population, of a mixture or a sample. In this range approximately means plus or minus ten per cent (10%).","As used herein, the term \u201cintracellular metabolite\u201d refers to a compound resulting from a metabolic process or reaction inside a cell on an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate (e.g., an Antibody Drug Conjugate (AMC)). The metabolic process or reaction may be an enzymatic process such as proteolytic cleavage of a peptide linker of the AMC. Intracellular metabolites include, but are not limited to, antibodies and free medicant which have undergone intracellular cleavage after entry, diffusion, uptake or transport into a cell.","As used herein, the terms \u201cintracellularly cleaved\u201d and \u201cintracellular cleavage\u201d refer to a metabolic process or reaction inside a cell on an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate (e.g., an Antibody Medicant conjugate (AMC) or the like), whereby the covalent attachment, e.g., the linker, between the Medicant moiety (M) and the Affinity unit (e.g., an antibody (Ab)) is broken, resulting in the free Medicant, or other metabolite of the conjugate dissociated from the antibody inside the cell. The cleaved moieties of the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate are thus intracellular metabolites.","As used herein, the term \u201cbioavailability\u201d refers to the systemic availability (i.e., blood\/plasma levels) of a given amount of a medicant administered to a patient. Bioavailability is an absolute term that indicates measurement of both the time (rate) and total amount (extent) of medicant that reaches the general circulation from an administered dosage form.","As used herein, the term \u201ccytotoxic activity\u201d refers to a cell-killing, a cytostatic or an anti-proliferative effect of an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate or an intracellular metabolite of an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate. Cytotoxic activity may be expressed as the ICvalue, which is the concentration (molar or mass) per unit volume at which half the cells survive.","As used herein, the term \u201ccytotoxic agent\u201d as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or inhibits the function of cells and\/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes (e.g., At, I, I, Y, Re, Re, Sm, Bi, P, C, and radioactive isotopes of Lu), chemotherapeutic agents, and toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including synthetic analogs and derivatives thereof. In one aspect, the term does not include a radioactive isotope(s).","As used herein, a \u201cdisorder\u201d is any condition that would benefit from treatment with an Affinity Medicant Linker Conjugate. This includes chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which predispose a mammal to the disorder in question. Non-limiting examples of disorders to be treated herein include benign and malignant cancers; leukemia and lymphoid malignancies, neuronal, glial, astrocytal, hypothalamic and other glandular, macrophagal, epithelial, stromal and blastocoelic disorders; and inflammatory, angiogenic and immunologic disorders.","As used herein, the terms \u201ccancer\u201d and \u201ccancerous\u201d refer to or describe the physiological condition or disorder in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. A \u201ctumor\u201d comprises one or more cancerous cells.","As used herein, an \u201cautoimmune disease\u201d herein is a disease or disorder arising from and directed against an individual's own tissues or a co-segregate or manifestation thereof or resulting condition therefrom.","As used herein, an example of a \u201cpatient\u201d includes, but is not limited to, a human, rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, pig, goat, cow, horse, dog, cat, bird and fowl. In an exemplary embodiment, the patient is a human.","As used herein, the terms \u201ctreat\u201d or \u201ctreatment,\u201d unless otherwise indicated by context, refer to therapeutic treatment and prophylactic measures to prevent relapse, wherein the object is to inhibit or slow down (lessen) an undesired physiological change or disorder, such as the development or spread of cancer. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. \u201cTreatment\u201d can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already having the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder.","As used herein, in the context of cancer, the term \u201ctreating\u201d includes any or all of inhibiting growth of tumor cells, cancer cells, or of a tumor; inhibiting replication of tumor cells or cancer cells, lessening of overall tumor burden or decreasing the number of cancerous cells, and ameliorating one or more symptoms associated with the disease.","As used herein, in the context of an autoimmune disease, the term \u201ctreating\u201d includes any or all of inhibiting replication of cells associated with an autoimmune disease state including, but not limited to, cells that produce an autoimmune antibody, lessening the autoimmune-antibody burden and ameliorating one or more symptoms of an autoimmune disease.","As used herein, in the context of an infectious disease, the term \u201ctreating\u201d includes any or all of inhibiting the growth, multiplication or replication of the pathogen that causes the infectious disease and ameliorating one or more symptoms of an infectious disease.","As used herein, the term \u201cpackage insert\u201d is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indication(s), usage, dosage, administration, contraindications and\/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products.","As used herein, a \u201cnative sequence\u201d polypeptide is one which has the same amino acid sequence as a polypeptide, e.g., a tumor-associated antigen receptor, derived from nature. Such native sequence polypeptides can be isolated from nature or can be produced by recombinant or synthetic means. Thus, a native sequence polypeptide can have the amino acid sequence of a naturally-occurring human polypeptide, a murine polypeptide, or a polypeptide from any other mammalian species.","As used herein, an \u201cisolated\u201d nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the nucleic acid. An isolated nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However, an isolated nucleic acid molecule includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the nucleic acid where, for example, the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.","As used herein, the expression \u201ccontrol sequences\u201d refers to nucleic acid sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.","As used herein, a nucleic acid is \u201coperably linked\u201d when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a pre-sequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA encoding a polypeptide if it is expressed as a pre-protein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence, for example, if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, \u201coperably linked\u201d means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking can be accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers can be used in accordance with conventional practice.","As used herein, the terms \u201ccell,\u201d \u201ccell line,\u201d and \u201ccell culture\u201d are used interchangeably and all such designations include progeny. The words \u201ctransformants\u201d and \u201ctransformed cells\u201d include the primary subject cell and cultures or progeny derived therefrom without regard for the number of transfers. It is also understood that all progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content, due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Mutant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened for in the originally transformed cell are included. Where distinct designations are intended, it will be clear from the context.","As used herein, the term \u201cchiral\u201d refers to molecules which have the property of non-superimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term \u201cachiral\u201d refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.","As used herein, the term \u201cstereoisomers\u201d refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.","As used herein, \u201cdiastereomer\u201d refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g., melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.","The abbreviations used herein have their conventional meaning within the chemical and biological arts. The chemical structures and formulae set forth herein are constructed according to the standard rules of chemical valency known in the chemical arts.","Where substituent groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulae, written from left to right, they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents that would result from writing the structure from right to left, e.g., \u2014CHO\u2014 is equivalent to \u2014OCH\u2014.","The term \u201calkyl,\u201d by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a straight (i.e., unbranched) or branched chain, or combination thereof, which may be fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include di- and multivalent radicals, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e., C-Cmeans one to ten carbons). Examples of saturated hydrocarbon radicals include, but are not limited to, groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, (cyclohexyl)methyl, homologs and isomers of, for example, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, and the like. An unsaturated alkyl group is one having one or more double bonds or triple bonds. Examples of unsaturated alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, vinyl, 2-propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2-(butadienyl), 2,4-pentadienyl, 3-(1,4-pentadienyl), ethynyl, 1- and 3-propynyl, 3-butynyl, and the higher homologs and isomers. An alkoxy is an alkyl attached to the remainder of the molecule via an oxygen linker (\u2014O\u2014).","The term \u201calkylene,\u201d by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a divalent radical derived from an alkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by, \u2014CHCHCHCH\u2014. Typically, an alkyl (or alkylene) group will have from 1 to 24 carbon atoms, with those groups having 10 or fewer carbon atoms being preferred in the present invention. A \u201clower alkyl\u201d or \u201clower alkylene\u201d is a shorter chain alkyl or alkylene group, generally having eight or fewer carbon atoms.","The term \u201cheteroalkyl,\u201d by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain, or combinations thereof, consisting of at least one carbon atom and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, N, P, Si, and S, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized, and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) O, N, P, S, and Si may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which the alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are not limited to: \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014O\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014NH\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014N(CH)\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2014S\u2014CH\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2014CH, \u2014S(O)\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014S(O)\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2550CH\u2014O\u2014CH, \u2014Si(CH), \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2550N\u2014OCH, \u2014CH\u2550CH\u2014N(CH)\u2014CH, \u2014O\u2014CH, \u2014O\u2014CH\u2014CH, and \u2014CN. Up to two heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for example, \u2014CH\u2014NH\u2014OCH.","Similarly, the term \u201cheteroalkylene,\u201d by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by, \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014S\u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014and \u2014CH\u2014S\u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014NH\u2014CH\u2014. For heteroalkylene groups, heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example, the formula \u2014C(O)R\u2032\u2014 represents both \u2014C(O)R\u2032\u2014 and \u2014R\u2032C(O)\u2014. As described above, heteroalkyl groups, as used herein, include those groups that are attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom, such as \u2014C(O)R\u2032, \u2014C(O)NR\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014OR, \u2014SR\u2032, and\/or \u2014SOR\u2032. Where \u201cheteroalkyl\u201d is recited, followed by recitations of specific heteroalkyl groups, such as \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033 or the like, it will be understood that the terms heteroalkyl and \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033 are not redundant or mutually exclusive. Rather, the specific heteroalkyl groups are recited to add clarity. Thus, the term \u201cheteroalkyl\u201d should not be interpreted herein as excluding specific heteroalkyl groups, such as \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033 or the like.","The terms \u201ccycloalkyl\u201d and \u201cheterocycloalkyl,\u201d by themselves or in combination with other terms, mean, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of \u201calkyl\u201d and \u201cheteroalkyl,\u201d respectively. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like. Examples of heterocycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, 1-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl), 1-piperidinyl, 2-piperidinyl, 3-piperidinyl, 4-morpholinyl, 3-morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuran-2-yl, tetrahydrofuran-3-yl, tetrahydrothien-2-yl, tetrahydrothien-3-yl, 1-piperazinyl, 2-piperazinyl, and the like. A \u201ccycloalkylene\u201d and a \u201cheterocycloalkylene,\u201d alone or as part of another substituent, means a divalent radical derived from a cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl, respectively.","The terms \u201chalo\u201d or \u201chalogen,\u201d by themselves or as part of another substituent, mean, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally, terms such as \u201chaloalkyl\u201d are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For example, the term \u201chalo(C-C)alkyl\u201d includes, but is not limited to, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 4-chlorobutyl, and 3-bromopropyl.","The term \u201cacyl\u201d means, unless otherwise stated, \u2014C(O)R where R is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, or substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl.","The term \u201caryl\u201d means, unless otherwise stated, a polyunsaturated, aromatic, hydrocarbon substituent, which can be a single ring or multiple rings (preferably from 1 to 3 rings) that are fused together (i.e., a fused ring aryl) or linked covalently. A fused ring aryl refers to multiple rings fused together wherein at least one of the fused rings is an aryl ring. The term \u201cheteroaryl\u201d refers to aryl groups (or rings) that contain from one to four heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized. Thus, the term \u201cheteroaryl\u201d includes fused ring heteroaryl groups (i.e., multiple rings fused together wherein at least one of the fused rings is a heteroaromatic ring). A 5,6-fused ring heteroarylene refers to two rings fused together, wherein one ring has 5 members and the other ring has 6 members, and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. Likewise, a 6,6-fused ring heteroarylene refers to two rings fused together, wherein one ring has 6 members and the other ring has 6 members, and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. And a 6,5-fused ring heteroarylene refers to two rings fused together, wherein one ring has 6 members and the other ring has 5 members, and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a carbon or heteroatom. Non-limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 4-biphenyl, 1-pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl, pyrazinyl, 2-oxazolyl, 4-oxazolyl, 2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl, 5-oxazolyl, 3-isoxazolyl, 4-isoxazolyl, 5-isoxazolyl, 2-thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl, 5-thiazolyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 4-pyrimidyl, 5-benzothiazolyl, purinyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 5-indolyl, 1-isoquinolyl, 5-isoquinolyl, 2-quinoxalinyl, 5-quinoxalinyl, 3-quinolyl, and 6-quinolyl.

When R\u2032 and R\u2033 are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033 includes, but is not limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term \u201calkyl\u201d is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g., \u2014CFand \u2014CHCF) and acyl (e.g., \u2014C(O)CH, \u2014C(O)CF, \u2014C(O)CHOCH, and the like).","Similar to the substituents described for the alkyl radical, substituents for the aryl and heteroaryl groups are varied and are selected from, for example: \u2014OR\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014SR\u2032, -halogen, \u2014SiR\u2032R\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014OC(O)R\u2032, \u2014C(O)R\u2032, \u2014COR\u2032, \u2014CONR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014OC(O)NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033C(O)R\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032\u2014C(O)NR\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033C(O)R\u2032, \u2014NR\u2014C(NR\u2032R\u2033R\u2032\u2033)\u2550NR\u2033\u2032, \u2014NR\u2014C(NR\u2032R\u2033)\u2550NR\u2032\u2033, \u2014S(O)R\u2032, \u2014S(O)R\u2032, \u2014S(O)NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NRSOR\u2032, \u2014CN, \u2014NO, \u2014R\u2032, \u2014N, \u2014CH(Ph), fluoro(C-C)alkoxy, and fluoro(C-C)alkyl, in a number ranging from zero to the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system; and where R\u2032, R\u2033, R\u2032\u2033, and R\u2033\u2033 are preferably independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl.

Chemotherapy has exerted a predominant role in increasing life spans for patients with a variety of tumors including Burkitt's lymphoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia and Hodgkin's disease. Further, new cancer chemotherapeutic agents and methods of care combined with early detection and treatment have resulted in decreases in the overall incidence of cancer and decreases in the death rates from all cancers combined. Responsive tumors represent only a small fraction of the various types of cancer. Further, agents such as cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, 5-fluorouracil and hexamethylmelamine, which are highly active against clinical solid tumors, are limited. Thus, patients with many types of malignancies remain at significant risk for relapse and mortality. After relapse, some patients can be re-induced into remission with their initial treatment regimen. However, higher doses of the initial chemotherapeutic agent or the use of additional agents are frequently required, indicating the development of at least partial medicant resistance. Evidence indicates medicant resistance can develop simultaneously to several agents, including medicant resistance to treatments to which the patient was not exposed. The development of multiple-medicant resistant tumors may be a function of tumor mass and constitutes a major cause of treatment failure. To overcome this medicant resistance, high-dose chemotherapy with or without radiation and allogenic or autologous bone marrow transplantation can be employed. The high-dose chemotherapy may employ the original medicant(s) or be altered to include additional agents. As a result, there remain many cancer patients for whom no or minimally effective therapy exists. Accordingly, there is a need for the development of novel chemotherapeutics with greater efficacy or safety, either as monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, and such agents with the potential to overcome medicant resistance in cancer cells.","Illudins are toxic natural products produced by mushrooms of the genus (). Syn-Illudins are semi-synthetic derivatives of Illudins. Acylfulvenes are also semi-synthetic derivatives of Illudins. Syn-Illudins and Acylfulvenes have each been chemically modified at select sites to allow their use as medicants. The modifications in the Syn-Illudins do not alter any of the cyclic rings (cyclopropane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane) of the basic Illudin chemical structure (). The modifications of Acylfulvenes differ from Syn-Illudins in that an additional double bond (an unsaturated bond) has been created in the 5 membered (cyclopentane) ring (, ).","Illudins function as alkylating agents that damage DNA and thereby block transcription. The blockage can be repaired through nucleotide excision. The toxicity of the illudins has prevented any applications in human tumor therapy. Acylfulvenes have been developed which exhibit promising antitumor activity with a better safety profile, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,439,936; 5,523,490 and 6,380,403 which are each herein expressly incorporated by reference in their entireties. Irofulven or 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (see ) is an analog of illudin S which has demonstrated clinical activity with an acceptable safety profile in hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Most relevant to clinical applications, irofulven activity is independent of common resistance mechanisms such as the multi-medicant resistance phenotype, anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) (SEQ. ID. 056) over expression, as well as tumor protein 53 (p53) (SEQ. ID. 057) and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21\/WAF1) (SEQ. ID. 058) mutations (see  and Table XIV).","Growth factors, including peptides and proteins are critical mediators of a wide range of cell-cell communication. They are important endocrine, paracrine and autocrine messengers. Growth factors function as neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, regulate chemotaxis, immune function, development, cell growth, and can influence tumor cells. The receptors that recognize growth factors are highly selective and define specific cell populations. As a result, growth factor receptors are a large and important class of medicant (including drug) targets. In addition to physiologic noncancerous cell populations, these receptors can also be expressed in various cancer cell populations.","A polypeptide is a long, continuous, and unbranched chain of amino acids. A glycol-peptide is a peptide that contains one or more carbohydrate moieties covalently attached to the side chains of specific amino acids. A pro-peptide, is an inactive peptide that can be turned into an active form through a post translational modification that enzymatically cleaves the pro-peptide. Examples include pro-insulin (SEQ. ID. 059) and pro-opiomelanocortin (SEQ. ID. 060). Enzymatically cleaving the pro-peptide, allows for the peptide to be available on short notice and\/or in large quantities. Some pro-peptides are secreted from the cell. Many of these are synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide that targets the pro-peptide for secretion.","Cytokines are small proteins (approximately 5 to 20 kDa) that affect the behavior of other cells, and sometimes the releasing cell itself and are thereby important in cell signaling (see Table XIV). Many specific cytokines can be released by a variety of different kinds of cells, e.g., macrophages, B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, mast cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and various stromal cells. Cytokines act through specific receptors, and are important in the humoral and cell-based immune responses. Cytokines also regulate the maturation, growth, and responsiveness of specific cell populations. Cytokines circulate in much higher concentrations than hormones and in contrast with hormones are made by a variety of different kinds of cells. Cytokines are important in host responses to infection, immune responses, inflammation, trauma, sepsis, cancer, and reproduction. As a result, cytokine receptors are upregulated in many forms of cancers.","A steroid is an organic compound that contains four cycloalkane rings joined to each other. Examples of steroids include the dietary lipid cholesterol and the sex hormones estradiol and testosterone. The core of a steroid molecule is composed of seventeen carbon atoms bonded together that take the form of four fused rings: three six-carbon atom rings and one five-carbon atom ring. A variety of functional groups can be attached to the four-ring core. Steroids can also vary depending on the oxidation state of the rings. A steroid hormone is a steroid that acts as a hormone. Steroid hormones can be grouped into five groups (glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens, estrogens, and progesterones) based on the receptors to which they bind. Steroid hormones, particularly androgens, are essential not only for growth and development but also in the progression of many forms of cancer. As a result, steroid hormone receptors are upregulated in many forms of cancers.","The retinoic acid receptor (RAR) is a nuclear receptor which can also act as a transcription factor. The RAR can be activated by either all-trans retinoic acid or 9-cis retinoic acid. There are three RAR isoforms (alpha (SEQ. ID. 061), beta (SEQ. ID. 062), and gamma (SEQ. ID. 063)), each encoded by separate genes, where splice variants generate still further diversity in the expressed receptor. The retinoid X receptor (RXR) is a nuclear receptor activated by 9-cis retinoic acid. There are also three RXR isoforms (alpha (SEQ. ID. 064), beta (SEQ. ID. 065), and gamma (SEQ. ID. 066)), each encoded by separate genes. RXR hetero-dimerizes with subfamily 1 nuclear receptors including RAR. In the absence of ligand, the RAR\/RXR dimer binds to retinoic acid response elements complexes with a co-repressor protein. Binding of agonist ligands to RAR results in dissociation of the co-repressor and recruitment of a co-activator protein that, in turn, promotes transcription of the downstream target gene into mRNA and thereby protein or other RNA signaling mechanisms.","Lipid metabolism is altered in many forms of cancer, including upregulation of de novo lipid synthesis. Cancer cells can also use alternative enzymes and pathways to facilitate the production of fatty acids. These newly synthesized lipids may support a number of cellular processes to promote cancer cell proliferation and survival. Elaidic acid or (E)-octadec-9-enoic acid is the trans isomer of oleic acid and is found in small quantities in caprine milk, bovine milk and some meats. It increases Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) (SEQ. ID. 067) activity, which in turn raises levels of very low density lipoprotein and lowers levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. CETP is found in plasma, where it is involved in the transfer of cholesteryl ester from HDL to other lipoproteins. Defects in the CETP gene are a cause of hyperalphalipoproteinemia 1.","An antibody is a protein made up of four peptide chains disulfide linked together to form a \u201cY\u201d-shape. Antibodies are produced by plasma cells and are used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign antigens such as bacteria and viruses. The antibody recognizes a unique part of the antigen using each FAB portion of the protein (i.e., the tip of the \u201cY\u201d portion of the antibody), allowing a specific high affinity binding interaction to occur. The binding interaction of different antibodies can target specific antigen epitopes. An antibody fragment containing one or both FAB portions can also target specific antigen epitopes.","The ability of the Illudin, Syn-Illudin and Acylfulvene analogs to inhibit tumor cell growth is shown in Table XV. The MV522 cell line is a lung-derived adenocarcinoma cell line. In various embodiments of the invention, the MV522 cell line represents a \u201ctarget\u201d cell line. That is an Illudin, Syn-Illudin or Acylfulvene analog that exhibits toxicity against this solid tumor cell line shows a desirable result. The 8392B cell line represents a hematopoietic (non-solid) cell line. In various embodiments of the invention, the 8392B cell line is considered a \u201cnontarget\u201d cell line. The two hour toxicity data represents the concentration of a given analog for which a two hour exposure will inhibit 50% of the DNA synthesis activity in a given cell line. The 48 hour exposure data represents the concentration at which a given analog with a 48 hour exposure will inhibit the growth or viability in a given cell line as defined by the standard Trypan Blue Exclusion assay. As an example, analog  () will inhibit the target MV522 cell line at 110 nM with only a 2 hour exposure but has no inhibitory effect on the nontarget 8392B cell line at 26,000 nM (26 \u03bcM). Analog  with a prolonged exposure period (e.g. 48 hours) can eventually inhibit the nontarget cell line. In contrast, Analog  () will inhibit the target. MV522 cell line with only a 2 hour exposure (IC50=360 nM) but has minimal effect on the 8392B cell nontarget line with even a 48 hour exposure (IC50=26,0000 nM) indicating superior anticancer activity as a monotherapeutic agent. In contrast to these two analogs, analog  () displayed minimal toxicity as well as no differential toxicity between the target and nontarget cell line indicating it would have minimal properties as a monotherapeutic anticancer agent.","As used herein, a \u201cgrowth factor\u201d or an \u201canti-angiogenic protein\u201d includes Adrenomedullin (SEQ.

Most of these patient's cancers become refractory to standard chemotherapy and\/or radiation treatment regimens. The prognosis for these patients is poor and long term survival rates for metastatic solid tumor cancers remain very low. Thus, there is a need for the development of novel agents and treatment regimens that specifically target these recurring tumor cells and also produce less systemic toxicity. Target therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies, now provide a promising alternative to the conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy approach.","Monoclonal antibody based therapy has recently achieved considerable success in oncology and there are currently nine monoclonal antibodies (without a medicant attached) approved by the FDA as cancer therapeutics. As an example, HERCEPTIN\u00ae and RITUXAN\u00ae (both produced by Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif.), are used to successfully treat breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively. HERCEPTIN\u00ae is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal antibody selectively binding to the extracellular domain of the Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) proto-oncogene whereas RITUXAN\u00ae is a genetically engineered chimeric murine\/human monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen overexpressed on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes.","Recent clinical evidence indicates that while the monoclonal antibody based therapies are effective at inducing remission, they do not always produce a complete cure, and relapses eventually occur in most patients. There is now a tremendous interest in the use of antibody medicant conjugates as a class of therapeutics that utilize the antigen-selectivity of monoclonal antibodies to deliver potent cytotoxic medicants to specific tumor cells. Antibody medicant conjugates are produced by attaching a cytotoxic agent to an antibody that binds specifically to a tumor-associated antigen.","In theory, antibody medicant conjugates can confer an increased therapeutic index to highly potent medicants by improving therapeutic efficacy and reducing systemic toxicity (by minimizing damage to normal tissues), although this goal has been elusive in achieving. The basis for the efficacy of antibody medicant conjugates is that they target tumor cells that preferentially express an antigen that is recognized by the associated antibody. In contrast, non-tumor cells either fail to express this antigen, or express the antigen at a very low level. In theory, only the tumor cells expressing the associated antibody are recognized and destroyed by the AMC, and other cells are left untouched and undamaged.","While different medicant classes have been tried for delivery via antibodies, only a few have proved efficacious for use as antibody medicant conjugates. The two main medicant classes used to date to produce antibody medicant conjugates are the auristatins (MMAE\/N-methylvaline-valine-dolaisoleuine-dolaproine-norephedrine or MMAF\/N-methylvaline-valine-dolaisoleuine-dolaproine-phenylalanine) and the maytansines (DM1 or DM4). Currently only two antibody medicant conjugates are approved by the U.S.F.D.A. and marketed; brentuximab vedotin (auristatin based) and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (maytansine based).","Illudins (see , where R\u2550CHOH or OH), Syn-illudins (see , where X or Y\u2550C, N, S, O and Z\u2550O or NH or NOH), and Acylfulvenes (see  and , where X\u2550C, N, S, O and n>1) have several unique properties over agents traditional used to make antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). Firstly, these are the only agents known to function by inhibition of the DNA transcription-coupled repair pathway (see ). No other toxin, drug or medicant inhibits this pathway. The result is that Illudins, Syn-illudins, and Acylfulvenes are true cytotoxic agents whereas other agents traditionally used to produce ADCs (pyrrolobenzodiazepines, maytansines, fumagillols, dolstatins, auristatins, enadiynes, halichondrins, and tubulysins) are only cytostatic. In the NCI-DTP 60 cell line panel these other agents were capable of inhibiting tumor cell growth (ICvalue), had some ability to block tumor cell growth (TGI value) but none were capable of actually causing tumor cell death or cytotoxicity (Table XIII). The illudin derivatives, however, are capable of killing tumor cells at nanomolar concentrations (Table XIII). This means that while ADCs developed using other toxins can stall tumor cell growth, they cannot actually kill the tumor cell. Once the effect of the drug has worn off the tumor cells will again grow and kill the patient. In contrast, the Illudins, Syn-illudins, and Acylfulvenes actually kill the tumor cell with as little as a 2 hour exposure (see ). Secondly, whereas tumor cells will undergo apoptosis or cell death with hours once the DNA transcription-coupled repair pathway is blocked, normal diploid non-tumor cells can survive for hours. This translates into a wide therapeutic window for ADCs developed with Illudins, Syn-illudins, and Acylfulvenes. The two ADC agents currently FDA approved for administration deliver a dose of the associated toxin that is 300% higher than a lethal dose which is why these agents have severe systemic toxicity. In contrast, the comparable ADC developed with Illudins, Syn-illudins, or Acylfulvenes will deliver a dose of the associated toxin that is 40% of a known non-toxic dose (estimated at 28% of a toxic dose and only 12% of a lethal dose). Thus, ADCS developed with Illudins, Syn-illudins, and Acylfulvenes will have minimal systemic toxicity as compared to current agents. Thirdly, these agents are stable down to a pH of 2.0. An ADC is engulfed by a tumor cell, transported to the endosomes (pH<6.0) and then into the lysozomes (pH<4). Many agents used for ADCs will degrade in these low pH environment, whereas Illudins, Syn-illudins, and Acylfulvenes are stable. 4) Cancer cells can become resistant to various toxins and drugs through the development of what is termed multi-drug resistance. This process is known to occur through several different mechanisms. Whereas other toxins and drugs are substrates for the most common MDR mechanisms (MDR1\/gp170 and MRP\/gp180), and cancer cells can become resistant to these agents, the Illudins, Syn-illudins, and Acylfulvenes remain active against all MDR phenotypes regardless of the mechanism (see  and Table XIV). Hence, if tumor cells have already developed multi-drug resistance prior to ADC with a conventional toxin, or during the administration of a course of the ADC, the ADC will have no efficacy. In contrast, ADCs developed with Illudins, Syn-illudins, or Acylfulvenes will continue to kill cancer cells.","The present invention is based on the unexpected discovery that acylfulvenes, can be conjugated directly to a linker, via a variety of peptide or non-peptide bonds, and are active as medicant delivery agents in vitro and in vivo. Similar to other medicant classes used to produce antibody medicant conjugates, the acylfulvenes can be conjugated to a linker that allows subsequent coupling to a monoclonal antibody. Surprisingly, unlike previous medicant classes such as the auristatins (MMAE, MMAF, dolstatin-10), the maytansines (DM1 or DM4), the irinotecans and their metabolites (SN38), the calicheamicins (17-DMAG), the pyrrolobenzodiazepines (SJG-136), the duocarmycins (CC-1065), many of the acylfulvene compounds do not require a linker and can be directly attached to a monoclonal antibody or fragment thereof by a variety of simple chemical reactions. In this sense, the lack of requirement for a linker or a spacer, the acylfulvene compounds are unique. They will directly form covalent bonds with reactive groups on an AM such as a monoclonal antibody. In addition, because of their very small size and extreme cytotoxicity the acylfulvenes can be coupled directly to very small molecular weight entities (or affinity moieties) that allow tumor specific cytotoxicity without the concomitant requirement of use of a monoclonal antibody. Examples include the ability to link illudins\/acylfulvenes directly to steroids which allow the medicant-affinity complex to kill cells overexpressing a specific steroid receptor (such as estrogen- or progesterone-positive breast cancer cells) or even to be chemically coupled to various lipids. The small size and extreme cytotoxicity acylfulvenes allows direct coupling to peptides which can preferentially bind to tumor cells (integrin binding peptides) or display anti-angiogenic properties to hinder tumor invasion. The illudins\/acylfulvenes can also be coupled to specific peptides which actually renders the medicant-affinity complex non-toxic until the peptide is cleaved by a protease secreted by tumor cells. An example includes PSA (prostate specific antigen) secreted by prostate adenocarcinoma cells. Again, unlike previous medicant classes such as the auristatins (MMAE, MMAF, dolstatin-10), the maytansines (DM1 or DM4), the irinotecans and their metabolites (SN38), the calicheamicins (17-DMAG), the pyrrolobenzodiazepines (SJG-136), the duocarmycins (CC-1065), the acylfulvene compounds do not require a linker and can be directly attached to a steroid or a peptide that will subsequently function as an AM and direct the associated complex to specific tumor cells. An acylfulvene is attached to either a Specific Binding Peptide or a peptide which if cleaved by a specific protease (see Table IX) such as PSA generates an entity which is cytotoxic (see Table VIII).","Trastuzumab emtansine (Genentech for Breast cancer) uses maytanasine derive DM-1, a stable non-cleavable linker. Brentuximab vedotin (Seattle Genetic s\/Takeda for Hodgkin's Lymphoma) uses auristatin MMAE to anti-CD30, an enzyme sensitive cleavable linker.","The malonic linker, maleimide linker and SMCC [succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate] linker can form active intermediates that react with sulfhydryl groups on an antibody. SMCC has been used to bind maytansine derivative DM1 to the monoclonal antibody Herceptin. The AMC was internalized where the Herceptin was degraded by proteases and DM1 was released into the cytosol. Further, Sulfo-SMCC [sulfosuccinimidyloxycarbonyl-\u03b1-methyl-\u03b1-(2-pyridyldithio)toluene] forms an active intermediate that reacts with sulfhydryl groups on an antibody. The resulting Sulfo-SMCC AMC is more water soluble than the SMCC AMC.","Compounds and Conjugates. The present invention is drawn to a series of compounds and conjugates containing a Medicant moiety (M) linked via its C terminus to a LU (LU). The LU can operate to provide a suitable release of M.","In one group of embodiments, the invention provides Medicant Linker compounds having Formula I: LU-M (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof where the medicant loading is represented by p, the average number of medicant molecules per affinity (e.g., an antibody) (e.g. of Formula II, IIa, IIa\u2032). Medicant loading may range from 1 to 20 Medicant units (M) per Affinity unit (e.g., Ab or in Ab). Compositions of Formula IIa and Formula IIa\u2032 include mixtures of antibodies conjugated with a range of medicants, from 1 to 20.","In some embodiments, p is from about 1 to about 8 Medicant units per Affinity unit. In some embodiments, p is 1. In some embodiments, p is from about 2 to about 8 Medicant units per Affinity unit. In some embodiments, p is from about 2 to about 6, 2 to about 5, or 2 to about 4 Medicant units per LU. In some embodiments, p is about 2, about 4, about 6 or about 8 Medicant units per Affinity unit.","The average number of Medicants units per Affinity unit in a preparation from a conjugation reaction may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy, ELISA assay, and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates in terms of p may also be determined. In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates, where p is a certain value from Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates with other medicant loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis.","Returning to Formula IIa\u2032, the conjugates comprise an antibody covalently attached to one or more Medicant units (moieties) via a LU: A, a, W and w are as described above. The antibody medicant conjugate include pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof.","The medicant loading is represented by p, the average number of Medicant units per antibody in a molecule of Formula II. Medicant loading may range from 1 to 20 medicants (M) per Ab or mAb. Compositions of the AMC of Formula IIa\u2032 include mixtures of antibodies conjugated with a range of medicants, from 1 to 20. In some embodiments, p is from about 1 to about 8 Medicant units per antibody. In some embodiments, p is 1. In some embodiments, p is from about 2 to about 8 Medicant units per antibody. In some embodiments, p is from about 2 to about 6, 2 to about 5, or 2 to about 4 Medicant units per antibody. In some embodiments, p is about 2, about 4, about 6 or about 8 Medicant units per antibody.","The average number of medicants per antibody in preparations of AMCs from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as UV\/visible spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, ELISA assay, and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of AMCs in terms of p may also be determined. In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous AMCs where p is a certain value from AMC with other medicant loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis.","For some antibody medicant conjugates, p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example, where the attachment is a cysteine thiol, an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups, or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a LU may be attached. In some embodiments, the cysteine thiol is a thiol group of a cysteine residue that forms an interchain disulfide bond. In some embodiments, the cysteine thiol is a thiol group of a cysteine residue that does not form an interchain disulfide bond.","Typically, less than the theoretical maximums of medicant moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain, for example, many lysine residues that do not react with the Medicant Linker compound intermediate or LU reagent. Only the most reactive lysine groups may react with an amine-reactive LU reagent. Generally, antibodies do not contain many, if any, free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a Medicant moiety via a LU. Most cysteine thiol residues in the antibodies exist as disulfide bridges and must be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT). The antibody may be subjected to denaturing conditions to reveal reactive nucleophilic groups such as lysine or cysteine. The loading (medicant\/antibody ratio) of an AMC may be controlled in several different manners, including: (i) limiting the molar excess of Medicant Linker compound intermediate or LU reagent relative to antibody, (ii) limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature, and (iii) partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification.","Where more than one nucleophilic group reacts with a Medicant Linker compound intermediate, or LU reagent followed by Medicant moiety reagent, then the resulting product is a mixture of Affinity Medicant Linker Conjugates (e.g., AMCs) with a distribution of one or more Medicant moieties per Affinity unit (e.g., an antibody). The average number of medicants per Affinity unit (e.g., antibody) may be calculated from the mixture by, for example, dual enzyme linked immune serum assay (ELISA) antibody assay, specific for antibody and specific for the medicant. Individual Affinity Medicant Linker Conjugate molecules may be identified in the mixture by mass spectroscopy, and separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), e.g., hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Thus, a homogeneous conjugate with a single loading value may be isolated from the conjugation mixture by electrophoresis or chromatography.","A \u201cLinker Unit\u201d (LU) is a bifunctional compound which can be used to link a Medicant unit and\/or an Affinity unit to form an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate. Such conjugates are useful, for example, in the formation of immuno conjugates directed against tumor associated antigens. Such conjugates allow the selective delivery of cytotoxic drugs to tumor cells. A LU includes a traditional linker, a 4-fluorosulfonyl benzoyl (4-FSB) linker, a 3-fluorosulfonyl benzoyl (3-FSB) linker a 2-fluorosulfonyl benzoyl (2-FSB) linker, a maleimide (Mal1) linker, an azlactone linker and a bridging amino acid.","A traditional linker is a linker as defined in Table I through Table VI, where the reagent column identifies various traditional linkers. A Stretcher Unit includes two or more Linker Units.","A bridging amino acid means \u2014NH\u2014C(R\u2032)H\u2014CO\u2014 or \u2014N(R\u2033)\u2014C(R\u2032)H\u2014CO\u2014 including glycine, L-alanine, L-serine, L-threonine, L-cysteine, L-valine, L-leucine, L-isoleucine, L-methionine, L-proline, L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine, L-tryptophan, L-aspartic acid, L-glutamic acid, L-apsparagine, L-glutamine, L-histidine, L-lysine, L-arginine, L-homocysteine, L-selenocysteine, L-pyrrolysine, L-carnitine, L-hypusine, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, dehydroalanine, L-gamma-aminobutyric acid, L-ornithine, L-citrulline, L-\u03b1-Amino-n-butyric acid, L-Norvaline, L-Norleucine, L-Pipecolic acid, L-Alloisoleucine, L-\u03b1,\u03b2-diaminopropionic acid, L-\u03b1,\u03b3-diaminobutyric acid, L-Allothreonine, L-\u03b1-Amino-n-heptanoic acid, L-Homoserine, \u03b2-Amino-n-butyric acid, \u03b2-Aminoisobutyric acid, \u03b3-Aminobutyric acid, L-isovaline, L-Sarcosine, N-ethyl glycine, N-propyl glycine, N-isopropyl glycine, L-N-methyl alanine, L-N-ethyl alanine, N-methyl \u03b2-alanine, N-ethyl \u03b2-alanine, Isoserine, L-\u03b1-hydroxy-\u03b3-aminobutyric acid, L-diaminopimelic acid, cystathione, L-aminoisobutyric acid, dehydroalanine, delta-aminolevulinic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid, L-Hydroxyproline, Formylmethioinine, L-lanthionine, djenkolic acid, L-Pyroglutamic acid, Hypusine, L-carboxyglutamic acid, penicillamin, L-thialysine, quisqualic acid, L-canavine, L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, D-alanine, D-serine, D-threonine, D-cysteine, D-valine, D-leucine, D-isoleucine, D-methionine, D-proline, D-phenylalanine, D-tyrosine, D-tryptophan, D-aspartic acid, D-glutamic acid, D-apsparagine, D-glutamine, D-histidine, D-lysine, D-arginine, D-homocysteine, D-selenocysteine, D-pyrrolysine, D-carnitine, D-hypusine, D-gamma-aminobutyric acid, D-ornithine, D-citrulline, D-\u03b1-Amino-n-butyric acid, D-Norvaline, D-Norleucine, D-Pipecolic acid, D-Alloisoleucine, D-\u03b1,\u03b2-diaminopropionic acid, D-\u03b1,\u03b3-diaminobutyric acid, D-Allothreonine, D-\u03b1-Amino-n-heptanoic acid, D-Homoserine, D-isovaline, D-Sarcosine, D-N-methyl alanine, D-N-ethyl alanine, D-\u03b1-hydroxy-\u03b3-aminobutyric acid, D-diaminopimelic acid, D-aminoisobutyric acid, D-Hydroxyproline, D-lanthionine, D-Pyroglutamic acid, D-carboxyglutamic acid, D-thialysine, quisqualic acid, D-canavine, D-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid. A \u2018modified bridging amino acid\u2019 means a bridging amino acid with R\u2032 including a hydroxyl group that has been esterified, a bridging amino acid with R\u2032 including a sulphur atom where the sulphur atom has been reacted with an alkyl or other organic group and\/or a bridging amino acid with R\u2032 including a primary amino group that has been converted into a secondary or tertiary amino group.","In one embodiment, the LU of the Medicant Linker compound and Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate has the formula: \u2014W-Awherein -A- is a Stretcher Unit; a is 1 or 2; each \u2014W\u2014 is independently an Amino Acid unit; w is independently an integer ranging from 1 to 20. In the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate, the LU serves to attach the Medicant moiety and the AM.","The Affinity Moiety (AM) includes within its scope an Affinity Unit (AU) that specifically binds or reactively associates or complexes with a receptor, antigen or other receptive moiety associated with a given target-cell population. An AU is a molecule that binds to, complexes with, or reacts with a receptor, antigen or other receptive moiety of a cell population sought to be therapeutically or otherwise biologically modified. In one aspect, the AM acts to deliver the Medicant unit to the particular target cell population with which the AM interacts. Such AM's include, but are not limited to, proteins, polypeptides and peptides and include, antibodies, binding proteins, smaller molecular weight proteins, polypeptides, peptides, lectins, glycoproteins, non-peptides, vitamins, nutrient-transport molecules (such as, but not limited to, transferrin), or any other cell binding molecule or substance.","In an embodiment of the invention, an AM can form a bond to a Stretcher Unit. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, an AM can form a bond to the Stretcher Unit of the LU via a heteroatom of the AM. Heteroatoms that may be present on an AM include sulfur (in one embodiment, from a sulfhydryl group of an AM), oxygen (in one embodiment, from a carbonyl, carboxyl or hydroxyl group of an AM) and nitrogen (in one embodiment, from a primary or secondary amino group of an AM). These hetero atoms can be present on the AM in the AM's natural state, for example a naturally-occurring antibody, or can be introduced into the AM via chemical modification.","In one embodiment, an AM unit has a sulfhydryl group and the AM bonds to the LU via the sulfhydryl group's sulfur atom. In another embodiment, the AM has lysine residues that can react with activated esters (such esters include, but are not limited to, N-hydroxysuccinimide, pentafluorophenyl, and p-nitrophenyl esters) of the Stretcher Unit of the AM and thus form an amide bond consisting of the primary nitrogen atom of the AM and the carboxyl group of the AM. In yet another aspect, the AM has one or more lysine residues that can be chemically modified to introduce one or more sulfhydryl groups. The AM bonds to the LU via the sulfhydryl group's sulfur atom. The reagents that can be used to modify lysines include, but are not limited to, N-succinimidyl S-acetylthioacetate (SATA) and 2-Iminothiolane hydrochloride (Traut's Reagent).","In another embodiment, the AM can have one or more carbohydrate groups that can be chemically modified to have one or more sulfhydryl groups. The AM bonds to the LU (or a Stretcher Unit) via the sulfhydryl group's sulfur atom. In yet another embodiment, the AM can have one or more carbohydrate groups that can be oxidized to provide an aldehyde (\u2014CHO) group. The corresponding aldehyde can form a bond with a reactive site on a Stretcher Unit. Reactive sites on a Stretcher Unit that can react with a carbonyl group on an AM include, but are not limited to, hydrazine and hydroxylamine.","Useful non-immunoreactive protein, polypeptide, or peptide affinity moieties include, but are not limited to, transferrin, epidermal growth factors (\u201cEGF\u201d), bombesin, gastrin, gastrin-releasing peptide, platelet-derived growth factor, IL-2, IL-6, transforming growth factors (\u201cTOP\u201d), such as TGF-.alpha. and TGF-.beta., vaccinia growth factor (\u201cVGF\u201d), insulin and insulin-like growth factors I and II, somatostatin, lectins and apoprotein from low density lipoprotein.","Useful polyclonal antibodies are heterogeneous populations of antibody molecules derived from the sera of immunized animals. Useful monoclonal antibodies are homogeneous populations of antibodies to a particular antigenic determinant (e.g., a cancer cell antigen, a viral antigen, a microbial antigen, a protein, a peptide, a carbohydrate, a chemical, nucleic acid, or fragments thereof). A monoclonal antibody (mAb) to an antigen-of-interest can be prepared by using any technique known in the art which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture.","Useful monoclonal antibodies include, but are not limited to, human monoclonal antibodies, humanized monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, or chimeric monoclonal antibodies. Human monoclonal antibodies may be made by any of numerous techniques known in the art.","The antibody can also be a bispecific antibody. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art and are discussed infra.","The antibody can be a functionally active fragment, derivative or analog of an antibody that immunospecifically binds to target cells (e.g., cancer cell antigens, viral antigens, or microbial antigens) or other antibodies that bind to tumor cells or matrix. In this regard, \u201cfunctionally active\u201d means that the fragment, derivative or analog is able to elicit anti-anti-idiotype antibodies that recognize the same antigen that the antibody from which the fragment, derivative or analog is derived recognized. Specifically, in an exemplary embodiment the antigenicity of the idiotype of the immunoglobulin molecule can be enhanced by deletion of framework and CDR sequences that are C-terminal to the CDR sequence that specifically recognizes the antigen. To determine which CDR sequences bind the antigen, synthetic peptides containing the CDR sequences can be used in binding assays with the antigen by any binding assay method known in the art (e.g., the BIA core assay).","Other useful antibodies include fragments of antibodies such as, but not limited to, F(ab\u2032)fragments, Fab fragments, Fvs, single chain antibodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, scFv, scFv-FV, or any other molecule with the same specificity as the antibody.","Additionally, recombinant antibodies, such as chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies, comprising both human and non-human portions, which can be made using standard recombinant DNA techniques, are useful antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species, such as for example, those having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal and human immunoglobulin constant regions. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and a framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Such chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art.","Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable and can be produced using transgenic mice that are incapable of expressing endogenous immunoglobulin heavy and light chains genes, but which can express human heavy and light chain genes. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. Other human antibodies can be obtained commercially from, for example, Abgenix, Inc. (now Amgen, Freemont, Calif.) and Medarex (Princeton, N.J.).","Completely human antibodies that recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as \u201cguided selection.\u201d In this approach a selected non-human monoclonal antibody, e.g., a mouse antibody, is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope. Human antibodies can also be produced using various techniques known in the art, including phage display libraries.","In other embodiments, the antibody is a fusion protein of an antibody, or a functionally active fragment thereof, for example in which the antibody is fused via a covalent bond (e.g., a peptide bond), at either the N-terminus or the C-terminus to an amino acid sequence of another protein (or portion thereof, preferably at least 10, 20 or 50 amino acid portion of the protein) that is not from an antibody. Preferably, the antibody or fragment thereof is covalently linked to the other protein at the N-terminus of the constant domain.","Antibodies include analogs and derivatives that are either modified, i.e., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule as long as such covalent attachment permits the antibody to retain its antigen binding immunospecificity. For example, but not by way of limitation, derivatives and analogs of the antibodies include those that have been further modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular antibody unit or other protein, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications can be carried out by known techniques including, but not limited to, specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin, etc. Additionally, the analog or derivative can contain one or more unnatural amino acids.","Antibodies can have modifications (e.g., substitutions, deletions or additions) in amino acid residues that interact with Fc receptors. In particular, antibodies can have modifications in amino acid residues identified as involved in the interaction between the anti-Fc domain and the FcRn receptor.","Antibodies immunospecific for a cancer cell antigen can be obtained commercially or produced by any method known to one of skill in the art such as, e.g., chemical synthesis or recombinant expression techniques. The nucleotide sequence encoding antibodies immunospecific for a cancer cell antigen can be obtained, e.g., from the GenBank database or a database like it, literature publications, or by routine cloning and sequencing.","In a specific embodiment, known antibodies for the treatment of cancer can be used. Antibodies immunospecific for a cancer cell antigen can be obtained commercially or produced by any method known to one of skill in the art such as, e.g., recombinant expression techniques. The nucleotide sequence encoding antibodies immunospecific for a cancer cell antigen can be obtained, e.g., from the GenBank database or a database like it, the literature publications, or by routine cloning and sequencing.

In other embodiments, described is a pharmaceutical composition including an effective amount of an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or vehicle. The compositions are suitable for veterinary or human administration.","The present pharmaceutical compositions can be in any form that allows for the composition to be administered to a patient. For example, the composition can be in the form of a solid or liquid. Typical routes of administration include, without limitation, parenteral, ocular and intra-tumor. Parenteral administration includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular or intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. In one aspect, the compositions are administered parenterally. In a specific embodiment, the compositions are administered intravenously.","Pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated so as to allow an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound to be bioavailable upon administration of the composition to a patient. Compositions can take the form of one or more dosage units, where for example, a tablet can be a single dosage unit, and a container of an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound in liquid form can hold a plurality of dosage units.","Materials used in preparing the pharmaceutical compositions can be non-toxic in the amounts used. It will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art that the optimal dosage of the active ingredient(s) in the pharmaceutical composition will depend on a variety of factors. Relevant factors include, without limitation, the type of animal (e.g., human), the particular form of the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound, the manner of administration, and the composition employed.","The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or vehicle can be solid or particulate, so that the compositions are, for example, in tablet or powder form. The carrier(s) can be liquid. In addition, the carrier(s) can be particulate.","The composition can be in the form of a liquid, e.g., a solution, emulsion or suspension. In a composition for administration by injection, one or more of a surfactant, preservative, wetting agent, dispersing agent, suspending agent, buffer, stabilizer and isotonic agent can also be included.","The liquid compositions, whether they are solutions, suspensions or other like form, can also include one or more of the following: sterile diluents such as water for injection, saline solution, preferably physiological saline, Ringer's solution, isotonic sodium chloride, fixed oils such as synthetic mono or digylcerides which can serve as the solvent or suspending medium, polyethylene glycols, glycerin, cyclodextrin, propylene glycol or other solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl paraben; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates, phosphates or amino acids and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. A parenteral composition can be enclosed in ampoule, a disposable syringe or a multiple-dose vial made of glass, plastic or other material. Physiological saline is an exemplary adjuvant. An injectable composition is preferably sterile.","The amount of the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound that is effective in the treatment of a particular disorder or condition will depend on the nature of the disorder or condition, and can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro or in vivo assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the compositions will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease or disorder, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances.","The compositions comprise an effective amount of an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound such that a suitable dosage will be obtained. Typically, this amount is at least about 0.01% of an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound by weight of the composition. In an exemplary embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions are prepared so that a parenteral dosage unit contains from about 0.01% to about 2% by weight of the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound.","For intravenous administration, the composition can comprise from about 0.01 to about 100 mg of an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound per kg of the patient's body weight. In one aspect, the composition can include from about 1 to about 100 mg of an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound per kg of the patient's body weight. In another aspect, the amount administered will be in the range from about 0.1 to about 25 mg\/kg of body weight of the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound.","Prior art ADC's such as Kadcyla or Adcetris deliver a dose of the associated toxin (auristatins MMAE or emtansine DM-1) that is three or more times the lethal dose (for that toxin) which results in severe systemic (or non-target) toxicity. In contrast, Illudin and Acylfulvene ADC's (such as analog  (, analog  (), analog  (), analog  (), analog  (), analog  (), or analog  () deliver less than one third (i.e., <\u2153) of a lethal dose, minimizing the risk and severity of systemic toxicity. Illudins and Acylfulvenes are true cytotoxic agents whereas other toxic agents used in prior art ADC's (e.g., pyrrolobenzodiazepines, maytansines, fumagillols, dolstatins, auristatins, enadiynes, halichondrins, and tubulysins) are only cytostatic. See Table XIII (the NCI-DTP 60 cell line table). Hence, other payloads, such as those used in Herceptin, Adcetris or Rituxin only stall tumor cell growth and do not actually kill the tumor cells. Other payloads (e.g., pyrrolobenzodiazepines, maytansines, fumagillols, dolstatins, auristatins, enadiynes, halichondrins, and tubulysins) are not active against multidrug phenotypes, notably the MDR1\/GP170 and MRP\/GP180 transport mechanisms (see Table XIV). Illudins and Acylfulvenes show the excellent effect of remaining active against all MDR phenotypes known regardless of the mechanism of resistance (see Table XIV). Hence, if tumor cells have already developed multi-drug resistance to a prior art ADC with a prior art toxin, or develop multi-drug resistance during the administration of a course of the prior art ADC with a prior art toxin, then the ADC will have no efficacy. In contrast, ADCs developed with Illudins, Syn-illudins, or Acylfulvenes have the advantageous effect that they will continue to kill cancer cells.","Generally, the dosage of an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound administered to a patient is typically about 0.01 mg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. In one aspect, the dosage administered to a patient is between about 0.01 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. In another aspect, the dosage administered to a patient is between about 0.1 mg\/kg and about 10 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. In yet another aspect, the dosage administered to a patient is between about 0.1 mg\/kg and about 5 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. In yet another aspect the dosage administered is between about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 3 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. In yet another aspect, the dosage administered is between about 1 mg\/kg to about 3 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight.","The Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound can be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection. Administration can be systemic or local. Various delivery systems are known, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, micro-particles, microcapsules, capsules, etc., and can be used to administer an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound. In certain embodiments, more than one Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound is administered to a patient.","In specific embodiments, it can be desirable to administer one or more Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates and\/or a Medicant Linker compound locally to the area in need of treatment. This can be achieved, for example, and not by way of limitation, by local infusion during surgery; topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery; by injection; by means of a catheter; or by means of an implant, the implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. In one embodiment, administration can be by direct injection at the site (or former site) of a cancer, tumor or neoplastic or pre-neoplastic tissue. In another embodiment, administration can be by direct injection at the site (or former site) of a manifestation of an autoimmune disease.","In yet another embodiment, the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound can be delivered in a controlled release system, such as but not limited to, a pump or various polymeric materials can be used. In yet another embodiment, a controlled-release system can be placed in proximity of the target of the Linker Affinity conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound, e.g., the liver, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose.","The term \u201ccarrier\u201d refers to a diluent, adjuvant or excipient, with which an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin. The carriers can be saline, and the like. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing and other agents can be used. In one embodiment, when administered to a patient, the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or the Medicant Linker compound and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sterile. Water is an exemplary carrier when the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound are administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. The present compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents.","The present compositions can take the form of solutions, pellets, powders, sustained-release formulations, or any other form suitable for use.","In an embodiment, the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates and\/or Medicant Linker compounds are formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to animals, particularly human beings. Typically, the carriers or vehicles for intravenous administration are sterile isotonic aqueous buffer solutions. Where necessary, the compositions can also include a solubilizing agent. Compositions for intravenous administration can optionally comprise a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or Medicant Linker compound is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or Medicant Linker compound is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.","The composition can include various materials that modify the physical form of a solid or liquid dosage unit. For example, the composition can include materials that form a coating shell around the active ingredients. The materials that form the coating shell are typically inert, and can be selected from, for example, sugar, shellac, and other enteric coating agents. Alternatively, the active ingredients can be encased in a gelatin capsule.","Whether in solid or liquid form, the present compositions can include a pharmacological agent used in the treatment of cancer, an autoimmune disease or an infectious disease.","Treatment of Cancer. The Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates and Medicant Linker compounds are useful for inhibiting the multiplication of a tumor cell or cancer cell, causing apoptosis in a tumor or cancer cell, or for treating cancer in a patient. The Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates and\/or Medicant Linker compounds can be used accordingly in a variety of settings for the treatment of animal cancers. The Affinity Medicant Linker Conjugates can be used to deliver a Medicant or Medicant unit to a tumor cell or cancer cell. Without being bound by theory, in one embodiment, the AM of an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate binds to or associates with a cancer-cell or a tumor-cell-associated antigen, and the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate can be taken up (internalized) inside a tumor cell or cancer cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis or other internalization mechanism. The antigen can be attached to a tumor cell or cancer cell or can be an extracellular matrix protein associated with the tumor cell or cancer cell. Once inside the cell, one or more specific peptide sequences within or at the Medicant unit's proximal end of the LU are hydrolytically cleaved by one or more tumor cell or cancer cell-associated proteases, resulting in release of the Medicant unit. The released Medicant unit is then free to migrate within the cell and induce cytotoxic or cytostatic activities. The Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate also can be cleaved by an intracellular protease to release the Medicant moiety. In an alternative embodiment, the Medicant or Medicant unit is cleaved from the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate outside the tumor cell or cancer cell, and the Medicant or Medicant unit subsequently penetrates the cell.","The Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates provide conjugation-specific tumor or cancer medicant targeting, thus reducing general toxicity of the Medicant. The LUs stabilize the Affinity Medicant Conjugates in blood, yet are cleavable by tumor-specific proteases within the cell, liberating a Medicant unit.","In one embodiment, the AM binds to the tumor cell or cancer cell. In another embodiment, the AM binds to a tumor cell or cancer cell antigen which is on the surface of the tumor cell or cancer cell. In another embodiment, the AM binds to a tumor cell or cancer cell antigen which is an extracellular matrix protein associated with the tumor cell or cancer cell.","The specificity of the AM for a particular tumor cell or cancer cell can be important for determining those tumors or cancers that are most effectively treated. For example, an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or Medicant Linker compound having a BR96 AM can be useful for treating antigen positive carcinomas including those of the lung, breast, colon, ovaries, and pancreas. Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates having an anti-CD30 or an anti-CD70 binding affinity moiety can be useful for treating hematologic malignancies.","Other particular types of cancers that can be treated with an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound include, but are not limited to fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, bone cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, oral cancer, nasal cancer, throat cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystadenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilms' tumor, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, testicular cancer, small cell lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, lung cancer, epithelial carcinoma, glioma, glioblastoma multiforme, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma, oligodendroglioma, meningioma, skin cancer, melanoma, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma blood-borne cancers, including but not limited to: acute lymphoblastic leukemia \u201cALL\u201d, acute lymphoblastic B-cell leukemia, acute lymphoblastic T-cell leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia \u201cAML\u201d, acute promyelocytic leukemia \u201cAPL\u201d, acute monoblastic leukemia, acute erythroleukemic leukemia, acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, acute myelomonocytic leukemia, acute nonlymphocyctic leukemia, acute undifferentiated leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia \u201cCML\u201d, chronic lymphocytic leukemia \u201cCLL\u201d, hairy cell leukemia, multiple myeloma acute and chronic leukemias: lymphoblastic, myelogenous, lymphocytic, myelocytic leukemias Lymphomas: Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, Heavy chain disease, Polycythemia vera.","Multi-Modality Therapy for Cancer.

In a specific embodiment, the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate is administered concurrently with the chemotherapeutic agent or with radiation therapy. In another specific embodiment, the chemotherapeutic agent or radiation therapy is administered prior or subsequent to administration of an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate.","A chemotherapeutic agent can be administered over a series of sessions. Any one or a combination of the chemotherapeutic agents, such a standard of care chemotherapeutic agent(s), can be administered.","Additionally, methods of treatment of cancer with an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and\/or a Medicant Linker compound are provided as an alternative to chemotherapy or radiation therapy where the chemotherapy or the radiation therapy has proven or can prove too toxic, e.g., results in unacceptable or unbearable side effects, for the subject being treated. The patient being treated can, optionally, be treated with another cancer treatment such as surgery, radiation therapy or chemotherapy, depending on which treatment is found to be acceptable or bearable.","The Affinity Medicant Linker (AML) conjugates and\/or Medicant Linker (ML) compounds can also be used in an in vitro or ex vivo fashion, such as for the treatment of certain cancers, including, but not limited to leukemia and lymphomas, such treatment involving autologous stem cell transplants. This can involve a multi-step process in which the animal's autologous hematopoietic stein cells are harvested and purged of all cancer cells, the animal's remaining bone-marrow cell population is then eradicated via the administration of a high dose of an AML conjugates and\/or ML compound with or without accompanying high dose radiation therapy, and the stem cell graft is infused back into the animal. Supportive care is then provided while bone marrow function is restored and the patient recovers.","Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases. The Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates and Medicant Linker compounds are useful for killing or inhibiting the replication of a cell that produces an autoimmune disease or for treating an autoimmune disease. The Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates and Medicant Linker compounds can be used accordingly in a variety of settings for the treatment of an autoimmune disease in a patient. The Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates can be used to deliver a Medicant unit to a target cell. Without being bound by theory, in one embodiment, the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate associates with an antigen on the surface of a target cell, and the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate is then taken up inside a target-cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Once inside the cell, one or more specific peptide sequences within and\/or Medicant unit proximal to the LU are enzymatically or hydrolytically cleaved, resulting in release of the Medicant or Medicant unit. The released Medicant or Medicant unit is then free to migrate in the cytosol and induce cytotoxic or cytostatic activities. The Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate also can be cleaved by an intracellular protease to release the Medicant or Medicant moiety. In an alternative embodiment, the Medicant is cleaved from the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate outside the target cell, and the Medicant or Medicant unit subsequently penetrates the cell.","In an embodiment of the present invention, the AM binds to an autoimmune antigen.

Reactions of carbodiimides such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) with a carboxylic acid yields a highly reactive O-acylisourea. During artificial protein synthesis (such as Fmoc solid-state synthesizers), the C-terminus is often used as the attachment site on which the amino acid monomers are added. To enhance the electrophilicity of carboxylate group, the negatively charged oxygen must first be \u201cactivated\u201d into a better leaving group and carbodiimides can be used for this purpose. The negatively charged oxygen will act as a nucleophile, attacking the central carbon in DCC. DCC is temporarily attached to the former carboxylate group (which is now an ester group), making nucleophilic attack by an amino group (on the attaching amino acid) to the former C-terminus (carbonyl group) more efficient.","When the Illudin, Syn-Illudin, or Acylfulvene carboxylic acid analog is activated by DCC or DIC in the presence of an amino acid the DCC-activated carboxylate will react with the amino acid to form an azlactone (, , , and ). This amino acid-derived azlactone will react with primary amines, undergo ring opening, and forms an amide bond.","Illudin M (450 mg, 1.845 mmol, 1 equiv.), glutaric anhydride (2.10 g, 18.45 mmol, 10 equiv.) and DMAP (171 mg, 1.4 mmol, 0.76 equiv.) were dissolved in CHCl(5 mL) at room temperature. After 3.5 hours the mixture was taken up by CHCl, which was washed with water, and brine in sequence. It was then dried and evaporated. The residue was eluted through a column (Hexane\/EtOAc 4:1) to give analog  (see ) (365 mg, 55%) as a liquid. UV (CHCl) \u03bb, nm (\u03b5):  (3387).","Analog  () was generated from illudin M as outlined in Example 13. The carboxylic acid derivative was activated using DCC\/DMAP to synthesize steroid AFC's  () and  (). In addition, Irofulven carboxylic acid derivative, analog  () was activated using DCC\/DMAP to produce analogs  (),  (),  (), and  (). In general, carboxylate group containing compounds can be activated using a carbodiimide in the presence of an amino acid to form an azlactone. The azlactone formed will react spontaneously with primary amine groups on an amino acid, a peptide, an antibody, a protein, or another drug, and undergo ring opening with the formation of an amide bond. For proteins, antibodies and peptides the amino acids capable of reacting with the azlactone derivative includes arginine and lysine.","To form an Illudin derived azlactone active drug-linker moiety, either analog  () or analog  () can be activated by DCC\/DMAP in the presence of a small amino acid such as glycine to form the azlactone. DCC cannot be added without the presence of an amine containing target (such as the glycine) or the activated carboxylate reacts with another carboxylate to form a symmetrical anhydride. The azlactone formed will react spontaneously with primary amine groups on a peptide, an antibody, a protein, or a medicant.","Part A: Production of Azlactone from carboxylate Acylfulvene analog: Analog  () (58.5 mg, 0.2035 mmol), and DMAP (5 mg. 0.048 mmol) were dissolved in CHCl(5.6 mL) at 0\u00b0 C. The desired amino acid (such as glycine) is added in an equimolar amount. Note that amino acids having substitutions on the C4 carbon (such as alpha-methyl glycine or 2-dimethylglycine) are preferred over conventional amino acids as substitution cannot occur at the C4 position after ring-opening and all nucleophilic coupling reactions must occur at the C5 position, resulting only in the desired amide-bond formation with the amine-containing molecule. To this solution was added CHClsolution of DCC (250 \u03bcL, 1 M, 0.244 mmol), stirred for 30 minutes, allowed to warm to room temperature then stirred for 1.5 hours. The filtrate was washed with dilute HCl (1.5%), saturated NaHCOand brine in sequence. The organic phase was dried over NaSO, and evaporated. The residue was eluted through a column (100% CHClplus 0.5% methanol), to give the desired azlactone analog as a solid. Part B: Coupling of Azlactone to the protein component (reacting with primary amines on amino acids such as the one on lysine): The typical protein coupling reaction consists of the Azlactone suspended in buffer [25 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.5)] and the desired amount of protein (20 \u03bcg to 5.0 mg) is added. The mixture is gently rocked for 60 minutes, then the reaction terminated by the addition of the blocking reagent, 1.0 ml of 1.0 M ethanolamine in 25 mM sodium pyrophosphate (titrated to pH 9.0 with HCI) Sample rocked gently for 5 minutes then the residual ethanolamine removed by dialysis or chromatography using pH 7.5 phosphate-NaCl buffer.","The azlactone derivative generated in Example 14 (note that other amino acids can be used in place of glycine) is then reacted with the desired peptide or protein or other compound containing a primary amino group at a 1:1 ratio in buffer (25 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.5) with gentle rocking at room temperature for 60 minutes. The reaction is terminated by the addition of 1.0 mL of 25 mM ethanolamine (titrated to pH 9.00) with rocking for 5 minutes at room temperature). The drug-azlactone-ligand product can be purified by column chromatography or dialysis to remove the ethanolamine by-product.","Azlactone linker to bind Antibody to a Protein Toxin.
