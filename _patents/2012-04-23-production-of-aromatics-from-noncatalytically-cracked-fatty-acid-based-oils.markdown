The government may have certain rights in the invention.","One of the key challenges facing modern industrialized society is the rapid depletion of crude oil, which is the primary source for most transportation fuels and many organic chemicals. The petrochemical industry represents a substantial benefit to human society and the invention and commercialization of alternative sources for petrochemicals is of great importance.","One category of organic chemicals that is often produced from petroleum includes aromatics. These chemicals have a wide range of uses including serving as monomers for many types of polymers, paints, and coatings; serving as chemical intermediates for many types of industrial and consumer chemicals; and serving as valuable chemical components of heterogeneous transportation fuels such as gasoline, diesel, aviation gasoline, and jet fuel.","Surprisingly, very little work has been done to develop a method of producing aromatics from renewable sources. Gruber et al. (U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009\/0299109) describe a method for producing aromatic compounds from cellulosic\/hemi-cellulosic\/lignin biomass. According to Gruber's method, cellulosic\/hemi-cellulosic\/lignin biomass is subjected to fermentation with one or more micro-organisms to form one or more C-Calcohols. The alcohols are converted into C-Calkenes by dehydration and then isolated from other compounds. These C-Calkenes are then catalytically reacted to form one or more aromatic hydrocarbons. To date, the only method based on the fermentation of cellulosic\/hemi-cellulosic\/lignin biomass to alcohols that has been commercialized involves the production of ethanol as a substitute for motor gasoline. Concerns with fermentation through alcohol pathways are the high consumption of water and low overall energy efficiency [Doherty, W. O. S., Mousavioun, P., Fellows, C. M., Value-adding to cellulosic ethanol: Lignin polymers, Industrial Crops and Products, Volume 33, Issue 2, March 2011, Pages 259-276., A. Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi, R. Barthos, and F. Solymosi, Aromatization of ethanol on MoC\/ZSM catalysts, Catalysis Letters Vol. 110, Nos. 1-2, August 2006]. Thus, a need exists to provide an alternative pathway that can provide a source for aromatic chemicals so that demand can be satisfied as the available supply of source material, i.e., crude oil, is depleted while addressing concerns with fermentation through alcohol pathways.","During the scale-up of a process to noncatalytically crack fatty acid based oils including but not limited to crop oils and other triacyl glycerides; fatty acid lipids produced by microbes, fungi, and yeasts; and animal fats, in a continuous reaction system, an unusual cracking reaction product was obtained that has not been documented in previous literature nor was seen during previous batch reaction experiments. This cracking reaction product contains a high concentration of C-Calkenes. This unusual result, coupled with subsequent catalytic reforming of these alpha alkenes, is the basis of a new process to generate renewable aromatics from fatty acid oils.","A method for producing aromatic chemical products from fatty acid oils includes heating a fatty acid oil to a temperature ranging from about 100\u00b0 C. to about 800\u00b0 C. at a pressure between about vacuum conditions and about 200 psia and for a time sufficient to crack the fatty acid oil and produce a cracked fatty acid oil; removing undesired materials, unreacted fatty acid oil, heavy ends, and light ends from the cracked fatty acid oil; heating the resulting purified cracked fatty acid oil to a temperature ranging from about 100\u00b0 C. to about 800\u00b0 C. at a pressure ranging from vacuum conditions to about 200 psia for a time sufficient to reform alkenes and alkanes in the purified cracked fatty acid oil into aromatics and produce a reformed fatty acid oil; and extracting components from the reformed fatty acid oil to produce a mixture of chemical products containing between 5% and 90% aromatic organic compounds by weight.","A method for producing a high-octane aviation fuel with low lead content includes heating a fatty acid oil to a temperature ranging from about 100\u00b0 C. to about 800\u00b0 C. at a pressure ranging from vacuum conditions to about 200 psia for a time sufficient to crack the fatty acid oil and produce a cracked fatty acid oil; removing undesired materials, unreacted fatty acid oil, heavy ends, and light ends from the cracked fatty acid oil; heating the resulting purified cracked fatty acid oil to a temperature ranging from about 100\u00b0 C. to about 800\u00b0 C. at a pressure ranging from vacuum conditions to about 200 psia for a time sufficient to reform alkenes and alkanes in the cracked fatty acid oil into aromatic compounds and produce a reformed fatty acid oil; removing undesired materials, unreacted cracked fatty acid oil, heavy ends, and light ends from the reformed fatty acid oil; alkylating the reformed fatty acid oil to produce a mixture of chemical products containing at least about 50% high octane alkylated aromatics by weight to produce an aviation fuel having an octane number of at least 95.","Aromatic compounds can be directly produced from fatty acid oils via chemical reaction using a zeolite-based, heterogeneous catalyst as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/626,304. However, the use of a catalyst to directly convert fatty acid oils to aromatics has the potential to produce unwanted by-products that can reduce the effectiveness of the catalyst and\/or reduce the overall conversion yield of feedstock into usable final products. One of these unwanted by-products is coke, which is a carbon-rich solid phase material that can foul heat transfer surfaces, block active catalyst sites, and plug catalyst pores. Another of these unwanted by-products is tar, which is a highly viscous organic liquid that can also cause the abovementioned problems associated with coke. These materials must be removed from a catalytic reactor whenever reaction efficiency drops below an acceptable level. The most common method of removing these materials is to oxidize the coke and tar to carbon dioxide, which then leaves the catalyst in the gas phase. Unfortunately, this method also results in a loss of valuable organic products and increases carbon emissions from the process.","Because of the problems caused by coke and tar formation in catalytic reactions of fatty acid oils, previous development and commercialization has focused on noncatalytic reactions (also known as noncatalytic cracking or thermal cracking) or on hydrotreating reactions for the conversion of fatty acid oils into useful products such as diesel, kerosene, or jet fuel as noted in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2008\/0092436 and 2009\/0158537. One disadvantage of hydrotreating reactions is that these reactions do not generate aromatic compounds nor the most commercially viable precursors to aromatics-alkenes. Noncatalytic cracking can generate aromatics directly, but the concentration is too low to isolate and purify aromatic products for commercial use.","The present invention resolves the aforementioned problems. During the scale-up of a process to noncatalytically crack fatty acid oils including but not limited to crop oils and other triacyl glycerides; fatty acid lipids produced by microbes, fungi, algae and yeasts; and animal fats, in a continuous reaction system, an unexpected cracking reaction product was obtained that had not been documented in previous literature nor was seen during previous batch reaction experiments. This reaction product contained a high concentration of alkenes. Based on this discovery, a process was developed that couples the noncatalytic cracking of fatty acid oils under conditions that yield a high concentration of alkenes with the subsequent catalytic reforming of C-Clength alkenes and alkanes into aromatics. While Gruber teaches the reforming of C-Calkenes to aromatics, no previous work has been found where C-Clength alkenes have been reformed to aromatics from a heterogeneous mixture.","The integration of multiple processing steps based on the two step reaction process creates valuable chemical products outside the scope of general fatty acid oil processing. One example is the purification of aromatic compounds so that they can be converted into raw materials from which polymers can be made. Another example of additional processing steps that create new products from fatty acid oils utilizes an additional chemical reaction in which aromatic compounds are further reacted with other chemicals to produce alkylated aromatic compounds. These alkylated aromatic compounds can be produced in a mixture that is suitable as a high octane gasoline fuel that can replace petroleum-based gasoline fuel compounds.","Subsequent separation and other processing steps can be used to produce specific aromatic-based products including but not limited to benzene, toluene, o-xylene, p-, m-xylene, ethylbenzene, and\/or a mixed aromatics product.","Subsequent alkylation reactions, separation steps, and other processing steps can be used to produce complex aromatic-based products including but not limited to cumene, naphthalene, anthracene and alkylated benzenes. Subsequent separation and other processing steps can be used to produce specific aromatic-based products or other products derived from aromatic hydrocarbons. Alternatively, a mixture of heavier aromatic compounds can be produced that can be used as a high octane gasoline such as a replacement for 100LL aviation gasoline or as a gasoline additive.","\u201cAromatics,\u201d \u201caromatic compounds\u201d or \u201caromatic hydrocarbons\u201d are hydrocarbons containing planar sets of six carbon atoms that are connected by delocalized electrons in a manner as if they were connected by alternating single and double covalent bonds. Aromatic compounds include, but are not limited to: benzene, toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, ethyl benzene, methyl benzene, ethyl methyl benzene, dimethyl benzene, trimethylbenzene, propyl benzene, methyl propyl benzene, tetramethyl benzene, cetyl butenyl benzene, and methyl propyl benzene. Aromatic compounds also include polyaromatics, such as naphthalene, methyl naphthalene, ethyl naphthalene, tetra hydro methyl naphthalene, and tetra hydro ethyl naphthalene.","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to the production and purification of products that contain aromatic compounds from plant oils, biologically generated lipids and animal fats. Specifically, the feedstocks are triacyl glycerides, long chain fatty acids, long chain lipids, or similar chemicals. Embodiments of the present invention provide means to produce aromatics from feedstocks not currently utilized to produce these chemicals. The chemical modifications, based on the use of cracking, chemical reactions, and separation techniques, are designed to produce commercial-quality chemical products that can directly replace comparable chemical products generated from other feedstock sources and to produce fuel blendstocks that are advantageous because of their high concentration of cyclic organic compounds containing aromatic compounds. \u201cCracking\u201d refers to any process that changes the chemical composition of an organic chemical or chemical mixture by cleaving one or more carbon-carbon bonds.","Applicants discovered that when a cracking reactor product was generated in a noncatalytic reactor at low pressures in a continuous reaction system and then purified to remove light ends, recyclables, and tars, the resulting product contained between 5% and 50% alkenes. Alkenes are known to catalytically reform more efficiently into aromatic compounds than comparably sized alkanes. This purified high alkene cracking reactor product can then be routed to a catalytic reactor where alkenes and some of the alkanes are reformed to aromatic hydrocarbons. Embodiments of the present invention use noncatalytic cracking technologies, coupled with separation technologies such as distillation, filtration, membrane filtration or separation, solvent extraction, and related technologies to produce high concentrations of alkenes from fatty acid oil, coupled with catalytic reforming technologies and additional separation technologies to generate aromatic products. In addition, certain aromatic products and\/or products derived from aromatics require additional subsequent chemical reactions. The unique set of noncatalytic reaction conditions that led to the production of a sufficiently high concentration of alkenes that makes these process routes feasible has not been previously reported, demonstrated or used to produce commercial quality cyclic organic compound fuel blendstocks or to produce commercial-quality purified aromatic and\/or cycloparaffinic chemical products having between 5% and 90% cyclic organic compounds. Mixtures of aromatic compounds and cycloparaffin products can be produced wherein at least about 20%, 30% or 50% of the mixture are aromatic compounds.","The raw material for the processes presently disclosed can be any fatty acid oil, representing a group of chemical compounds that can be found in plant oils or biomass such as algae, or any medium and\/or long chain fatty acids that are naturally synthesized and found in biomass such as algae, animal fats, or modified materials. \u201cBiomass\u201d refers to any organic, non-fossil material that is derived from the mass of any biological organism excluding mass that has been transformed by geological processes in substances such as coal or petroleum. \u201cFatty acid oil\u201d refers to any oil derived from a biomass source that contains a carboxylic acid group. The fatty acid oils in plant oils consist of three medium and\/or long chain fatty (naturally synthesized carboxylic) acids connected via a glycerol group. These medium and\/or long chain fatty acids, can be purified, separated, and chemically modified for use as a food source or chemical feedstock or as a potential transportation fuel. \u201cLong chain fatty acids\u201d refer to fatty acid chains containing at least fifteen carbon atoms. \u201cMedium chain fatty acids\u201d refer to fatty acid chains containing ten to fourteen carbon atoms.","\u201cPlant oil\u201d refers to lipids that are derived from plant sources. Plant oils include, but are not limited to oils from cottonseed, flaxseed, soybean, safflower, sunflower, sesame, canola, rapeseed, jatropha, jojoba, evening primrose, poppy, camelina, crambe, olive, coconut, palm, cotton, corn, soybean, and nuts. Compositions of major commercially available crop oils are listed in Table 1. Typical fatty acids contained in crop oils include saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids do not contain any double bonds between carbon atoms. Unsaturated fatty acids contain two or more carbon atoms having a carbon-carbon double bond. Saturated acids include stearic acid, palmitic acid, myristic acid, and lauric acid. Unsaturated acids include linolenic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, hexadecanoic acid, palmitoleic acid, and myristoleic acid.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE
