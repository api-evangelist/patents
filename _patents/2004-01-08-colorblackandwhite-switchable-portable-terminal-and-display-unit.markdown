No. 09\/763,806 filed 27 Feb. 2001, now abandoned, which is a 371 of PCT\/JP00\/03312, filed May 24, 2000.","The invention relates to a display unit and a device using this display unit, such as a portable phone, a portable information terminal, a home electric product, etc.","With respect to a technique for displaying colors in the display unit of a portable information device, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 213799\/1998 discloses a technique relating to a reflection type color display produced by a color filter system having auxiliary illumination. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 106328\/1998 discloses a technique relating to a liquid crystal display unit for both reflection and transmission using a reflecting layer having a light polarizing state maintaining property. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 19257\/1993 discloses a technique relating to a field sequential color system operating as a color display system in which no color filter is required. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10529\/2000 discloses a technique relating to a liquid crystal color display driving method in which red, green and blue liquid crystal element operating signals are synthesized and set to a monochromatic video signal on the basis of a consumed power restraining command signal, and power consumption is reduced by displaying only this monochromatic image.","As mentioned above, high image quality, color and low power consumption are required in a portable information device, but many problems, which are described below, exist in the display technique employed by the conventional color portable information device.","First, in the reflection type color display of a system using a color filter, a problem exists in that the display image is dark and is not easily seen in comparison with the reflection type black-and-white display, due to the absorption of light by the color filter each time external light and auxiliary illumination are used. It is necessary to construct one pixel three subpixels of red, green and blue (hereinafter respectively called R, G and B) to perform the color display. Therefore, a problem also exists in that three-times the power in the image display is required at any time in comparison with a black-and-white display. Further, since the same driving system is adopted at each time a device is in use and at a standby time (a transmission display time and a reflection display time), the difference in consumed power is only equal to the difference in consumed power of the light source itself due to turning-on and turning-off of the light source. Therefore, room for improvement is also left as far as reduction in power consumption is concerned. Further, when a half mirror, a semi-transmitting reflection plate or a partial transmitting reflection plate having a partial opening portion, etc. are used as an external light reflecting means, a trade-off exists between luminance at the transmission display time and luminance at the reflection display time. Therefore, the image quality of incomplete brightness is formed in any display quality.","Accordingly, when a color display system using a color filter is adopted, a problem exists in that the power consumption is large and a dark display image is formed in comparison with the black-and-white liquid crystal display unit at each of the reflection display time and the transmission display time (auxiliary light source using time).","In contrast to this, if a field sequential color display system using no color filter is adopted, the problem of the above-mentioned color filter can be solved, and a high image quality can be obtained. However, in this case, the light source must be lighted at any time to display the image, and it is considered that room for improvement is yet left as far as reduction in power consumption is concerned in a device which has plural modes of operation at the so-called device using time and the standby time (transmission display time and reflection display time).","Therefore, an object of the invention is to provide a display unit for reducing power consumption which is able to produce a color display, or a portable information device having this display unit, such as a portable phone, etc.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a display unit having a light source has a mode switching section for switching a displayed image mode, a light source control section for controlling operation of the light source in accordance with instructions from the mode switching section, an image signal processing section for processing an image signal in accordance with instructions from the mode switching section, and a liquid crystal cell for displaying an image in accordance with the image signal from the image signal processing section. Accordingly, it is possible to realize a bright display unit with reduced power consumption and high contrast in each of a light emitting display and a reflection display.","In one embodiment, the image signal processing section of a driving section has a digital-analog converter and a level shifter. When the mode switching section switches the display mode to a multi-gradation display mode, the image signal generating section generates the image signal of analog multi-gradation by using the digital-analog converter. When the mode switching section switches the display mode to a two-gradation display mode, the image signal generating section generates an image signal of analog binary gradation by using the level shifter. Accordingly, the driving method can be switched by using such a construction so that optimum power can be selected at any time, and consumed power can be optimized, and power consumption can be reduced.","Further, in another embodiment, the display element has a liquid crystal cell having a pair of transparent substrates, a liquid crystal layer located between the pair of transparent substrates, and an electrode group arranged on at least one of the pair of transparent substrates; a light polarizing maintaining diffusion reflection plate arranged on one face of the liquid crystal cell; a light guide body arranged between the liquid crystal cell and the light polarizing maintaining diffusion reflection plate such that the light source is arranged on a side face of the light guide body; and a light polarizing maintaining scattering layer arranged between the light guide body and the liquid crystal cell. Accordingly, it is possible to realize a display unit in which the light utilization efficiency is further increased, and the problem of a double image is also solved in addition to the effects in which power consumption is reduced and the display of high contrast can be performed in each of the light emitting display and the reflection display.","Further, in an example taken from a separate viewpoint of the invention, the display element has a liquid crystal cell having a pair of substrates; a liquid crystal layer disposed between the pair of substrates; plural pixels formed by an electrode arranged on at least one of the pair of substrates; and a light source arranged in accordance with each of the plural pixels and constructed by including a metallic electrode, an organic LED layer and a transparent electrode from a substrate side. Accordingly, an image is displayed by adjusting the luminance of the organic LED at a color light emitting display time, and adjusting the luminance of the liquid crystal at a reflection display time. Thus, bright image display with reduced power consumption and high contrast can be realized, and the display element can be entirely reduced in thickness.","One embodiment of a display unit of the present invention will be explained with reference to . The display unit of  is mainly constructed to include a display element  and a driving section  for operating the display element . The driving section  will first be explained.","The driving section  has a signal processing switching section , a light source control section , and signal processing sections , .","The signal processing switching section  performs switching control of a processing method of an image signal displayed in the display element  and on\/off control of a color light emitting means  through a driving signal interface  at any time. The switching control of the image signal processing method for displaying the image signal in the display element , e.g., refers to switching control of a color light emitting display and reflection display in accordance with a display state. For processing display data, for example, one of the signal processing sections ,  is selected, switched and controlled in the switching control of the image signal processing method. Each of the signal processing sections ,  processes an image signal inputted from the outside, and converts the inputted image signal to an image signal suitable for display, or generates a suitable image signal. The arrangement of plural signal processing sections for performing such operations means that the driving section  has plural paths for processing the image signal. In a concrete example of the switching control of the signal processing method, there are switching control of a driving frequency, switching control of each case of using and not using a digital\/analog converter, switching control of the number of operated pixels, switching control of a circuit block for supplying a clock, etc. The light source control section  is a circuit section for controlling operation of the light source arranged in the display element , and operation of the light source control section  is controlled by the signal processing switching section . Each of these sections will be explained in detail in a later embodiment.","The switching control of the signal processing method, i.e., selection switching of the signal processing section, can be performed by adopting such a construction. This finally means that consumed power can be switched. Accordingly, it is possible to supply power in accordance with the amount required at each of the color light emitting display time and the reflection display time. Therefore, display with high definition and high quality can be performed at the color light emitting display time, and the unnecessary use of power can be reduced, whereby the consumed power can be optimized, and power consumption can be greatly reduced at the reflection display time. As a matter of course, power can be also reduced by turning-on and turning-off the color light emitting means .","The driving section  in the display unit has plural signal processing sections ,  and the signal processing switching section . Power consumption of the display unit is reduced by switching the plural signal processing sections using this signal processing switching section  at any time. This simultaneously means that one display element has plural display states. Accordingly, it is necessary to set the display element itself to be adapted to the plural display states. Therefore, the display element  also can be designed to be combined with the driving circuit section  so that power consumption is further reduced and image quality is further improved. In the following embodiments, an explanation will be given of the use of one signal processing switching section and the plural signal processing sections, but one signal processing section and plural signal processing paths may be also arranged, or the signal processing switching section can be also arranged within the signal processing section when these actions are obtained. Various different modifications are included in a range of possibilities, in which plural signal processing paths can be arranged and selection control can be performed.","The display element  will be explained next.","The display element  is constructed by including a light polarizing state modulating means , a colored light emitting means  for emitting colored light, and an external light reflecting means  for reflecting external light . The colored light emitting display refers to both a case in which an illuminating means other than for external light is arranged, and light emitted from this illuminating means is modulated by the light polarizing state modulating means and is displayed as an image, and a case in which a light emitting element is included and formed in each pixel of the display element, and an image is displayed by adjusting the light emission and luminance of each light emitting element. In the former case, for example, there is a liquid crystal display element in which a backlight is set to the illuminating means and a liquid crystal element is used as a luminance adjusting means. In this case, the liquid crystal display element is the light polarizing state modulating means , and the backlight is the colored light emitting means . In the latter case, there is a display element using an organic LED (Light Emitting Diode) display element and an organic EL (also called Electroluminescence) display element. In this case, the liquid crystal display element also corresponds to the light polarizing state modulating means , but the organic LED display element corresponds to the colored light emitting means . These examples and effects peculiar to this construction will be explained in later embodiments.","One of the common features of the display element  is that the colored light emitting means  is arranged between the light polarizing state modulating means  and the external light reflecting means . Thus, the display element  of the invention can use a mirror of total reflection as the external light reflecting means , instead of a half mirror as used in the conventional display element. Accordingly, there is no loss of light due to the half mirror at each of the reflection display time and the colored light emitting display time. Namely, no trade-off relation is formed in luminance between both of the displays. In a detailed explanation, almost all of each of the external light  and the emitted light  is emitted to the exterior (upward in ) of the display element  by the external light reflecting means , etc., and light can be efficiently utilized so that display of high contrast can be performed and the display quality can be improved. Further, the light emitting means arranged on an upper face of the external light reflecting means has a function of the colored light emitting display so that a bright colored light emitting display can be produced without using a color filter. Furthermore, at the reflection display time, a black-and-white display can be produced without using the colored light emitting means  so that it is possible to adapt the display to each of the light emitting display, the reflection display and a different display method. This is particularly suitable for a device having the above driving circuit section, which can reduce excessive power at the reflection display time and is effective to reduce power consumption.","From the above description, power consumption of the driving section  is greatly reduced by switching of the signal processing (switching of the display states), and the display element  is suitable for both the display states of the colored light emitting display and the reflection display, so that it is possible to produce a display with high contrast and light, as well as high image quality. Further, it is possible to provide a display unit with high image quality and reduced power consumption by combining these constructions.","Detailed constructions of the display element  and the driving section  and effects peculiar to these constructions, etc. will be described in detail in the following embodiments.","The same reference numerals used in each figure designate the same or corresponding objects.","(Embodiment 1)","One embodiment of the display unit in accordance with the invention will be sequentially explained with reference to .","In the display unit of this embodiment, a light emitting display is performed by field sequential driving of multi-gradation color, and reflection display is performed by frame driving of a black-and-white binary display. The field sequential driving of the multi-gradation color is performed at a light emitting display time, since the light emitting display time is a time during which the display unit is used in many cases, and it is believed to improve the convenience of a user requiring the display of a larger amount of information with high image quality. The frame driving of the black-and-white binary display is performed at a reflection display time since the reflection display time is a standby time of the display unit in many cases, and it is considered to reduce power consumption while a function property of the display unit is secured. Namely, this display unit can optimize the consumed power and reduce power consumption by switching driving methods in consideration of a function (display ability, etc.) required for the user at each of the color light emitting display time and the reflection display time. In this specification, the frame driving is a driving method for changing the driving voltage of a liquid crystal for every one frame period, and this term is used to discriminate this frame driving from field sequential driving having plural subframe periods within one frame period.","Points concerning reduction in power consumption in the driving circuit section  (see ) will be explained next.","As mentioned above, the driving section  has the signal processing switching section , the light source control section , and the signal processing sections , . In accordance with the invention, the display element  is set to have a display section including a display control section (a so-called scanning side driving circuit section, a signal side driving circuit section, etc.) for controlling the operation of an active matrix on an active matrix substrate. Each of the constructional elements of the driving section  may be arranged on the active matrix substrate of the display element , and may be also arranged outside the display element . The driving section  is rigidly considered as a functional set of the above constructional elements, however, there is no limit to the position in a concrete arrangement of this driving section .","The signal processing switching section  reduces power consumption by selectively using signal processing corresponding to each of the color light emitting display and the reflection display at any time. Here, we have noticed the difference between both the displays, i.e., the driving method and gradation to reduce power consumption, and the power consumption is reduced with respect to each point. This construction will be explained next.","First, a first point is to switch the driving methods, i.e., operating frequencies. The field sequential color display method is adopted in the light emitting display. Therefore, each subfield (at least three subframe periods in total) of at least the three primary colors RGB is required to perform the color light emitting display in one frame period. In contrast to this, frame driving of the black-and-white display is adopted at the reflection display time so that it is not necessary to arrange the subfield required at the color display time. Accordingly, the operating frequency at the reflection display time is reduced in comparison with the operating frequency at the color light emitting display time, and can be set to at least one-third and less. As a result, the amount of power consumption can be greatly reduced. In this case, it is sufficient to add a circuit construction (driving frequency control section) for switching frequencies of the driving section.","A second point is to reduce power consumption by a method (memory switching method) for switching gradation. As mentioned above, this is because convenience is improved by adopting a multi-gradation display at the color display time, and power consumption is reduced by adopting a binary display at the black-and-white display time. The power consumption can be reduced by setting the binary display to that of black-and-white from color multi-gradation, since the use of a digital-analog converter of relatively large power consumption required to perform the multi-gradation display is avoided. In this case, it is also useful to reduce the power consumption by bypassing a signal path (digital-analog converter) of large power consumption, and simultaneously stopping the supply of a clock to the digital-analog converter. In this case, it is also useful to use a construction for changing memories at the color light emitting display time and the reflection display time. In this embodiment, this construction is realized by providing a function for realizing a memory switching method in the signal processing switching portion . In this specification, this gradation switching method includes switching of an image signal and conversion of bits of the image signal. This method will be also described later.","In a separate view of the second point, at a normal time, i.e., when the light emitting display is selected, the display of a high bit number (n-bits) is performed. In contrast to this, when the reflection display is selected by commands of a user, etc., an image signal for the reflection display suitable for low power consumption is separately regenerated, and the display of a low bit number (m-bits n>m) is performed so that the power consumption is reduced.","A technique for reducing the power consumption will be explained next together with a concrete example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"In each of upper and lower waveforms of , the abscissa shows time, and the ordinate shows a voltage value applied to a pixel electrode. The upper waveform shows a voltage waveform applied at the field sequential color driving time, and the lower waveform shows a voltage waveform applied at the black-and-white frame driving time.","In the application voltage waveform  of the field sequential color driving, one frame period  includes three subframe periods . In each of these subframe periods , the application voltage corresponding to each of the three primary colors RGB is applied to the pixel electrode. Since the three primary colors RGB corresponding to the application voltage are switched in an order of RGB every subframe period, an observer recognizes this switching as a color display. In this figure, one frame period includes the three subframe periods. Therefore, for example, when the frame frequency is set to 60 Hz, it is necessary to set the subframe frequency, i.e., operating frequency to 180 Hz.","In contrast to this, in the application voltage waveform  of the frame driving, no subframe period exists within one frame period . Accordingly, similar to the above case, no subframe period exists even when the frame frequency is set to 60 Hz. Therefore, the frame frequency of 60 Hz is set to the operating frequency as it is.","This display unit notices a difference in operating frequency at the above field sequential color driving time and the frame driving time, and switches the operating frequency at the frame driving time to one-third of the operating frequency at the field sequential color display time. Thus, power consumption can be reduced by the difference in operating frequency. This construction can be realized by providing an operating frequency control section for switching the frequency of a dot clock for controlling a time interval of data transfer to a pixel in accordance with a display mode within e.g., the driving section, a control section of an entire device, etc. At the black-and-white frame display time, i.e., the reflection display time, the power consumption is also reduced by turning-off the light source.","In , the voltage polarity of the application voltage of the field sequential color driving is inverted with respect to a central electric potential for every one subframe period, but it also can be inverted every one frame period. Further, the number of subframes constituting one frame is not limited to three. This is because the object is to reduce power consumption by the difference in frequency.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["105","105","106","240","245","112","113"]},"The first signal processing circuit section  has an n-bit memory  and a digital\/analog converter . The second signal processing circuit section  has a 1-bit memory  and a level shifter . The n-bit memory  and the 1-bit memory  are arranged independently and have a function for holding image signals for the color display and the black-and-white display.","The memory control section  is connected to at least the D\/A converter , the level shifter , the signal control section , the 1-bit memory  and the n-bit memory , and performs a control operation such as the writing of an image signal, etc. by selecting one of the memories in accordance with a control signal. For example, the control signal includes instructions for controlling one of the color display and the black-and-white display, etc. In this embodiment, this image signal is a digital signal. An image signal of n-bits is transmitted in the color multi-gradation display, and an image signal of one bit is transmitted in the black-and-white display (for example, a control section of the entire device if it is a portable device, etc.). In this case, the switching operation may be performed by judging the number of bits of the image signal using the memory control circuit section. In this case, it can be also constructed such that the image signal is also a control signal.","In the above description, the driving section  selects a display path according to the transmitted image signal and the control signal.","An operation and effects of the signal processing switching section  in  will be explained next.","When the memory control section  selects the n-bit memory  using the control signal transmitted from the outside, the image signal is stored in the n-bit memory  and is then converted to an analog signal by the D\/A converter . An image is then displayed in the display element  through the signal control section  and the driving interface . In contrast to this, when the memory control section  selects the 1-bit memory , the image signal is stored in the 1-bit memory  and is then converted to a binary analog signal by the level shifter . An image is then displayed in the display element  through the signal control section  and the driving interface .","In this embodiment, a combination using both the image signals of the n-bit gradation and the 1-bit gradation is adopted as the image signal transmitted from the outside. However, the image signal of only the n-bit gradation is also possible. In this case, a section (bit converting section) for converting n-bits to one bit is added to the memory control section  or the signal processing section . This bit converting circuit section may be also arranged before or after the memory control section. When the bit converting circuit section is arranged after the memory control section, this bit converting circuit section may be arranged before the 1-bit memory. In contrast to this, when the bit converting circuit section is arranged before the memory control section, the memory control section  has this function. A concrete example of the case of generating a signal from n-bits to one bit will be described later.","As mentioned above, it is possible to bypass the D\/A converter  of large power consumption by using a construction in which both the n-bit gradation display and the 1-bit gradation display (binary display) are provided, and in which the D\/A converter  and the level shifter  are selected. Namely, power consumption can be greatly reduced at the one-bit gradation display (binary display) time. This is particularly effective in a situation in which low power consumption is important at a standby time in a portable phone using the display unit.","In this embodiment, the n-bit multi-gradation color display is performed at the time of using the D\/A converter, and the one-bit black-and-white display is performed by two gradations of one bit at the time of using the level shifter, for example. However, the display unit also may be constructed such that the color display at the time of using the D\/A converter can be performed by the multi-gradation of n-bits, and the display at the time of using the level shifter can be set to the color display (eight-color display) of 1-bit gradation in which the 1-bit memory is arranged for each of the three primary colors. This construction is suitable for a case in which only character information is displayed in color in a portable phone using this display unit, etc. This construction is also effective to reduce power consumption.","Otherwise, the display unit also may be constructed such that black-and-white display is performed by n-bit gradation. This has an effect of a reduction in power consumption when a natural image is displayed in gray scale. This construction can be realized by providing a circuit portion for converting a color image signal to a black-and-white image signal. Concretely, each of color multi-gradation display, color 1-bit gradation display, black-and-white (monochromatic) multi-gradation display and black-and-white (monochromatic) 1-bit display can be performed by the construction provided in accordance with the invention.","The arrangement and construction of the entire circuit is not limited to that shown in , but a construction as shown in  also can be used. This construction will be explained next. The difference in construction between  is that the n-bit memory  also can be used in the case of 1-bit gradation display. In a concrete construction, the n-bit memory  of one kind is adopted as a memory and is arranged independently of the D\/A converter  and the level shifter .","The operation and effects of the display unit shown in  will be explained. A memory control section  stores a supplied image signal to a necessary area of the n-bit memory  in accordance with a control signal. The image signal supplied to the memory control section  in this example is set to a combination of an n-bit gradation signal and a 1-bit gradation signal. When the n-bit gradation display is performed, the n-bit gradation signal is supplied to the D\/A converter . In contrast to this, when the 1-bit gradation display is performed, the 1-bit gradation signal is supplied to the level shifter . The D\/A converter  generates an image signal of analog gradation, and the level shifter  generates an image signal of binary gradation. One of the image signals generated through the signal control section  is supplied to the display element . In view of the consumed power, it is desirable to construct the display unit such that a clock is supplied to only one of the D\/A converter  and the level shifter  depending on whether n-bit gradation display or 1-bit gradation display is to be performed.","As mentioned above, it is also possible to use a construction in which the image signal inputted from the exterior of the driving section  is set to n-bits at any time, and a circuit section (bit converting section) for converting the image signal to one bit is arranged before the memory control section , and a construction in which the bit converting section is arranged between the memory control section and the level shifter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"]},"For example, only the memory for green among memories for the three primary colors RGB is used by this memory allocating method, and the display of two gradations can be performed by using the value of a most significant bit of this memory.

It is proposed, as an example of concrete constructions of the signal generating section and the display mode judging section, that a CPU having a function of both the signal generating section and the display mode judging section is provided, and the display mode judging section and the image signal generating section are arranged in software (a program for controlling the operation of a device) of the CPU. Otherwise, it is also proposed in the above example that the display mode judging section and the image signal generating section are provided as a system LSI including the CPU. It is further proposed in the above example that the CPU is the signal generating section, and the circuit section for display mode judgment is separately provided, etc.","In ), the first and second signal processing sections are separately arranged, but may be combined with each other as a single signal processing section, and two processing paths may be arranged within this signal processing section, as mentioned above.

The following construction also can be applied to the construction shown in .","The display mode of ) and () is set to have color multi-gradation (n-bit gradation) and monochromatic two gradations (1-bit gradation). However, the above low light emitting mode also can be added to this mode. A monochromatic signal may be set to gradation of n-bits. In this case, it is necessary to arrange a bit converting section before the level shifter or the 1-bit memory.","A processing flow in ) will be explained first. First, the display mode judging section  judges the display mode (display state) in the display section in response to a button operation by a user and commands of a markup language, and sends judging commands to the image signal generating section. Thereafter, the image signal generating section generates an image signal corresponding to the display mode of the display section based on information transmitted from a wireless portion, etc., and a control signal for controlling an operation of the signal processing switching section, and transmits the generated signals to the signal processing switching means. Each of the generated signals is an n-bit signal for color in the case of the color multi-gradation, and is a 1-bit signal for monochromatic display in the case of the monochromatic two gradations. The signal processing switching section, upon receiving the image signal and the control signal, selectively switches a path of signal processing, i.e., one of the first and second signal processing sections. The above selected signal processing section performs processing for converting the image signal to an analog signal, etc. Thereafter, the display section  displays an image by receiving the image signal. Thus, the display mode of the image can be arbitrarily switched, and convenience can be improved and power consumption can be reduced.","Switching timing of the display mode judged by the display mode judging section is not limited to the user's operation and the markup language, but timing in application, etc. is also considered as mentioned above. The display mode judging section  transmits commands to the signal generating section, but the signal generating section also recognizes a judgment of the display mode judging section, and information transmitting direction is not limited to one direction.","The signal generating section produces the image signal and the control signal, but information of the control signal can be included in the image signal as mentioned above. For example, an operation such as a switching operation performed by recognizing the bit of an image, is possible. An operation such as an operation for reconverting a bit made by the signal generating section in accordance with the display mode, etc. is performed in this case.","Further, it is proposed that switching instructions are directly transmitted to the signal processing switching section while the display mode judging section transmits instructions to the signal generating section and an image signal corresponding to the display mode is generated. It is also proposed that the image signal is generated irrespective of the display mode, but the display mode judging section judges the display mode of the display section and directly transmits instructions to the signal processing switching circuit section.

Thus, the image in an arbitrary display mode can be displayed even when the signal generating section generates an image signal corresponding to the same display mode at any time. Accordingly, convenience can be improved and power consumption can be reduced.","Further, the driving circuit section  in this display unit also controls the operation of a backlight as a light emitting means, and the power consumption is also reduced in view of this backlight control.

The lighting of the light source is controlled by a light source control section in the driving section. For example, an operation of the light source control section is controlled by the signal processing switching section receiving the control signal.","One subframe period includes three periods of a scanning period required to scan m-gate lines, a liquid crystal response period required to produce a sufficient response of the liquid crystal, and a light source lighting period for lighting the light source. Luminance depends on the intensity of transmitted light and the lighting time. Therefore, if the light intensity is the same, a brighter display state can be obtained as the light source lighting period becomes longer. However, the light source lighting period is determined by subtracting the scanning period and the liquid crystal response period from one subframe period.","The liquid crystal response period is set to prevent a deterioration in image quality due to luminance irregularities of a pixel. When no liquid crystal response period is set, light is immediately emitted from the light source after the scanning period. However, no response of the liquid crystal is yet stabilized in a lower portion (near K=m) of a display area. Therefore, no desirable luminance can be obtained even when light is transmitted through this lower portion. As a result, a deterioration in image quality is caused.","The scanning period is set since there is a time difference between a time point for selecting a first gate line and a time point for selecting an m-th gate line. When no scanning period is set, a luminance difference is caused by lighting the light source in the scanning period between upper and lower portions (k=1 and m) of the display area even when the response time of the liquid crystal is a negligible short time. Therefore, a deterioration in image quality is caused.","Accordingly, it is necessary to set the scanning period and the liquid crystal response period, and to light the light source after the liquid crystal of the m-th line makes a sufficient response.","As shown in ), the scanning period is about one-third of the subframe period. Therefore, it is also useful to further reduce power consumption by stopping the supply of a clock signal to a display driver between the liquid crystal response period and the light source lighting period.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0099"},"figref":["FIGS. 8(","FIG. 8(","FIG. 8(","FIGS. 8("],"i":["a","b","a","b","a","b"],"b":["8","8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":["FIG. 8(","FIG. 8("],"i":["a","a"],"b":["140","143","143"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":"FIG. 8(","i":"b","b":"163"},"This display mode can be easily realized by separately and independently on\/off switching the light source and the driving method.","This display mode has advantages in that the power consumption is reduced by reducing the frequency to a frequency corresponding to frame driving, and the power amount of the light source can be reduced by reducing the light source intensity. Namely, the light emitting display of low power consumption can be performed in comparison with a case in which the field sequential color light emitting display is performed. This is particularly effective for use over a long time in a dark place, and is effective to improve convenience as a portable device. ) shows an example of the black-and-white display in which all the red, green and blue colors are lighted. However, it is also possible to perform monochromatic display in which only two or one color among the red, green and blue colors is lighted. Control for increasing the light source intensity under a light environment and decreasing the light source intensity under a dark room environment may be also used by arranging a sensor for monitoring the intensity of the environmental light. Thus, it is possible to prevent a reduction in color purity caused by superposing the luminance of external light on the luminance of the light source under the light environment. Further, power consumption can be reduced while a sufficient visual recognizing property is obtained under the dark room environment. Further, it is useful to arrange a temperature monitor and control frame frequency in accordance with temperature, and switch the color light emitting display to the reflection display. This is because the liquid crystal response speed is reduced under an environment at a low temperature, such as a below-zero temperature, so that the possibility of a reduction in color reproducibility is caused. Thus, the frame frequency can be set to be low under the low temperature environment so that an influence on image quality due to the reduction in liquid crystal response speed can be prevented. Further, it is particularly useful to suitably replace the sequential time order of subframes for every color and every frame under the low temperature environment. Thus, it is possible to prevent a color imbalance caused by a reduction in liquid crystal response speed under a low temperature environment. Otherwise, the display unit may be also constructed such that the color display is compulsorily switched to the black-and-white or monochromatic display at a temperature equal to or lower than a constant temperature.","In the field sequential color driving used in this embodiment, the light source is lighted in a pulse shape so as to increase the display luminance so that it is necessary to set the peak power to be very high. Therefore, it is useful to arrange a precharge circuit for lighting the light source in a pulse shape by continuous power in a light source control section of the driving section . A charge pump operation is performed by an action of this precharge circuit, and it is possible to prevent a sudden load due to generation of the peak power from being applied to a storage battery. Thus, wearing of the storage battery is reduced, and the life time of a device can be lengthened.","Further, when a point light source such as an LED, etc. is used, an incident light ratio can be improved by forming a notch in an incident portion of light emitted from the LED in a light guide body. A widening angle of emitted light can be widened by forming a cylindrical lens on an emitting face of the LED, and uniformity of illumination can be improved. If the above light emission can be performed, a fluorescent tube of each of the three primary colors RGB, etc. also can be used.","As explained above, the unnecessary case of power can be reduced at the reflection display time and power consumption can be greatly reduced by arranging the driving section , having the signal processing sections , , and the signal processing switching means  in the display unit.","The display element  in this embodiment will be explained next.","As mentioned above, one of the features of this display unit is that the driving section  having a switching means operating in accordance with the signal processing method is arranged to reduce power consumption.

An orientation film for orientating the liquid crystal is formed on liquid crystal layer contact sides of the transparent substrate  and the active matrix substrate , although this construction is omitted in ) and (). Further, the cell gap, which is the distance between the transparent substrate  and the active matrix substrate , is set to 2 \u03bcm in consideration of high speed response of the liquid crystal. If the field sequential color display can be performed, another display mode can be also applied naturally. When the display element is used in a portable information terminal, there are many cases in which this display unit is seen from a lower side. Therefore, an angle of visual field is symmetrically set on left-hand and right-hand sides, and is set to be wide from the lower side, and is set to be narrow on an upper side so that convenience is usefully improved. These constructions can be adjusted by the rubbing angle.","The active matrix substrate  has a display portion in which pixels are arranged in a matrix shape. A transistor as an active element is arranged in each pixel. In this display element, a transistor using amorphous silicon is used as one example, but any one of amorphous silicon, polycrystal silicon and monocrystal silicon may be also used as a semiconductor material forming an active element such as a transistor, etc. When amorphous silicon and polycrystal silicon are used, a glass substrate is normally used. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the glass substrate is used as the active matrix substrate . As a method of production of the active matrix substrate, there are a method for arranging the active element in an epitaxial growing layer of monocrystal silicon formed on the glass substrate, and a method in which an active matrix circuit structure formed on a monocrystal silicon substrate in advance is separated by a lift-off method and is stuck onto the glass substrate.","Next, the backlight  (corresponding to the colored light emitting means  and the external light reflecting means  in ) in ) and () will be explained. The backlight  in the embodiment 1 has both a function for guiding light from a white LED as a light source to the liquid crystal cell  by scattering this light, and a function as a reflection plate for reflecting external light  incident through the liquid crystal cell .","The backlight  sequentially has a light polarizing maintaining type scattering layer , a light guide body  and a light polarizing maintaining scattering reflection plate  on one side of the liquid crystal cell . The backlight  is constructed by arranging a white LED  which can perform field sequential lighting of the three primary colors on a side face of the light guide body . The light polarizing maintaining scattering layer  has a function for scattering transmitted light, but approximately maintaining a light polarizing state before and after the transmission. The light polarizing maintaining scattering layer  may be basically constructed by a layer in which the light absorption in the entire visible ray range is very small, and the refractive index is slightly changed in an order approximately equal to or smaller than a wavelength of light on a layer face in a thickness direction, and has a distribution. For example, it is possible to apply a film formed by dispersing particles of a material slightly different in refractive index from a medium into a polymer film and resin, a hologram made by using a photosensitive material to an ultraviolet ray, etc., a layer using a material formed by dispersing particulates of a material slightly different in refractive index from an adhesive into resin such as an adhesive, a prism sheet having a scattering property, etc. When the prism sheet is applied, the prism sheet can function as a reflection plate for reflection of external light. The light polarizing maintaining type scattering reflection plate  has a function for reflecting and scattering light, but approximately maintaining a light polarizing state before and after the reflection. In a structure of the light polarizing maintaining type scattering reflection plate , for example, fine irregular faces are formed on the surface of a light guide body, and a high reflectivity metallic plate of aluminum, etc. is formed by an evaporation method, sputtering method, etc. It is useful in obtaining uniformity of luminance to provide a distribution on a face with respect to the above fine irregular shape, and it is particularly useful to make emitted light  from the light source arranged on a side face uniformly incident onto the liquid crystal cell . As another constructional example of the light polarizing maintaining scattering reflection plate , there is an embodiment in which the light guide body  and the reflection plate are adhered to each other by an adhesive, and particles of resin, glass, etc. slightly different in refractive index from the adhesive are dispersed into the adhesive. Further, it is also possible to provide a polymer type liquid crystal layer disposed between transparent electrodes, in which a scattering state and a transmitting state are switched by electric control, and the scattering state is set at the color light emitting display time, and the transmitting state is set at the reflection display time. In this case, a reduction in color purity caused by superposing white external light can be prevented, and it is particularly effective during use under a bright environment, such as outdoors, etc.","The above light polarizing maintaining scattering layer  and the light polarizing maintaining type scattering reflection plate  may be arranged as one portion of the light guide body, as mentioned above, and it may be also arranged as a layer separated from the light guide body. This is because the objective in this arrangement is to maintain the light polarizing states of incident light and reflected light.","When a point light source such as an LED, etc. is used, the light polarizing state is maintained in the light guide body itself, and it is further preferable to use a light guide body having a scattering property. In this case, an effect of making a locus of light inconspicuous is obtained. It is considered that a construction for providing the scattering property is similar to that of the light polarizing maintaining scattering layer . However, it is necessary to set the scattering property of the light guide body to be weaker than that of the light polarizing maintaining scattering layer so as to maintain a light guide property of the light guide body. For example, it is necessary to devise the light guide body such that the density of particles dispersed into the above resin is reduced, etc. In this case, the light guide body may be considered to be a second light polarizing maintaining scattering layer, and the light scattering property can be provided by forming a groove on an entire lower face of this light guide body. Further, when this groove is formed in a prismatic shape, the light guide body can function as a reflection plate for reflection of external light.","Operations and effects of the display element in the embodiment 1 at the color light emitting display time and the reflection display time will be explained next.","First, the display element at the color light emitting display time in ) will be explained.","An LED of each of the red, green and blue colors provided in the white LED  as a light source is sequentially lighted in time, and emitted light  is incident on the light guide body . The incident emitted light  is scattered and reflected on the light polarizing maintaining type scattering reflection plate  and the light polarizing maintaining type scattering layer , and is uniformly irradiated to the entire liquid crystal cell . The display section in the liquid crystal cell  synchronizes image information every color with the emitted light  of each of the red, green and blue colors emitted from the above white LED , and displays an image in the field sequential system. The emitted light  transmitted through the liquid crystal cell is shifted in time in each of the red, green and blue colors, and is emitted in monochromatic color. However, an observer recognizes this emitted light as a color image due to the afterimage effects of the eyes. This state is represented as the color light emitting display. In the embodiment 1, a diffusion means and a diffusion reflection means are arranged such that the light guide body  is nipped. Therefore, the emitted light  can be approximately uniformly incident on the liquid crystal cell  at any time. Further, since no color filter is used, high light utilization efficiency can be obtained.","The display element at the reflection display time in ) will be explained next. Since no display element in the embodiment 1 has a color filter, the black-and-white display is set at the reflection display time.","In the black-and-white display, no white LED  is lighted, and external light  is used as the light source. The external light  is sequentially transmitted through the liquid crystal cell  and the light polarizing maintaining scattering layer , and is reflected on the light polarizing maintaining scattering reflection plate  arranged in the light guide body . The external light  is again transmitted through the light polarizing maintaining scattering layer , and is modulated in luminance by the liquid crystal cell . Thereafter, the external light  is recognized as image information in an observer's eyes.","In the embodiment 1, the light polarizing state is maintained by arranging the light polarizing maintaining scattering layer  and the light polarizing maintaining scattering reflection plate  to brightly hold the reflection display. This feature will be explained next.","First, the external light  used as a light source is transmitted through first and second light polarizing plates ,  of the liquid crystal cell . In this case, the external light  is absorbed by the first light polarizing plate , modulated by a liquid crystal layer , and absorbed by the second light polarizing plate  so that the external light  attains a light polarizing state. The external light  in the light polarizing state is then diffused and reflected on the light polarizing maintaining scattering layer  and the light polarizing maintaining scattering reflection plate . The external light  is again incident on the liquid crystal cell  so that image information is obtained. However, in a case in which no light polarizing state (in an axial direction of a second polarizer  through which the reflected light is easily transmitted) is maintained when the reflected light  is again incident on the liquid crystal cell , a light polarizing component shifted from a light polarizing direction is produced. Therefore, this shifted light polarizing component is again absorbed by the second light polarizing plate  of the liquid crystal cell  so that brightness is lost by this absorption. Accordingly, it is necessary to maintain the light polarizing state of the external light  before and after the reflection and the diffusion within the backlight . Therefore, in this embodiment, the light polarizing maintaining scattering layer  and the light polarizing maintaining scattering reflection plate  are used. When a sufficient scattering state is obtained by the first and second light polarizing maintaining scattering layers, the light polarizing maintaining scattering reflection plate  may be also set as a mirror face.","Light is also scattered and reflected by arranging the light polarizing maintaining scattering layer  and the light polarizing maintaining scattering reflection plate  to reduce the problem of a double image caused by parallax, etc.","The problem of the double image, etc. will be explained first.","In a conventional reflection type liquid crystal display in which a liquid crystal cell having light polarizing plates on both faces is provided and a reflection plate is also arranged outside the liquid crystal cell, a white image (light image) is formed on a surface of the reflection plate, and a black image (dark image) is formed in the position of a first light polarizing plate  disposed onto an observer's side thereof. Accordingly, when these images are observed in a slanting direction shifted from a substrate normal line of the liquid crystal display, a display image is seen in which the positions of the white and black images are shifted (are floated upward). Accordingly, a problem exists in that a double image caused by parallax is seen.","Further, in a case in which the external light  reaches the observer by passing through different pixels when the external light  is incident on the liquid crystal display and after the external light  becomes reflected light , the brightness levels and luminance levels of the pixels at the incident and reflection times are averaged and recognized by the observer. Accordingly, when the white and black images are adjacent to each other, a pixel to be originally seen as white looks slightly dark, etc. Therefore, a frizzy appearance of the display image is recognized, and a deterioration in image quality is caused. This problem becomes even more serious in a liquid crystal display using a color filter. Namely, when the external light and the reflected light pass through color filters of different colors, the color filters absorb the different colored lights in nature. Accordingly, the light can be hardly transmitted, and the brightness of the display image is greatly reduced together with the fuzzy appearance of the display image.","These problems become notable as the thickness of the glass substrate constituting the liquid crystal cell is increased, and the distance between the display element and the reflection plate is increased. Therefore, a deterioration in image quality is caused. Accordingly, it is necessary to reduce the thickness of the glass substrate and the distance between the display element and the reflection plate so as to prevent this deterioration in image quality.","With this in mind, the invention provides a structure in which the light emitting means is arranged in front of the reflection plate. Accordingly, the problem of increasing the distance between the position (reflecting position of the external light) where the white image is formed and the position (the position of the light polarizing plate) where the black image is formed remains. However, this problem is solved in accordance with the invention by arranging the light polarizing maintaining type scattering layer  between the liquid crystal cell  and the light guide body  to make the image forming positions of the white and black images approach each other. In this embodiment 1, no color filter is arranged. Accordingly, the problem of light interruption due to the color filter is naturally solved, and the problems of the so-called double image and the fuzzy appearance of the image are also solved so that the deterioration in image quality is prevented. These operational effects will be explained next.","First, the external light  is transmitted through the first light polarizing plate  of the liquid crystal cell , the liquid crystal layer  and the second light polarizing plate . After light and dark image information is obtained, the external light  is transmitted through the light polarizing maintaining scattering layer , and is reflected on the light polarizing maintaining scattering reflection plate . The external light  is again transmitted through the light polarizing maintaining scattering layer  so that the external light  is scattered plural times. This light again has an approximately uniform intensity distribution. This uniform light is first transmitted through the liquid crystal cell , and an observer recognizes this light as an image. In this case, the black image is formed in the first light polarizing plate , and the white image is formed between the liquid crystal cell  and the light guide body , i.e., at a position of the light polarizing maintaining scattering layer . As a result, the distance between the white and black images can be shortened. Thus, the problems of double image due to parallax and the fuzzy image due to the averaging of brightness can be solved, and a display element of high image quality can be obtained. The light polarizing maintaining scattering reflection plate  operating as a reflecting means need not necessarily have a scattering means to obtain the above effects of making the image forming distances approach each other. However, it is more desirable that the reflecting means also has a scattering means in consideration of a viewpoint in which a uniform property of emitted light of the backlight at the light emitting display time is obtained.","The problems of the double image due to parallax, the fuzzy image, the light interruption due to the color filter, etc. can be solved for the first time by using the construction provided in the embodiment 1 according to the above description, while the light efficiency is increased. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain a display element in which both the colored light emitting display and the reflection display with high image quality can be performed by one display element. Power consumption also can be reduced by only the driving circuit section . Therefore, when it is sufficient to obtain effects of only the driving circuit , for example, it is also possible to use a reflection type display element of a front light type as the display element  in addition to the display element  of the invention. In the present system, negativity and positivity of the image are not inverted at the color light emitting display time and the reflection display time. Therefore, the contrast ratio is not easily reduced even when the external light is superposed on light from the white LED  as a light source at the field sequential color display time. Image display easily visualized (having high tolerance) can be performed at any time under various environments of different brightness levels.","As mentioned above, if the driving circuit section  and the display element  of this embodiment are used, it is possible to realize a bright display unit in which the power consumption is low and the contrast is high in each of the light emitting display and the reflection display.","(Embodiment 2)","An embodiment 2 of the display unit according to the invention will be explained with reference to .","The display unit of this embodiment is constructed such that the field sequential color display also can be performed at the reflection display time. This display unit is characterized in that a second liquid crystal cell  is newly arranged on the liquid crystal cell  of the display unit in the embodiment 1. In this embodiment, various voltages are superposed and applied to this second liquid crystal cell  and the birefringence of this liquid crystal cell is changed so that the transmission spectrum is arbitrarily adjusted and is utilized as a switchable color filter. In another example of the switchable color filter, a tunable filter of COLORLINK Corporation, etc. is also preferable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0137","num":"0136"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":"133"},"The light amount is reduced by this construction since the color filter is used. However, since this construction is combined with the display unit in the embodiment 1, it is possible to obtain a display in which the above effects are obtained, i.e., the double image caused by parallax and the fuzzy image due to averaging of luminance are eliminated. Since the entire face has a single color, there is no case in which the colors of transmitting filters of the incident light and the reflected light are different from each other. Therefore, the above problem of light interruption of the color filter caused by parallax is not caused. Accordingly, it is possible to sufficiently perform bright color image display with high image quality in comparison with the display unit using the normal color filter.","It is considered as one of the optimum utilization modes of the display unit having the above effects that the above reflection type field sequential color display is performed at the reflection display time, and the bright field sequential color light emitting display described in the embodiment 1 is performed without using the switchable filter at the color light emitting display time. In this case, it is desirable to arrange a filter switching circuit section for switching between use and non-use of the switchable color filter in the driving switching circuit section  in accordance with necessity. Concretely, there is a method in which an organic LED selection switch (light source selection switch) and a liquid crystal selection switch for selecting the second liquid crystal cell  are independently arranged, and the color light emitting display and the reflection display are switched in accordance with the necessity of a user or device control software.

On the other hand, in a use in which a deterioration in contrast is prevented, the black matrix can be naturally used.

An organic LED layer for emitting any one of the three primary colors RGB is formed in each of the subpixels arranged in parallel with each other. At the light emitting display time, the color display can be performed by arbitrarily modulating luminance levels of the three subpixels of RGB.","The embodiment 4 is characterized in that the common wiring  is arranged between the organic LED layer and the liquid crystal layer . The common wiring required in each of the organic LED layer  and the liquid crystal layer  can be combined by this construction. Further, an in-plane switching system for operating the liquid crystal by an electric field component parallel to the substrate can be adopted as the liquid crystal display system. In this case, it is necessary to adjust a liquid crystal material and the thickness of the liquid crystal layer so as to obtain a preferable contrast ratio in a display of the reflection type. Further, it is also necessary to arrange the phase plate  in accordance with necessity. In the embodiment 4, the phase plate  is a one-fourth wavelength plate, and the reflection display having preferable characteristics in angle of visual field can be obtained by adopting the in-plane switching system.","The circuit construction of a pixel section of the display element in the embodiment 4 will be explained with reference to .","An area surrounded by a broken line shows one subpixel . Each subpixel is constructed by including at least a first transistor , a second transistor , a third transistor , a fourth transistor , a holding capacitor , an organic LED layer  and a liquid crystal layer . An organic LED selection switch  and a liquid crystal selection line  are arranged outside the subpixel.","The organic LED selection switch  is connected to an electric current supply source. Each of the first, second and third transistors is an NMOS (n-channel Metal Oxide Semiconductor), and the fourth transistor is a PMOS (p-channel MOS). A drain and a gate of the first transistor  are respectively connected to a data line  and a scanning line . Gates of the third and fourth transistors are respectively connected to the liquid crystal selection line .","A case in which the organic LED selection switch  is turned on and the liquid crystal selection line  is set to be low in voltage, will be explained. First, a signal Vd of the data line  is sample-held by the timing of a selection pulse inputted to the gate of the first transistor  through the scanning line . Concretely, the signal Vd is written to the holding capacitor  arranged between the data line  and organic LED common wiring . An electric current supplied from common wiring  is applied to the organic LED layer  by controlling an operation of the second transistor  by a voltage of the signal Vd written to the gate holding capacitor . Thus, the organic LED layer  emits light at specific intensity in accordance with this electric current value. The electric current value can be constantly set, and the light emitting luminance also can be adjusted by time width.","At this time, the third transistor is turned off, and no voltage Vd of the holding capacitor  is applied to the liquid crystal layer . However, since the fourth transistor  is turned on, both ends of the liquid crystal layer  are connected to the common wiring . Accordingly, the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer  becomes 0 Vrms so that the liquid crystal layer  is not operated, and contributes to an improvement of contrast ratio as a one-fourth wavelength plate.","When the organic LED selection switch  is turned off and the liquid crystal selection line  is set to be high in voltage, the fourth transistor  is turned off and the third transistor  is turned on. Therefore, the liquid crystal layer  is operated by the signal voltage Vd written to the holding capacitor . At this time, since the second transistor  is turned off, no organic LED layer  emits light. Accordingly, reflection display using the liquid crystal layer can be performed.","The display element using in-plane switching can be provided by the above construction, and operations of the organic LED layer  and the liquid crystal layer  can be arbitrarily switched in accordance with necessity. Further, the color light emitting display and the reflection display of the liquid crystal operation can be easily switched by independently adjusting the light emitting luminance levels of the respective subpixels of the three primary colors RGB arranged in parallel with each other.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0169","num":"0168"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":"202"},"A display section is constructed by longitudinally and transversally arranging subpixels  by a required number in parallel with each other.

The settlement service provider can directly communicate details of the proxy-executed settlement to the user, or can communicate such information to the information terminal of the user through the connection service provider.
