The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations, drawings, and techniques illustrated below, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.","The present disclosure describes a system and methods that promote a telecommunications service provider or other organization to monitor and selectively capture and store entries made into a portable electronic device. The telecommunications service provider forwards the entries to a plurality of customers to view or otherwise experience. The entries are associated with ring tones, wallpapers, themes, and other settings entered into the portable electronic device. The system may also capture and forward transmissions received by the portable electronic device related to interactions of the device with other parties. The interactions may take place using short message service (SMS) or text messaging, electronic mail messaging, and internet browsing, for example. Customers of the telecommunications service provider receive the collections of entries, received transmissions, and other content using their own devices, for example portable electronic devices. The customer devices may load applications, media files, and web widgets used by the monitored portable electronic device as an ID. This may permit the customer devices to mimic or simulate the monitored portable electronic device and may allow users of customer devices to emulate and\/or share some of the experiences of the user of the portable electronic device and adopt the user's preferences.","As used herein, an ID comprises one or more of applications, media files, and web widgets. An ID may further comprise installation logic that brings the applications, media files, and\/or web widgets into service on an electronic device. In some cases, the applications, media files, and\/or web widgets may be tested to confirm a standard amount of interoperability and\/or compatibility. Thus, an ID comprises a unity which may be loaded, unloaded, cached, activated, deactivated as a group.","Celebrities, public figures, and other persons may use portable electronic devices, for example, mobile telephones, and take actions with their devices that are of interest to admirers or fans. The selection and configuration of portable electronic devices and their applications and other software may be viewed as statements or expressions of lifestyle preferences among some sectors of device users. A configuration for a ring tone or wallpaper, for example, made by the celebrity may be of interest to thousands or even millions of persons that admire the celebrity and are interested in and wish to emulate the celebrity's tastes and lifestyle choices. The admirers also wish to learn promptly about the celebrity's interactions with other persons, including other celebrities. The celebrity may enter into a commercial arrangement with the telecommunications service provider or other entity wherein the celebrity permits the provider to monitor, capture, and store some entries made by the celebrity into his or her portable electronic device. The provider creates files that mirror the celebrity's ID, including applications, media files, and widgets. The provider forwards these captured and stored entries to a plurality of its customers, for example fans and admirers of the celebrity, that subscribe to this service and wish to be kept informed on a timely basis of the celebrity's choices in device-related activities. The provider may also advise its subscribers of applications, media files, and web widgets used by the celebrity as his or her ID. The provider gives the subscribers a mechanism to download and install copies of this software that become components of IDs on the subscribers' devices. This may promote the subscribers to emulate the celebrity and enjoy the same experiences with their devices as enjoyed by the celebrity.","The system described herein additionally captures interactions of the celebrity with other devices and computers, for example text messaging and internet web site browsing and downloading. When the celebrity engages in text message interactions with selected other devices or browses some web sites, makes inquiries or postings, and downloads content, this information is provided to subscribing customers of the telecommunications service provider. Subscribing customers receive messages from the provider that describe text messaging between the monitored celebrity and another celebrity, for example, wherein both celebrities may provide authorization for this activity. Subscribing customers receive information about their favorite celebrities' web browsing of popular or trendy restaurant web sites. By installing and using one, some, or all of the applications, media files, and web widgets used by the monitored celebrity as an ID or portion of the celebrity's device interface, customers of the telecommunications service provider may stay current with many of the celebrity's preferences, choices, and interactions. The telecommunications service provider may generate revenues and user loyalty from such a commercial arrangement.","The telecommunications service provider may offer a similar service wherein a single customer may be provided information about the portable electronic device usage and movements of a plurality of users such as employees or children. While the usage of one device user, such as a celebrity, may be monitored, captured, and conveyed to a large quantity of admirers, one subscriber may alternatively receive information about portable electronic device usage by many users. The subscriber may concurrently view portable electronic device entries and interactions by the monitored users in tiled or cascaded panels of a monitor of a computer or interchangeable screens of a smaller device. This may allow a parent to selectively monitor the portable electronic device usage and associated actions of a child or may allow an employer to monitor the actions and movements of some field employees, such as drivers or sales people.","Turning now to , a system  is provided.

In an embodiment, the keypad, voice, and other entries may be captured in other ways, for example by a component installed and executing on the portable electronic device  such as the client module , and transmitted to the monitoring server  under push, pull, or other arrangements that will be discussed in greater detail hereinafter. The monitoring application  stores the entries in the database  or elsewhere in files that mirror the ID  or collection of applications, media files, and widgets comprising elements of the user interface of the portable electronic device . The monitoring application  may also capture and store messages received by the portable electronic device  from other portable electronic devices  and other computers, such as the web server . The messages received by the portable electronic device  may be in reply to the entries made by the user of the portable electronic device , for example entries associated with text messaging, electronic mail messaging, or web browsing. In an embodiment, the monitoring application  stores the entries made by the portable electronic device  and the messages received by the portable electronic device  from the portable electronic device  or others in chronological order or in another manner. The entries may receive time stamps when made and may be arranged by the monitoring application  after capturing in accordance with their time stamps for transmission to the customer devices , . This promotes the sequence of entries and messages to be intelligible to the users of the customer devices ,  that receive this content under subscription or other arrangements with the telecommunications service provider.","The telecommunications service provider may capture keypad entries related to configurations, outgoing messages, and incoming transmissions for selected celebrities, public figures, and other persons of interest that use the portable electronic device . Because the tastes, preferences, lifestyle choices, and activities of celebrities such as athletes and actors may be of intense interest to large portions of the general public, their portable electronic device configurations and usage as expressions of their lifestyles and personalities may be of value to fans and admirers that in this disclosure are users of the customer devices , . Interest in device usage, including communications, by celebrities may be particularly intense when the information may be captured by the monitoring application  and conveyed to the customer devices ,  on a timely basis. Having fresh or late-breaking information about a popular athlete, actor, or other celebrity may be valuable to a user of the customer device , especially if the celebrity is considered to be a trend setter in fashion, style, or culture. Timely information, for example information captured and provided to customer devices ,  within an hour or several hours of its entry or other occurrence, about text messaging, web searching, and other interactions by the celebrity that may involve other celebrities or provide information about activities considered fashionable may also be of intense interest to users of customer devices , . By learning the ring tones, wallpaper choices, and themes of choice of one or several of a person's favorite celebrities, the person may emulate the celebrity. This may extend to products and services chosen by the celebrity. The telecommunications service provider may establish marketing and business alliances with manufacturers and vendors of products chosen by celebrities wherein fans and other admirers follow suit and purchase large amounts of these products. The telecommunications service provider may derive financial benefit from assisting in creating associations of celebrities and chosen products in the minds of many members of the general public that may then patronize these products.","The portable electronic device  is one of a mobile telephone, media player, or personal digital assistant (PDA) used by a celebrity or other person of interest. The portable electronic device  may also be a notebook computer, tablet computer, or an electronic device designed for the purpose of reading digital books and periodicals that uses e-ink technology to display content to readers. The celebrity may contract to allow the telecommunications service provider to monitor, capture, and forward some of the celebrity's entries into the portable electronic device .

The bundles become the ID  when installed on the portable electronic device . The selected bundle is downloaded to the portable electronic device  and installed by a custom toolset comprising a software installer included with the bundle. The installation may take place automatically without user action. The chosen applications, media files, and\/or widgets comprising the ID  are installed and automatically configured. In an embodiment, one or more of the applications, media files, widgets, or other components of the ID  provide user interfaces that may, for example make available controls for user navigation and entry of choices. For example, an application loaded as a component of the ID  may be an internet web link to a restaurant locator web site. The application may provide an interface with controls allowing the user of the portable electronic device  to navigate about the restaurant locator and make selections regarding restaurant reservations and driving directions to the restaurant.","The ID  comprises more than individual applications, media files, and widgets for deployment on the portable electronic device . The bundles that contain the applications, media files, and\/or widgets also contain the software installer that invokes routines or scripts that cause the applications, media files, and\/or widgets to be installed in an automated and pre-tested fashion. This alleviates the installation process of requesting user intervention, for example making manual selections or restarting the portable electronic device . The routines or scripts invoked by the software installer are tested before being built into the bundles to assure that the applications, media files, and\/or widgets install smoothly without intervention. The applications, media files, and\/or widgets themselves are also tested before inclusion in the bundles and determined to be functioning as designed and free or viruses and other malicious elements.","Similar to the initial installation of the ID  on the portable electronic device , other IDs may be loaded, unloaded, cached, and reloaded at subsequent times and under specific conditions, such as when the portable electronic device  is detected to enter a particular location, for example a retail store or an entertainment venue. While the initial set of applications, media files, and\/or widgets associated with the ID  obtained from the telecommunications service provider may comprise portions of a default ID, other IDs may be loaded with the user's approval and substitute for the applications, media files, and\/or widgets associated with the default ID. When the portable electronic device  is detected to enter a retail store by technology located at the retail store, for example, Wi-Fi functionality of the portable electronic device  may be turned on, and an ID associated with the retail store may be temporarily loaded on the portable electronic device . The retail store's ID may comprise applications, media files, and\/or widgets providing a floor map of the retail store, in-store radio providing music and announcements of promotions, and special messages to the portable electronic device  based on previous shopping behavior by the user. When the portable electronic device  exits the retail store, the store's ID may be unloaded, and the previous ID  may be reloaded.","In an embodiment, the ID  and other IDs may be fully or partially cached in the portable electronic device  when they are unloaded or deactivated upon the entry of the retail store or other premises that provide their own customized IDs. For example, the ID  may be a default ID for the portable electronic device . When the portable electronic device  enters the retail establishment as described above, the ID  is replaced by the ID of the retail establishment but is fully or partially cached in storage of the portable electronic device  and is therefore not deleted. This is in anticipation of the portable electronic device  exiting the retail establishment, the ID of the retail establishment being removed, and the default ID  being restored. It may be technically and economically unfeasible for the default ID  to be completely deleted and reinstalled each time the portable electronic device  enters and later exits the retail establishment. While the default ID  is deactivated and unloaded, it is not deleted, rather fully or partially cached in anticipation of its being reloaded upon exit of the portable electronic device  from the retail establishment. When the default ID  is partially cached, the portions of the default ID  that are not cached, and therefore may need to be located and downloaded again, are obtained from content servers associated with the monitoring server , the database , or from other sources.","For further details about IDs and loading IDs see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/876,220, filed Sep. 6, 2010, entitled \u201cProvisioning System and Methods for Interfaceless Phone\u201d by Jason R. Delker, et al., and U.S. patent application Ser.

It is fundamental to the electrical engineering and software engineering arts that functionality that can be implemented by loading executable software into a computer can be converted to a hardware implementation by well known design rules. Decisions between implementing a concept in software versus hardware typically hinge on considerations of stability of the design and numbers of units to be produced rather than any issues involved in translating from the software domain to the hardware domain. Generally, a design that is still subject to frequent change may be preferred to be implemented in software, because re-spinning a hardware implementation is more expensive than re-spinning a software design. Generally, a design that is stable that will be produced in large volume may be preferred to be implemented in hardware, for example in an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), because for large production runs the hardware implementation may be less expensive than the software implementation. Often a design may be developed and tested in a software form and later transformed, by well known design rules, to an equivalent hardware implementation in an application specific integrated circuit that hardwires the instructions of the software.
