{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to social networking systems and other systems in which users can form connections with other users, and in particular, applying computer vision algorithms to user-uploaded multimedia objects to detect specific objects within the multimedia object, and promoting the uploaded multimedia object from a users' news feed to a sponsored stories area.","This disclosure hereby incorporates by reference commonly-owned U.S. utility patent application, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/020,745 entitled, \u201cSponsored Stories Unit Creation from Organic Activity Stream,\u201d previously filed on 3 Feb. 2011.","This disclosure hereby incorporates by reference commonly-owned U.S. utility patent application, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/044,506 entitled, \u201cEndorsement Subscriptions for Sponsored Stories\u201d previously filed on 9 Mar. 2011.","Social networks, or social utilities that track and enable connections between users (including people, businesses, and other entities), have become prevalent in recent years. In particular, social networking systems allow users to communicate information more efficiently. For example, a user may post contact information, background information, job information, hobbies, or other user-specific data to a location associated with the user on a social networking system. Other users can then review the posted data by browsing user profiles or searching for profiles including specific data. Social networking systems also allow users to associate themselves with other users, thus creating a web of connections among the users of social networking system. These connections among the users can be leveraged by the website to offer more relevant information to each user in view of the users' own stated interests in their connections.","A system, such as a website, that allows users to interact with the system typically stores a record for each users of the system. These records may comprise information provided by the user as well as information gathered by the system related to activities or actions of the user on the system. For example, a system may require a user to enter information such as contact information, gender, preferences, interests, and the like in an initial interaction with the system, which is stored in the user's record. A user's activities on the system, such as frequency of access of particular information on the system, also provide information that can be stored in the user's record. The system may then use information provided by the user and information gathered about the user, to customize interactions of the system with the user. For example, a website selling books may keep track of a users previous purchases and provide the user with information on related books during subsequent interactions with the system. Information in a user's profile may also be used by the system to target sponsored stories that are of interest to the user. Using information collected from and about users results in a system that is more efficient and beneficial for both the user and the system.","Users interacting with the social network may post stories or status updates to a live activity stream, such as a \u201cnews feed.\u201d A news feed is a data format typically used for providing users with frequently updated content. A social networking system may provide various news feeds to its users, where each news feed includes content relating to a specific subject matter or topic, or other users. Various pieces of content may be aggregated into a single news feed. In some implementations, a social networking system may provide a news feed that includes selected entries corresponding to activities of a user's first-degree contacts or pages or topics that a user has indicated an interest. Individual users of the social networking system may subscribe to specific news feeds of their interest. A group of related actions may be presented together to a user of the social networking system in the same news feed. For example, a news feed concerning the event organized through the social networking system may include information about the event such as its time, location, and attendees, and photos taken at the event, which have been uploaded to the social networking system.","Sponsored or promoted stories generated from actual stories in users' newsfeeds are more likely to be viewed by users, because they generally involve interactions or suggestions by their connected friends, or fan pages that they are connected or subscribed to. However, sponsored stories require explicit, on-network interaction with a sponsor node, such as a check-in to a physical location, \u201cliking\u201d their hub page, commenting on their hub page, reviewing their product, and the like. A significant portion of off-network activity lacking explicit user interaction, is captured in uploaded photos.","The figures depict various embodiments of the present disclosure for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.","Overview","Particular embodiments relate to a social networking environment including a social networking system and related systems that integrate individual stories, status updates, and user interactions with an advertising system. A social networking system offers its users the ability to communicate and interact with other users of the social networking system. Users join the social networking system and then add connections to a number of other users to whom they desire to be connected. Once they are members of the social network, the users may interact with the social network itself, by posting stories and status messages on their own page, other users, by commenting, posting stories, etc. on other users' pages, or with non-user entities, such as fan pages that they subscribe to, online deals they redeem or subscribe to, or locations that they check in to.","In the present disclosure, the social network environment may be described in terms of a social graph including social graph information. In particular embodiments, one or more computing systems of the social network environment implementing the social network environment include, store, or have access to a data structure that includes social graph information for use in implementing the social network environment described herein. The social network utilizes a social graph that includes nodes representing users and concepts in the social network environment as well as edges that define or represent connections between such nodes.","In particular embodiments, the social graph information includes a first set of user nodes that each correspond to a respective user, and a second set of concept nodes that each correspond to a respective concept. As used herein, a \u201cuser\u201d may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third party application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over such a social network environment. As used herein, a \u201cconcept\u201d may refer to virtually anything that a user may declare or otherwise demonstrate an interest in, a like towards, or a relationship with, such as, by way of example, a sport, a sports team, a genre of music, a musical composer, a hobby, a business (enterprise), an entity, a group, a third party application, a celebrity, a person who is not a registered user, etc. In particular embodiments, each node has, represents, or is represented by, a corresponding web page (\u201cprofile page\u201d) hosted or accessible in the social network environment.","By way of example, a user node may have a corresponding user profile page in which the corresponding user can add content, make declarations, and otherwise express him or herself, while a concept node may have a corresponding concept profile page (\u201chub\u201d) in which a plurality of users can add content, make declarations, and express themselves, particularly in relation to the concept. In particular embodiments, the social graph information further includes a plurality of edges that each define or represent a connection between a corresponding pair of nodes in the social graph.","Implementations of the present disclosure extend these concepts by allowing sponsors to export by promoting specific newsfeed stories to sponsored story space on users' social networking pages, thereby increasing the display duration and viewing frequency of these stories. In particular, implementations of the present disclosure allow sponsors or advertisers to capture off-network behavior or interactions with their brand by applying computer-vision algorithms to user-uploaded multimedia objects, such as photographs and videos.","In particular embodiments, the social networking system maintains a photographic object database of various objects. In particular embodiments, the images in the photographic object database are generated by the social network itself. In particular embodiments, the images are submitted by administrators of nodes associated with businesses, such as business owners. A particular business owner may submit a photo image of his or her storefront, for example. As an example, a particular sponsor may submit multiple photos of its logo or product. In particular embodiments, the photographic location database is provided by a third-party such as Google images. In particular embodiments, the images may be uploaded and tagged by users of the social network. This disclosure contemplates any method of generating or obtaining the photographic object database.","In particular embodiments, photographs uploaded to the social networking system are subject to an image object recognition algorithm. The image object recognition algorithm compares the uploaded image to images stored in the photographic object database and searches for similar objects. Methods for object searching are well-known in the art, and may include frequency-domain image processing, filtering, wavelet analysis, feature extraction, learning-algorithms such as neural networks, texture recognition, and the like. This disclosure contemplates any type of computer vision algorithms for finding matching objects.","In one example, a sponsor may wish to boost any newsfeed story involving a photo upload where a user is interacting with the sponsor's brand. For example, if a user is photographed at a Starbucks, or holding a Starbucks cup, the sponsor may wish to boost the photograph itself, along with some promotional material, to the sponsored stories space of the user's friends or first degree connections. Such a sponsored story is far more interesting to the user's friends compared to a static advertisement, because it contains a real-life photograph of the user interacting with the brand. Additionally, the user does not have to perform any on-network actions such as checking-in to the Starbucks, \u201cliking\u201d Starbucks, or even making a comment about Starbucks. Thus, the user's off-network behavior or endorsement of Starbucks is captured and leveraged for a more beneficial experience for users and sponsors alike. Other embodiments are readily envisioned by the disclosure and are described in detail below.","Various portions of such a social networking platform may be implemented via a hardware architecture or software framework that enables various software components or processes to implement particular embodiments, as is described in more detail, by way of example and not by way of limitation, below. The platform may include one or more hardware or software components, one or more of which may be located or embodied in one or more consolidated or distributed computing systems. Additionally, as used herein, \u201cor\u201d may imply \u201cand\u201d as well as \u201cor;\u201d that is, \u201cor\u201d does not necessarily preclude \u201cand,\u201d unless explicitly stated or implicitly implied.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","180","300","190","300","200","180","180","180","180","170","180","170","300","180","180","200"]},"Social networking system  comprises a computing system that allows members to communicate or otherwise interact with each other and access content as described herein. Social networking system  stores member profiles that describe the members of a social network, including biographic, demographic, and other types of descriptive information, such as work experience, educational history, hobbies or preferences, location, and the like. Website  further stores data describing one or more relationships between different members. The relationship information may indicate members who have similar or common work experience, group memberships, hobbies, or educational history.","A user of the client device  interacts with the social networking system  via an application, such as a web browser or a native application, to perform operations such as browsing content, posting and sending messages, retrieving and sorting messages received from other users, uploading multimedia objects, and the like. Client device  may also use an application or browser to pull and view profile information for various user nodes and hubs in social networking system .","Social networking system  comprises an object store , and a graph information store . The object store  stores information on objects, such as users, represented in or by the social networking environment . The graph information store  stores information on the relationships of the objects in the object store .","Object store  includes various storage areas. User store  includes profile pages for specific user accounts or members of social networking system . Hubs store  includes profile or hub pages for concept nodes such as businesses, locations, and celebrities. Apps store  includes third-party applications that users may install and run on their profile page. Media store  includes uploaded user media such as photos, videos, audio files, and other types of multimedia objects.","Image object database  stores information regarding physical real-world objects or logos, that may be associated with concept nodes, such as brand, product, or company. In one implementation, each object can be maintained as a hub node in a social graph or other data structure maintained by the social networking system. Social networking system  may allow users to access information regarding each object using a client application (e.g., a browser) hosted by a wired or wireless station, such as a laptop, desktop or mobile device. For example, social networking system may serve web pages (or other structured documents) to users that request information about an object. In addition to user profile and place information, the social networking system may track or maintain other information about the user. For example, the social networking system may support geo-social networking system functionality including one or more location-based services that record the user's location. For example, users may access the geo-social networking system using a special-purpose client application hosted by a mobile device of the user (or a web- or network-based application using a browser client). The client application may automatically access Global Positioning System (GPS) or other geo-location functions supported by the mobile device and report the user's current location to the geo-social networking system. In addition, the client application may support geo-social networking functionality that allows users to check-in at various locations and communicate this location to other users.","Location application program interface (API)  and image object recognition API  interacts with client device  to receive photos and other multimedia objects. In particular embodiments, client device  may upload photos substantially in real-time and without user action. In particular embodiments, client device  only uploads the photo in response to specific user actions. In particular embodiments, client device  uploads the photo or multimedia device through wireless network . In particular embodiments, client device  has a wired or wireless connection, such as a cellular connection or WiFi connection, and uploads the photo or multimedia object directly through network . This disclosure contemplates any manner of connectivity from client device  to social networking system .","Image object recognition API  accesses photographic object database . Photographic object database  contains a collection of images of logos, products, brands, and the like. In particular embodiments, photographic object database  includes, for each photo, an association with a particular concept node stored in concept store . In particular embodiments, searchable text extracted through OCR is stored in association with photo images containing signage or other sources of text. For example, photographic object database  may store the text \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d in a searchable format in association with a photo of a Coca-Cola product. In particular embodiments, photographic object database  stores a link to the node associated with the object, and pulls text or other related data directly from the node as necessary.","Photographic object database  may be updated to keep the photographs current. In particular embodiments, photos and videos received from other users may be utilized to update photographic object database . In particular embodiments, location image object recognition API  may pull images from third-party sites  such as Yelp! or Google Images to update photographic object database .","Additionally, social networking system  includes a web server , an action logger , an action log , a newsfeed generator , an ad server , and a database of ad requests . In other embodiments, social networking system  may include additional, fewer, or different modules for various applications.","Web server  links social networking system  via network  to one or more client devices , as well as to one or more third party websites . Web server  may include a mail server or other messaging functionality for receiving and routing messages between social networking system  and client devices  or third party websites . The messages can be instant messages, queued messages (e.g., email), text and SMS messages, or any other suitable messaging technique.","Action logger  is capable of receiving communications from the web server  about member actions on or off social networking system . Newsfeed generator  generates communications for each member about information that may be relevant to the member. These communications may take the form of stories, each story is an information message comprising one or a few lines of information about an action in the action log that is relevant to the particular member. The stories are presented to a member via one or more pages of the social networking system , for example in each member's home page or newsfeed page.","Ad server  performs an ad selection algorithm. Ad server  is communicatively coupled to the database of ad requests  and to action log  for this purpose.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["201","202","201","204","205","201","201"]},"Activity stream  comprises the aggregate stream of status updates and news stories for all users of a social network. In particular embodiments, activity stream  may include all types of user activity, such as check-ins , comments , \u201clikes\u201d , etc. In particular embodiments, activity stream  includes photo and video uploads . In particular embodiments, photos and videos uploaded to social networking system  are first passed to image object recognition API . Image object recognition API  detects objects within uploaded images such as products, logos, text, etc. in accordance with the process described in . Upon detecting such objects, image objection recognition API  tags the uploaded images. In particular embodiments, the tags may be represented as edges connecting particular concept nodes in the social graph. In particular embodiments, the object tags are metadata appended to the photo file. This disclosure contemplates any manner of associating a particular image object in a photo or video to a particular concept node.","Activity stream  under normal operation passes to news feed engine  (communicatively linked to news feed generator  in ), which parses the individual stories in activity stream  and determines which users' (generally the friends of the user who generated the story) pages to display each story on. In particular embodiments, both activity stream  and newsfeed engine  are applications residing in server . In particular embodiments, activity stream  or newsfeed engine  are applications distributed across one or more computing servers. This disclosure contemplates any suitable implementation of activity stream  and newsfeed engine .","A sponsor uses Sponsor GUI  to specify the type of stories it wants promoted to the sponsored story section of users' pages. Examples of Sponsor GUI  are depicted in . The Sponsor GUI  provides a method for the sponsor to create story filters to locate specific types of news feed stories for promoting to the sponsored story space of a user's home page. Once the sponsor sets up its preferences for the types of stories it wishes to promote to the sponsored story portion, the sponsor specifications are stored into stream sponsored story specification database . In particular embodiments, sponsor GUI  allows sponsors to continually scan activity stream  for photo uploads that have tags associated with the concept node or entity specified by the sponsor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["204","301","201","202","205","201"]},"In step , the sponsored story system compares each story in activity stream  to all stream sponsored story specifications in stream sponsored story specification database. In particular embodiments, sponsored story system compares the metadata or tagged objects in each user uploaded photo in activity stream  to all the stream sponsored story specifications. If there is a match, the procedure continues to step , if not, it loops back to .","In step , upon finding a match, sponsored story application  pulls the matching entry out of activity stream , and formats the entry into a predetermined visual specification. In particular embodiments, the visual specification is dictated by the social networking system to mimic a regular news feed story. In other embodiments, special identifiers may be added by the social networking system to indicate that the story is a sponsored story. In other embodiments, the visual specifications are entered by the sponsor through the Sponsor GUI  at the time of stream story specification. In such an embodiment, the visual specification is stored along with the story specification in the stream sponsored story specification database . In particular embodiments, the sponsor is given limited discretion as to the visual specifications for the promoted stream story, subject to predetermined constraints imposed by the social networking system.","Where the sponsored story specification requires the upload of a photo or video tagged with a particular object, upon finding such a matching photo or video, sponsored story application  formats the matching photo or video into a sponsored story including the photo or video. In particular embodiments, the photo or video is cropped or reduced in resolution. In particular embodiments, it is cropped to include the tagged object and, if possible, a person's face in the photo or video. In particular embodiments, the sponsored story is clickable, and clicking the story launches a full-size photo or video viewer. In particular embodiments, tag lines or promotional text specified by the sponsor in sponsor GUI .","In step , after the story is formatted pursuant to the visual specification or by the social networking system to visually comport with a news feed story, the sponsored story is passed to sponsored story system .","In step , after an entry from activity stream  is formatted into a sponsored story, it is priced and directed toward users in a similar manner as a social ad. In particular embodiments, the sponsor may also add a weight to the story to alter its direction toward users. For example, certain stories may decay quickly, such as check-ins, and are not displayed to other users beyond a predetermined threshold time period from the story generation. In other embodiments, sponsor-specified temporal factors, such as deadlines, may increase the weight of the sponsored story so that it is promoted over other sponsored stories lacking time sensitivity.","Specifically with regard to photo and video stories having tagged objects, the sponsor may access social targeting functions through analysis of the social graph. For example, the ad system may display the sponsored story to friends of the uploading user. In particular embodiments, the sponsored story may be more heavily weighted toward display to the friends of the user who express an affinity for the tagged object or competitors of the tagged object. In particular embodiments, the sponsored story is displayed more frequently to friends of the uploading user in a particular age range, demographic group, or geographic location. In particular embodiments, the sponsored story may be targeted toward users who have a higher relative affinity with the uploading user, or with other users tagged in the photo. In particular embodiments, the relative affinity is a coefficient score between any two users. The coefficient score may take into account the degree of interaction between the two users, their similarity, their geographic proximity, their age, their common friends, and their common affinities. This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner or combination of methods of targeting specific users for the display of sponsored stories.","In particular embodiments, ad targeting is based upon an affinity score calculated by social networking system . A member may have affinities for other members, types of actions, types of objects, and content. Accordingly, a calculated affinity score may be based on a weighted function that takes into account the set of affinities for the particular member for each type of data field that is in a candidate story. The website may obtain a member's affinities based on the member's express interests (whether provided directly or indirectly, for example, through communications with other members) or impliedly based on the member's actions (e.g., a member's checking of another member's page indicates an interest in that other member, or clicking on particular types of links may indicate an interest in similar links). An affinity, as measured for example by an affinity score, need not be an actual subjective interest or lack of interest that a member has for something (i.e., the member likes punk rock music, and dislikes vegetarian restaurants), but rather it may merely be a correlation between something in the candidate story and some information stored in connection with that member, whether is an action taken by the member, a communication involving the member, a characteristic, feature or expressed interest in the member's profile.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","405","406","401","404","60","100","401","60","402","130","400","60"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["501","100","60","180","180","180","502","60"]},"If image object recognition API  determines that the uploaded multimedia object is a video, the method proceeds to Step . In Step , image object recognition API  extracts one or more individual frames from the video file. Image object recognition API  may extract frames from a video file in any manner. For example, in particular embodiments, image object recognition API  may select the first frame. In particular embodiments, location API may select the frame or frames which have the greatest similarity to other frames. In particular embodiments, image object recognition API  may select frames at predetermined intervals. In particular embodiments, image object recognition API  may generate composites of multiple frames. This disclosure contemplates any manner of selecting and extracting frames from a video file.","After extracting one or more frames for comparison from the video file, or if the multimedia object is a single photographic image, the method proceeds to Step . At Step , image object recognition API  compares the uploaded photo or extracted frames to photographs in photographic object database . In particular embodiments, this process is carried out through specialized a object recognition application. In particular embodiments, this step is carried out by image object recognition API . In particular embodiments, one or more software modules for comparing textures, edges, smooth objects, and the like carry out Step . In particular embodiments, image object recognition API  performs frequency-domain image processing or texture recognition to match a particular object in the uploaded photo to an object in one of the photographs in photographic object database . In particular embodiments, image object recognition API  uses graph similarity functions to perform the image matching. In particular embodiments, image object recognition API  creates object representations based on two-dimensional shape primitives for each object in the uploaded photo, and compares the primitives to primitives stored in association with each photo in photographic object database . In particular embodiments, image object recognition API  creates a transformed image from the uploaded photo using wavelet transforms, and compares the image to wavelet transforms of images stored in photographic object database . In particular embodiments, image object recognition API  utilizes a neural network to classify objects in the uploaded image. Methods of image matching and image object recognition are well-known in the art, and this disclosure contemplates any suitable method for matching objects in the uploaded image with objects contained in the images stored in photographic object database .","Comparison Step  may include extracting text from the uploaded image or extracted frames. Image object recognition API  may include an optical character recognition application or other software modules that, alone or in conjunction, may locate blocks of text, perform OCR on the blocks of text, and extract searchable text from the OCR process. For example, the text on bottle  (\u201cGrey Goose Vodka\u201d) may be searched and matched with a database of concept nodes or photographs with extracted text in photographic object database . Because of the relative speed at which text may be searched versus images, in particular embodiments, image object recognition API  first narrows the set of images in photographic location database  to be compared with the uploaded image to only those stored with extracted text matching a portion of the text extracted from the uploaded image.","If image object recognition API  completes the search of all images in photographic location database  without a match, the process terminates at Step . In particular embodiments, image object recognition API  may progressively increase the search set until a match is found or every single image in photographic location database  is searched. If an object in the uploaded image or extracted frames matches an object contained in an image stored in photographic object database , at Step , image object recognition API  obtains the concept node identifier stored in association with the matching image.","Upon obtaining the concept node identifiers associated with one or more photographs in photographic object database  containing objects matching objects in the uploaded photo, image object recognition API  tags the detected object in Step . Thus, in the example of , coca-cola bottle  would be tagged with the concept node for \u201cCoca-Cola,\u201d vodka bottle  would be tagged with the concept node \u201cGrey Goose\u201d, bottle  would be tagged with \u201cJack Daniel's\u201d, and so on. In particular embodiments, a single object may be tagged with multiple concept nodes. For example, bottle  may be tagged with \u201cJack Daniel's\u201d as well as \u201cOld No. 7\u201d, or \u201cGentleman Jack.\u201d Once the images have been associated with various concept nodes, the photo is exported in Step  to the activity stream in the form of a photo-upload story or entry.","As a result of the method of  performed on every photo or video uploaded to the social networking system, the social networking system has access to and stores a vast amount of product data for its set of geographically diverse users. For example, because the social networking system is aware of where the photo or video was taken, or at a very minimum, the physical location associated with the user who uploaded the photo or video, the social networking system may build a database of geographic locations where any given product was captured. This geographic database may be queried by product owners to determine the penetration of their products to specific geographic areas in order to test the effectiveness of their advertisements. For example, Grey Goose vodka may wish to assess the effectiveness of an advertisement campaign or ad agency that they have employed in the San Francisco bay area. By querying a \u201cproduct heat map\u201d that displays where their product has been detected over time, Grey Goose may determine whether the advertising campaign has been effective by comparing the number of detected instances of their product in the photos associated with the SF bay area at intervals before and after the ad campaign.","In particular embodiments, the social networking system may charge product owners for these analytics, as a package, or on a per-query basis. In particular embodiments, the social networking system may track other demographic information about the users uploading photos and videos in which products are detected. For example, Grey Goose may wish to determine the popularity of its vodka among females aged 27-35 living in urban areas. The social networking system may provide a \u201cheat map\u201d with adjustable filters so product owners may finely tune their query demographics. This disclosure contemplates any suitable method of building a geographic product database and any suitable commercial application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["602","100","601","602","602","602"]},"The bid amount specified in the sponsored story request may indicate an amount of money that sponsor  will pay for each time a member presented with the sponsored story clicks on it. In one embodiment, the sponsor may be a non-profit or charity where the bid amount is given at little or no cost. Alternatively, the bid amount may specify an amount that sponsor  will pay the website operator  each time the sponsored story is displayed to a member or a certain number of members or each time the sponsored story is clicked on by a member or a certain number of members. In another embodiment, the sponsor may pay a set amount per month or period of time and the social networking system will determine the bid amount or how and when to display the sponsored stories. In addition, the sponsored story request may allow sponsor  to specify targeting criteria. This targeting criteria may be a filter to apply to fields of a member's member profile or other object, or it may include free form text such as wall posts, comments, and messages. In one embodiment, in order to optimize the targeting and selection of sponsored stories for users of a social network, social information gathered on and off the social network about a user is leveraged to infer interests about users of the social network. A social network may maintain a social graph that identifies the mapping of connections among the users, including entities such as businesses, applications, groups, etc, of a social network, and the social network may also maintain profiles that contain full or partial information about each of the users in the social network. Targeting may be based one or more factors such as member demographics (age, gender, location, education level, employers, employment type, work history and experience, hobbies, and or preferences). These factors may draw from explicit member statements such as listing it on their profile, connections to other members or entities, or through user-entered text on and off the social networking site. In another embodiment, these factors may be implicitly or inferred by the social network.","One or more sponsored stories available to the social network may contain targeting criteria for determining whether the sponsored story should be targeted to a particular user. While the social network may have sufficient information about some of its users to apply the targeting criteria, the social network may not have sufficient information about other users to apply the targeting criteria. Rather than missing out on the opportunity to target sponsored stories to this latter group of users, embodiments use the information for other users to whom a particular user is connected when the social network does not have sufficient information to apply the targeting criteria to the user.
