The present invention also relates to a method for the preparation of the composition. The present invention further relates to a process for the treatment of gastric ulcer using the composition.","Various theories have been proposed with respect to a cause of ulcer in human. In particular, it has been elucidated that stress, taking of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for curing rheumatic diseases, and the like are closely related to ulcer formation, mainly due to relatively excess gastric or duodenal acid secretion. Accordingly it is important to suppress the acid secretion in order to prevent ulcer formation and to cure it.","On the other hand it has been considered that which is a rod normally existing in stomach, generates ammonia due to its strong urease activity, thereby inducing ulcer. Since, it persistently lives within mucus and mucosa, it becomes the greatest cause for recurrence of ulcer. Accordingly, it has been considered that the recurrence of ulcer can be prevented, if this bacterium is sterilized.","References may be made to K. M.
