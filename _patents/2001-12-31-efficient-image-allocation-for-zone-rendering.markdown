title: Efficient image allocation for zone rendering
abstract: Embodiments of the present invention efficiently support rendering of high resolution images under zone rendering. In particular, a bin array rectangle and binner clipping rectangle for determining primitive-zone intersections. Both of these rectangles are defined by graphics device state variables containing the screen-space location of the rectangle corners. In particular, the binner clipping rectangle is used to define the visible region in screen coordinates. Objects completely outside the binner clipping rectangle in one or more directions will be discarded. Objects that cannot be trivially rejected are subjected to bin determination. The bin array rectangle handles color buffer resolutions larger than could otherwise be accommodated by the optimally-renderer image limits.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field","The present invention relates generally to graphics systems and more particularly to graphics-rendering systems.","2. Background Information","Computer graphics systems are commonly used for displaying graphical representations of objects on a two-dimensional video display screen. Current computer graphics systems provide highly detailed representations and are used in a variety of applications. In typical computer graphics systems, an object to be represented on the display screen is broken down into graphics primitives. Primitives are basic components of a graphics display and may include points, lines, vectors and polygons, such as triangles and quadrilaterals. Typically, a hardware\/software scheme is implemented to render or draw the graphics primitives that represent a view of one or more objects being represented on the display screen.","The primitives of the three-dimensional objects to be rendered are defined by a host computer in terms of primitive data. For example, when the primitive is a triangle, the host computer may define the primitive in terms of X, Y and Z coordinates of its vertices, as well as the red, green and blue (R, G and B) color values of each vertex. Additional primitive data may be used in specific applications.","Image rendering is the conversion of a high-level object-based description into a graphical image for display on some display device. For example, an act of image rendering occurs during the conversion of a mathematical model of a three-dimensional object or scene into a bitmap image. Another example of image rendering is converting an HTML document into an image for display on a computer monitor. Typically, a hardware device referred to as a graphics-rendering engine performs these graphics processing tasks. Graphics-rendering engines typically render scenes into a buffer that is subsequently output to the graphical output device, but it is possible for some rendering-engines to write their two-dimensional output directly to the output device. The graphics-rendering engine interpolates the primitive data to compute the display screen pixels that represent the each primitive, and the R, G and B color values of each pixel.","A graphics-rendering system (or subsystem), as used herein, refers to all of the levels of processing between an application program and a graphical output device. A graphics engine can provide for one or more modes of rendering, including zone rendering. Zone rendering attempts to increase overall 3D rendering performance by gaining optimal render cache utilization, thereby reducing pixel color and depth memory read\/write bottlenecks. In zone rendering, a screen is subdivided into an array of zones and per-zone instruction bins, used to hold all of the primitive and state setting instructions required to render each sub-image, are generated. Whenever a primitive intersects (or possibly intersects) a zone, that primitive instruction is placed in the bin for that zone. Some primitives will intersect more than one zone, in which case the primitive instruction is replicated in the corresponding bins. This process is continued until the entire scene is sorted into the bins. Following the first pass of building a bin for each zone intersected by a primitive, a second zone-by-zone rendering pass is performed. In particular, the bins for all the zones are rendered to generate the final image.","What is needed therefore is an efficient image\/bin allocation method and apparatus for zone rendering.","Embodiments of the present invention efficiently support rendering of high resolution images under zone rendering. In particular, a bin array rectangle and binner clipping rectangle for determining primitive-zone intersections. Both of these rectangles are defined by graphics device state variables containing the screen-space location of the rectangle corners. In particular, the binner clipping rectangle is used to define the visible region in screen coordinates. Objects completely outside the binner clipping rectangle in one or more directions will be discarded. Objects that cannot be trivially rejected are subjected to bin determination. The bin array rectangle handles color buffer resolutions larger than could otherwise be accommodated by the optimally-renderer image limits.","In the detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention maybe practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components and circuits have been described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention.","Some portions of the detailed description that follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits or binary signals within a computer. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, considered to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps include physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers or the like. It should be understood, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussions, it is appreciated that throughout the specification, discussions utilizing such terms as \u201cprocessing\u201d or \u201ccomputing\u201d or \u201ccalculating\u201d or \u201cdetermining\u201d or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer or computing system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulate and transform data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computing system's registers and\/or memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computing system's memories, registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.","Embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in hardware or software, or a combination of both. However, embodiments of the invention may be implemented as computer programs executing on programmable systems comprising at least one processor, a data storage system (including volatile and non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements), at least one input device, and at least one output device. Program code may be applied to input data to perform the functions described herein and generate output information. The output information may be applied to one or more output devices, in known fashion. For purposes of this application, a processing system includes any system that has a processor, such as, for example, a digital signal processor (DSP), a micro-controller, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or a microprocessor.","The programs may be implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a processing system. The programs may also be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. In fact, the invention is not limited in scope to any particular programming language. In any case, the language may be a compiled or interpreted language.","The programs may be stored on a storage media or device (e.g., hard disk drive, floppy disk drive, read only memory (ROM), CD-ROM device, flash memory device, digital versatile disk (DVD), or other storage device) readable by a general or special purpose programmable processing system, for configuring and operating the processing system when the storage media or device is read by the processing system to perform the procedures described herein. Embodiments of the invention may also be considered to be implemented as a machine-readable storage medium, configured for use with a processing system, where the storage medium so configured causes the processing system to operate in a specific and predefined manner to perform the functions described herein.","An example of one such type of processing system is shown in FIG. . Sample system  may be used, for example, to execute the processing for methods in accordance with the present invention, such as the embodiment described herein. Sample system  is representative of processing systems based on the microprocessors available from Intel Corporation, although other systems (including personal computers (PCs) having other microprocessors, engineering workstations, set-top boxes and the like) may also be used.

Per-zone instruction bins  are thus used to hold primitive instructions and state-setting instructions required to render each sub-image and are generated by comparing the screen-space extent of each primitive  to the array of zones . Thus, as the primitives  are received, the present invention determines which zone(s)  each primitive  intersects, and replicates the primitive instructions into a bin  associated with each of these zones .","The process of assigning primitives (and their attributes)  to zones  is referred to as binning. \u201cBin\u201d refers to the abstract buffer used for each zone\u2014where a bin  will typically be realized as a series of instruction batch buffers . Binning performs the necessary computations to determine what primitives  lie in what zones  and can be performed by dedicated hardware and\/or software implementations.","In one typical implementation, a driver  writes out a set of primitive instructions to be parsed by the graphics-binning engine . In particular, the information necessary for primitive binning is stored in vertex buffers , which includes first buffer  and second buffer . As discussed in detail below, first buffer  stores vertex X and Y data, while second buffer  contains the remainder of the vertex data. For each zone  intersected by a primitive , the graphics-binning engine writes corresponding primitive instructions into buffers  associated with the zones  intersected. Given the split vertex buffers  and , graphics binning-engine  is now permitted to read and cache only vertex screen X and Y data from first buffer . Some primitives  will intersect more than one zone , in which case the primitive instruction is replicated in bins  corresponding to the intersected zones . For example, the lightning bolt depicted in  intersects nine zones . This process is continued until the entire scene is sorted into bins .","Referring to , in a typical implementation, a graphics primitive and state-setting instruction stream, referred to as a scene input list , is initially applied to graphics-binning engine ring buffer  associated with graphics-binning engine . The scene input list  may be a single, temporally-ordered scene description as received by the application programming interface (API). Graphics-binning engine  is typically implemented as a hardware binning engine (HWB) . One skilled in the art will recognize that a software or software plus hardware binner could be used as well. The graphics-binning engine  parses scene input list  and determines which zone(s)  each primitive  intersects.","As previously noted, the zones  are associated with bins . Graphics-binning engine  compares the screen-space extent of each primitive  to the array of zones , and replicates the associated primitive commands into corresponding bins . Bins  are comprised of chained series of command buffers  typically stored within non-contiguous physical memory pages. A bin list is a list of buffers  which comprise each bin . Pages are initially allocated to the bin memory pool (BMP) . The bin pointer list  is initialized with the page numbers of the pages and stores write pointers into each bin list .","The graphics-binning engine  also maintains the current graphics state by parsing associated state-setting instructions contained with the scene input list . Prior to placing a primitive command in any given bin , the graphics-binning engine  typically precedes the primitive command in the bin  with any required state-setting instructions.","After the scene input list  has been completely parsed, the associated bins (i.e. bin , bin  . . . bin n-) are ready to be used by the graphics-rendering engine  to render the scene. As discussed in detail below, instructions are included at the end of the scene input list  to cause the graphics-binning engine  to increment the register in pending scene counter  by one and initiate rendering of the binned scene. For example, graphics-binning engine  sends a render instruction to graphics-rendering engine ring buffer  associated with graphics-rendering engine  via path .","Once all the primitives  are sorted and the command structures completed, a second pass is made to render the scene one zone  at a time. Following the first pass of building a bin for each zone  intersected by a primitive , a second zone-by-zone rendering pass is performed. In particular, the bins  for all the zones  are rendered to generate the final image, with each scene rendered one zone  at a time. The order with which the zones  are rendered is typically not significant. All bins  associated with primitives  that touch pixels within a particular zone  are rendered before the next zone  is rendered. A single primitive  may intersect many zones , thus requiring multiple replications. As a result, primitives  that intersect multiple zones  are rendered multiple times (i.e. once for each zone  intersected).","Rendering performance improves as a result of the primitives  being sorted by their intersection with zones  that are aligned to the render cache . Since the graphics device  is only working on a small portion of the screen at a time (i.e. a zone ), it is able to hold the frame buffer contents for the entire zone  in a render cache . The dimensions of the zone  are typically a constant tuned to the size and organization of the render cache . It is by this mechanism that the render cache  provides optimal benefits\u2014reuse of cached data is maximized by exploiting the spatial coherence of a zone . Through use of the zone rendering mode, only the minimum number of color memory writes need be performed to generate the final image one zone  at a time, and color memory reads and depth memory reads and writes can be minimized or avoided altogether. Use of the render cache  thus significantly reduces the memory traffic and improves performance relative to a conventional renderer that draws each primitive completely before continuing to the next primitive.","Image\/Bin Allocation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["170","178","172","174","176","110","110","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Max (color bpp, depth bpp)","Zone Size (pixels)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"16 bits","\u200264 wide \u00d7  64 high (4K pixels)"]},{"entry":[{},{},"128 wide \u00d7  32 high (4K pixels)"]},{"entry":[{},"32 bits","\u200264 wide \u00d7  32 high (2K pixels)"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u200232 wide \u00d7  64 high (2K pixels)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["180","182","184","186"]},"Graphics-binning engine  () uses two rectangles in the process of determining primitive-zone intersections: bin array rectangle  and binner clipping rectangle .
