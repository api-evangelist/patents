{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority on Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/506,519, entitled \u201cE-Commerce System Related To Wear Apparel\u201d filed on Sep. 27, 2003, by Tara Chand Singhal. The contents of the Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/506,519 are incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention is directed to methods and apparatus that enable an apparel designer to provide apparel data to an apparel web merchant and enable a customer to try on apparel for size fit from the apparel web merchants before making a purchase decision.","Apparel designers design new wear apparel in various sizes based on the sizes of the potential customers. The designers sell the apparel designs to apparel retailers and, based on the orders from retailers, have the apparel manufactured by an apparel manufacturer. Sometimes, the designer and the apparel manufacturer are the same entity.","When the apparel retailers make the apparel available to their customers, the customers try the apparel for fit to determine among other things, how well the apparel fits on them and decide which one of the available sizes offered is the best fit among the various sizes, before making a purchase decision. Each brand and design of apparel is designed and cut differently and there is no uniformity in sizes from different designers and different brands from the same designer as to how a particular size will fit on a customer. Hence for this reason, customers usually choose to try on the apparel for size fit before making a purchase decision. The customers try the apparel in the fitting rooms of the retailer.","Customers are also increasingly using the Internet to view apparel and their available sizes and colors and are also making purchase decisions. However, the Internet does not permit the customer to actually try on a apparel for fit before making a purchase decision as would the customer in the fitting room of an apparel retailer before deciding which one of the available sizes is the best or optimum fit or is not a good fit. This affects the growth of e-commerce related to wear apparel as the Internet based e-commerce offers many benefits that the web shoppers and the web merchants find desirable such as convenience for the shoppers and economical for the merchant.","In the past, there may have been attempts by others to provide solutions and or technology that would enable the customer to select the size of the apparel that would be the best fit. However such attempts may not have been successful due to a variety of reasons, such as, cost of developing and using such a system by apparel merchants and the necessity of collecting personal data of the shoppers to be able to try on the apparel for fit.","Therefore, it is an objective of the present invention to provide an apparel fit system on the global computer network that (i) minimizes the cost and effort of merchants to use and deploy apparel fit system for use by their customers and (ii) enables customers to try on an apparel for size fit without divulging private and personal data to the merchant.","This invention discloses a fit system that provides (i) a means for the merchant to display web pages related to apparel that enable a shopper to try on the displayed apparel for size fit and (ii) a means for the customer to try on an apparel for size fit without providing any personal data to the apparel merchant and without providing personal data to any data server anywhere.","The fit system of this invention on a global computer network enables:\n\n","Introduction","An apparel designer designs the apparel and hence is the best entity to have the knowledge about the size and the fit of the apparel. The knowledge about the apparel includes the various colors, designs and patterns in which the apparel will be available, the various sizes the apparel would be available, and for each size the actual dimensions of the apparel and for each dimension the optimum fit for that dimension.","To illustrate the concept of optimum fit, a term fit-range is coined in this invention. The term fit-range enables identification of the apparel for the type of fit intended by the designer. For example, some apparel are designed to be worn skintight while others are designed to be worn as loose fit. The fit-range may be different for each dimension of the apparel and may be different for different apparel. For example, for young women generally, apparel are designed to be worn skintight and apparel for others such as elderly women and men are designed to be worn as loose fit or comfortable fit. The fit-range and its use in this invention is described in more detail later.","An apparel merchant makes the apparel available to a retail customer and does not have detailed knowledge of the apparel fit, leaving the apparel fit to be decided by the customer after trying on the available sizes. Many times, a size chart as an aid to the customer is made available which identifies the various sizes of the apparel and one or two dimensions of the customer for which the particular size is the best fit. However this is provided as a guide for the customer to initially select a size and does not provide information on how a particular size would fit on the customer.","With reference to , the fit system  on the global network  can be accessed by a merchant , a customer , and an apparel designer  via their respective computer systems interfaced to the global computer network  via their respective network interfaces.  shows a human body  of customer  and wear apparel , which is being fitted on the human body on the global network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1C"},"In Step , the apparel designer  fills out an apparel data form  (described later with reference to ) to make the apparel data  available to the fit system .","In Step , the merchant  connects to the fit system  selects the apparel, and is displayed the apparel data form  with the apparel data, which the merchant either already sells on his\/her web page or desires to sell on his\/her web page.","In Step , the merchant  enters in the partially filled apparel data form, additional data such as, merchant name, inventory id, retail price, and the identification of the web page. The web page is the web page in the merchant server in which the apparel is already displayed or is intended to be displayed to the customer.","In Step , an embed function, when clicked in the apparel data form by the merchant, transfers the apparel data from the form and embeds it in the web page under a link try-it-on next to the display of the apparel.","In Step , the customer of merchant is shopping the merchant and is looking at one or more of the web pages displaying the apparel. Each apparel has a try-it-on link next to it.","In Step , the customer clicks the try-it-on link, which enables a fit page to be displayed to the customer. The Fit web page enables the customer to try on the available apparel sizes. The customer after knowing the right size can return to the merchant web page from the fit page and proceed further to either try on another apparel or buy the apparel using the merchant's e-commerce payment options.","These and other aspects of the invention are described here in detail. The headings are provided for reader convenience.","Fit System ","Referring to , the fit system  includes (i) a fit storage device , (ii) a fit operating system  stored in the fit storage device , (iii) a fit server program  stored in the fit storage device , and (iv) a fit system processor  connected to the fit storage device .","The fit system processor  can include one or more conventional central processing units. The fit system processor  is preferably capable of high volume processing.","The fit storage device  can include one or more magnetic disk drives, magnetic tape drives, optical storage units, CD-ROM drives, flash memory, cache memory and\/or other types of memory devices. The fit storage device  may also contains a plurality of databases. For example, as illustrated in , the fit storage device  can include designer data, apparel data, and merchant data.","The fit operating system  includes web server and other related programs to keep and present web pages to the designer and the merchant for them to be able to log in and view, review and modify apparel data.","In the embodiment illustrated in , the fit system operating system  and the fit system processor  utilize a fit network interface B to interface with (i) each customer  via a client A and customer network interface B, (ii) each merchant  via a merchant system A and merchant network interface B, and (iii) each apparel designer  via a designer system A and designer network interface B. Conventional internal or external modems may serve as the fit network interface B. In a preferred embodiment, the fit network interface B is connected to the merchant network interface B, the designer network interface B, and the customer network interface B with the Internet.","With reference to , the fit server program  includes a:\n\n","With reference to , the operational steps of Fit server program are:","In step , on access from the apparel designer, serve apparel data form, receive and save apparel data in the fit system .","In step , on access from apparel merchant, serve selected apparel data and merchant interface function to enable entry of merchant data and embed apparel data in apparel_data ( ) function on merchant server web page.","In step , on execution of apparel_data ( ) function, receive and save date, time, merchant id, apparel brand, and apparel type in a statistical data file for each click of the try-it-on button.","In step , transfer the fit program to the client.","Designer Interface Function ","The apparel designer  or alternatively an apparel manufacturer makes the apparel data available to the fit system  on the global computer network. In the preferred embodiment this is facilitated by an apparel data form that is made available to the designer on the global network enabling the designer to access the form on the fit system from anywhere and make the apparel data available to the fit system . To enable the apparel designer to provide apparel data, the apparel designer connects to the fit system and is presented a form as illustrated in  and .","The form is viewable in two different formats, a summary format () and a detailed format (). The fit system web page  is displayed when the designer connects to the fit system . The web page  enables the designer log in  using a user id and password.","The summary form  displays designer , brand name , apparel type , apparel gender , and the file Id . A create function  enables a new entry to be created and a detailed form  to be displayed. Alternatively, clicking the file id displays the form  () populated with existing apparel data. The summary format  enables the apparel data to be searched by designer, brand, gender and apparel id.","The detailed form  () collects apparel data from the designer. The apparel data may include items such as: file id , designer , brand , apparel type , apparel gender , number of colors , names of colors , number of sizes , names of sizes , one or more apparel images , apparel description , fabric  and apparel size and fit data . The apparel size and fit data  may include name of the size , its corresponding length or girth dimension , fit-range , for each of the dimension  of this size small .","Each dimension  of the apparel is coded or identified as either a girth or as length dimension. Each dimension is assumed default as girth, and each length dimension is distinguished and identified by an L. For example, the neck shoulder, chest, waist and arm are girth dimensions, where as Waist L and Arm L are length dimensions as illustrated .","For anyone, including the designer or the manufacturer, it is easy to measure the girth or length dimension of the apparel by laying it on a flat surface. In the , for example, for apparel type equal to shirt, the dimensions  of neck, shoulder, chest, waist and arm are circumference dimensions that have been measured and recorded as girth . They are converted to circumference dimensions when computing fit indicators as described later. The shirt dimensions for waist length and arm length are distinguished as being identified as Waist L and Arm L  and are recorded as length dimensions , which are used as is when computing fit indicators as described later. The number and types of dimensions for the apparel depend upon the apparel type. For example, if the apparel type is shirt, the number and types of dimensions are specific to those required to judge the fit of a shirt.","An Update\/Save button  enables the designer to update and or save the data in the fit system. Some of this apparel data is optional and some is required. The required apparel data is the (i) name of sizes , (ii) for each size, the fit dimensions . Other data is preferably used to facilitate the use of the fit system.","Apparel Data ","With reference to , the apparel data  captured in the form  may be kept in the fit system  as an HTML page and catalogued by designer name, brand name and apparel type, as illustrated in . Alternatively, the apparel data in the form  () may be kept as a database, and may be displayed as an HTML form to the designer and the merchant. The information technologies that enable the data to be kept in databases and displayed as a web page are prior art.","Merchant Interface Function ","With reference to , an apparel merchant  has access to the fit system  via web page , where the merchant can log in  and is displayed the summary form web page . Using the summary form, merchant may search and find apparel by apparel type, designer, and brand and decide if the merchant already sells the apparel or may decide to sell the apparel on his\/her website. Merchant can open the apparel data form for the particular apparel by clicking the file id , and view the details of the apparel as identified in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 3C","b":["350","314","306","308","308","310","324","326","328","330","322","3332","336"]},"Additional fields in the form  are used for the merchant data. The fields: merchant name , inventory id , retail price  and web page , where the apparel is displayed or is intended to be displayed enable the merchant to specify the merchant specific data.","There is an action button called EMBED  which is linked to the execution of an embed function. The embed function (i) takes the apparel data from the apparel data forms  and  and creates parameters of a function called apparel_data( ), (ii) embeds that function in the merchant web page  (Refer to ) where the apparel is displayed  and (iii) links the apparel_data function execution to a try-it-on button . The JavaScript code added to the merchant web page  is identified as .","Alternatively, the embed function creates the JavaScript code and displays in the web page  at the bottom of the page . The merchant then can copy\/paste this code in the merchant web page  as illustrated in .","The apparel_data ( ) function code  is part of the merchant web page . Alternatively, the function code  for the apparel_data ( ) may be made available to the web page as a library function, by embedding a HTML library command in the merchant web page. When the customer loads the merchant web page, the library function is loaded as well. The library function may be accessed from the merchant system A or the fit system . The library function preferably is loaded from the fit system . Alternatively it may be loaded from the merchant server A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","402","404","406"]},"As an illustration, the variables whose values are contained in this JavaScript function are:\n\n","As an illustration, for variable first size name with value of small, the next variable is dimensions for first size with a value of \u201805.5-0.5-1.5;16.5-2.5-5.5;12.5-1.5-3.5;12.5-2.5-3.5;22.0-1.5-4.5;20.0-2.5-3.5\u2019. The value is a string of numerals that capture, the measured size of each dimension for small size, the lower fit range, and an upper fit range. For example, the first dimension is neck=05.5 and the lower fit range is 0.5 and upper fit range is 1.5 and similarly for other dimensions of shoulder, chest, waist and belly and length. Each parameter is enclosed in a single quote. To minimize the number of parameters, the dimensions are concatenated as one numeric string with dash and semicolon as separators.","The merchant web page  as shown in  also has the code for function apparel_data ( ) . The function code  is executed only when the customer clicks the button Try-it-on .","In summary, the apparel designer  may provide the apparel data  to the fit system  via the use of the apparel_data form . The merchant  accesses the apparel data  from the Fit system , via form  and provides merchant data such as merchant name, inventory identification, retail price, and web page name. Therefore, the merchant can review apparel at the fit system and choose those apparel that he already sells or intends to sell and enable the apparel data to be embedded on the web page next to the apparel as parameters of a function apparel_data( ).","As described earlier with reference to , the embed function searches the specified web page by inventory id and price to determine if the apparel is already part of the web page, then it embeds the apparel_data function as identified in . If the embed function cannot find the apparel on the web page, then it creates the apparel display web page  using the data from the apparel data form. The apparel data in the form  including the merchant data in form  is embedded  for the apparel in the merchant web page . Additionally apparel data  including apparel image, apparel description, price and inventory identification may also be embedded for display on the web page .","As described in the next section on customer interface function, when the customer clicks the Try-it-on button  next to the apparel display on the merchant web page , the apparel data is saved in a cookie file called apparel_size in the customer's client, and customer is transferred to a Fit web page, where the apparel data from the apparel_size cookie is read into apparel size variables. These are then used in the Fit web page for comparison with the customer size variables.","Customer Interface Function and Fit Program ","With reference to , the customer, when viewing a merchant apparel web page , sees an apparel information  he\/she likes. The customer interface function and the Fit program enables the customer to click try-it-on link  and to be able to try on the apparel for size fit to determine which one of the available sizes is the best fit for the customer.","Customer interface function includes an apparel data function and a fit program. With reference to , the apparel_data function when executed because the customer has clicked the try-it-on link next to the apparel display on the web page, does the following tasks:\n\n","With reference to  the fit program  does the following tasks:\n\n","The eight features of the fit web page that are performed by the fit program  are described here with reference to .","Feature (1): One of the features of the fit web page displays a form for customer sizes with default sizes or sizes populated from customer_size cookie. Accept changes to customer size, if any, and save in customer_size cookie. This feature enables the customer to enter his\/her sizes into the customer size form and save those sizes in a customer_size cookie kept in the client. Customer may also store customer size data by naming the cookie for different family members. The entry of customer size data is illustrated with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0113"},"figref":"FIG. 5A","b":["501","20","501","534","501"]},"The data fields H-Z are spread on the screen for the different body segments. Each of the data fields H-Z includes a header , a change-arrow  and the dimension itself . Clicking the header  opens a window  that shows how the dimensions can be measured. Clicking the change-arrows  increases or decreases the dimension. The customer, after seeing the standard images and the dimensions for the body data, may review and alter these dimensions.","Stated another way, the generic information in data fields H-Z can be changed to the actual body data of the customer by adjusting the respective arrow  near the respective data field. More specifically, the generic body information of the customer can be customized to customer's specific body dimensions by clicking up and down on each arrow  until the data field matches the body data of the customer . For example, data field H illustrates that the generic information of the ankle diameter is .. If the ankle diameter of the customer is 4.9, the customer can click the down arrow  until the data field H reads 4.9.","Importantly, the customer can modify one or more of the data fields H-Z and click upon the SAVE AS button. The SAVE AS button  saves the customer size data in a cookie file in the client computer. Multiple cookie files one for each family member may be created and saved. The display has a feature, where the names of cookie files are displayed and a RESTORE AS function that enables the customer size data from a specified cookie to be loaded as customer size variables in the Fit program.","Feature (2): With reference to , the Fit web page B displays the second feature, which displays all available apparel sizes with ability to select apparel size . This feature helps the customer select one of the available sizes of the apparel by the use of drop down box to try on for size fit.","Feature (3): Also display Fit options with the ability to select a Fit option . This feature enables the customer specify a fit option by a drop down box among choices as tight fit, loose fit and comfy fit.","Feature (4): With reference to , the Fit web page B displays mini (reduced size) apparel image , apparel brand , and inventory ID . This feature helps the customer visually know which apparel is being tried on while seeing the Fit web page.","Feature (5): With reference to , the Fit web page B Display a Flash program animation image  that is a composite of frames that include a base image  of generic male or female figure with or without the generic or actual image of the apparel and visual fit indicator frames , along with numerical fit indicators that include the length fit indicators  and girth fit indicators .","There are two types of dimensions that are applicable to an apparel, one is, length dimension and the other is and girth or circumference dimension. In the apparel data form, the data for circumference is provided as a diameter as it is easy to measure by the laying the apparel on a flat surface. When measuring customer size it is easy to provide the girth or circumference dimension as circumference is what the customer measures. When the customer judges the fitness or looseness of the apparel he\/she judges it by the diameter. Hence the fit computations take the apparel data in the diameter measure, convert it to the circumference measure by multiplying it by 2.0 before comparing it with customer size data and then convert it back to diameter by dividing it by 2.0 and then rounded before for displaying the tightness or looseness for a girth dimension.","Computation of the fit variable that enables the computation of numerical, color, and shape of visual fit indicator parameters for entry into Flash Application program is described here. The apparel data that is made available to the fit web page from the apparel_size cookie is illustrated as follows with respect to one size and one dimension:\n\n","Apparel_size=small\n\n","The customer size for neck is obtained from the customer size data displayed on the customer size form A, which has been read from the customer size cookie file.\n\n","The fit computations for this one dimension are illustrated as follows:\n\nNeck_fit=(2.0\u00d7apparel_neck\u2212customer_neck)\/2\n\n","This computes the numerical fit indicators. The visual fit indicators frames that are turned on may be further derived from the numerical fit indicators by the Flash program. These values of neckfit are used as input to the Flash program to control the display of the visual and numeric fit indicators that may be visually encoded by color or shape.","The visual fit indicators represent and show to the customer , how well one or more dimensions of article of wear will fit and\/or feel on the body corresponding to the dimensions f the apparel being tried on. The visual fit indicators may be of different shapes, sizes and colors to represent a range of fit from very loose to very tight and be different for girth or length fit. For example, some visual indicators are illustrated in . These are meant for illustration and the visual indicator may be a any number of shapes and colors.","A customer may also specify a fit preference from skin fit, comfy, and loose choices. For each of these selections a variable fit_preference with a pre-defined value is added to the customer size at the time of the fit computations. For example the predefined values may be:\n\n","Where 0.0 is added to the customer size if the fit preference of skin fit is chosen, value of 0.5 is added if fit preference of comfy is chosen and a value of 1.0 is added if fit preference of loose is chosen. For example the fit preference may added to the fit computation as follows:\n\nNeck_fit=(2.0\u00d7apparel_neck\u2212(customer_neck+fit_preference)\/2\n","The fit preference may be different for different body segments. For example, the above fit preference may be for neck. Then the fit computations are:\n\nNeck_fit=(2.0\u00d7apparel_neck\u2212(customer_neck+neck_fit_preference)\/2\n","Feature (6): With reference to , the Fit web page B displays Flash image made from a composite of frames that show customer image selected from a group of generic customer images based on apparel gender and visual fit indicators overlaid over the image and numerical fit indicators overlaid around the image.","Using the Flash program an image composite made up of a multiple image layers can be displayed where each layer can be individually positioned and made visible or invisible. The layers can be made visible or hidden based on values of variables that are dynamically determined by the Fit Program based on customer interactions in selecting the apparel size and fit preference.","The program Flash image layers can include layers (i) that display base customer generic image (ii) visual fit indicator layers that are overlaid or positioned upon the specific parts of the base image and (iii) numerical fit indicators that may be in layers that are placed around the base image. Tying the visual fit indicator layers to the fit computations can vary the color and or shape of the visual fit indicators and so can the numeric fit indicators can be made dependent upon the fit computations in color. For example optimum fit indicators can be displayed in green, loose fit indicators can be displayed in blue and tight fit indicators can be displayed in red color.","Furthermore the base generic customer image may itself be composed of layers that may include wireline male image, wireline female image, and wireline customer image with generic apparel that is being tried on. For example if a shirt is tried on the base image may be a wireline image of a generic customer clothed with a generic shirt. The generic apparel image may be the actual apparel image if such image is available. The variables from the apparel data variable enable the Flash program to dynamically determine which base customer image to enable to be visible and which to hide in the composite Flash image.","The Flash program that enables the Flash images to be defined and a Flash image composite created based on customer interactions or variables values in the program is commercially available from Macromedia and a Flash player or plug in to display such Flash movie or clips is included with the commercially used browsers such as Internet Explorer 4 and up.","The Flash program that may be used is codebase=http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0 and pluginspage=\u201chttp:\/\/www.macromedia.com\/go\/getflashplayer\u201d type=\u201capplication\/x-shockwave-flash\u201d","Feature (7): With reference to , the Fit web page B displays a Size Fit button  to refresh page and redisplay the Flash image  with new selection of the apparel size  or the fit preference .","Feature (8): With reference to , the Fit web page B display Return to Merchant button  that enables the customer to return to the merchant web pages to buy an apparel or select another apparel for size fit by clicking its try-it-on button.","Use of Cookies","In this invention cookie files are used as provided in commercial Windows operating system. Cookie files are files of limited size (1 Kbyte) that are stored in the temporary Internet file folder of the Windows operating system. These short cookie files are used to store apparel data and customer data either temporarily or permanently in the customer's client machine.","For example, the apparel data for the one apparel being tried on by the customer is saved in the apparel_data cookie temporarily so that the apparel data can be made available to the Fit web page without the need to link to a database server of the merchant or the Fit system. When the customer tries on another apparel for fit, that particular apparel data is then stored in the temporary cookie file. Additionally the customer size data that is provided by the customer on the Fit web page is also stored in a customer_size cookie file. The customer may specify different cookie files for different members of the family. Again the customer size data is stored in these cookie files in the customer's computer system without the need to store and make such data available to the merchant system or the Fit system.","The use of the cookie files is further illustrated here. When the customer clicks the try-it-on button, an apparel_data cookie file is created. When the web page A is presented to the customer by the Fit program, a cookie file containing default customer size data is created. The default customer size data is displayed to the customer on page A. The customer can change the data to his\/her size, and then click the SAVE AS button after specifying the customer name. At that time a customer_name_customer size cookie is created. If the customer has done it once before, when the customer returns to web page A, the customer can specify the customer name and click the RESTORE AS button, which reads the customer size data from the cookie and populates the display as well as copy the size data into the default customer size cookie. When the customer leaves the web page A and transitions or is presented the web page B, the apparel_data cookie is read into apparel data variables and the default customer size data cookie is read into customer size variables. The apparel data variables and the customer size variables are then used to compute those fit indicators that are relevant for the apparel type as described earlier.","Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with respect to certain preferred versions thereof, other versions are possible. For example, the fit system and the merchant system can be combined. Therefore, the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the descriptions of the preferred versions contained herein."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":["The novel features of this invention, as well as the invention itself, both as to its structure and its operation, will be best understood from the accompanying drawings, taken in conjunction with the accompanying description, in which similar reference characters refer to similar parts, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3A-C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 7A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 7C"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
