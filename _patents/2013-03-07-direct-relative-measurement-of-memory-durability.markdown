{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED CASES","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a non-provisional of, and claims priority to, U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/705,475 filed Sep. 25, 2012 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/608,064 filed Mar. 7, 2012, both of which are incorporated herein by this reference.","New and emerging memory technologies, for example resistive change, or resistivity change, memory cells are gaining in popularity. Some examples include phase change (PCRAM) and conductive bridge (CB-RRAM) memories, all of which have limited endurance. For resistive change memories generally, the cumulative number of set or reset cycles the component memory cells may undergo before failure is finite and may be difficult to predict. Consequently, in typical applications, the host or memory\/storage controller must either estimate or acquire a present endurance state of the constituent cells and actively manage and track their usage, striving to minimize the variance in usage of physical locations.","While erase count based estimates of durability or endurance may be adequate for NAND Flash wear leveling, this technique does not scale well for technologies like CB-RRAM or PCRAM, as the total amount of persistent storage required to maintain these counts increases with the smaller granularity of program\/erase operations.","Improvements are needed to maximize the useful lives of memories.","Reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the disclosed embodiments. However, embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the embodiments.","A resistive change memory device generally includes an array of resistive change memory cells, each of which includes a resistive memory element. The resistive memory element includes a resistance-switching material situated between two electrodes. The resistance-switching material has at least two states, a high-resistance state and a low-resistance state, and can be cycled between these two states by application of appropriate voltages to the electrodes, thus allowing the resistive memory element to be programmed. For example, a resistive change memory cell for which the resistance-switching material has been programmed to the high-resistance state (referred to herein as a \u201creset\u201d state) is considered to store a \u201c1\u201d and a resistive change memory cell for which the resistance-switching material has been programmed to the low-resistance state (referred to herein as a \u201cset\u201d state) is considered to store a \u201c0,\u201d or vice-versa.","Four general classes of resistance-switching materials are solid electrolyte materials, insulating materials, phase-change materials, and organic materials. The term \u201cresistive change memory device\u201d as used herein includes, without limitation, memories that use any of these classes of resistance-switching materials (e.g., resistance-switching random access memories (RRAMs), conductive-bridging random access memories (CB-RAMS), and phase-change memories (PRAMs)). Examples of resistance-switching electrolyte materials include GeSe, GeS, CuS, CuO, AgS, WO, CeO, HfO, and SiO. Examples of resistance-switching insulating materials include TiO, NiO, SrZrO, SrTiO, ZrO, and MgO.","A resistive change memory cell using a solid electrolyte material as the resistance-switching material is typically fabricated using a metal that exhibits ionic conductivity in the solid electrolyte (i.e., a metal ion source for the solid electrolyte) as the first electrode and an inert metal as the second electrode. Application of a biasing condition (e.g., a first bias voltage applied for a specified duration) that corresponds to a set operation causes the first electrode to inject ions into the solid electrolyte; the ions precipitate into filaments that produce low-resistance paths between the electrodes, resulting in formation of a low-resistance state (or set state) in the solid electrolyte.","Application of a biasing condition (e.g., a second bias voltage distinct from the first bias voltage, applied for a specified duration) that corresponds to a reset operation causes the dissolution of the filaments, resulting in formation of a high-resistance state (or reset state) in the solid electrolyte. (While other types of resistance-switching materials may operate in accordance with other physical mechanisms, the materials also may be programmed to low-resistance (set) and high-resistance (reset) states). The reset operation, however, does not entirely reverse the set operation: some ions injected into the solid electrolyte during the set operation remain in the solid electrolyte after the reset operation. Over time, these ions accumulate in the solid electrolyte as the resistive change memory cell is repeatedly cycled between set and reset states, resulting in a decrease in the resistive change memory cell's reset resistance (i.e., the resistance in the reset state). Similarly, ions may also accumulate in the form of reduced metal at the inert electrode leading to a reduction in the effective thickness of the electrolyte and reducing the resistive change memory cell's resistance in the high resistance state. Eventually the reset resistance and the set resistance of the resistive change memory cell change to a point at which the reset resistance and the set resistance cannot be distinguished rapidly and reliably. When this occurs, the resistive change memory cell can be regarded as no longer being functional.","A newly-fabricated resistive change memory cell has an initial write endurance. The write endurance is the maximum number of set\/reset cycles the memory cell will undergo before the above-described degradation mechanisms make the reset resistance and the set resistance of the resistive change memory cell difficult to distinguish rapidly and reliably. Each set\/reset cycle that the memory cell undergoes degrades the difference between the reset resistance and the set resistance. Thus, at any point in its lifetime, a resistive change memory cell can be regarded as having what may be called a future endurance or remaining endurance. The remaining endurance of a resistive memory cell corresponds to the number of set\/reset cycles the memory cell will be able to undergo before the memory cell ceases to be functional.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","106","110","106","110","108","108","108","110"],"sub":["SET ","RESET ","SET ","RESET ","REF ","REF ","REF ","RESET "]},"At a first point , Ihas sufficient margin with respect to I to allow a \u201c1\u201d stored in the resistive change memory cell to be read rapidly and reliably. At a second point , however, the reset resistance has decreased by an amount such that Ino longer has sufficient margin with respect to I to allow a \u201c1\u201d stored in the resistive change memory cell to be read rapidly and reliably. The number of cycles (N)  corresponding to the second point  represents the write endurance of the resistive change memory cell: the resistive change memory cell is deemed to have failed when the number of set\/reset cycles  exceeds N. Note that although I is illustrated as being a linear function of the number N of set\/reset cycles, in general I (and hence, the resistive change memory cell's resistance) is a monotonic function (and in some implementations a non-linear monotonic function) of the number N of set\/reset cycles.","Resistive change memory cells with endurance such as that illustrated in  include at least three-terminal resistive change memory cells and two-terminal resistive change memory cells.  are schematic diagrams of respective three-terminal resistive change memory cells  ( ().

The order of pass gate  and resistive memory element  is reversed in resistive change memory cell  as compared to resistive change memory cell .","To program resistive change memory cells  and , a logic-high (\u201cH\u201d) signal is applied to the gate of pass gate  via node  to turn on pass gate , and a programming voltage is applied between nodes  and  for a specified duration. In some embodiments, a positive set voltage Vis applied between nodes  and  (e.g., Vis a positive voltage relative to node ) for a first duration to perform a set operation and a negative reset voltage \u2212Vis applied between nodes  and  (e.g., \u2212Vis a negative voltage relative to node ) for a second duration to perform a reset operation. Note that the first duration and the second duration are typically equal. Also note that this specification refers to a logic-high (\u201cH\u201d) signal being applied to a gate to turn on pass gate . However, a voltage other than the logic-high (\u201cH\u201d) signal and that is sufficient to turn on the pass gate may be applied to the pass gate. Similarly, this specification refers to a logic-low (\u201cL\u201d) signal being applied to pass gate  to turn off the pass gate. However, a voltage other than the logic-low (\u201cL\u201d) signal and that is sufficient to turn off the pass gate may be applied to the pass gate.","In some embodiments, to perform a restore operation for the resistive change memory cells  and , the logic-high signal is applied to the gate of pass gate  via node  to turn on the pass gate , and a negative restore voltage \u2212Vis applied between the nodes  and  (e.g., \u2212Vis a negative voltage relative to node ) for a third duration. In some implementations, voltage Vis greater in magnitude than voltage V. In some implementations, voltage \u2212Vis applied between nodes  and  for a longer duration in the restore operation than the voltage \u2212Vis applied between nodes  and  in the reset operation. In other words, the third duration is greater than the second duration. Alternatively, the restore operation is performed by applying \u2212V(as opposed to \u2212V) between nodes  and  for a longer duration than for the reset operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIGS. 2C and 2D","FIG. 2C) and 240","FIG. 2D","FIG. 16E","FIG. 16E","FIG. 16E"],"b":["230","230","240","210","236","232","234","232","0","0","1","1","2","2","234","0","1","2","236","230","240","350","236","236","236","236","210","236","240","230","230","236","232","210","234","240","210","232","236","234"],"sub":"TH "},"The two-terminal resistive change memory cells  and  are programmed and restored in similar manners to the three-terminal resistive change memory cells  and , except that there is no pass gate to turn on and the programming and restore voltages are adjusted to account for threshold voltage V.

The total memory size in bytes is the product of B\u00d7R\u00d7C\u00d7G.","In some embodiments, the data array organization may be modified to support arbitrary block remapping.  shows the changes for one bank for simplicity as these changes apply to the other banks in the same way. One significant change in an RRAM device is the support for more physical blocks than the number of logical blocks. This over provisioning applies in the number of extra columns, denoted as C\u2032, and in the number of extra rows, denoted as R\u2032. The size of the over provision can be as small as one.","The new organization would have C\u2032 number of columns in each row and a column translation table, denoted as CTT, that maps the logical columns to their physical columns. Similarly, each bank has R\u2032 number of rows and a row translation table, denoted as RTT, that maps the logical rows to their physical rows. It is possible to have a global translation table that maps any logical column on any logical row to any physical column to any physical row. However, this mapping flexibility has a cost in terms of the translation table size. A preferred embodiment may implement two-level translation tables, where one table is used to remap all the rows and a series of smaller tables are used to remap all the columns within each row.

The resistive change memory cell includes a resistive memory element. A first biasing condition is applied to the resistive change memory cell to program the resistive change memory cell to a reset state. A determination is made that the resistance of the resistive change memory cell in the reset state has decreased below a predefined threshold. In response to the determination, a second biasing condition is applied to the resistive change memory cell for a restore operation to counteract the decrease in resistance of the resistive change memory cell in the reset state. At least one of a voltage, current, and duration of the second biasing condition is greater than a corresponding voltage, current, or duration of the first biasing condition.","In some embodiments, to at least partially reverse the decrease in reset resistance resulting from subjecting the resistive change memory cell to repeated set\/reset cycles, a restore operation is performed under a more extreme biasing condition, referred to as a second biasing condition, than the biasing condition for the reset operation, which is referred to as a first biasing condition. Each biasing condition involves applying a specified voltage to a resistive change memory cell for a specified duration, or alternatively applying a specified current to a resistive change memory cell for a specified duration. For example, the specified voltage (or current) of the second biasing condition has a greater magnitude than, but the same polarity as, the specified voltage (or current) of the first biasing condition, and\/or the specified duration of the second biasing condition is greater than the specified duration of the first biasing condition. Because the second biasing condition is more extreme than the first biasing condition, the restore operation more effectively reverses the set operation than does the reset operation. For example, the second biasing condition results in greater migration of ions out of the solid electrolyte onto the electrode than does the first biasing condition. Performing a restore operation increases the future endurance of the resistive change memory cell and therefore increases the number of set\/reset cycles the resistive change memory cell can undergo to a value greater than the cell's specified write endurance.","In the implementation shown in , a pair of bit lines (e.g., BLA and BLOB) shares a single read\/write circuit  (e.g., -), as controlled by the transistors  and .

During a read operation, a logic-high EN_READ signal is applied to transistor , a logic-high signal is applied to a respective word line (e.g., WL or WL), and source line SL is grounded (e.g., connected to the circuit ground of the resistive change memory device ), thus coupling a respective resistive change memory cell (e.g., E or F) to a current mirror  and causing a reference current Ito flow along bit line BL. The reference current Icorresponds to the read current of the respective reference resistive change memory cell (e.g., resistive change memory cell E or F). Similarly, during a characterization operation, a logic-high EN_CHAR signal is applied to transistor , a logic-high signal is applied to a respective word line (e.g., WL or WL), and source line SL is grounded (or coupled to a predetermined voltage), thus coupling a respective resistive change memory cell (e.g., G or H) to the current mirror  and causing a reference current Ithat corresponds to the read current of the respective reference resistive change memory cell (e.g., resistive change memory cell G or H) to flow along bit line BL. In both operations, current mirror  multiplies Iby a factor M and provides the multiplied current M\u00d7Ito a transistor . In some implementations, the factor M is used to adjust the multiplied current M\u00d7Ifor margining. In some implementations the factor M is greater than 0. Transistor  is connected to transistors - through -in sense amplifiers - through -in current-mirror configurations that mirror the multiplied current M\u00d7Iinto sense amplifiers - through -. The current mirror  and transistor  together constitute a configurable reference current generator . Along with the transistors  and , configurable reference current generator  thus multiplexes multiple reference currents into sense amplifiers - through -. Note that although  illustrates a common source line that runs parallel to and is shared by multiple word lines, other configurations of the source line may be used. In some implementations, each word line has a corresponding and unique source line. In some implementations, a common source line runs parallel to and is shared by multiple bit lines. In some implementations, each bit line has a corresponding and unique source line.","Each sense amplifier  compares a respective bit line current Ito M\u00d7I; the inverter pairs  produce result signals indicating the results of these comparisons, as described with reference to . The reference resistive change memory cells E-H are designed with resistive memory elements  configured to have read currents that, when multiplied by M, provide the desired reference currents. In some embodiments, the reference resistive change memory cells E, F for read operations are initially programmed to set states and the reference resistive change memory cells G, H for characterization operations are initially programmed to reset states. For the resistive change memory cells along bit line BL, M\u00d7Iequals I(). For the resistive change memory cells along bit line BL, M\u00d7Iequals I(). Use of reference resistive change memory cells to generate reference currents accounts for manufacturing process variation that affects the resistive change memory cells being read or characterized and thus results in more accurate read and characterization operations.","During a characterization operation, the output of each inverter pair  is coupled to the gate of a pull-down transistor  (e.g., an n-type MOSFET). For example, in some implementations a multiplexer or a pass gate (or a transmission gate) is used to couple an output of an inverter pair  to the gate of a pull-down transistor . Note that the circuitry used to output data to a data bus during a read operation is described below. The source of each pull-down transistor  connects to a \/ROWFAIL signal line . A pull-up transistor  precharges the signal line .

The FAIL signal of \u201c1\u201d turns on a respective pull-down transistor , which pulls down the \/ROW FAIL signal line . An inverter  outputs the complement of the value on the \/ROWFAIL signal line  and thus provides a ROWFAIL signal that equals \u201c1\u201d if the reset resistance of at least one resistive change memory cell in the row of resistive change memory cells being characterized has decreased below (i.e., below) the threshold, and otherwise equals \u201c0.\u201d The ROWFAIL signal line , transistors  and , and inverter  together constitute wired-OR detection circuitry coupled to the sense amplifiers - through -to generate a fail signal (e.g., ROW FAIL=\u201c1\u201d) in response to a determination by any one of the sense amplifiers - through -that the future endurance of a respective resistive change memory cell does not satisfy a specified future endurance threshold.","In a characterization operation performed to determine whether the set resistance of one or more resistive change memory cells has increased above the threshold corresponding to I, a FAIL signal of \u201c0\u201d from an inverter pair  indicates that the set resistance of a respective resistive change memory cell has increased above the threshold. Accordingly, in some embodiments for performing such an operation, a third inverter is added in series with the inverter pair .","In some embodiments, the current mirror  for each sense amplifier  includes multiple parallel outputs (e.g., parallel mirrored current branches) each of which is coupled to its own instance of transistor  and its own instance of inverter pair , which in turn are coupled its own instance of the wired-OR detection circuitry and the FAIL signal. In these embodiments, multiple characterization operations with distinct reference currents are performed simultaneously. Furthermore, these embodiments allow a characterization operation to be performed simultaneously with a read operation.","During a read operation, the output of each inverter pair  is coupled to a data bus (not shown).

Also, while transistors  () are not shown in  for clarity, in some embodiments transistors  are included for performing restore operations. For example, a restore operation is performed for a group (e.g., a row) of resistive change memory cells in response to an indication by the ROWFAIL signal that at least one resistive change memory cell in the group has degraded beyond a threshold corresponding to I.
