THE INVENTION","OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","REFERENCES","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.","This invention relates generally to the field of computer architectures modeled on the function of the brain. More specifically, the present invention relates to a computer architecture using modem electronics to perform the function of neurons and synaptic connections.","The amazing computing power of the brain originates thanks to its highly parallelized interconnectivity amongst neurons through synaptic connections. The synaptic connection plays an important role in brain activity as these connections can be strengthened or weakened as the brain learns and knowledge is stored within the system [2]: Neuron behavior has been characterized as an adding system that provides an output based on the sum of all inputs, or synapse outputs, and its connectivity to other neurons [1]. In addition, the amount of information or knowledge a neuromorphic computer can retain depends on the number neurons and synaptic connections within the system. For example, the brain of an ant is said to contain approximately 300,000 neurons [3].","The natural ability of the brain to perform a high number of complex functions in parallel that to date are unmatched by the fastest most powerful supercomputers represents a great technological engineering challenge. Neuromorphic computers promise to provide artificial machines the ability to perform complex functions by mimicking the brain's engineering. Software based implementations of neuromorphic computing have demonstrated the feasibility of mimicking brain functionality [1]. However, software based implementations of neuromorphic computing require high performance computers and super computers that in turn make usage of such applications in everyday life impractical specially within mobile and\/or low cost systems.","What is lacking, therefore, is the development of hardware based neuromorphic computer that will enable a technological breakthrough with the implementation of brain functionality within systems that are built based on the engineering principles of the brain. Such a hardware based neuromorphic computer would require a neuromorphic hardware architecture that mimics the brain's synaptic and neuron functionality employing electronic devices to represent synaptic and neuron characteristic behavior. Given the large number of neurons and synaptic connections (approximately 1,000 synaptic connections per neuron) required to design systems capable of mimicking practical brain functionality such as image recognition, it is important for the electronic devices to be small in order to be fabricated within a small physical area as computer microprocessors are fabricated today.","The present invention provides an apparatus to perform human brain-like computing functions.","It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus that overcomes the limitations of software-based methods to perform human brain-like computing functions.","It is another object of the present invention, then, to provide an electronic means to perform excitatory and inhibitory responses.","It is another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus that performs the functions of neurons and synaptic connections through electronic means.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an electronic means for performing the functions of neurons and synaptic connections which is amenable to high density fabrication.","Briefly stated, the present invention provides an apparatus for human brain-like (i.e., neuromorphic) computing utilizing electronics to perform the function of neurons and synaptic connections. The invention provides variable resistance circuits to represent interconnection strength between neurons and a positive and negative output circuit to represent excitatory and inhibitory responses, respectively. This approach has definite advantages over software-based neuromorphic computing methods.","The above, and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals designate the same elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["[1] J.

This variable conductance, or its inverse the resistance, can be used to control the connection strength between synapses and neuron circuitry.","Positive\/Negative Output Potential Circuit Element","Referring to , the present invention re-create the positive and negative (excitatory and inhibitory) potential outputs of a synaptic system by employing a common CMOS inverter circuit  operating along its transition region. A pfet device  (distinguished by the black notch on its gate ) is connected to an nfet  device in series. Both devices receive the same input, and based on the input potential, the inverter circuit  will output either Vmax or Vmin. For example, if the input potential is 0 volts, the nfet device  will be in the off state meaning the input potential is below its threshold voltage and no conducting channel is formed under the gate. On the other hand, at 0 volts, the pfet device  is switched on given that its threshold potential is negative. Therefore, for a zero input voltage the output of the inverter  is Vmax as Vout will be shorted to Vmax through the channel under the gate  for the pfet device .","The present invention needs to operate the inverter circuit  along its transition region to achieve positive (Vmax) and negative (Vmin) potential outputs that will resemble post-synaptic behavior. Since the inverter circuit  of , works in saturation mode, meaning that Vmax and Vmin (VDS) are both greater in magnitude than (VGS\u2212Vth), transistor current saturation equations describe its transition characteristics. For an nfet device, ignoring channel length modulation, the drain current is modeled as for the nfet as [4] (for the pfet reverse current flow direction):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0039"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["I","DS"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["\u03bc","n"]},{"mi":["C","ox"]}],"mo":"\u2062"},"mn":"2"},{"mi":["W","L"]}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["V","GS"]},{"mi":["V","th"]}],"mo":"-"}},"mn":"2"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"4"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{},{}],"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["V","V","V"],"sub":["OUT","in"]},"Synaptic System","In the present invention the synaptic system employs the variable resistor and inverter circuit elements described previously.
