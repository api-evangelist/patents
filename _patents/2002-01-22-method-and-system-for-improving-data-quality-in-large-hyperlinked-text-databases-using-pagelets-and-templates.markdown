title: Method and system for improving data quality in large hyperlinked text databases using pagelets and templates
abstract: A computing system and method clean a set of hypertext documents to minimize violations of a Hypertext Information Retrieval (IR) rule set. Then, the system and method performs an information retrieval operation on the resulting cleaned data. The cleaning process includes decomposing each page of the set of hypertext documents into one or more pagelets; identifying possible templates; and eliminating the templates from the data. Traditional IR search and mining algorithms can then be used to search on the remaining pagelets, as opposed to the original pages, to provide cleaner, more precise results.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","This invention generally relates to the field of computer based search systems, and more particularly relates to a system and method for improving data quality in large hyperlinked text databases using pagelets and templates, and to the use of the cleaned data in hypertext information retrieval algorithms.","2. Description of Related Art","The explosive growth of content available on the World-Wide-Web has led to an increased demand and opportunity for tools to organize, search and effectively use the available information. People are increasingly finding it difficult to sort through the great mass of content available. New classes of information retrieval algorithms\u2014link-based information retrieval algorithms\u2014have been proposed and show increasing promise in addressing the problems caused by this information overload.","Three important principles (or assumptions)\u2014collectively called Hypertext IR Principles\u2014underlie most, if not all, link-based methods in information retrieval.","1. Relevant Linkage Principle: Links confer authority; by placing a link from a page p to a page q, the author of p recommends q or at least acknowledges the relevance of q to the subject of p.","2. Topical Unity Principle: Documents co-cited within the same document are related to each other.","3. Lexical Affinity Principle: Proximity of text and links within a page is a measure of the relevance of one to the other.","Each of these principles, while generally true, is frequently and systematically violated on the web. Moreover, these violations have an adverse impact on the quality of results produced by linkage based search and mining algorithms. This necessitates the use of several heuristic methods to deal with unreliable data that degrades performance and overall quality of searching and data mining.","Therefore a need exists to overcome the problems with the prior art as discussed above, and particularly for a method of cleaning the data prior to a search and eliminating violations of hypertext information retrieval principles.","According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a computing system and method clean a set of text documents to minimize violations of Hypertext IR Principles as a preparation step towards running an information retrieval\/mining system. The cleaning process includes first, decomposing each page of the set of text documents into one or more pagelets; second, identifying possible templates; and finally, eliminating the templates from the data. Traditional IR search and mining algorithms can then be used to process the remaining data, as opposed to the original pages, to provide more precise results.","The present invention, according to a preferred embodiment, overcomes problems with the prior art by \u201ccleaning\u201d the underlying data so that violations of Hypertext Information Retrieval (IR) Principles are minimized, then applying conventional IR algorithms. This results in higher precision, better scalability, and more understandable algorithms for link-based information retrieval.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention presents a formal framework and introduces new methods for unifying a large number of these data cleaning heuristics. The violations of the hypertext information retrieval principles result in significant performance degradations in all linkage based search and mining algorithms. Therefore, eliminating these violations in a preprocessing step will result in a uniform improvement in quality across the board.","The web contains frequent violations of the Hypertext IR Principles. These violations are not random, but rather happen for systematic reasons. The web contains many navigational links (links that help navigating inside a web-site), download links (links to download pages, for instance, those which point to a popular Internet browser download page), links which point to business partners, links which are introduced to deliberately mislead link-based search algorithms, and paid advertisement links. Each of these auxiliary links violates the Relevant Linkage Principle. In algorithmic terms, these are a significant source of noise that search algorithms have to combat, and which can sometimes result in non-relevant pages being ranked as highly authoritative. An example of this would be that a highly popular, but very broad, homepage (e.g., Yahoo!) is ranked as a highly authoritative page regardless of the query because many pages contain a pointer to it.","Another common violation occurs from pages that cater to a mixture of topics. Bookmark pages and personal homepages are particularly frequent instances of this kind of violation. For example, suppose that a colleague is a fan of professional football, as well as an authority on finite model theory. Further that these two interests are obvious from his homepage. Some linkage based information retrieval tools will then incorrectly surmise that these two broad topics are related. Since the web has a significantly larger amount of information about professional football than it has about finite model theory, it is possible, even probable, that a link-based search for resources about finite model theory returns pages about pro football.","Another issue arises from the actual construction of the web pages. HTML is a linearization of a document; however, the true structure is most like a tree. For constructs such as a two dimensional table, trees are not effective descriptions of document structure either. Thus, lexical affinity should be judged on the real structure of the document, not on the particular linearization of it as determined by the conventions used in HTML. Additionally, there are many instances of lists that are arranged in alphabetical order within a page. Assuming that links that are close to each other on such a list are more germane to each other than otherwise would be wrong.","Modern web pages contain many elements for navigational and other auxiliary purposes. For example, popular web sites tend to contain advertisement banners, shopping lists, navigational bars, privacy policy information, and even news headlines. Many times, pages represent a collection of interests and ideas that are loosely knit together to form a single entity (i.e., a person's work and relevant information about his hobbies may appear on a homepage). These pages may be broken down into self-contained logical regions called pagelets. Each pagelet has a well-defined topic or functionality. Pagelets are the more appropriate unit for information retrieval, since they tend to better conform to the Hypertext IR Principles.","The proliferation of the use of templates in creating web pages has also been a source of Hypertext IR Principles violations. A template is a pre-prepared master HTML shell page that is used as a basis for composing new web pages. The content of the new page is plugged into the template shell, resulting in a collection of pages that share a common look and feel. Templates can spread over several sister sites and contain links to other web sites. Since all pages that conform to a common template share many links, it is clear that these links cannot be relevant to the specific content on these pages.","According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, each page from a collection of documents is decomposed into one or more pagelets. These pagelets are screened to eliminate the ones that belong to templates. Traditional IR algorithms can then be used on the remaining pagelets to return a more precise result set. The collection of documents may reside locally; be located on an internal LAN; or may be the collection or a subset of the collection of documents located on the World Wide Web.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIGS. 1 and 2","b":["100","102","110","112","102","106","104","104","102"]},"Each computer system  may include, inter alia, one or more computers and at least a computer readable medium . The computers preferably include means for reading and\/or writing to the computer readable medium. The computer readable medium allows a computer system to read data, instructions, messages or message packets, and other computer readable information from the computer readable medium. The computer readable medium, for example, may include non-volatile memory, such as Floppy, ROM, Flash memory, Disk drive memory, CD-ROM, and other permanent storage. It is useful, for example, for transporting information, such as data and computer instructions, between computer systems.","The computer system , according to the present example, includes a controller\/processor  (shown in ), which processes instructions, performs calculations, and manages the flow of information through the computer system . Additionally, the controller\/processor  is communicatively coupled with program memory . Included within program memory  are an information retrieval tool  with a data cleaning application  (which will be discussed later in greater detail), operating system platform , and glue software . The operating system platform  manages resources, such as the data stored in data memory , the scheduling of tasks, and processes the operation of the information retrieval tool  and the data cleaning application  in the program memory . The operating system platform  also manages a graphical display interface (not shown), a user input interface (not shown) that receives inputs from the keyboard  and the mouse , and communication network interfaces (not shown) for communicating with the network link . Additionally, the operating system platform  also manages many other basic tasks of the computer system  in a manner well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.","Glue software  may include drivers, stacks, and low level application programming interfaces (API's) and provides basic functional components for use by the operating system platform  and by compatible applications that run on the operating system platform  for managing communications with resources and processes in the computing system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIGS. 3 and 4","b":["110","112","218","304","302","204","304","406","308","204"]},"The information retrieval tool  can work with a generic data gathering application  (such as a web crawler) and a generic hypertext information retrieval application  (such as a search engine, a similar page finder, a focused crawler, or a page classifier). The data gathering application  fetches a collection of hypertext documents . These documents can be fetched from the Word-Wide Web , from a local intranet network, or from any other source. The documents are stored on database tables . The information retrieval application  processes the collection of hypertext documents  stored on the database tables , and based on a user's query  extracts results  from this collection matching the query. For example, when the information retrieval application  is a search engine, the application finds all the documents in the collection  that match the query terms given by the user.","The data cleaning application  processes the collection of hypertext documents  stored on the database tables, after they were fetched by the data gathering application  and before the information retrieval application  extracts results from them. The data cleaning application  assumes the data gathering application  stores all the pages it fetches on the PAGES database table  and all the links between these pages in the LINKS database table . The data cleaning application  stores the clean set of pages and pagelets on the PAGES , LINKS , and PAGELETS  tables. The information retrieval application  thus gets the clean data from these tables. An exemplary scheme for the database tables  used by the information retrieval tool is depicted in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["112","502","310","410","310","504","414","318","506","410","414","508","410","414","510","314","314","410","412","414","414","512","414"]},"An exemplary HTML page, illustrating the concept of the use of pagelets according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, is shown in .

A template is a collection of pagelets T satisfying the following two requirements:","(1) all the pagelets in T are identical or almost identical; and (2) every two pages owning pagelets in T are reachable one from the other via other pages also owning pagelets in T; the path connecting each such two pages can be undirected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1112","1114","1102","1104","1106","1108","1110"]},"A preferred embodiment uses the concept of shingling, as taught by U.S. Pat. No. 6,119,124, \u201cMethod for Clustering Closely Resembling Data Objects,\u201d filed Mar. 26, 1998, the entire teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference, and applies it to cluster similar pagelets. A shingle is a hash value that is insensitive to small perturbations (i.e. two strings that are almost identical get the same shingle value with a high probability, whereas two very different strings have a low probability of receiving the same shingle value). A shingle calculator  calculates shingle values for each pagelet in the PAGELETS table  and also for each page in the PAGES table .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIGS. 7 and 8","b":["410","414","412"]},"The exemplary operational sequence shown in  is more suitable for small document sets, which consist only of a small fraction of the documents from the larger universe. In this case the template identifier  verifies only the first requirement of the template definition, that is, that all the pagelets in a template are identical or almost identical. The template identifier  starts, at step , by eliminating identical pagelets that belong to duplicate pages by merging all pagelets that share the same page shingle and pagelet serial. This is done in order to avoid confusing templates with mirrors.","The template identifier , at step , then sorts the pagelets by their shingle into clusters. Each such cluster contains pagelets sharing the same shingle, and therefore represents a set of pagelets that are identical or almost identical. The template identifier  enumerates the clusters at step , and outputs the pagelets belonging to each cluster at step .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["314","314","802","314","804","416","806","416","412","418","808","314","810","418","812","814","316","314","816"],"sub":["\u2014","\u2014","\u2014","\u2014"]},"The present invention can be realized in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software.
