{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","COPYRIGHT NOTICE","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention is a continuation-in-part and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/731,900, filed Dec. 9, 2003, entitled \u201cContext Free Document Portions,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference as if fully set out herein.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","The present invention generally relates to managing data across different computer-generated documents. More particularly, the present invention relates to utilization of context-free document portions having alternate formats and other properties in association with a single computer-generated document.","With the advent of the computer age, computer and software users have grown accustomed to user-friendly software applications that help then write, calculate, organize, prepare presentations, send and receive electronic mail, make music, and the like. For example, modern electronic word processing applications allow users to prepare a variety of useful documents. Modem spreadsheet applications allow users to enter, manipulate, and organize data. Modem electronic slide presentation applications allow users to create a variety of slide presentations containing text, pictures, data or other useful objects.","Methods and systems have been developed for representing documents and associated properties generated by such applications according to various formatting types. For example, documents may be represented in binary format, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format, rich text format (RTF), Extensible Markup Language format (XML), and the like. In addition, there are many components that make up such documents, including paragraphs, tables, styles, fonts, lists and the like. Some components of a document reference other components for providing a first component with structural limitations. For example, a paragraph in a document might reference a particular formatting type or style setting that defines how the paragraph is to appear in a document. For another example, a paragraph component of a document may be part of a particular list structure in a document. Because there are a number of properties and objects that other objects of a document may reference, such as styles, there is typically a need in a document for a header in which various properties and objects, such as styles and font definitions, are located.","Unfortunately, a problem occurs when a user attempts to add additional content to a particular document, for example, a paragraph, text portion, image, chart, and the like, where the additional content is formatted according to a formatting that is different from the formatting of the document to which the additional content is being added. For example, a given application may store all rich text in HTML format. To take content from a document generated by that application to a non-HTML application, the HTML-formatted content must be transformed into another format. Otherwise, if the HTML-formatted content, for example, is added to a document formatted according to another formatting, for example, XML, the original formatting of the added content may be lost, or the additional content may fail to load altogether.","It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present invention has been made.","The present invention solves the above and other problems by providing self-describing portions of text or data in a document. According to an embodiment of the invention, portions of a document, such as individual paragraphs or groups of paragraphs or fragments of text, are provided self-describing properties such as file format type associated with the portion, style, font, list type, and the like. If such a portion of a document is subsequently copied or moved to a second document or to a different location in the first document, the self-describing properties provided for the portion travel with the portion to the second document or to the different location in the first document. Consequently, an application preparing and displaying the second document or the first document may consume and display the portion according to the properties provided for the portion.","According to another embodiment, a document container is established for displaying and editing a document. Self-describing portions or components of the document may be maintained and edited in the document container. Alternatively, the self-describing portions or components of the document may be maintained and edited separately from the document container, but may be pointed to from within the document container. At open time for the document, all document portions or components pointed to from within the document container may be merged by and displayed by an application enabled to consume each of the different document portions or components according to their individual file format types or other properties.","These and other features, advantages, and aspects of the present invention may be more clearly understood and appreciated from a review of the following detailed description of the disclosed embodiments and by reference to the appended drawings and claims.","As briefly described above, embodiments of the present invention are directed to methods and systems for inserting or referencing portions of text or data into or by a document where the inserted or referenced portions of text or data are formatted according to a file format type and other properties different from the document into which the portions of text or data are inserted or to which the portions of text or data are referenced for merger with the receiving document. These embodiments may be combined, other embodiments may be utilized, and structural changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting senses and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals represent like elements through the several figures, aspects of the present invention and the exemplary operating environment will be described.  and the following discussion are intended to provide a brief, general description of a suitable computing environment in which the invention may be implemented. While the invention will be described in the general context of program modules that execute in conjunction with an application program that runs on an operating system on a personal computer, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention may also be implemented in combination with other program modules.","Generally, program modules include routines, programs, components, data structures, and other types of structures that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. The invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.","Turning now to , illustrative computer architecture for a personal computer  for practicing the various embodiments of the invention will be described. The computer architecture shown in  illustrates a conventional personal computer, including a central processing unit  (\u201cCPU\u201d), a system memory , including a random access memory  (\u201cRAM\u201d) and a read-only memory (\u201cROM\u201d) , and a system bus  that couples the memory to the CPU . A basic input\/output system containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the computer, such as during startup, is stored in the ROM . The personal computer  further includes a mass storage device  for storing an operating system , application programs, such as the application program , and data.","The mass storage device  is connected to the CPU  through a mass storage controller (not shown) connected to the bus . The mass storage device  and its associated computer-readable media, provide non-volatile storage for the personal computer . Although the description of computer-readable media contained herein refers to a mass storage device, such as a hard disk or CD-ROM drive, it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by the personal computer .","By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media includes volatile and non-volatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data.

The personal computer  may connect to the TCP\/IP network  through a network interface unit  connected to the bus . It should be appreciated that the network interface unit  may also be utilized to connect to other types of networks and remote computer systems. The personal computer  may also include an input\/output controller  for receiving and processing input from a number of devices, including a keyboard or mouse (not shown). Similarly, an input\/output controller  may provide output to a display screen, a printer, or other type of output device.","As mentioned briefly above, a number of program modules and data files may be stored in the mass storage device  and RAM  of the personal computer , including an operating system  suitable for controlling the operation of a networked personal computer, such as the WINDOWS XP operating system from MICROSOFT CORPORATION of Redmond, Wash. The mass storage device  and RAM  may also store one or more application programs. In particular, the mass storage device  and RAM  may store an application program  for creating and editing an electronic document . For instance, the application program  may comprise a word processing application program, a spreadsheet application, a contact application, and the like. Application programs for creating and editing other types of electronic documents may also be used with the various embodiments of the present invention. A schema file  and a namespace\/schema library , described below, are also shown.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are implemented by communications between different software objects in an object-oriented programming environment. For purposes of the following description of embodiments of the present invention, it is useful to briefly to describe components of an object-oriented programming environment.  is a simplified block diagram illustrating interaction between software objects according to an object-oriented programming model. According to an object-oriented programming environment, a first object  may include software code, executable methods, properties, and parameters. Similarly, a second object  may also include software code, executable methods, properties, and parameters.","A first object  may communicate with a second object  to obtain information or functionality from the second object  by calling the second object  via a message call . As is well know to those skilled in the art of object-oriented programming environment, the first object  may communicate with the second object  via application programming interfaces (API) that allow two disparate software objects ,  to communicate with each other in order to obtain information and functionality from each other. For example, if the first object  requires the functionality provided by a method contained in the second object , the first object  may pass a message call  to the second object  in which the first object identifies the required method and in which the first object passes any required parameters to the second object required by the second object for operating the identified method. Once the second object  receives the call from the first object, the second object executes the called method based on the provided parameters and sends a return message  containing a value obtained from the executed method back to the first object .","For example, in terms of embodiments of the present invention, and as will be described below, a first object  may be a third party customized application that passes a message to a second object such as an Extensible Markup Language schema validation object whereby the first object identifies a method requiring the validation of a specified XML element in a document where the specified XML element is a parameter passed by the first object with the identified method. Upon receipt of the call from the first object, according to this example, the schema validation object executes the identified method on the specified XML element and returns a message to the first object in the form of a result or value associated with the validated XML element. Operation of object-oriented programming environments, as briefly described above, are well known to those skilled in the art.","As described below, embodiments of the present invention are implemented through the interaction of software objects in the use, customization, and application of components of the Extensible Markup Language (XML).  is a block diagram illustrating interaction between a document, an attached schema file, and a schema validation functionality module. As is well known to those skilled in the art, the Extensible Markup Language (XML) provides a method of describing text and data in a document by allowing a user to create tag names that are applied to text or data in a document that in turn define the text or data to which associated tags are applied. For example referring to , the document  created with the application  contains text that has been marked up with XML tags , , . For example, the text \u201cGreetings\u201d is annotated with the XML tag <title>. The text \u201cMy name is Sarah\u201d is annotated with the <body> tag. According to XML, the creator of the <title> and <body> tags is free to create her own tags for describing the tags to which those tags will be applied. Then, so long as any downstream consuming application or computing machine is provided instructions as to the definition of the tags applied to the text, that application or computing machine may utilize the data in accordance with the tags. For example, if a downstream application has been programmed to extract text defined as titles of articles or publications processed by that application, the application may parse the document  and extract the text \u201cGreetings,\u201d as illustrated in  because that text is annotated with the tag <title>. The creator of the particular XML tag naming for the document , illustrated in , provides useful description for text or data contained in the document  that may be utilized by third parties so long as those third parties are provided with the definitions associated with tags applied to the text or data.","According to embodiments of the present invention, the text and XML markup entered into the document  may be saved according to a variety of different file formats and according to the native programming language of the application  with which the document  is created. For example, the text and XML markup may be saved according to a word processing application, a spreadsheet application, and the like. Alternatively, the text and XML markup entered into the document  may be saved as an XML format whereby the text or data, any applied XML markup, and any formatting such as font, style, paragraph structure, etc. may be saved as an XML representation. Accordingly, downstream or third party applications capable of understanding data saved as XML may open and consume the text or data thus saved as an XML representation. For a detailed discussion of saving text and XML markup and associated formatting and other attributes of a document  as XML, see U.S. patent application entitled \u201cWord Processing Document Stored in a Single XML File that may be Manipulated by Applications that Understanding XML,\u201d U.S. Ser. No. 10\/187,060, filed Jun. 28, 2002, which is incorporated herein by reference as if fully set out herein. An exemplary schema in accordance with the present invention is disclosed beginning on page 11 in an application entitled \u201cMixed Content Flexibility,\u201d Ser. No. 10\/726,077, filed Dec. 2, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In order to provide a definitional framework for XML markup elements (tags) applied to text or data, as illustrated in , XML schema files are created which contain information necessary for allowing users and consumers of marked up and stored data to understand the XML tagging definitions designed by the creator of the document. Each schema file also referred to in the art as a Namespace or XSD file preferably includes a listing of all XML elements (tags) that may be applied to a document according to a given schema file. For example, a schema file , illustrated in , may be a schema file containing definitions of certain XML elements that may be applied to a document  including attributes of XML elements or limitations and\/or rules associated with text or data that may be annotated with XML elements according to the schema file. For example, referring to the schema file  illustrated in , the schema file is identified by the Namespace \u201cintro\u201d the schema file includes a root element of <intro card>.","According to the schema file , the <intro card> element serves as a root element for the schema file and also as a parent element to two child elements <title> and <body>. As is well known to those skilled in the art, a number of parent elements may be defined under a single root element, and a number of child elements may be defined under each parent element. Typically, however, a given schema file  contains only one root element. Referring still to , the schema file  also contains attributes  and  to the <title> and <body> elements, respectfully. The attributes  and  may provide further definition or rules associated with applying the respective elements to text or data in the document . For example, the attribute  defines that text annotated with the <title> element must be less than or equal to twenty-five characters in length. Accordingly, if text exceeding twenty-five characters in length is annotated with the <title> element or tag, the attempted annotation of that text will be invalid according to the definitions contained in the schema file .","By applying such definitions or rules as attributes to XML elements, the creator of the schema may dictate the structure of data contained in a document associated with a given schema file. For example, if the creator of a schema file  for defining XML markup applied to a resume document desires that the experience section of the resume document contain no more than four present or previous job entries, the creator of the schema file  may define an attribute of an <experience> element, for example, to allow that no more than four present or past job entries may be entered between the <experience> tags in order for the experience text to be valid according to the schema file . As is well known to those skilled in the art, the schema file  may be attached to or otherwise associated with a given document  for application of allowable XML markup defined in the attached schema file to the document . According to one embodiment, the document  marked up with XML elements of the attached or associated schema file  may point to the attached or associated schema file by pointing to a uniform resource identifier (URI) associated with a Namespace identifying the attached or associated schema file .","According to embodiments of the present invention, a document  may have a plurality of attached schema files. That is, a creator of the document  may associate or attach more than one schema file  to the document  in order to provide a framework for the annotation of XML markup from more than one schema file. For example, a document  may contain text or data associated with financial data. A creator of the document  may wish to associate XML schema files  containing XML markup and definitions associated with multiple financial institutions. Accordingly, the creator of the document  may associate an XML schema file  from one or more financial institutions with the document . Likewise, a given XML schema file  may be associated with a particular document structure such as a template for placing financial data into a desirable format.","According to embodiments of the present invention, a collection of XML schema files and associated document solutions may be maintained in a Namespace or schema library located separately from the document . The document  may in turn contain pointers to URIs in the Namespace or schema library associated with the one or more schema files attached to otherwise associated with the document . As the document  requires information from one or more associated schema files, the document  points to the Namespace or schema library to obtain the required schema definitions. For a detailed description of the use of an operation of Namespace or schema libraries, see U.S. patent application entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Providing Namespace Related Information,\u201d U.S. Ser. No. 10\/184,190, filed Jun. 27, 2002, and U.S. patent application entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Obtaining and Using Namespace Related Information for Opening XML Documents,\u201d U.S. Ser. No. 10\/185,940, filed Jun. 27, 2002, both U.S. patent applications of which are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set out herein. For a detailed description of a mechanism for downloading software components such as XML schema files and associated solutions from a Namespace or schema library, see U.S. patent application entitled Mechanism for Downloading Software Components from a Remote Source for Use by a Local Software Application, U.S. Ser. No. 10\/164,260, filed Jun. 5, 2002.","Referring still to , a schema validation functionality module  is illustrated for validating XML markup applied to a document  against an XML schema file  attached to or otherwise associated with the document , as described above. As described above, the schema file  sets out acceptable XML elements and associated attributes and defines rules for the valid annotation of the document  with XML markup from an associated schema file . For example, as shown in the schema file , two child elements <title> and <body> are defined under the root or parent element <intro card>. Attributes ,  defining the acceptable string length of text associated with the child elements <title> and <body> are also illustrated. As described above, if a user attempts to annotate the document  with XML markup from a schema file  attached to or associated with the document in violation of the XML markup definitions contained in the schema file , an invalidity or error state will be presented. For example, if the user attempts to enter a title string exceeding twenty-five characters, that text entry will violate the maximum character length attribute of the <title> element of the schema file . In order to validate XML markup applied to a document , against an associated schema file , a schema validation module  is utilized. As should be understood by those skilled in the art, the schema validation module  is a software module including computer executable instructions sufficient for comparing XML markup and associated text entered in to a document  against an associated or attached XML schema file  as the XML markup and associated text is entered in to the document .","According to embodiments of the present invention, the schema validation module  compares each XML markup element and associated text or data applied to the document  against the attached or associated schema file  to determine whether each element and associated text or data complies with the rules and definitions set out by the attached schema file . For example, if a user attempts to enter a character string exceeding twenty-five characters annotated by the <title> elements , the schema validation module will compare that text string against the text string attribute  of the attached schema file  and determine that the text string entered by the user exceeds the maximum allowable text string length. Accordingly, an error message or dialogue will be presented to the user to alert the user that the text string being entered by the user exceeds the maximum allowable character length according to the attached schema file . Likewise, if the user attempts to add an XML markup element between the <title> and the <body> elements, the schema validation module  will determine that the XML markup element applied by the user is not a valid element allowed between the <title> and <body> elements according to the attached schema file . Accordingly, the schema validation module  will generate an error message or dialogue to the user to alert the user of the invalid XML markup.","Context Free Document Text and Data Portions","As briefly described above, embodiments of the present invention provide methods and systems for inserting a portion of text or data into a document where the inserted portion of text or data carries with it its own specific formatting and style properties such as specified styles, fonts, list types, and the like.  is a block diagram illustrating interaction between a first document and a second document where a portion of text is copied or moved from the second document to the first document according to embodiments of the present invention.  is a block diagram illustrating interaction between a first document and a second document where a portion of text is copied or moved from the second document to the first document according to embodiments of the present invention. It should be understood that describing the present invention in terms of copying or moving a text portion from one document to another is by way example only. Apart from copying or moving text from one document to another, the self-describing properties of the text portion allow users and software applications who desire to or who are required to parse and manipulate a file to apply rich editing to portions of the file or document without having to parse the entire document to manage properties associated with the entire document or file.","Referring to , a document  and a document  are described for purposes of illustrating how a portion of text may be copied from the document  into the document  according to embodiments of the present invention. The first document  has a title  and two paragraphs  and . Also illustrated for the document  is an XML structure pane  showing Extensible Markup Language (XML) structure applied to the document . For example, a <title> element is applied to the title of the document , a <paragraph 1> element is applied to the first paragraph of the document  and a <paragraph 2> element is applied to the second paragraph of the document . The second document  includes a document  that has been similarly marked up with XML structure. An XML structure pane  is illustrated for the document .","According to embodiments of the present invention, a text or data portion from the second document may be copied or moved to the first document such that style and other formatting properties are carried with the text or data portion from the one document to another document. Accordingly, there is no need to resolve style or formatting properties associated with the text portion inserted into the first document against style or other formatting properties associated with the first document. For example, as shown in  the first document may have a header information properties element for referencing styles and other formatting properties associated with the first document. That is, the user or creator of the first document may have established a set of styles or formatting properties for the first document. According to prior art systems, as described above, if the user desires to copy the second paragraph  from the second document  into the first document , style or formatting information associated with the second paragraph  in the second document  may conflict with style or formatting information contained at the document level of the first document .","For example, the first document  may have a style called \u201cHeader \u201d causing a formatting of boldface and italics to be applied to the document . On the other hand, the creator of the second document  may have likewise used the style designator \u201cHeader \u201d for formatting the second paragraph  containing the second document to include boldfacing, but not italics. If the second paragraph  of the second document  is copied into the first document , the style applied to the second document will conflict with the style applied to the document in the first document . Therefore, the user of the first document  will be required to manually parse the header information properties element of the XML structure applied to the first document  in order to make changes to the styles applied to the inserted text or data in order to prevent a conflict of the two styles.","According to embodiments of the present invention, an XML schema is provided for applying style markup as specified text and data portions of a document such as the second paragraph  of the second document  so that particular styles or formatting applications to a given text or data portion are carried with the text or data portion to the first document. By applying an XML markup to a particular text or data selection, the first document need not de-conflict style or formatting properties applied to inserted text or data portions so long as the first document has access to the style or formatting markup applied to the inserted text or data portion.","Referring to , a text portion  and a text portion  are illustrated for inserting into the first document . According to embodiments of the present invention, each text portion  and  may be a sentence, a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, fragments of sentences or paragraphs, alphanumeric data, or any other native objects. As should be appreciated, the creator of the second document  marks up the second document with Extensible Markup Language data according to the context free text portion schema which defines XML elements, as described below, for specifying particular text or data portions which carries with them their own styles or other formatting properties. In effect, each of the text portions  and  become \u201cmini\u201d documents carrying their own style and formatting properties that may be inserted into a first document  and which may be treated separately from the main document  by an XML parsing application operating on the document .","It should be understood, a text or data portion such as the second paragraph  or either of the text portions ,  illustrated in , may be copied and pasted or cut and pasted from the second document into the first document according to conventional cut\/copy and pasting methods available from a variety of software applications. Alternatively, according to a variety of Extensible Markup Language parsing applications, the user may likewise insert a text or data portion from a second document into a first document by selecting an appropriate XML node from the XML structure pane  and copying that XML node into the XML structure of the first document. That is, by selecting the <paragraph > node  from the XML structure  of the second document  and by moving that node to the XML structure of the first document , the XML markup and associated text or data of the second paragraph  may be inserted into the first document along with its own style and other formatting properties as described herein.","To further illustrate the operation of embodiments of the present invention, the following XML structure is associated with a simple document having the following two paragraphs.","Para 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.","Para 2: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.","As can be seen in the following XML structure, a font of \u201cTimes New Roman\u201d and a style identification of \u201cDefault Paragraph Font\u201d is applied to the two paragraphs. The actual text of the two paragraphs is also illustrated in the following XML structure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<?xml

brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.","The following is an example XML structure showing the first two paragraphs of the document with the normal default style applied to them. According to this example, as shown in the following XML structure, the user inserts the third italicized paragraph into the document under a style called \u201cMy Style.\u201d Because the paragraph is being inserted in an environment outside of the native Word Processing application, the logic of checking that the \u201cMy Style\u201d style exists must be done manually. The XML file must be parsed to find the proper location of the style declarations, and then the style declarations must be parsed to guarantee that there is no conflict. Once this has been done, the \u201cMy Style\u201d declaration can be entered. Now that the \u201cMy Style\u201d declaration is entered, then the XML file must be parsed again to find the proper location for the paragraph itself. Since there was no conflict with the \u201cMy Style\u201d declaration, the paragraph being inserted can still reference the \u201cMy Style\u201d style.

described above, according to embodiments of the present invention, an XML schema is provided which provides an XML element that may be used to markup and describe a particular text or data portion of a document such that style or other formatting properties applied to that text or data portion are treated separately from the remaining style or formatting properties associated with a document into which the text or data portion is inserted. So long as the document into which the text or data portion is inserted is operated by an application that may understand the XML schema associated with the text or data portion inserted into the document, the XML element wrapping the inserted text or data portion will be understood.","Below is a sample XML structure showing the addition of the third italicized paragraph \u201cThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\u201d according to embodiments of the present invention. As shown in the following XML structure, the first two paragraphs are included in the document having style identification of \u201cTimes New Roman\u201d and \u201cDefault Paragraph Font.\u201d However, as shown in the following XML structure, the third paragraph being inserted into the document has been wrapped in an XML element called <cfChunk>. As should be appreciated, the element <cfChunk> is illustrative of an infinite number of names that could be provided to the element according to embodiments of the present invention by the creator of this particular XML structure. As should be understood, the element might similarly be called context free portion, cf portion, context free data, cfData, and the like. Inside the element <cfChunk> is contained the third paragraph \u201cThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\u201d having a style identification of \u201cMy Style\u201d and having a font identification of \u201citalics.\u201d","According to embodiments of the present invention, when the third paragraph \u201cThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\u201d is copied or moved from a second document into a first document, the text or data portion moved points to or references an XML schema file that provides an XML parsing application associated with the first document access to the grammatical and other definitional rules associated with XML elements according to the schema file including the <cfchunk> element utilized for wrapping a text or data portion and for carrying with the text or data portion its own individual styles or other formatting properties. Accordingly, when the first document's XML parsing application encounters the element <cfChunk> that application may refer to the associated XML schema to learn that the style and other formatting designations contained in the structure wrapped inside the <cfchunk> element is to be treated particularly for a text or data portion being inserted into the first document and being associated with the <cfchunk> element. Accordingly, when the third paragraph is inserted into the first document according to embodiments of the present invention, as illustrated in the following sample XML structure, the style and other formatting properties associated with that text portion are honored by the application receiving the inserted text or data portion without regard to potentially conflicting style or other formatting properties associated with the document into which the text portion is inserted. The application does the necessary work to resolve any conflicts, and to properly associate the style reference for the paragraph with the appropriate

described above, according to prior methods and systems, when a portion of data or content is added to a document having a different file format as the receiving document, the receiving document may not be able to process the incoming portion in a manner that the incoming portion is properly displayed with appropriate formatting properties including styles, fonts, and the like. Or, when the incoming portion is of a different formatting type as the receiving document, the receiving document may fail to load the incoming portion altogether. For example, if a portion of data formatted according to the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is copied to a document formatted according to the Extensible Markup Language (XML), the HTML portion may fail to load because the application responsible for processing and displaying the document may not understand what the incoming portion of content is. As described above with reference to , incoming portions of text or data may be wrapped in a <cfchunk> XML tag, and the XML annotation applied to the portion of text or data identifies formatting information such as styles, fonts and the like associated with the incoming portion of text or data so that a receiving XML-represented document may ascertain or resolve formatting properties to be applied to the incoming portion of text or data at the time the document is launched and the incoming portion of text or data integrated with (i.e., merged with, copied to, moved to, linked to ) the launched document.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, an XML <cfchunk> annotation is applied to an incoming portion of text, data or other content that provides self-describing properties to notify the receiving document and application as to alternative file format types associated with the incoming or referenced portion of text, data or other content to notify the receiving XML-represented document that the incoming portion is of a different file format type than is utilized for the receiving document.  is a simplified block diagram illustrating the insertion of context-free content portions having self-described alternative file formats into an XML-based document according to embodiments of the present invention. As illustrated in , an XML-represented document , for example, a word processing document, such as a memorandum or article, is illustrated. The XML document  is illustrated having a variety of XML structure applied to the document. For example, <heading> tags  are applied to the document for structuring heading information to be entered into the document. <Body> tags  are applied to the document for structuring text, data or other content to be inserted into the body of the document . As should be understood by those skilled in the art, the sample XML structure illustrated in  is not meant to represent well-formed XML tags and associated structure. The sample XML structure and information illustrated in  are for purposes of example only.","Referring still to , three <cfchunk> tags , ,  have been applied to the XML document  within the <body> tag . According to embodiments of the present invention, the <cfchunk> tags , ,  are utilized for annotating incoming portions of text, data or other content in a context-free manner to allow the incoming portions to be self-describing to the XML document . As described above with reference to , an application with which the XML document  is generated and\/or edited calls on an XML parsing application either integrated with the application in use or called upon by the application in use to parse the XML structure applied to the XML document .","According to embodiments of the present invention, when the XML parsing application parses the XML <cfChunk> tags , ,  associated with portions , , , respectively, the parsing application determines the specified file format types and formatting information applied to each incoming portion of content. For example, the first incoming portion  that is to be inserted into the body of the XML document  has been associated with a <cfChunk> tag and identifies the file format type of the incoming portion as HTML. A style type of \u201cstyle: 1\u201d is also identified. Accordingly, the application, for example, a word processing application, responsible for generating, editing and displaying the XML document , learns through parsing the XML structure applied to the document  that the inserted content portion  is formatted according to HTML and bears a formatting style of \u201cstyle: 1.\u201d Accordingly, the application in use for generating and\/or editing the XML-represented document  may process the incoming content portion  according to the file format type and style associated with the incoming portion. For example, with reference to the incoming portion , the receiving application will know that the incoming portion must be processed, read, and displayed according to the Hypertext Markup Language, or that the incoming portion must be transformed from the an HTML file format into another file format type suitable for processing by the receiving application. Similarly, the receiving application will know that the incoming portion should be displayed with formatting properties, for example, fonts, styles, etc. associated with the identified formatting property of \u201cstyle: 1.\u201d","As illustrated in , a second incoming content portion  is illustrated. The second incoming portion  is illustrated as having a file format type of rich text formatting (RTF) in a style identified as \u201cstyle: 4.\u201d As with the incoming portion , the information used for self-describing the incoming portion of content may be utilized by the receiving or consuming application for understanding the file format type associated with the incoming portion and for understanding any associated formatting properties applied to the incoming content. Similarly, a third incoming portion  is illustrated having an associated binary file format type and an associated style of \u201cstyle: 2.\u201d As with the other incoming content portions, the receiving or consuming application may utilize the identified file format type and other information such as the identified style properties for receiving and processing the incoming content portion.","According to this embodiment, the receiving or consuming application, for example, a word processing application, may utilize the incoming portions of content in view of the file format types associated with those portions. According to prior methods and systems, the incoming portions may fail to load by the receiving application, or even if the incoming portions successfully load by the receiving application, the associated text, data or other content may be processed incorrectly. For example, the incoming portion may be displayed in an unsatisfactory manner. Because the receiving application may ascertain the original file format type of the incoming content, the receiving application may take appropriate action such as transforming the incoming content, or such as calling on software programming necessary for understanding, consuming, and utilizing the incoming content. For example, if the incoming content is formatted according to HTML, the receiving application may either transform the incoming content prior to utilizing the content, or the receiving application may access code necessary for utilizing, for example, displaying, the incoming content. Accordingly, as the receiving application resolves associated formatting properties for the incoming content, as described above with reference to , according to embodiments of the present invention, the receiving application may also resolve alternative file format types associated with the incoming content.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a software application responsible for receiving or consuming the content portions described herein, for example, a word procession application, a spreadsheet application, a slide presentation application, a desktop publishing application and the like, may likewise create or generate the context free portions of data , ,  for use by other applications. When a portion of data is saved by such an application, or when a portion of data is copied for pasting to a document operated by another document, the application in use for generating the context free portion may apply a <cfChunk> annotation to the data, and the application may save properties to the portion of data for identifying a file format associated with the portion of data, as well as, other properties such as formatting (e.g., boldfacing, italics, font, etc.). For example, if the application generating the context free portion , ,  generates data according to an HTML format, then the context free portions of data generated for use by other applications may be annotated to identify HTML as the file format associated with the context free portion of data. When a consuming application receives the data, as described above, the consuming application may read and use the context free portion according to the associated file format and other formatting properties applied to the portion of data by the generating application.","Referring now to , and according to another embodiment of the present invention, a receiving document  and one or more incoming content portions , ,  may be contained in an electronic file container . For example, the file container  may be representative of a file format such as a .ZIP file format. According to embodiments, if the file container  is selected or opened, the XML receiving document  and each of the associated content portions , ,  may be identified and visually represented as separate files. According to this embodiment, each incoming content portion , ,  is not inserted or populated in line into a receiving document , as described above with reference to , but instead the receiving document  references a relationship file  which, in turn, points to the incoming content portions and provides information to the receiving document  and to an application responsible for processing the receiving document  for utilizing the incoming content portions.","As illustrated in , the XML document  is representative of a receiving document being generated by an author\/editor, and the content portions , ,  are representative of incoming content portions for merging with the receiving document . The receiving document  includes three content references , , . According to embodiments of the present invention, the file container  is linked to a relationship file , which contains a relationship tree  illustrating the relationship between the receiving document  and the incoming content portions which are to be merged with the receiving document  upon document load and\/or launch by the receiving document application, for example, a word processing application, a spreadsheet application, a slide presentation application, and the like.","Referring to the relationship file , each content reference identified in the XML document  points to an associated incoming content portion. According to embodiments of the present invention, when a software application responsible for operating the receiving document , for example, a word processing application, spreadsheet application, slide presentation application, and the like loads the receiving document , the document  is parsed by an associated parsing application, for example, an XML parser, for structure applied to the receiving document . When each reference , ,  is parsed, the receiving application references the relationship file  for determining what incoming or associated content portion is pointed to by the identified reference. For example, when the XML document  is parsed, the first reference  is found to point to a first content portion , which is a content portion having a file format type of HTML, for example. When the second reference  is parsed in the XML document , reference to the relationship file  determines that the second reference  points to a second incoming content portion  having a file format of RTF. Similarly, when the third reference  is parsed in the receiving document , a reference to the associated relationship file  shows that the third reference  points to a third incoming portion  having a binary file format type. Once all information such as file format types associated with referenced content is resolved, the receiving application may merge the pointed-to content portions with the receiving document for displaying a merged document.
