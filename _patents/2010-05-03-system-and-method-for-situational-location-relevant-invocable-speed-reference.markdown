title: System and method for situational location relevant invocable speed reference
abstract: Situational location dependent information is transmitted from a server data processing system to a receiving data processing system. The server data processing system communicates with the receiving data processing system in a manner by pushing content when appropriate. A candidate delivery event associated with a current positional attribute of the receiving data processing system is recognized and a situational location of the remote data processing system is determined. The candidate delivery event may be a location and/or direction change, device state change, or movement exceeding a movement tolerance. The situational location of the remote data processing system may be its location, direction, location and direction, proximity to a location, state change, or location and/or direction relative to a previous location and/or direction, or combinations thereof. A set of delivery content from a deliverable content database is transmitted from the server data processing system to the receiving data processing system according to the situational location of the receiving data processing system, and according to delivery constraints. The delivery content is configurable by authorized administrators on an instant activation basis for proactive delivery.

No. 6,456,234, issued Sep. 24, 2002.","The present invention relates generally to location dependent delivery of information to mobile data processing systems, and more particularly to a system for pushing situational location dependent content to data processing system devices traveling to locations for, or in directions of, that place which delivery content is designated as deliverable.","The boom of the internet has greatly provided information to mobile users through wireless web server connected devices such as laptops, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and telephones. People with an internet enabled device can access yahoo.com (yahoo is a trademark of Yahoo corporation) and other internet connected resources. There are also Global Positioning System (GPS) devices that enable mobile users to know exactly where they are on a particular map. Users with GPS device functionality can further manually enter their known location into an internet MAP directory service (e.g. yahoo.com Maps) and then provide a target address they want to go to. Step by step instructions are then provided to the user for how to get to the destination from the current location. Some GPS devices provide local processing for directing, and narrating to, a driver. Mating automated location finding systems with internet travel direction services is an attractive blend.","Cadillac recently announced the OnStar program with sales of Cadillac automobiles (Cadillac and OnStar are trademarks of General Motors corporation). A person is enabled with calling upon an \u201cOnStar Advisor\u201d 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, with the press of a button. An emergency call, for example 911, or for a disabled Cadillac vehicle, allows a driver to instantly call upon wireless connected assistance. The driver may also call upon the OnStar Advisor for directions to a destination. The Advisor has access to automatic processing for determination of the vehicle's current location in case of auto theft, a disabled vehicle, or assisting with directions. The Advisor can also remotely unlock the vehicle should the driver lock the keys in the car. In effect, Cadillac drivers have full time wireless connected assistance around the clock for many reasons. While the location determination of the vehicle is automatic, there remain manual processes performed by the Advisor. Automation of some of these processes is desirable.","Many internet services derive their revenue stream from advertising. Advertisers pay to have their content delivered to users who access web site and web server interfaces. Advertisers desire to target their audience at the most appropriate time. Knowing the location of a user as being relevant to a particular advertisement is desirable. Automating the delivery of the content is desirable.","A method is needed for a low cost business model that enables the efficient configuration of deliverable content for automatic delivery to mobile users based on their situational location that is relevant to receive such content.","The present invention provides transmission of situational location dependent information from a server data processing system (SDPS) to a receiving data processing system (RDPS). The server data processing system (SDPS) communicates with the receiving data processing system (RDPS) by pushing content (i.e. proactive content delivery) when appropriate, rather than in response to a user query. A candidate delivery event associated with a current positional attribute of the receiving data processing system is recognized and a situational location of the remote data processing system is determined. The candidate delivery event may be a location and\/or direction change, device state change, or movement exceeding a movement tolerance. The situational location of the remote data processing system may be its location, direction, location and direction, proximity to a location, state change, or location and\/or direction relative to a previous location and\/or direction, or combinations thereof. At the SDPS, a set of delivery content from a deliverable content database is retrieved according to the situational location of the RDPS, and according to system delivery constraints and\/or configured user delivery constraints. The SDPS transmits any applicable content found to the RDPS. The delivery content is configurable by authorized administrators in a manner that enables the configured content for immediate delivery should a RDPS meet the criteria of the associated situational location and delivery constraints.","Various embodiments with respect to recognizing a candidate delivery event and determining a situational location include:\n\n","A situational location is completely determined for the RDPS upon the candidate delivery event. Content that can be delivered is fully configurable, of any type, and can be instantly activated for candidate delivery upon convenient administration. As well known in the art of software installation, the present invention may be installed to a variety of network embodiments and underlying operating systems through installation parameters, or as distinct installations for the particular platform. Preferably, an internet connection is used for configuring deliverable content, and for the interoperation of communications between the RDPS and SDPS.","The present invention enables a user of a RDPS to be made aware of content that is applicable for the current situational location of the user. Depending on the application of the present invention, the content and configurations will take on a variety of themes.","For example, in an outdoor wireless embodiment of the present invention, advertisement content can be configured by paying customer advertisers through an internet web interface, and then automatically delivered to people when the people are in a location, or heading path to a location, for reasonable delivery of the content to their automobile installed, or handheld, RDPS. For example, as a driver or pedestrian (i.e. user) approaches a retail store with a mobile RDPS, a configured advertisement of a special deal at the retail store can be proactively delivered (i.e. pushed) to the user automatically on behalf of the store. Likewise, an indoor wireless embodiment of the present invention enables the driver or pedestrian, now a shopper inside the store, to receive configured content to a shopping cart mounted, or handheld, RDPS directing the shopper to specific sales items as the shopper moves about the inside of the store.","In another application, a policeman may activate a mobile police automobile device (i.e. RDPS) in a police car for automatic delivery of a person's criminal record as the policeman drives by the location of a person's house. The police establishment configures criminal record content, or pointers thereto, along with the location of the residence that is believed to harbor the person with a record. As the policeman drives by locations with addresses of known offenders, the RDPS displays applicable criminal data. Of course, the policeman can enable or disable the functionality as needed.","In another application, a traveling vehicle, for example a touring bus, carries tourists for a narrated drive through a geographic area. Currently, there are human narrators for providing narration of sites and landmarks to people of the narrated drive. The present invention allows configuring deliverable content for locations on the touring bus path so that an automated narrator RDPS installed in the bus can be provided to people on the bus. For example, an RDPS providing audio, video, multimedia, or combination thereof, communicates narration content to people on the touring bus automatically as locations are encountered, or driven by.","In another application, a person attending a large park (e.g. Disney World (Disney World is a trademark of Walt Disney corporation)) could simply carry a RDPS, and receive content to a handheld device for what attraction lies ahead based on the current location and direction of the person. The person would not have to consult a directory or ask where to find something. Informative content would be proactively delivered, rather than reactively in response to a person's manual query to a service, or question to a human being.","In yet a further example, a valuable use would be for emergencies such as when a child is kidnapped. Currently, there is an Amber-Alert mechanism in Dallas\/Ft. Worth, Texas where radio stations broadcast an emergency message along with a distinguishable series of tones. This enables any pertinent information known about the kidnapper and child to be broadcast immediately to everyone with the radio on. The present invention enables the emergency broadcast to be immediately configured and then communicated to everyone with a RDPS, for example with a wireless internet connection. A picture of the victim and other multimedia information could be delivered along with audio immediately.","In still a further use of the present invention, garage sale and estate sale advertisements could be configured on behalf of paying customers that would otherwise use a newspaper classified section. As drivers become in reasonably close proximity to the sale, in the desired time window, advertisement content would be proactively delivered to a wireless RDPS installed, or handheld, in the automobile.","Thus, there are many applications for the present invention, all accomplished through simply changing the way the present invention is used. Content is pushed out to receiving devices at the most appropriate times. Users do not pull the content with a query.","It is therefore an advantage of the present invention in supporting a variety of applications and uses. The way the invention is used makes it applicable to a wide range of applications. For example, a deliverable content database can be configured with content that is appropriate for the particular application. Situational location parameters associated with the particular application are also variable, provided the installed methodology is utilized consistently. For example, world coordinates, GPS coordinates, regional coordinates, MAPSCO references, Application Address Book locations and directions, a user's caller id, a cell number in a cellular network, and like means used to describe a location can be used. Directional information of North, South, East, West, Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, Southwest, Up, Down, Left, Right, Straight, Back, and like methods used to describe a direction can be used. Further still, there are delivery constraints that can be set up for a system, or configured by a user, which provides flexibility in adapting to a variety of applications.","It is another advantage of the present invention in providing deliverable content to a person, based on the situational location of the person. Content is pushed to a user's RDPS when it is most appropriate for the user to see the content.","It is another advantage of the present invention in automatically recognizing a candidate delivery event of a RDPS and automatically determining a situational location of the RDPS. A user is not burdened with providing information on a query. The present invention automatically determines when content should be delivered and then automatically and proactively delivers it. Content is pushed to the user (of the RDPS). The user is not burdened with pulling content via a query.","It is a further advantage of the present invention to deliver any type, variety, or combination of content. The content is fully configurable by an authorized administrator who may be a paying customer for the privilege of performing configurations. Upon configuration, the content is immediately and instantly activated for proactive delivery to any RDPS meeting the configured criteria. Content may be audio, video, graphical, textual, multimedia, intranet\/internet web address(es) activated for transposable selection, image, or any combination thereof.","It is another advantage in maintaining a history of delivered content at the RDPS with information that is useful for later browsing. Contained therein is information relevant to the delivered content. Additionally, provided is an invocable speed address enabling the user to transpose to a web address, or perform a speed dial phone call, that is associated with the delivered content.","Yet another advantage of the present invention is providing new and useful query functionality for querying the total number of known receiving data processing systems for a particular situational location, querying any content configured for delivery to a particular situational location with a comprehensive variety of query parameters, and querying up to a maximum threshold number of deliverable content instances for a particular location in a manner which automatically determines containing (ascending) locations, if necessary, until the specified number is met.","Further features and advantages of the invention, as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments of the invention, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, like reference numbers generally indicate identical, functionally similar, and\/or structurally similar elements. The drawing in which an element first appears is indicated by the leftmost digit(s) in the corresponding reference number.","With reference now to detail of the drawings, the present invention is described. Obvious errorhandling is omitted from the flowcharts in order to focus on the key aspects of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","104","102","106","108","108","106","108","106","110","110","112","112","114","112","114","112","114","114","116","118","110","120","122","124","120","124","110","126","128","130","132","132"],"i":["b","e","a ","d"]},"In another embodiment of the present invention, GPS satellites such as satellite , satellite , and satellite  provide information, as is well known in the art, to GPS devices on earth for triangulation locating of the GPS device. In this embodiment, a RDPS has integrated GPS functionality so that the RDPS monitors its positional attribute(s). When the RDPS determines a candidate delivery event, it communicates parameters to the controller by way of the nearest base station. Thus, positional attribute information is provided by the RDPS to the SDPS. The RDPS is again known by a unique identifier, for example a caller id, device identifier, or like appropriate unique handle.","In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a physically connected device, for example, telephone , computer , PDA , telephone , and fax machine , may be newly connected to a network. Each is a RDPS. Physical connections include copper wire, optical fiber, or the like. Devices are known by a unique identifier, for example a caller id, device identifier, physical or logical network address, or like appropriate unique handle. When the RDPS is detected for being newly located, the SDPS determines the candidate delivery event. The SDPS may execute at an Automatic Response Unit (ARU) , a telephony switch, for example telephony switch , a web server  (for example, connected through a gateway ), or a like data processing system that communicates with the RDPS. RDPS detection may be a result of the RDPS initiating a communication with the SDPS directly or indirectly. Thus, a user may connect his laptop to a hotel network, initiate a communication with the SDPS, and the SDPS determines that the user is in a different location than the previous communication. A local area network (LAN)  may contain a variety of connected devices, each an RDPS that later becomes connected to a local area network  at a different location, such as a PDA , a server computer , a printer , an internet protocol telephone , a computer , or the like. Hard copy presentation could be made to printer  and fax . Electronic content could be delivered to any RDPS.","Current technology enables devices to communicate with each other, and other systems, through a variety of heterogeneous system and communication methods. Current technology allows executable processing to run on diverse devices and systems. Current technology allows communications between the devices and\/or systems over a plethora of methodologies at close or long distance. Many technologies also exist for automatic locating of devices. It is well known how to have an interoperating communications system that comprises a plurality of individual systems communicating with each other with one or more protocols. As is further known in the art of developing software, executable processing of the present invention may be developed to run on a particular target data processing system in a particular manner, or customized at install time to execute on a particular data processing system in a particular manner.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","204","206","208","204","206","208"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["302","108","108","108"],"i":["b, ","d, ","f, "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["310","312"]},"TDOA is conventionally calculated from the time it takes for a communication to occur from the RDPS back to the RDPS via the base tower, or alternatively, from a base tower back to that base tower via the RDPS. AOA is conventionally performed through calculations of the angle by which a signal from the RDPS encounters the base tower antenna. Simple triangle geometry is then used to calculate a location. The AOA antenna is typically of a phased array type.","The controller at block  may communicate with other controllers when base stations in other cellular clusters are picking up a signal, for example, when the RDPS roams. In any case, at block , the controller(s) determines the strongest signal base stations needed for locating the RDPS, at block . The strongest  (or 2 or 4 as discussed above) are used. Thereafter, block  accesses base station location information for base stations determined at block . The base station provides location anchors used to (relatively) determine the location of the RDPS. Then, block  uses the TDOA, or AOA, information together with known base station locations to calculate the RDPS location. Blocks  through  are well known to those skilled in art. Thereafter, block  accesses historical RDPS location information, and block  performs housekeeping by pruning location history data for the RDPS by time, number of entries, or other criteria. Block  then determines a direction of the RDPS based on previous location information. Block  may perform Artificial Intelligence (AI) to determine where the traveler may be going by consulting many or all of the location history data. Block  may also consider when and\/or where a candidate delivery event (CADE) was generated for a direction change in order to cause certain flow from block . Block  calculates how much (e.g. distance) the RDPS has moved since the previous location that caused a candidate delivery event (CADE) generation for the RDPS (event generated Y\/N field in location history data). Thereafter, block  compares the movement since the last CADE generation, and if the distance exceeds a movement tolerance, then block  posts (generates) a CADE to a present invention service handling RDPS situational location changes. The movement tolerance may be a system wide setting for all RDPS devices, particular to a type of RDPS, or specific for an RDPS.","If, at block , movement did not exceed the tolerance, then block  checks for a direction change as determined at block . If, at block , the direction did change, then a CADE is generated at block . If, at block , the direction of the RDPS did not change, then block  appends an appropriate entry to the location history data (see ). Block  also flows to block . Blocks  through  determine if a CADE is to be generated, and if so, a CADE is generated at block . Blocks  through  determine part, or all, (i.e. a subset) of the situational location, depending on the installation.  processing is continuous for every RDPS in the wireless network 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 3C","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3C"],"b":["350","352","354","356","358","358","350","358"]},"Thereafter, block  accesses historical RDPS location information, and block  performs housekeeping by pruning the location history data for the RDPS by time, number of entries, or other criteria.

If block  determines content applies, then processing stops at block .","If block  determines that the event was not a CADE, then processing continues to block  by way of off page connector . If block  determines that the event is for a situational location query, then block  searches deliverable content database records  with parameters from the RDPS: positional attribute parameters from the RDPS with the location field  and direction field , time criteria with time criteria field , and so on. All fields associated to record  are searchable through parameters. Block  also applies location hierarchy data depending on a zoom specification parameter. The zoom specification allows control over the block  search algorithm for whether or not to use hierarchy data, and whether or not to check descending locations, ascending locations up to a maximum threshold parameter of content, both descending and ascending (respectively) up to a threshold of content, or neither ascending nor descending hierarchy data functionality. The maximum threshold parameter may be specified regardless, and optionally limits the amount of content to deliver to the RDPS by size, number of content instances, or number of hierarchical data record nestings to search. Further still block  may use field  as described above, or the user's interest and\/or filters as described above. Information for records found is transmitted as content to the RDPS at block  (see ) and processing stops at block .","If block  determines that the event was not a situational location query, then processing continues to block . If block  determines that the request is a client count query request, then block  retrieves the known number of RDPS devices at the specified situational location (e.g. location\/direction) given specified time criteria; the number of location history data records  for unique values in rec id field  that contain a date\/time stamp  according to the user's specified time criteria. A null time criteria parameter implies use the current time of processing the request with a truncated precision for a time window. Otherwise, a specified time window was entered by the user, or automatically inserted as a parameter by the RDPS or SDPS. Presence of the content specification parameter implies to additionally retrieve content from the deliverable content database as described by blocks  through . This allows providing information (e.g. graphical) to complement presentation of the total number of RDPS devices identified. Processing then continues to block  for transmitting the count as content.","If block  determines that the event was not a client count query request, then processing continues to block  where any other SDPS event (request) is processed as is appropriate for the particular service application, and processing stops at block .  depicts a flowchart for describing the content transmission aspects.  describes processing of blocks , , and .","In any of the embodiments described above, a performance conscious implementation of the present invention including a cache may be pursued given the RDPS has appropriate capability. Without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, deliverable content database records , and joined data from them, may be stored at an RDPS. The SDPS may transmit a compression of the data to the RDPS for decompression and local maintaining Transmission may be at registration and\/or performed asynchronously to the RDPS as necessary. Thus, the deliverable content database, and joined data from it, will be accessed locally to the RDPS to prevent real-time communication of what could be large amounts of content.  processing would include updating any RDPS with a local cache when configuration was complete.","While various embodiments of the present invention have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation. Thus, the breadth and scope of the present invention should not be limited by any of the above-described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 7A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 9A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 9B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 9C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 9D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 10A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 10B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 10C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIGS. 12A and 12B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIGS. 15A","b":["15","15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIGS. 18A and 18B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIGS. 20A","b":["20","20"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
