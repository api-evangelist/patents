In particular, the present invention relates to a decision control of a frequency channel to be allocated to a cell.","As one of technologies to increase the communication speed of mobile stations located at cell edges, DC-HSDPA using existing HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access) has been examined in 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project). DC-HSDPA uses two frequency channels (each of which is 5 MHz) contained in the same frequency band in order to increase the downlink speed. The general idea of DC-HSDPA, which has been currently examined in 3GPP, is explained hereinafter. Note that the details of DC-HSDPA technique, which has been currently proposed, are explained in Non-patent literatures 1 to 3 mentioned below.","In DC-HSDPA, a second serving HS-DSCH cell is referred to as \u201csecondary-serving HS-DSCH cell\u201d. Meanwhile, a first serving HS-DSCH cell is simply referred to as \u201cserving HS-DSCH cell\u201d. A secondary-serving HS-DSCH cell is dependently formed on condition that a serving HS-DSCH cell is already generated. Note that the serving HS-DSCH cell may be also referred to as \u201cprimary carrier\u201d or \u201cbase carrier\u201d. Meanwhile, the secondary-serving HS-DSCH cell may be also referred to as \u201csecondary carrier\u201d or \u201cextended carrier\u201d.","In this specification, in order to clearly distinguish between these two serving HS-DSCH cells, the first serving HS-DSCH cell is referred to as \u201cprimary-serving HS-DSCH cell\u201d. Further, in the following explanation, the primary-serving HS-DSCH cell and the secondary-serving HS-DSCH cell may be also referred as simply \u201cprimary cell\u201d and \u201csecondary cell\u201d respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":["91","92","92","91"]},"P-CPICH: Primary Common Pilot Channel","DPCH: Dedicated Physical Channel","HS-DPCCH: Dedicated Physical Control Channel (uplink) for HS-DSCH","HS-DSCH: High Speed Downlink Shared Channel","HS-PDSCH: High Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel","HS-SCCH: Shared Control Channel for HS-DSCH","P-CCPCH: Primary Common Control Physical Channel","S-CCPCH: Secondary Common Control Physical Channel","SCH: Synchronisation Channel","When two serving HS-DSCH cells are established in a base station supporting DC-HSDPA, the activation and deactivation of the secondary cell are controlled by the base station. A command (HS-SCCH Order) that is used by the base station to instruct a mobile station (UE) on the activation and deactivation of the secondary cell is transmitted to the mobile station by using HS-SCCH, which is a downlink control channel. Further, the activation and deactivation of the secondary cell may be also changed by transmitting an RRC message from the base station or a radio network controller (RNC) to the mobile station. The details of the message structure and the like of the RRC message are explained in 3GPP TS 25.331 V8.4.0 (2008-09) \u201cRadio Resource Control (RRC)\u201d.","Meanwhile, as the indoor voice communication and data transmission have grown in demand owing to the widespread use of mobile phones, the development of compact base stations that can be installed in user's houses, offices, and the likes has been under way. These compact base stations are installed in houses, small-scale offices, and the likes by the owners of the compact base stations, for example, and are connected to an upper layer apparatus on core-network sides by using ADSLs (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Lines) and fiber-optic lines. In 3GPP, the standardization task has been under way while defining these compact base stations as \u201cHome NodeB\u201d and \u201cHome eNodeB\u201d (for example, see Non-patent literature 4). Note that \u201cHome NodeB\u201d is a compact base station for use in UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System), while the \u201cHome eNodeB\u201d is a compact base station for use in LTE (Long Term Evolution). In this specification, these compact base stations are referred to as \u201chome base stations\u201d, and cells generated by these home base stations are referred to as \u201chome cells\u201d.","In base stations used in existing mobile communication networks (cellular communication networks), radio resources to be used in communications between the base stations and mobile stations are determined in advance. In contrast to this, as for the home base stations, a technique to make a home base station autonomously select a radio resource has been examined. Note that the radio resources mean frequency channels in FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access) systems, whereas they mean spreading codes in CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) systems. In the case of 3GPP UMTS (W-CDMA: Wideband-CDMA), the radio resources mean frequency channels and scrambling codes. Further, in the case of 3GPP LTE in which SC-FDMA (Single Carrier FDMA) is used for the uplink and OFDMA (Orthogonal FDMA) is used for the downlink, the radio resources means physical resource blocks. The physical resource block is the fundament unit of the radio resources used for downlink data transmission from a base station to a mobile station, and includes a plurality of OFDM subcarriers in the frequency domain and at least one symbol time in the time domain.","Patent literature 1 discloses a home base station that receives a permission list including a plurality of radio resource (specifically, frequency channel and scrambling code) candidates from an administration system to which the home base station is connected through an xDSL line, a fiber-optic line, or the like, and measures a received signal strength and a CIR (Carrier to Interference Ratio) of a radio signal for each of the radio resource candidates included in the permission list. Further, the home base station disclosed in Patent literature 1 autonomously select a radio resource candidate having the lowest received signal strength and uses the selected radio resource for communication with a mobile station. The reason why the radio resource candidate having the lowest received signal strength is selected is that, by doing so, the interference with cells formed by nearby base stations is believed to be minimized. Further, the home base station disclosed in Patent literature 1 determines the initial transmission power using the selected radio resource based on the previously-measured received signal strength and CIR. Specifically, the initial transmission power is determined with consideration given to the interference level from the nearby base stations so that satisfactory communication service can be provided in a desired communication range (e.g., within 20 m).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":"Patent literature 1: U.K. Patent Application Publication NO.

When DC-HSDPA is applied to a home base station, the priority of communication service provided by a secondary cell is believed to be low compared to the communication service provided by the primary cell or nearby cells. A downlink signal transmitted on a secondary cell by the home base station becomes an interfering wave to downlink signals that are transmitted from nearby base stations and received by mobile stations connecting to the nearby cells. Therefore, when occurrence of interference to nearby cells caused by the secondary cell is expected, it is desirable to use a frequency channel different from the frequency channels used in the nearby cells for the secondary cell.","However, whether a mobile stations connecting to a nearby cell can tolerate interference from the secondary cell or not changes according to the load status of this nearby cell. Examples of the situation where the load of nearby cell is large include a situation where a lot of mobile stations connect to the nearby cell, a situation where high-speed communication service (such as HSDPA) having a low spreading ratio is provided, and a situation where the level of an interfering wave from other closely-located cells or other radio systems is large. In such situations, the mobile stations connecting to the nearby cell are already exposed to large interference and\/or have a small tolerance to interference. Therefore, the communication quality of mobile stations connecting to the nearby cell could deteriorate due to additional interference caused by the secondary cell.","Note that Patent literature 1 discloses only that the home base station determines a radio resource (frequency channel and scrambling code) based on the received power of a signal wirelessly transmitted from a nearby base station and determines its own transmission power based on the CIR of the signal wirelessly transmitted from a nearby cell. That is, Patent literature 1 does not disclose anything about the determination of a frequency channel to be allocated to a secondary cell of DC-HSDPA that is performed based on the load status of a nearby cell.","The present invention has been made based on the above-described consideration, and an object thereof is to suppress the interference to a nearby cell caused by a base station that performs data transmission to a mobile station by using a first cell and a second cell that is dependently formed under condition of the formation of the first cell by using a frequency channel different from that of the first cell like DC-HSDPA.","A base station apparatus in accordance with a first aspect of the present invention includes a radio communication unit and a control unit.

Further, the first base station determines a frequency channel available to the second cell based on a load status of the nearby cell.","A program in accordance with a fourth aspect of the present invention is a program that causes a computer to perform control processing of a base station apparatus. The base station apparatus is capable of forming a first cell and a second cell that is dependently formed under condition of the formation of the first cell by using a frequency channel different from that of the first cell, and transmitting a physical channel for data transmission in each of the first and second cells.
