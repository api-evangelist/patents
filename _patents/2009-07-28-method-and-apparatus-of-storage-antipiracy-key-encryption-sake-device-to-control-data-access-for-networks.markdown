{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to the field of network communications. More specifically, the present invention relates to a secured access to restricted information over networks.","The piracy and illegal copying of software and other digital media has become extremely pervasive and currently results in billions of dollars in lost revenue for media and software owners worldwide. This problem is compounded by the advent of faster and more technologically advanced computers, the development of inexpensive mass storage media (i.e. CDs, DVDs), as well as copying devices such as CD writers, which aid in various aspects of digital piracy.","Each technological breakthrough seemingly results in a new and better way to illegally copy intellectual property belonging to another. Examples of digital piracy include: the copying of proprietary software to sell to others, the installing of a single proprietary software package on several different systems, placing a copy of proprietary software on the Internet, or even downloading copyrighted images from the Internet.","While digital piracy is fairly common among many end users who have lawfully purchased the software, large-scale piracy typically occurs at a reseller level. For instance, a reseller may duplicate and distribute multiple copies of a software program, a digital audio file or a digital video file to different customers. These counterfeit versions are sometimes passed on to unsuspecting customers. Hardware distributors have been known to preload different systems using a single software package. In such instances, customers are either not provided with original manuals, diskettes and\/or compact discs (CDs) or are simply supplied with pirated copies of the same.","Numerous methods to combat the rampant problem of digital piracy have been devised. One of the methods is the use of trialware to restrict usage of a software product. Trialware may be implemented by either programming an expiration date or a usage counter into a software program. Such a scheme limits the use of a software product to a particular duration or a number of trial times, respectively, after which the protected application can no longer be launched. Users are then forced to either purchase the full version of the product or to quit using it altogether.","Hardware keys are another type of anti-piracy device that is commonly used to prevent illegal use of software. Hardware keys are devices that are plugged into selected ports of a computer. Once the software is executed, it then detects the presence of a hardware key in a similar manner to detecting other hardware devices (such as a printer, monitor or a mouse). Programming the software such that it only operates when an appropriate hardware key is attached prevents illegal use of the software. As the number of hardware keys distributed to end users correspond to the number of seat licenses purchased, the software will not work when installed on another system without the requisite hardware key.","Another common anti-piracy technique is to require the entry of a certain registration key that is supplied by the software company before the software can be installed. Traditionally, the registration keys are given only with the original software package, although some are issued electronically. Unfortunately, there is nothing to prevent the holder of the registration key from installing the software on multiple systems. In addition, many of the electronic registration keys are based on the user's personal information (i.e. such as the user's name), therefore, some hackers have developed programs to calculate registration keys for random names.","Unfortunately, as with the use of the registration key, all of the above anti-piracy systems (and many others) are easily circumvented by hackers. A common method of combating these anti-piracy techniques is to disassemble the coding of the Application Programming Interface (API) to assembly language and, thereafter, decompile the assembly language into programming language. With the knowledge gained from the program flow, the hacker can easily re-write the program or set certain conditions within the program itself, such that it bypasses all the anti-piracy authentication algorithms.","In view of the foregoing, it is extremely desirable to have an anti-piracy system that cannot be easily re-programmed or bypassed by computer hackers or other digital pirates. It is also desirable to have an anti-piracy system that can be integrated with existing mass storage devices.","According to one aspect of the present invention, a method of storage anti-piracy key encryption (\u201cSAKE\u201d) is provided in which a SAKE device is coupled to a host or client system and the SAKE device obtains user's biometric identity information through its biometric sensor. User's biometric identity information, such as fingerprints, is verified according to the biometric templates stored in an internal memory unit of the SAKE device. Various initialization information including a public key associated with the user is retrieved from the internal memory unit of the SAKE device and the initialization information is provided to an information provider or Internet Service Provider (\u201cISP\u201d) via a computer network such as the Internet, through the host system. Upon verifying the initialization information, a network communication is established between the SAKE device and the information provider. When the SAKE device obtains information from the information provider, the information is encrypted and stored in a flash memory within the SAKE device.","Additional features and benefits of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description, figures, and claims set forth below.","An apparatus and method for providing data access control over the Internet are discussed.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that these specific details may not be required to practice the present invention. In other instances, well-known circuits and devices are shown in block diagram form to avoid obscuring the present invention.","It is understood that the present invention may contain transistor circuits that are readily manufacturable using well-known art, such as for example CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) technology, or other semiconductor manufacturing processes. In addition, the present invention may be implemented with other manufacturing processes for making digital devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","10","16","18","20","20","14","16","18","22","20","14"]},"In other embodiments of the present invention, ROM unit  may be formed as part of microcontroller . Furthermore, both first storage unit  and second storage unit  may be one of a number of mass storage devices, including hard drives, floppy disks, or removable flash memory devices, such as the ThumbDrive\u2122 manufactured by Trek 2000. In addition, the two storage units may be utilized in one physical structure to form a single mass storage device. The mass storage device may also be placed with microcontroller  to form a single chip.","First storage unit  stores an authentication sequence , which is used to verify password . An authentication algorithm  to authenticate password  with authentication sequence  is programmed onto ROM unit . In addition, ROM unit  preferably comprises a shutdown algorithm . Because these algorithms and other data are hard coded, the contents of ROM unit  cannot be decompiled or altered. Upon receiving password , microcontroller  loads and executes authentication algorithm  to verify password  with authentication sequence . Access to second storage unit  is permitted only if password  is verified.","Password  may be entered by a user or a software program executed by host  after receiving a query from microcontroller . Because authentication algorithm  is hard coded onto ROM unit , copying or decompiling and changing the software program resident on host  does not breach the copy protection provided by the present invention. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that password  may be a private string of characters, a sequence of communication protocols or some other security protocol known only to an authorized user. In addition, password  and authentication sequence  may form part of a biometric authentication process by using a user's fingerprints, iris, face, or voice as authentication means.","Password  may also be programmed into the software running on host  and recognizable only by authentication algorithm  and therefore not known to an end user. As described above, authentication algorithm  is preferably implemented on hardware or firmware (such as ROM unit ) so that it is tamper resistant; that is, authentication algorithm  will be either extremely difficult to reverse engineer or extract data from, and therefore extremely difficult to bypass.","Shutdown algorithm  is preferably implemented as a deterrent against brute force attacks by shutting down the entire system if a series of incorrect passwords is received by microcontroller . An authentication system programmer may define the maximum number of incorrect passwords allowed before the system shuts down. Shutdown algorithm  may also be programmed to not accept any more password entries for a specified amount of time. By using shutdown algorithm , trial and error methods used by brute force application programs to identify password  would become an extremely tedious process for hackers. Shutdown algorithm  would therefore deter potential hackers from even attempting to identify password .","Second storage unit  is used to store programs and\/or files, which are required for a program on host  to run. Examples of such files include executable programs such as a software installer, digital audio files, digital video files, image files, text files, and library files. Microcontroller  allows access to second storage unit  from host  only if the correct password  has been received by microcontroller .","Although illustrated in this embodiment as separate entities, it should be evident to a person skilled in the art that microcontroller , first storage unit , ROM unit  and second storage unit  may be combined in a number of ways. For example, microcontroller , first storage unit , ROM unit  and second storage unit  may be implemented on a single semiconductor chip. In an alternative embodiment, microcontroller  and ROM unit  may be implemented on a chip that is separate from the storage units.","The present invention therefore has great flexibility of design that may easily be altered depending on a user's requirements. For example, on one hand, the use of multiple chips may allow different vendors to manufacture different parts of the authentication system. On the other hand, fabricating the present invention onto fewer chips (or a single chip) may be less expensive and provide better performance. In addition, if ROM unit  and microcontroller  are located on the same chip, it may be more difficult to separate the ROM to read the data stored.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["50","52","54","50","56","58","60","60","54","56","58","62","62","64","56","66","52","68","52","58","58","70"]},"Upon receiving password , microcontroller  loads and executes authentication algorithm  to verify password  with authentication sequence . Access to second storage unit  is permitted only if password  is verified. Shutdown algorithm  preferably shuts down the entire system if a series of wrong passwords is received by microcontroller . An authentication system programmer determines the maximum number of incorrect password attempts allowed.","Data to be read from or written onto second storage unit  is first decrypted or encrypted respectively by encoder . Many different encryption schemes may be used by encoder , including International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), Data Encryption Standard (DES) encryption, Triple Data Encryption Standard (3-DES) encryption, and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). By encrypting the contents of second storage unit , a hacker will not be able to make sense of the contents even if he manages to read the contents by bypassing microcontroller  (for example, by using a probe). After password  has been authenticated, a decoder (not illustrated) may be used to decrypt the contents of second storage unit .","Alternatively, the data stored in second storage unit  may be protected by hash coding. In addition, authentication sequence  is preferably encrypted or hashed as well to prevent hackers from unraveling authentication sequence . This may be accomplished without requiring an additional encoder if first storage unit  is located within second storage unit .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["100","102","104","100","106","108","108","104","106","110","110","112","114","102","106","116","102","114","106","118"]},"As described in previous embodiments, upon receiving password , microcontroller  loads and executes authentication algorithm  to verify password  with authentication sequence . Access to storage unit  is permitted only if password  is verified. Shutdown algorithm  is preferably used to shut down the entire system if a series of incorrect passwords is received by microcontroller .","By hard coding authentication sequence  directly into authentication algorithm , possibly in multiple places, modification of authentication sequence  becomes substantially more difficult. In order to change a hard coded authentication sequence, not only is recompilation necessary (if using a compiled language), but also sufficient understanding of the implementation is required to ensure that the change will not cause program failure. Such a measure makes it difficult for a hacker to re-program authentication system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["150","152","154","150","156","158","158","154","156","160","160","162","162","160","162"]},"Storage unit  is made up of two types of data storage areas: a public storage area  and a private storage area . An authentication sequence , which is used to verify password , is stored in private storage area . An authentication algorithm  to authenticate password  is programmed onto ROM unit . ROM unit  also contains a shutdown algorithm . Public storage area  and private storage area  may be created by under-declaring the memory size available on storage unit .","Take for example a storage unit with physical addresses ranging from 000 to 1000. If only physical addresses 000 to 500 are declared to an operating system (OS) such as Windows\u2122, on host , the OS will not be aware of the presence of physical addresses 501 to 1000. Under such circumstances, data stored within physical addresses 000 to 500 will be accessible to any user. This area is known as a public storage area. Conversely, undeclared physical addresses 501 to 1000 form a private storage area since these addresses are only available to microcontroller  and can only be accessed by an authorized user or software program.","Under non-secure operating conditions, any user may instruct host  to read data from or write data onto public storage area . However, if a user wishes to access private storage area , the user or the software program must first enter password , which is then sent to microcontroller  for authentication. Upon receiving password , microcontroller  executes authentication algorithm  to verify password  with authentication sequence . Access to private storage area  is permitted only if password  is verified. Shutdown algorithm  shuts down the entire system if a series of incorrect passwords is received by microcontroller .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["200","202","204","206","208"]},"If the password is verified in decision block , access to a private area, such as second storage unit in the above-described embodiments, will be permitted in a block . The user is then able to read from or write onto the second storage unit, which is preferably encrypted. If the password is not verified in decision block , the user will be denied access to the second storage unit and method  will end in a block . Alternatively, if the password is incorrect, the user may be given additional chances to enter the right password. However, the system is preferably shut down if a series of incorrect passwords is received by the microcontroller.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["250","252","252","254","256","252","258","254","256","260","252"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["300","302","300","304","302","304","300","304"]},"To retrieve data from web server , a password received by host  is verified by authentication system . The password is typically entered by a user or by software on the host. If the password is entered by the user, authentication system  may also be configured to accept a biometrics password, such as a fingerprint or a retina scan. If the verification is successful, authentication system  sends a request through host  for access to web server . Upon receiving the request, web server  grants access to a web page having secured data. The data may be in the form of a music file or an online book or a software program. Because the authentication algorithm in authentication system  is hard coded, an unauthorized user will not be able to circumvent or change the verification scheme in authentication system  and, hence, will be unable to access the data on web server .","In another embodiment of the present invention, the password is embedded in the data to be retrieved over the Internet. Host  sends a request for the data to web server . Upon receiving the request, web server  sends the password embedded in the requested data to authentication system  for verification. If the verification is successful, authentication system  allows host  to access the data, where upon it may be displayed or executed. In a preferred embodiment, the data from web server  is encrypted. Decryption of the data is carried out in authentication system  before use in host  or storage in authentication system .","Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention. Furthermore, certain terminology has been used for the purposes of descriptive clarity, and not to limit the present invention.

After the identity of the user is verified, the SAKE device notifies the website with an access request and security codes. Upon acknowledgement of the access request and security codes, the website, which could act through an ISP, establishes a network communication with the SAKE device over the Internet . An encrypted public key is subsequently forwarded from the SAKE device to the website to confirm the true identity of the user. Once the user's identity is confirmed by the website, it sends the requested software to the SAKE device via the SAKE device's host system.

Therefore, the reply enables the server to verify that the SAKE device is properly assigned to the user for accessing restricted content on the server. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the device authentication reply includes multiple authentication sequences, with each sequence being transmitted to the server separately. For example, after transmitting a first authentication sequence, the SAKE device can wait for a confirmation sequence from the server before transmitting the next sequence itself. Any number of sequences can be used in the authentication handshake, allowing for flexibility in customization. In a preferred embodiment, different content servers have different authentication handshakes with their corresponding SAKE devices, so that a given SAKE device assigned for a particular content server will be of no use in accessing restricted content on another content server.","In step , the SAKE device receives a key request from the content server. In a preferred embodiment, the content server transmits a key request to the SAKE device when the authentication handshake described above in step  is completed. In other words, when the content server has ascertained that the request for restricted content originates from a legitimate SAKE device properly assigned for that purpose, the server sends a key request to the SAKE device.","In step , the SAKE device transmits a first key representative of the user's identity to the content server in response to the key request described in step  above. This first key enables the server to confirm the user's identity. In a preferred embodiment, the first key is a public key (e.g., as used under the Public Key Infrastructure, or PKI) that uniquely identifies the key holder to third parties, such as the content server in this case. In one embodiment, the public key is hashed using a secure hashing algorithm, preferably stored in a non-volatile solid-state memory, before transmission to the content server. It is appreciated that according to the present invention, the key verification can be performed by the content server itself or by a certifying authority (\u201cCA\u201d) on behalf of the content server.","In step , the SAKE device receives the restricted content from the content server as requested. In one embodiment, the restricted content is received by the SAKE device as one or more data streams. In other words, the content is transmitted from the content server to the SAKE device by streaming.","It should be appreciated that according to a preferred embodiment described above, the content server only sends the restricted content to the SAKE device after a successful biometric authentication of the user's identity, a successful authentication handshake between the content server and the SAKE device, and a successful verification of the user's identity using a unique key such as a public key. The tri-level authentication process of the present invention as described provides very strong security protection against unauthorized access of restricted content stored on the content server.","In step , the SAKE device encrypts the content received from the content server. In a preferred embodiment, the encryption is performed using a second key representative of the user's identity. In one embodiment, the second key is a private key assigned to the user.","In step , the SAKE device stores the encrypted content in its memory. The stored content is secured against unauthorized access because it is in encrypted form and cannot be decrypted without the second key (e.g., private key) described above in step . In one embodiment, the encrypted content is stored in a non-volatile solid-state memory.","In a preferred embodiment, the SAKE device includes one or more of a voltage detector, a frequency detector, and a temperature detector (e.g., thermometer, thermostat) to further protect the stored information against tampering. These detectors monitor the operation parameters of voltage, frequency, and temperature. It is appreciated that common hacking techniques involve altering the voltage, frequency, and\/or temperature of the environment in which a storage device operates in an attempt to gain unauthorized access to the stored data. Thus, according to this embodiment, when the detectors detect that one or more of the operation parameters fall beyond their normal operating ranges as specified, the SAKE device erases or otherwise destroys the encrypted data stored therein, and optionally the first key, the second key, and the biometric template. This data self-destruction feature provides a last line of defense against unauthorized access of the restricted content stored in the SAKE device.","Importantly, content received from the content server goes directly to the SAKE device and is not stored on the client computer in any form. The internet browser serves as a conduit of data transfer between the content server and the SAKE device. The data transfer is transparent to the user and the content is neither displayed to the user in the browser, nor is the content allowed to be stored on the client computer using the browser interface. In a preferred embodiment, data is transferred by streaming, which provides additional protection against hacking, as portions of a data stream cannot be meaningfully reassembled in case of malicious interception. In one embodiment, encrypted content received from the server is decrypted by the browser (using standard decryption protocols such as DES, AES, 3-DS) and then encrypted by the SAKE device using a private key before storing. In another embodiment, the encrypted content is passed as is to the SAKE device, which can perform additional decryption and\/or re-encryption. The restricted content is stored within the SAKE device in encrypted form and cannot be replicated to another storage medium connected to the client computer. Moreover, retrieval of the data is only allowed when the user's identity is authenticated through the biometric detector and verification engine.","Once the content is securely stored in the SAKE device, an authorized user can gain access to the content by a successfully passing the biometric authentication, thereby causing the SAKE device to decrypt the stored content and streaming it to the appropriate application program for processing. For example, a music file or a movie file is decrypted and streamed to a media player for playback. An executable file is decrypted and then run from the SAKE device. A document is decrypted for viewing by a viewer\/word processing program straight from the SAKE device. Thus, the content remains in the SAKE device and the streaming of the data is under the control of the SAKE device so that unauthorized access is prevented. In another embodiment, the encrypted content is streamed for processing by the appropriate application program without being decrypted. In this embodiment, a customized application program capable of processing the encrypted content is provided.","In the foregoing specification the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader scope of the invention.
