The first PBD antitumour antibiotic, anthramycin, was discovered in 1965 (Leimgruber, et al., 87, 5793-5795 (1965); Leimgruber, et al, 87, 5791-5793 (1965)). Since then, a number of naturally occurring PBDs have been reported, and over 10 synthetic routes have been developed to a variety of analogues (Thurston, et al., 1994, 433-465 (1994); Antonow, D. and Thurston, D. E., Chem. Rev. 2011 111 (4), 2815-2864). Family members include abbeymycin (Hochlowski, et al., 40, 145-148 (1987)), chicamycin (Konishi, et al., 37, 200-206 (1984)), DC-81 (Japanese Patent 58-180 487; Thurston, et al., 26, 767-772 (1990); Bose, et al., 48, 751-758 (1992)), mazethramycin (Kuminoto, et al., 33, 665-667 (1980)), neothramycins A and B (Takeuchi, et al., 29, 93-96 (1976)), porothramycin (Tsunakawa, et al., 41, 1366-1373 (1988)), prothracarcin (Shimizu, et al, 29, 2492-2503 (1982); Langley and Thurston, 52, 91-97 (1987)), sibanomicin (DC-102)(Hara, et al., 41, 702-704 (1988); Itoh, et al., 41, 1281-1284 (1988)), sibiromycin (Leber, et al., 110, 2992-2993 (1988)) and tomamycin (Arima, et al., 25, 437-444 (1972)). PBDs are of the general structure:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0003"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"23.62mm","wi":"32.17mm","file":"US09649390-20170516-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"They differ in the number, type and position of substituents, in both their aromatic A rings and pyrrolo C rings, and in the degree of saturation of the C ring. In the B-ring there is either an imine (N\u2550C), a carbinolamine (NH\u2014CH(OH)), or a carbinolamine methyl ether (NH\u2014CH(OMe)) at the N10-C11 position which is the electrophilic centre responsible for alkylating DNA. All of the known natural products have an (S)-configuration at the chiral C11a position which provides them with a right-handed twist when viewed from the C ring towards the A ring. This gives them the appropriate three-dimensional shape for isohelicity with the minor groove of B-form DNA, leading to a snug fit at the binding site (Kohn, In . Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 3-11 (1975); Hurley and Needham-VanDevanter, 19, 230-237 (1986)). Their ability to form an adduct in the minor groove, enables them to interfere with DNA processing, hence their use as antitumour agents.","A particularly advantageous pyrrolobenzodiazepine compound is described by Gregson et al. (1999, 797-798) as compound 1, and by Gregson et al. (2001, 44, 1161-1174) as compound 4a.

(2006) Nature Reviews Immunology 6:343-357). The use of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), i.e. immunoconjugates, for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents, i.e. drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer, targets delivery of the drug moiety to tumors, and intracellular accumulation therein, whereas systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated (Xie et al (2006) 6(3):281-291; Kovtun et al (2006) 66(6):3214-3121; Law et al (2006) 66(4):2328-2337; Wu et al (2005) 23(9):1137-1145; Lambert J. (2005) 5:543-549; Hamann P. (2005) 15(9):1087-1103; Payne, G. (2003) 3:207-212; Trail et al (2003) 52:328-337; Syrigos and Epenetos (1999) 19:605-614).","Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Efforts to design and refine ADC have focused on the selectivity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as well as drug mechanism of action, drug-linking, drug\/antibody ratio (loading), and drug-releasing properties (Junutula, et al., 2008b Nature Biotech., 26(8):925-932; Dornan et al (2009) 114(13):2721-2729; U.S. Pat. No. 7,521,541; U.S. Pat. No. 7,723,485; WO2009\/052249; McDonagh (2006) Protein Eng. Design & Sel. 19(7): 299-307; Doronina et al (2006) Bioconj. Chem. 17:114-124; Erickson et al (2006) 66(8):1-8; Sanderson et al (2005) 11:843-852; Jeffrey et al (2005) 48:1344-1358; Hamblett et al (2004) 10:7063-7070). Drug moieties may impart their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding, DNA binding, or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.","PBDs in ADCs","Dimeric PBDs have been disclosed as the drugs in drug conjugates. For example, in WO 2011\/130598, dimer PBD compounds having linker groups for connection to a cell binding agent, such as an antibody, are disclosed where the linker group is attached to one of the available N10 positions, and are generally cleaved by action of an enzyme on the linker group.","By contrast, in WO 2011\/130613 and WO 2011\/130616, dimer PBD compounds having linker groups for connection to a cell binding agent, such as an antibody, are disclosed where the linker group is attached via an aromatic group at one of the C2 positions, and are generally cleaved by action of an enzyme on the linker group. Such antibody drug conjugates are also described in Flygare, J., et al, 81: 113-121 (2013), which also describes other types of antibody drug conjugates.","A further approach is described in WO 2007\/085930, wherein tomamycin-like dimers have a linker group for connection to a cell binding agent, such as an antibody, where the linker group is attached to the tether between the tomamycin units, and are generally cleaved by action of an enzyme on the linker group.","The present inventors have developed a novel approach to forming PBD conjugates with cell binding agents, and in particular PBD antibody conjugates.","in a general aspect the present invention provides a conjugate comprising a PBD dimer compound with a linker for connecting to a cell binding agent, wherein the linker has a triazole, piperazine, propargylene or oxime group attached to a phenylene or pyriydylene in the bridge linking the two PBD monomers. The cell binding agent is preferably an antibody.","In a first aspect, the present invention provides novel conjugate compounds of formula (A):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0018"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"41.49mm","wi":"110.07mm","file":"US09649390-20170516-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{}]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0019"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"43.18mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09649390-20170516-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{}],"sup":"2 ","sub":["5-10 ","1-7 ","3-7 ","1-3 ","1-5 ","3-6 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0020"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00007","num":"00007"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00007","he":"17.02mm","wi":"20.83mm","file":"US09649390-20170516-C00007.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{}],"sup":["31","32 ","33 ","2 "],"sub":["1-3 ","2-3 ","2-3 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0021"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00008","num":"00008"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00008","he":"12.11mm","wi":"22.01mm","file":"US09649390-20170516-C00008.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["35a ","35b "],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":"phenyl, which phenyl is optionally substituted by a group selected from halo, methyl, methoxy;

These can include antibodies or a fragment of an antibody that contains at least one binding site, lymphokines, hormones, growth factors, nutrient-transport molecules, or any other cell binding molecule or substance.","The term \u201cantibody\u201d herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, dimers, multimers, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (Miller et al (2003) 170:4854-4861). Antibodies may be murine, human, humanized, chimeric, or derived from other species. An antibody is a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing and binding to a specific antigen. (Janeway, C., Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik (2001) 5., Garland Publishing, New York). A target antigen generally has numerous binding sites, also called epitopes, recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies. Each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure. Thus, one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody. An antibody includes a full-length immunoglobulin molecule or an immunologically active portion of a full-length immunoglobulin molecule, i.e., a molecule that contains an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen of a target of interest or part thereof, such targets including but not limited to, cancer cell or cells that produce autoimmune antibodies associated with an autoimmune disease. The immunoglobulin can be of any type (e.g. IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, and IgA), class (e.g. IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. The immunoglobulins can be derived from any species, including human, murine, or rabbit origin.","\u201cAntibody fragments\u201d comprise a portion of a full length antibody, generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies: fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, CDR (complementary determining region), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to cancer cell antigens, viral antigens or microbial antigens, single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.","The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al (1975) 256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al (1991) Nature, 352:624-628; Marks et al (1991) J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597.","The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include \u201cchimeric\u201d antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and\/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al (1984) . USA, 81:6851-6855). Chimeric antibodies include \u201cprimatized\u201d antibodies comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g. Old World Monkey or Ape) and human constant region sequences.","An \u201cintact antibody\u201d herein is one comprising a VL and VH domains, as well as a light chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains, CH, CHand CH. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g. human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variant thereof. The intact antibody may have one or more \u201ceffector functions\u201d which refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; and down regulation of cell surface receptors such as B cell receptor and BCR.","Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, intact antibodies can be assigned to different \u201cclasses.\u201d There are five major classes of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into \u201csubclasses\u201d (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b3, and \u03bc, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.","Examples of cell binding agents include those agents described for use in WO 2007\/085930, which is incorporated herein.","The cell binding agent may be, or comprise, a polypeptide. The polypeptide may be a cyclic polypeptide. The cell binding agent may be antibody. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC).","Drug Loading","The drug loading is the average number of PBD drugs per antibody. Drug loading may range from 1 to 8 drugs (D) per antibody (Ab), i.e. where 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 drug moieties are covalently attached to the antibody. Compositions of ADC include collections of antibodies conjugated with a range of drugs, from 1 to 8. The average number of drugs per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy, ELISA assay, electrophoresis, and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of ADC in terms of p may also be determined. By ELISA, the averaged value of p in a particular preparation of ADC may be determined (Hamblett et al (2004) Clin. Cancer Res. 10:7063-7070; Sanderson et al (2005) Clin. Cancer Res. 11:843-852). However, the distribution of p (drug) values is not discernible by the antibody-antigen binding and detection limitation of ELISA. Also, ELISA assay for detection of antibody-drug conjugates does not determine where the drug moieties are attached to the antibody, such as the heavy chain or light chain fragments, or the particular amino acid residues. In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis.","For some antibody-drug conjugates, p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example, an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups, or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. Higher drug loading, e.g. p>5, may cause aggregation, insolubility, toxicity, or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody-drug conjugates.","Typically, fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain, for example, many lysine residues that do not react with the drug-linker intermediate (D-L) or linker reagent. Only the most reactive lysine groups may react with an amine-reactive linker reagent. Also, only the most reactive cysteine thiol groups may react with a thiol-reactive linker reagent. Generally, antibodies do not contain many, if any, free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety. Most cysteine thiol residues in the antibodies of the compounds exist as disulfide bridges and must be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or TCEP, under partial or total reducing conditions. The loading (drug\/antibody ratio) of an ADC may be controlled in several different manners, including: (i) limiting the molar excess of drug-linker intermediate (D-L) or linker reagent relative to antibody, (ii) limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature, and (iii) partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification.","Cysteine amino acids may be engineered at reactive sites in an antibody and which do not form intrachain or intermolecular disulfide linkages (Junutula, et al., 2008b Nature Biotech., 26(8):925-932; Dornan et al (2009) Blood 114(13):2721-2729; U.S. Pat.

The engineered cysteine thiols may react with linker reagents or the drug-linker reagents of the present invention which have thiol-reactive, electrophilic groups such as maleimide or alpha-halo amides to form ADO with cysteine engineered antibodies (ThioMabs) and the PBD drug moieties. The location of the drug moiety can thus be designed, controlled, and known. The drug loading can be controlled since the engineered cysteine thiol groups typically react with thiol-reactive linker reagents or drug-linker reagents in high yield. Engineering an IgG antibody to introduce a cysteine amino acid by substitution at a single site on the heavy or light chain gives two new cysteines on the symmetrical antibody. A drug loading near 2 can be achieved and near homogeneity of the conjugation product ADC.","Where more than one nucleophilic or electrophilic group of the antibody reacts with a drug-linker intermediate, or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent, then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of drug moieties attached to an antibody, e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc. Liquid chromatography methods such as polymeric reverse phase (PLRP) and hydrophobic interaction (HIC) may separate compounds in the mixture by drug loading value. Preparations of ADC with a single drug loading value (p) may be isolated, however, these single loading value ADCs may still be heterogeneous mixtures because the drug moieties may be attached, via the linker, at different sites on the antibody.","Thus the antibody-drug conjugate compositions of the invention include mixtures of antibody-drug conjugate compounds where the antibody has one or more PBD drug moieties and where the drug moieties may be attached to the antibody at various amino acid residues.","In one embodiment, the average number of dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine groups per cell binding agent is in the range 1 to 20. In some embodiments the range is selected from 1 to 8, 2 to 8, 2 to 6, 2 to 4, and 4 to 8.","In some embodiments, there is one dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine groups per cell binding agent.","Peptides","In one embodiment, the cell binding agent is a linear or cyclic peptide comprising 4-20, preferably 6-20, contiguous amino acid residues. In this embodiment, it is preferred that one cell binding agent is linked to one monomer or dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine compound.","In one embodiment the cell binding agent comprises a peptide that binds integrin \u03b1\u03b2. The peptide may be selective for \u03b1\u03b2over XYS.","In one embodiment the cell binding agent comprises the A20FMDV-Cys polypeptide. The A20FMDV-Cys has the sequence: NAVPNLRGDLQVLAQKVARTC, SEQ ID NO:7. Alternatively, a variant of the A20FMDV-Cys sequence may be used wherein one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine or ten amino acid residues is substituted with another amino acid residue.","In one embodiment the antibody is a monoclonal antibody; chimeric antibody; humanized antibody; fully human antibody; or a single chain antibody. One embodiment the antibody is a fragment of one of these antibodies having biological activity. Examples of such fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)and Fv fragments.","In these embodiments, each antibody may be linked to one or several dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine groups. The preferred ratios of pyrrolobenzodiazepine to cell binding agent are given above.","The antibody may be a domain antibody (DAB).","In one embodiment, the antibody is a monoclonal antibody.","Antibodies for use in the present invention include those antibodies described in WO 2005\/082023 which is incorporated herein. Particularly preferred are those antibodies for tumour-associated antigens. Examples of those antigens known in the art include, but are not limited to, those tumour-associated antigens set out in WO 2005\/082023. See, for instance, pages 41-55.","The conjugates of the invention are designed to target tumour cells via their cell surface antigens. The antigens are usually normal cell surface antigens which are either over-expressed or expressed at abnormal times. Ideally the target antigen is expressed only on proliferative cells (preferably tumour cells), however this is rarely observed in practice. As a result, target antigens are usually selected on the basis of differential expression between proliferative and healthy tissue.","Tumor-associated antigens (TAA) are known in the art, and can prepared for use in generating antibodies using methods and information which are well known in the art. In attempts to discover effective cellular targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy, researchers have sought to identify transmembrane or otherwise tumor-associated polypeptides that are specifically expressed on the surface of one or more particular type(s) of cancer cell as compared to on one or more normal non-cancerous cell(s). Often, such tumor-associated polypeptides are more abundantly expressed on the surface of the cancer cells as compared to on the surface of the non-cancerous cells. The identification of such tumor-associated cell surface antigen polypeptides has given rise to the ability to specifically target cancer cells for destruction via antibody-based therapies.","Examples of TAA include, but are not limited to, TAA (1)-(36) listed below. For convenience, information relating to these antigens, all of which are known in the art, is listed below and includes names, alternative names, Genbank accession numbers and primary reference(s), following nucleic acid and protein sequence identification conventions of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Nucleic acid and protein sequences corresponding to TAA (1)-(36) are available in public databases such as GenBank. Tumor-associated antigens targeted by antibodies include all amino acid sequence variants and isoforms possessing at least about 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% sequence identity relative to the sequences identified in the cited references, or which exhibit substantially the same biological properties or characteristics as a TAA having a sequence found in the cited references. For example, a TAA having a variant sequence generally is able to bind specifically to an antibody that binds specifically to the TAA with the corresponding sequence listed. The sequences and disclosure in the reference specifically recited herein are expressly incorporated by reference.","Tumor-Associated Antigens (1)-(36):","(1) BMPR1B (bone morphogenetic protein receptor-type IB, Genbank accession no.

Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.","\u201cEnantiomers\u201d refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another.","Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., -(1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and l or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or l meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \u201cracemic mixture\u201d and \u201cracemate\u201d refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.","Note that, except as discussed below for tautomeric forms, specifically excluded from the term \u201cisomers\u201d, as used herein, are structural (or constitutional) isomers (i.e. isomers which differ in the connections between atoms rather than merely by the position of atoms in space). For example, a reference to a methoxy group, \u2014OCH, is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, a hydroxymethyl group, \u2014CHOH. Similarly, a reference to ortho-chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, meta-chlorophenyl. However, a reference to a class of structures may well include structurally isomeric forms falling within that class (e.g. Calkyl includes n-propyl and iso-propyl; butyl includes n-, iso-, sec-, and tert-butyl; methoxyphenyl includes ortho-, meta-, and para-methoxyphenyl).","The above exclusion does not pertain to tautomeric forms, for example, keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example, the following tautomeric pairs: keto\/enol (illustrated below), imine\/enamine, amide\/imino alcohol, amidine\/amidine, nitroso\/oxime, thioketone\/enethiol, N-nitroso\/hyroxyazo, and nitro\/aci-nitro.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0446","num":"0518"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00078","num":"00078"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00078","he":"16.59mm","wi":"65.36mm","file":"US09649390-20170516-C00078.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.","Note that specifically included in the term \u201cisomer\u201d are compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions. For example, H may be in any isotopic form, including H, H (D), and H (T); C may be in any isotopic form, including C, C, and C; O may be in any isotopic form, including O and O; and the like.","Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, and chlorine, such as, but not limited to H (deuterium, D), H (tritium), C, C, C, N, F, P, P, S, Cl, and I. Various isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H, 13C, and 14C are incorporated. Such isotopically labelled compounds may be useful in metabolic studies, reaction kinetic studies, detection or imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in radioactive treatment of patients. Deuterium labelled or substituted therapeutic compounds of the invention may have improved DMPK (drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics) properties, relating to distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. An 18F labeled compound may be useful for PET or SPECT studies. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes, particularly deuterium (i.e., 2H or D) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements or an improvement in therapeutic index. It is understood that deuterium in this context is regarded as a substituent. The concentration of such a heavier isotope, specifically deuterium, may be defined by an isotopic enrichment factor. In the compounds of this invention any atom not specifically designated as a particular isotope is meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom.","Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound includes all such isomeric forms, including (wholly or partially) racemic and other mixtures thereof. Methods for the preparation (e.g. asymmetric synthesis) and separation (e.g. fractional crystallisation and chromatographic means) of such isomeric forms are either known in the art or are readily obtained by adapting the methods taught herein, or known methods, in a known manner.","Biological Activity","In Vitro Cell Proliferation Assays","Generally, the cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is measured by: exposing mammalian cells having receptor proteins, e.g. HER2, to the antibody of the ADC in a cell culture medium; culturing the cells for a period from about 6 hours to about 5 days; and measuring cell viability. Cell-based in vitro assays are used to measure viability (proliferation), cytotoxicity, and induction of apoptosis (caspase activation) of an ADC of the invention.","The in vitro potency of antibody-drug conjugates can be measured by a cell proliferation assay. The CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Assay is a commercially available (Promega Corp., Madison, Wis.), homogeneous assay method based on the recombinant expression of luciferase (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,583,024; 5,674,713 and 5,700,670). This cell proliferation assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, an indicator of metabolically active cells (Crouch et al (1993) 160:81-88; U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,677). The CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Assay is conducted in 96 well format, making it amenable to automated high-throughput screening (HTS) (Cree et al (1995) 6:398-404). The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the single reagent (CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Reagent) directly to cells cultured in serum-supplemented medium. Cell washing, removal of medium and multiple pipetting steps are not required. The system detects as few as 15 cells\/well in a 384-well format in 10 minutes after adding reagent and mixing. The cells may be treated continuously with ADC, or they may be treated and separated from ADC. Generally, cells treated briefly, i.e. 3 hours, showed the same potency effects as continuously treated cells.","The homogeneous \u201cadd-mix-measure\u201d format results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present. The amount of ATP is directly proportional to the number of cells present in culture. The CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Assay generates a \u201cglow-type\u201d luminescent signal, produced by the luciferase reaction, which has a half-life generally greater than five hours, depending on cell type and medium used. Viable cells are reflected in relative luminescence units (RLU). The substrate, Beetle Luciferin, is oxidatively decarboxylated by recombinant firefly luciferase with concomitant conversion of ATP to AMP and generation of photons.","The in vitro potency of antibody-drug conjugates can also be measured by a cytotoxicity assay. Cultured adherent cells are washed with PBS, detached with trypsin, diluted in complete medium, containing 10% FCS, centrifuged, re-suspended in fresh medium and counted with a haemocytometer. Suspension cultures are counted directly. Monodisperse cell suspensions suitable for counting may require agitation of the suspension by repeated aspiration to break up cell clumps.","The cell suspension is diluted to the desired seeding density and dispensed (100 \u03bcl per well) into black 96 well plates. Plates of adherent cell lines are incubated overnight to allow adherence. Suspension cell cultures can be used on the day of seeding.","A stock solution (1 ml) of ADC (20 \u03bcg\/ml) is made in the appropriate cell culture medium. Serial 10-fold dilutions of stock ADC are made in 15 ml centrifuge tubes by serially transferring 100 \u03bcl to 900 \u03bcl of cell culture medium.","Four replicate wells of each ADC dilution (100 \u03bcl) are dispensed in 96-well black plates, previously plated with cell suspension (100 \u03bcl), resulting in a final volume of 200 \u03bcl. Control wells receive cell culture medium (100 \u03bcl).","If the doubling time of the cell line is greater than 30 hours, ADC incubation is for 5 days, otherwise a four day incubation is done.","At the end of the incubation period, cell viability is assessed with the Alamar blue assay. AlamarBlue (Invitrogen) is dispensed over the whole plate (20 \u03bcl per well) and incubated for 4 hours. Alamar blue fluorescence is measured at excitation 570 nm, emission 585 nm on the Varioskan flash plate reader. Percentage cell survival is calculated from the mean fluorescence in the ADC treated wells compared to the mean fluorescence in the control wells.","In Vivo Efficacy","The in vivo efficacy of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of the invention can be measured by tumor xenograft studies in mice. For example, the in vivo efficacy of an anti-HER2 ADC of the invention can be measured by a high expressing HER2 transgenic explant mouse model. An allograft is propagated from the Fo5 mmtv transgenic mouse which does not respond to, or responds poorly to, HERCEPTIN\u00ae therapy. Subjects were treated once with ADC at certain dose levels (mg\/kg) and PBD drug exposure (\u03bcg\/m); and placebo buffer control (Vehicle) and monitored over two weeks or more to measure the time to tumor doubling, log cell kill, and tumor shrinkage.","Use","The conjugates of the invention may be used to provide a PBD conjugate at a target location.","The target location is preferably a proliferative cell population. The antibody is an antibody for an antigen present in a proliferative cell population.","In one embodiment the antigen is absent or present at a reduced level in a non-proliferative cell population compared to the amount of antigen present in the proliferative cell population, for example a tumour cell population.","The target location may be in vitro, in vivo or ex vivo.","The antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) compounds of the invention include those with utility for anticancer activity. In particular, the compounds include an antibody conjugated, i.e. covalently attached by a linker, to a PBD moiety.","At the target location the linker may not be cleaved. The antibody-drug conjugate (ADC compounds of the invention may have a cytotoxic effect without the cleavage of the linker to release a PBD drug moiety. The antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of the invention selectively deliver cytotoxic agent to tumor tissue whereby greater selectivity, i.e. a lower efficacious dose, may be achieved.","Thus, in one aspect, the present invention provides a conjugate compound as described herein for use in therapy.","In a further aspect there is also provides a conjugate compound as described herein for use in the treatment of a proliferative disease.

Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2000; and 2nd edition, 1994.","Another aspect of the present invention pertains to methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one [C]-radiolabelled conjugate or conjugate-like compound, as defined herein, together with one or more other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients well known to those skilled in the art, e.g., carriers, diluents, excipients, etc. If formulated as discrete units (e.g., tablets, etc.), each unit contains a predetermined amount (dosage) of the active compound.","The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable,\u201d as used herein, pertains to compounds, ingredients, materials, compositions, dosage forms, etc., which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of the subject in question (e.g., human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit\/risk ratio. Each carrier, diluent, excipient, etc. must also be \u201cacceptable\u201d in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation.","The formulations may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with a carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active compound with carriers (e.g., liquid carriers, finely divided solid carrier, etc.), and then shaping the product, if necessary.","The formulation may be prepared to provide for rapid or slow release; immediate, delayed, timed, or sustained release; or a combination thereof.","Formulations suitable for parenteral administration (e.g., by injection), include aqueous or non-aqueous, isotonic, pyrogen-free, sterile liquids (e.g., solutions, suspensions), in which the active ingredient is dissolved, suspended, or otherwise provided (e.g., in a liposome or other microparticulate). Such liquids may additional contain other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients, such as anti-oxidants, buffers, preservatives, stabilisers, bacteriostats, suspending agents, thickening agents, and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood (or other relevant bodily fluid) of the intended recipient. Examples of excipients include, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils, and the like. Examples of suitable isotonic carriers for use in such formulations include Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Solution, or Lactated Ringer's Injection. Typically, the concentration of the active ingredient in the liquid is from about 1 ng\/ml to about 10 \u03bcg\/ml, for example from about 10 ng\/ml to about 1 \u03bcg\/ml. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example, ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets.","Dosage","It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that appropriate dosages of the conjugate compound, and compositions comprising the conjugate compound, can vary from patient to patient. Determining the optimal dosage will generally involve the balancing of the level of therapeutic benefit against any risk or deleterious side effects. The selected dosage level will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the activity of the particular compound, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds, and\/or materials used in combination, the severity of the condition, and the species, sex, age, weight, condition, general health, and prior medical history of the patient. The amount of compound and route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician, veterinarian, or clinician, although generally the dosage will be selected to achieve local concentrations at the site of action which achieve the desired effect without causing substantial harmful or deleterious side-effects.","Administration can be effected in one dose, continuously or intermittently (e.g., in divided doses at appropriate intervals) throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the art and will vary with the formulation used for therapy, the purpose of the therapy, the target cell(s) being treated, and the subject being treated. Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician, veterinarian, or clinician.","In general, a suitable dose of the active compound is in the range of about 100 ng to about 25 mg (more typically about 1 \u03bcg to about 10 mg) per kilogram body weight of the subject per day. Where the active compound is a salt, an ester, an amide, a prodrug, or the like, the amount administered is calculated on the basis of the parent compound and so the actual weight to be used is increased proportionately.","In one embodiment, the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime: about 100 mg, 3 times daily.","In one embodiment, the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime: about 150 mg, 2 times daily.","In one embodiment, the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime: about 200 mg, 2 times daily.","However in one embodiment, the conjugate compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime: about 50 or about 75 mg, 3 or 4 times daily.","In one embodiment, the conjugate compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime: about 100 or about 125 mg, 2 times daily.","The dosage amounts described above may apply to the conjugate (including the PBD moiety and the linker to the antibody) or to the effective amount of PBD compound provided, for example the amount of compound that is releasable after cleavage of the linker.","For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an ADC of the invention will depend on the type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease, whether the molecule is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The molecule is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 15 mg\/kg (e.g. 0.1-20 mg\/kg) of molecule is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. An exemplary dosage of ADC to be administered to a patient is in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg\/kg of patient weight. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises a course of administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg\/kg, followed by additional doses every week, two weeks, or three weeks of an ADC. Other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.","Treatment","The term \u201ctreatment,\u201d as used herein in the context of treating a condition, pertains generally to treatment and therapy, whether of a human or an animal (e.g., in veterinary applications), in which some desired therapeutic effect is achieved, for example, the inhibition of the progress of the condition, and includes a reduction in the rate of progress, a halt in the rate of progress, regression of the condition, amelioration of the condition, and cure of the condition. Treatment as a prophylactic measure (i.e., prophylaxis, prevention) is also included.","The term \u201ctherapeutically-effective amount,\u201d as used herein, pertains to that amount of an active compound, or a material, composition or dosage from comprising an active compound, which is effective for producing some desired therapeutic effect, commensurate with a reasonable benefit\/risk ratio, when administered in accordance with a desired treatment regimen.","Similarly, the term \u201cprophylactically-effective amount,\u201d as used herein, pertains to that amount of an active compound, or a material, composition or dosage from comprising an active compound, which is effective for producing some desired prophylactic effect, commensurate with a reasonable benefit\/risk ratio, when administered in accordance with a desired treatment regimen.","Preparation of Antibody Drug Conjugates","Antibody drug conjugates may be prepared by several routes, employing organic chemistry reactions, conditions, and reagents known to those skilled in the art, including: (1) reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent, to form antibody-linker intermediate Ab-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with an activated drug moiety reagent; and (2) reaction of a drug moiety reagent with a linker reagent, to form drug-linker reagent D-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with the nucleophilic of an antibody. Conjugation methods (1) and (2) may be employed with a variety of antibodies, and linkers to prepare the antibody-drug conjugates of the invention.","Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include, but are not limited to side chain thiol groups, e.g. cysteine. Thiol groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties such as those of the present invention. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (Cleland's reagent, dithiothreitol) or TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; Getz et al (1999) Anal. Biochem. Vol 273:73-80; Soltec Ventures, Beverly, Mass.). Each cysteine disulfide bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol.","The Subject\/Patient","The subject\/patient may be an animal, mammal, a placental mammal, a marsupial (e.g., kangaroo, wombat), a monotreme (e.g., duckbilled platypus), a rodent (e.g., a guinea pig, a hamster, a rat, a mouse), murine (e.g., a mouse), a lagomorph (e.g., a rabbit), avian (e.g., a bird), canine (e.g., a dog), feline (e.g., a cat), equine (e.g., a horse), porcine (e.g., a pig), ovine (e.g., a sheep), bovine (e.g., a cow), a primate, simian (e.g., a monkey or ape), a monkey (e.g., marmoset, baboon), an ape (e.g., gorilla, chimpanzee, orangutan, gibbon), or a human.","Furthermore, the subject\/patient may be any of its forms of development, for example, a fetus. In one preferred embodiment, the subject\/patient is a human.","In one embodiment, the patient is a population where each patient has a tumour having \u03b1\u03b2integrin on the surface of the cell.","Synthesis","One possible synthesis route to a dimer intermediate of formula IV is shown below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0518","num":"0590"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00079","num":"00079"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00079","he":"117.01mm","wi":"100.16mm","file":"US09649390-20170516-C00079.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Intermediate IV can be used to make intermediate VII",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0520","num":"0592"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00080","num":"00080"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00080","he":"182.80mm","wi":"100.16mm","file":"US09649390-20170516-C00080.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00081","num":"00081"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00081","he":"71.54mm","wi":"100.16mm","file":"US09649390-20170516-C00081.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}]},"Intermediate IV can be used to make intermediate IX:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0522","num":"0594"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00082","num":"00082"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00082","he":"182.96mm","wi":"100.16mm","file":"US09649390-20170516-C00082.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Alternatively, intermediate IV can be coupled with intermediate X to make intermediate IX:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0524","num":"0596"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00083","num":"00083"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00083","he":"67.99mm","wi":"57.57mm","file":"US09649390-20170516-C00083.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0525","num":"0597"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00084","num":"00084"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00084","he":"203.88mm","wi":"100.58mm","file":"US09649390-20170516-C00084.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Intermediate IV can be used to make intermediate XVI",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0527","num":"0599"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00085","num":"00085"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00085","he":"187.03mm","wi":"100.58mm","file":"US09649390-20170516-C00085.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Intermediate IV can be used to make intermediate XIX",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0529","num":"0601"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00086","num":"00086"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00086","he":"202.86mm","wi":"100.58mm","file":"US09649390-20170516-C00086.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"One possible synthesis route to a dimer intermediate of formula XIV is shown below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0531","num":"0603"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00087","num":"00087"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00087","he":"155.19mm","wi":"100.58mm","file":"US09649390-20170516-C00087.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0532","num":"0604"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00088","num":"00088"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00088","he":"64.01mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US09649390-20170516-C00088.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Intermediate XXI can be Used to make intermediate XXVII:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0534","num":"0606"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00089","num":"00089"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00089","he":"247.73mm","wi":"100.16mm","file":"US09649390-20170516-C00089.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In the above schemes, R, R, and R each independently represent a nitrogen protecting group.

The halogen group on the aryl ring in the dimer bridge of intermediate IV may then be used to form the tether (including linker group G or L) to connect the PBD dimer to the cell binding agent.","In more detail, two PBD monomers with \u2014XH and \u2014X\u2032H groups at the C8 position of each PBD monomer (intermediates I and II, respectively) may be rected with -T-Hal and -T\u2032-Hal groups on intermediate II or intermediate XX. Such a method of synthesis allows for the PBD monomers to be different and so the resulting PBD dimer is asymmetrical. Equally, the PBD monomers may be the same.","PBD dimer intermediate IV may be used to provide the compounds and conjugates of the present invention by reacting the aryl halogen group in the bridge in a number of ways.","First, intermediate IV can be used in a Sonogishira cross-coupling reaction to provide an acetylene group on the aryl group of the dimer bridge. Sonogishira cross-coupling reactions are well known in the art for coupling a terminal alkyne with an aryl halide in the presence of a palladium catalyst, such as Pd(Ph), a copper catalyst, such as CuI, and a base, such as diethylamine.","When acetylene is to be used as the terminal acetylene, one side of the acetylene molecule is typically protected with, for example, TMS in order to prevent cross-linking of the PBD dimers. Once the Sonogishira reaction is complete, the TMS group can be cleaved to provide alkyne intermediate V.","Intermediate V can be reacted with an azido compound to form a triazole derivative in an azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition. Such a reaction may be catalysed by a copper catalyst. To form the compounds and conjugates of the present invention, the azide is bonded to an ethylene group and a variable number of PEG groups. The azide may be terminated with an amine group to react further. Reaction of intermediate V with an amino-azide compound will provide intermediate VI.","The free amine group of intermediate VI can then be reacted with a carboxylic acid group of a linker group for connecting to a cell binding unit to form the amido group linking the PBD dimer to the linker group G or L to provide compound VII.","The linker group\/reactive group, G, of intermediate VII can be conjugated to a cell binding agent to provide conjugates of the present invention.","As an alternative Sonogishira reaction, intermediate IV can be coupled to an acetylamine, such as propargylamine in the presence of palladium and copper catalysts and base. Such a reaction provides part of a tether attached to the PBD dimer bridge where the aclyne group is preserved and a free terminal amine is available for further reaction. For example, the reaction of intermediate IV with propargylamine provides intermediate VIII.","The terminal amine of intermediate VIII can be reacted with, for example, a carboxylic acid group attached to a linker\/reactive group G (for connecting to a cell binding agent) to provide intermediate IX.","As an alternative synthesis of intermediate IX, the carboxylic acid group of intermediate XI can be reacted with propargylamine to form intermediate XII. Reaction of intermediate IV with intermediate XII in a Sonogoshira reaction yields intermediate XIII.","The protected amine group terminated the variable PEG chain can be deprotected and reacted with the carboxylic acid group of intermediate XIV in order to couple the linker\/reactive group G onto the PBD dimer and produce intermediate XIV.","Intermediate IV may also used in a cross-coupling amination reaction, such as a Buchwald-Hartwig amination. A carbon-nitrogen bond is formed via a palladium-catalysed cross-coupling of an amine with an aryl halide. A number of palladium catalysts for use in such cross-coupling reactions are known, such as Pd(Ph)or RuPhos\/RuPhosPd.","Reaction of intermediate IV with a piperizine functionalised with a protected propan-1-amine provides intermediate XV. The protected amine of intermediate XV can be further reacted with, for example, a carboxylic acid group attached to a linker\/reactive group, G, for connecting to a cell binding agent to provide intermediate XVI.","Cross-coupling amination reaction, such as a Buchwald-Hartwig amination, of intermediate IV with a partially protected piperazine followed by deprotection (for example with trifluoroacetic acid) provides intermediate XVII.","The deprotected piperazine amine group of intermediate XVII can be reacted with a carboxylic acid group in intermediate XVIII to provide intermediate XIX.","Intermediate XXI can be used to form the oxime intermediate XXIV. For example, a partially protected PEG-diamine, intermediate XXII, may be reacted with the carboxylic acid group of intermediate XIV. Deprotection yields intermediate XIII.","Reaction of intermediates XXI and XXIII yields oxime intermediate XXIV. The syn and anti oximes can be resolved using preparative HPLC.","Intermediate XXI can also be used to form the acrylamide intermediate XXVII. For example, the aldehyde intermediate XXI can be reacted with malonic acid in a Knoevenagel condensation to yield the acrylic acid intermediate XXV. This can be reacted with a partially protected PEG-diamine to yield intermediate XXVI. Deprotectopm and coupling with intermediate XIV yield the acrylamide intermediate XXVII","The synthesis of PBD compounds containing two imine moieties is extensively discussed in the following references, which discussions are incorporated herein by reference:\n\n","General Experimental Methods","Optical rotations were measured on an ADP 220 polarimeter (Bellingham Stanley Ltd.) and concentrations (c) are given in g\/100 mL.

A freshly prepared solution of TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride) is added to selectively reduce cysteine disulfide bridges. The amount of TCEP is proportional to the target level of reduction, within 1 to 4 molar equivalents per antibody, generating 2 to 8 reactive thiols. After reduction for several hours at 37\u00b0 C., the mixture is cooled down to room temperature and excess drug-linker (7, 10) added as a diluted DMSO solution (final DMSO content of up to 10% volume\/volume of reaction mixture). The mixture was gently shaken at either 4\u00b0 C. or room temperature for the appropriate time, generally 1-3 hours. Excess reactive thiols can be reacted with a \u2018thiol capping reagent\u2019 like N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) at the end of the conjugation. Antibody-drug conjugates are concentrated using centrifugal spin-filters with a molecular weight cut-off of 10 kDa or higher, then purified by tangential flow filtration (TFF) or Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC). Corresponding antibody-drug conjugates can be determined by analysis by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) to assess drug-per-antibody ratio (DAR) using reverse-phase chromatography (RP) or Hydrophobic-Interaction Chromatography (HIC), coupled with UV-Visible, Fluorescence or Mass-Spectrometer detection; aggregate level and monomer purity can be analysed by HPLC or UHPLC using size-exclusion chromatography coupled with UV-Visible, Fluorescence or Mass-Spectrometer detection. Final conjugate concentration is determined by a combination of spectroscopic (absorbance at 280, 214 and 330 nm) and biochemical assay (bicinchonic acid assay BCA; Smith, P. K., et al. (1985) 150 (1): 76-85; using a known-concentration IgG antibody as reference). Antibody-drug conjugates are generally sterile filtered using 0.2 \u03bcm filters under aseptic conditions, and stored at +4\u00b0 C., \u221220\u00b0 C. or \u221280\u00b0 C.","Examples of particular conjugations are described below.","Conjugate A (Ab-7, ConjA)","Antibody (Ab) (2.0 mg, 13.3 nanomoles) was diluted into 1.8 mL of a reduction buffer containing 10 mM sodium borate pH 8.4, 2.5 mM EDTA and a final antibody concentration of 1.11 mg\/mL.
