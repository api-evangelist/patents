title: Entity-relationship model extensions using annotations
abstract: Embodiments extend the relational model and language of standard SQL, to recognize features of higher level entity-relationship models (ERMs). Annotation language is implemented in the data design language (DDL) to incorporate tables and entities Using DDL, annotations are typed structures of metadata. Annotations may be used for types, entities and elements. In the query language (QL), annotations may be added to the standard QL. A reflection program may use the metadata of the annotation language for reflection on the tables or entities.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","EXAMPLES","Examples"],"p":["Embodiments relate to databases, and in particular, to annotating extensions to a database language to accommodate higher level entity-relationship models.","Unless otherwise indicated herein, the approaches described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.","A database is a powerful tool for the storage, organization, and analysis of large volumes of data. At a low level, a database may employ fundamental data definition and processing that is based upon a relational model. In particular, a data definition defines a data type with sufficient metadata being associated therewith. A data definition may also involve a definition of a database structure such as columns and tables. Many database structures rely upon Structured Query Language (SQL) as the standard database language to define, read, and manipulate data within a database. In its standard form, SQL itself reflects the basic relational model of the database.","Various other types of applications (e.g., toolsets) are constructed by developers to allow consumers to interact with the database in an efficient and intuitive manner. Such applications are typically provided in an application layer overlying the database.","The overlying applications, such as consumer technology and toolsets provided by developers, may introduce higher-level models, e.g., entity-relationship models (ERMs), in order to contribute semantics and ease consumption by the user. In particular, a plain data model on the SQL-level only contains the requisite information to process data on the SQL-level. Adding more information in a declarative fashion provides potential for higher-level engines to offload work from developers by contributing more semantics. Adding more information in a declarative fashion can also make data models more comprehensible, thereby easing their consumption by users.","One example of a higher-level model is an OData Entity Data Model (EDM). In particular, OData is a web protocol standard providing platform-agnostic interoperability for querying and updating data. OData leverages web technologies such as HTTP, Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub), and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) in order to provide access to information from a variety of applications. The simplicity and extensibility of OData can provide consumers with a predictable interface for querying a variety of data sources.","Other examples of higher-level models may include the Semantic Layer in the Business Intelligence (BI) platform of SAP AG in Walldorf, Germany, Java Persistence API (JPA) and enterprise objects in Java, or the business objects frameworks in Advanced Business Application Programming (ABAP) of SAP AG. Also, the River programming model and the River Definition Language (RDL) of the River application development framework for SAP AG in Walldorf, Germany, are based upon entities linked by relationships.","Even though those higher-level models may share many commonalities, the individual information cannot be shared across stacks. That is, the higher-level models mentioned above contribute essentially the same kind of additional information, yet that information is provided in different ways that interfere with its being shared across higher-level models (e.g., between an OData EDM and an ERM created using RDL).","This situation results in a fragmented environment with information unable to be shared between applications. To cope with this fragmentation, redundant information is provided, with application developers and customers contributing the same essential information in multiple forms, thereby undesirably increasing overhead.","Furthermore, while the developers of consumer technologies may have some knowledge of SQL, they are generally not experts in complex SQL programming. Thus, there is a need for an improved language for interacting with relational databases.","Embodiments extend the relational model and language of standard SQL, to recognize features of higher level entity-relationship models (ERMs). Annotation language is implemented in the data design language (DDL) that defines organization of data and associated metadata in a database, to incorporate tables and entities using DDL, annotations are typed structures of metadata. Annotations may be used for types, entities and elements. In the query language (QL), annotations may be added to the standard QL. A reflection program may use the metadata of the annotation language for reflection on the tables or entities.","A computer-implemented method according to an embodiment comprises providing a database organized according to a relational model; providing a database engine in communication with the database utilizing a language describing the relational model; providing an application comprising an entity-relationship model (ERM) including a first entity, a second entity, and a relationship between the first entity and the second entity, and elements; causing a query engine of the application to communicate a query to the database engine utilizing an annotation language, the annotation language comprising a typed structure of metadata related to the first entity, the second entity and the elements; and causing the database engine to return a query result to the query engine based upon the annotation language.","In various embodiments, the method further comprises reflecting at runtime on the annotation language.","A non-transitory computer readable storage medium embodies a computer program for performing a method comprising providing a database organized according to a relational model; providing a database engine in communication with the database utilizing a language describing the relational model; providing an application comprising an entity-relationship model (ERM) including a first entity, a second entity, and a relationship between the first entity and the second entity, and elements; causing a query engine of the application to communicate a query to the database engine utilizing an annotation language, the annotation language comprising a typed structure of metadata related to the first entity, the second entity and the elements; and causing the database engine to return a query result to the query engine based upon the annotation language.","An embodiment of a computer system comprises one or more processors and a software program executable on said computer system. The software program is configured to provide a database organized according to a relational model, provide a database engine in communication with the database utilizing a language describing the relational model, provide an application comprising an entity-relationship model (ERM) including a first entity, a second entity, and a relationship between the first entity and the second entity, and elements, and cause a query engine of the application to communicate a query to the database engine utilizing an annotation language, the annotation language comprising a typed structure of metadata related to the first entity, the second entity and the elements, and cause the database engine to return a query result to the query engine based upon the annotation language.","In various embodiments, the processor is further configured to reflect at runtime on the annotation language.","In various embodiments, the language comprises SQL.","In various embodiments, the annotation language is a chain of successively included annotation language.","In various embodiments, the annotation language is added to a pre-defined view of the ERM.","In various embodiments, the annotation language includes metadata on types, entities and elements in data model definitions of the ERM.","The following detailed description and accompanying drawings provide a better understanding of the nature and advantages of various embodiments.","Described herein are techniques for annotating language extensions of a relational model-based database language (e.g., Structured Query Language known as SQL), to accommodate higher level entity-relationship models. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous examples and specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention as defined by the claims may include some or all of the features in these examples alone or in combination with other features described below, and may further include modifications and equivalents of the features and concepts described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","105"]},"A lower layer  of the database system comprises calculation logic  that is designed to interact with the data  itself. Such calculation logic  may be performed by various engines (e.g., SQL engine, calculation engine, SQL script) in order to provide basic data definition and processing based on the relational model. Such basic data definition can include defining of data types making up the database, associated metadata, and the database structure (e.g. columns, tables). The lower layer  of the database system may include SQL script , as well as data structures such as tables , views , and calculation views .","The embodiment presented in  shows HANA, the in-memory database available from SAP AG of Walldorf, Germany, implemented as the database. However, embodiments are not limited to use with this particular database. Examples of other in-memory databases include, but are not limited to, the SYBASE IQ database also available from SAP AG; the Microsoft Embedded SQL for C (ESQL\/C) database available from Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash.; the Exalytics In-Memory database available from Oracle Corp. of Redwood Shores, Calif., etc.","Further, while the embodiment presented in  shows the database as comprising an in-memory database, various embodiments could be employed in conjunction with conventional disk-based database systems.","An application layer , overlying the calculation logic  of the database system  comprises control flow logic . The control flow logic  may be implemented utilizing River Definition Language (RDL)  and JavaScript (JS)  to reference model concepts such as entities and relationships that are not reflected in basic SQL. This control flow logic  may further comprise common languages for defining and consuming data across different containers (e.g. native, ABAP, Java).","As shown in , in order to facilitate the sharing of information across such different containers and thereby promote a more unified environment, the database system  may further comprise a Core Data Services (CDS) component . CDS component  comprises a common set of domain-specific languages (DSL) and services. The CDS component  may allow defining and consuming semantically rich data models as an integral part of the database structure, thereby permitting data modeling as well as the retrieval and processing of data to be raised to a higher semantic level that is closer to the conceptual thinking of domain experts. The role of the CDS component  is discussed in detail further below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["150","150","152","154","105","154","152","156","158","160"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","202","204","106","105","118","119","118","220","222","224","226"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["130","106","118","130","118","130"]},"In particular, the CDS component  implements higher-level Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) and services based on an entity-relationship model (ERM). The Data Definition Language (DDL)  is used for defining semantically rich data models, including the data types, associated metadata, and database organization (e.g., columns and tables). As mentioned throughout, according to embodiments, the DDL may be extended to further enrich these data models through the use of entities and annotations.","The Query Language (QL)  is used to conveniently and efficiently read data based on data models. It is also used to define views within data models. The role of the QL  and its relation to the DDL  is further illustrated in connection with .","The Expression Language (EL)  is used to specify calculated fields, default values, constraints, etc., within queries. Calculated fields, default values, and constraints may be specified as well as for elements in data models.","Other elements of the CDS component  can include Data Manipulation Language (DML)  and a Data Control Language (DCL) , both of which may be used to control access to data.","Embodiments as described herein may distinguish between the domain-specific languages DDL, QL, and EL as members of a language family. This approach fosters considerations such as modular design, incremental implementation, and reuse.  is a simplified view illustrating relationships between these language family members. A consistent language experience across the members of the family of  can be achieved by ensuring the languages follow a common style. This can extend to the host programming language, with expressions in DDL, QL, and EL code adopting the same syntax. Utilization of application level domain language(s) as has been described above, can offer certain benefits. One possible benefit is that the application domain level language can avoid the use of \u201cinefficient\u201d and error-prone code.","Take, for example, the following simple data model describing employee information:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"entity Employee {"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"name : String(77);"]},{"entry":[{},"salary : Amount;\u2003\/\/ a structured type"]},{"entry":[{},"orgunit : Association to OrgUnit;"]},{"entry":[{},"addresses : Association to Address[0..*] via entity"]},{"entry":[{},"Employee2Address;"]},{"entry":[{},"homeAddress = addresses[kind=home];\u2003\/\/ introduced later on"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"}"},{"entry":"entity OrgUnit {"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"name : String(111);"]},{"entry":[{},"costcenter : String(44);"]},{"entry":[{},"manager: Association to Employee;"]},{"entry":[{},"parent: Association to OrgUnit;"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"}"},{"entry":"entity Address {"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"key streetAddress; key zipCode; city;\u2003\/\/ omitted type defs"]},{"entry":[{},"kind : enum { home; business; }"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"}"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Under some circumstances, it may be desired to write a query statement as follows: SELECT id, name, homeAddress.zipCode FROM Employee WHERE . . . .","Within that sample snippet, path expressions along relationships are used to fetch data from an associated entity.

One issue is the use of an imperative coding style with loops in loops, resulting in 1+n queries being executed or too much data being fetched with a SELECT*statement.","The above code represents only a relatively simple case. A more complex case is found in the following example:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"SELECT FROM OrgUnit[boardarea=\u2018TIP\u2019]"]},{"entry":[{},".employees[salary>\u2018$100.000\u2019] {"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"addresses[kind=home].city, count(*)"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The preceding cases illustrate the importance of increasing expressiveness of the languages used in application development (here, the query language). This allows the intent of application developers to be captured, rather than being buried under substantial volumes of imperative boilerplate coding.","Such expressiveness is in turn is fundamental to having optimizations applied by the query engine (in a manner analogous to functional programming vs. imperative programming). This can affect system characteristics, such as its overall performance and scalability. Further, a language's ability to allow developers to draft concise and comprehensive code, can increase developer productivity. It can also reduce the risk of mistakes and also enhance readability, and thus increase the maintainability of the code.","In order to write concise and readable query statements, it is desirable to enrich the data definitions with sufficient metadata (e.g., about associations, semantic types, etc.). Accordingly, embodiments seek to extend the DDL to define data definitions with sufficient metadata, and seek to extend the QL to leverage such definitions.","DDL and QL are declarative, domain-specific languages providing developers with concise ways to express their models and queries. Certain concepts may originate from entity-relationship modeling (ERM). By adding native support for such concepts in the underlying engine of the database, embodiments avoid the impedance mismatch induced by the translation of conceptual models based on ERM into implementations based upon a plain relational model. In particular, writing concise and comprehensive code reduces risks of mistakes and increases readability and maintainability.","Moreover, as the concepts of entity-relationship models may lie at the core of many higher-level models, embodiments are able to capture the semantics of other data models (e.g., RDL-based data models), and share those semantics with database modelers, and\/or ABAP of SAP AG, or Java consumers. This reduces fragmentation and the loss of semantics. In addition, since ERM is also the chosen basis for technologies like OData EDM, embodiments can facilitate mapping entities and views to OData entity sets.","Embodiments may employ a functional approach that is based on standard SQL. In particular, the comprehensive, domain-specific nature of DDL and QL allows capturing the intent of application developers, thus avoiding a lack of clarity regarding that intent which can result from large volumes of imperative boilerplate coding. This follows the principles of functional programming and is important for optimizations.","The functional approach may be inherited from SQL. A SQL SELECT statement declares which sub-set of an overall data model is of interest as projections and selections. It may be left to the query engine to determine optimal execution, including parallelizing as appropriate.","In contrast with imperative object traversing patterns, embodiments can speed up many data retrieval use cases. While many of those retrieval cases are not individually expensive, the cumulative impact of this streamlining can have significant impacts on scalability, as it affects all requests over long periods of time.","Embodiments address some of the complexity offered by standard SQL to typical application developers by raising the basis of SQL from plain relational models to the level of conceptual models. This is done by providing native support for ERM in the database system. In this manner, the use of SQL may be reestablished for most application developers, not only for those with the SQL expertise for specific optimization tasks.","Embodiments employ associations in DDL. Specifically, the DDL allows definition of data models as entity-relationship models on a semantically rich level that is close to actual conceptual thought. To achieve this over the conventional relational model of standard SQL, certain concepts are captured by the embodiments described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","401","402"]},"Another concept underlying entities as described herein, involves employing associations  on a conceptual level. This approach contrasts with the conventional use of hand-managed foreign keys. Associations define relationships between entities, and are specified by adding an element with an association type to a source entity  that points to a target entity . As shown in the , the relationship implemented by the association type, between source entity type and the target entity type, reflects the actual relationship between entities in the overlying ERM model . Using the type definition, associations may capture metadata about relationships present in the ERM in a \u2018reflectable\u2019 way. According to such a reflectable characteristic, a consuming portion of code receiving a piece of data from the database can get back to the type information (i.e., metadata) provided for the respective elements in the data model.","The association may be complemented by optional further information (e.g., regarding cardinality, which keys to use, additional filter conditions, etc.) up to a complete JOIN condition. According to embodiments, the clause-based syntax style of standard SQL may be adopted for specifying the various parameters without sacrificing readability.","In addition, the extended DDL works with custom-defined Types instead of being limited to primitive types only. The extended DDL may also add other enhancements, such as annotations, to enrich the data models with additional metadata, constraints, or calculated fields.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502"]},"In a second step , a database engine is provided in communication with a database utilizing a language describing the relational model.
