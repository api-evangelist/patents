title: Shape memory alloy device and control method
abstract: A preferred rotary actuator includes an actuator assembly having a torque tube formed of a shape memory alloy (SMA), a superelastic NiTinol return spring associated with the torque tube and adapted to bias the torque tube toward an initial position, and a torque tube heating element, especially a thermoelectric device, for switching the SMA to cause rotation to an object connected to the actuator or to generate a torque upon that object. The torque tube () includes a proximal end () and a distal end (). The return spring and torque tube are connected at their ends, with the torque tube being pretwisted while in a martensitic state relative to the spring. Activation of the heating element causes the torque tube to enter an austenitic state in which it returns to its previous untwisted configuration. Removal of heat allows the torque tube to return to a martensitic state, when the return spring retwists the torque tube. A unique locking assembly  is used with the preferred actuator assembly. A helicopter blade twist rotation system for a rotorcraft blade  having a blade root  and a tip  includes a SMA rotary actuator  located within the blade near the blade root, and a passive torque tube () located within the blade and having a proximal end connected to the rotary actuator and a distal end connected to the blade near to the blade tip.

No. 09\/514,561 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,499,952, filed Feb. 28, 2000, which was a continuation-in-part application based upon U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/032,415, filed Feb. 28, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,065,934, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/039,660, filed Feb. 28, 1997. We incorporate these applications by reference.","The U.S. Government may has an interest in this application under Contract MDA-972-F-30-0017.","The present invention relates to devices using shape memory alloys (SMA), especially SMA rotary actuators for flexing aerospace control surfaces, and to switching mechanisms and methods for controlling the switching of SMAs between states using thermoelectric devices.","Shape memory alloys (SMA) form a group of metals that have interesting thermal and mechanical properties. If a SMA material such as NiTinol is deformed while in a martensitic state (low yield strength condition) and then heated to its transition temperature to reach an austenitic state, the SMA material will resume its original (undeformed) shape. The rate of return to the original shape depends upon the amount and rate of thermal energy applied to the component. When the SMA material is cooled, it will return to the martensitic state and shape. Properties of and information about shape memory alloys can be found at http:\/\/www.sma-inc.com\/SMAPaper.html or http:\/\/www.SMA-mems.com\/info.html, which we also incorporate by reference.","The application of \u2018smart structures\u2019 to helicopter rotors has received widespread study in recent years, and is one thrust of the Shape Memory Alloy Consortium (SMAC) program, which Boeing leads. The SMAC program includes NiTinol fatigue\/characterization studies, SMA actuator development, and ferromagnetic SMA material development (offering increased actuation speed). An SMA torsional (i.e. rotary) actuator of the present invention for rotocraft (i.e., helicopters or tilt rotors) retwists a rotocraft blade in flight, and results in a significant payload gain for the vehicle.","Distributed fibers of piezo material embedded in a composite blade can accomplish dynamic twisting. Twists of a degree or two are adequate to achieve dynamic control of vibration and acoustics. By laying the piezo fibers at \u00b145\u00b0 to the blade axis and actuating the piezo material along the fiber direction, the piezo strain twists the blade about 2\u00b0, either dynamically at control frequencies (for vibration & noise reduction) or statically (for some payload increase). Implementing this technology requires high quality, low cost piezo fibers and high voltage, high power efficient drive amplifiers.","A second method of dynamic control uses a flap, actuated by a piezo stack actuator mounted on the rotor spar. A few degrees of flap motion provide adequate dynamic control of the rotor blade. This method also achieves vibration or acoustic benefits.","One key to getting good response out of an SMA such as NiTinol is to have a good cooling path. The NiTinol needs to be kept as thin as possible, consistent with the load requirements. In one actuator design, we surrounded a NiTinol torque tube with a thin brass tube wrapped with Nichrome foil heater tape. We initially wound the heater tape directly on the torque tube, but discovered that the tape could not stand the large torsion actuation strain the tube undergoes. The axial windings of the tape were nonuniform to help keep the tube at a constant, desired temperature, but the attachments for the tube made it difficult to achieve even, constant heating. The housing carries the heat load from the passive torque tube when the actuator was unpowered. Small air gaps within the actuator impose significant thermal resistance, and grease was required between the NiTinol\/brass and heater\/housing. The performance measured for the device suggests that 500 watts of power are required for a 20-second response as a nominal value of the power requirement for a \u2159-scale actuator. Scaling laws based upon our tests indicate that simply scaling this design (to full scale) would result in a heavy actuator requiring large power to achieve a constant response time, or, alternatively, would sacrifice response time at reasonable power requirements.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,127,228 describes a \u2018smart structure\u2019 actuator device having an inner SMA (e.g., NiTinol) torque tube seated concentrically within an outer SMA torque tube. Ends of both tubes are mechanically restrained to an indexed position. Because one tube provides torque clockwise while the other tube provides counter-clockwise torque, the tubes are arranged in an opposing manner. Initially, both SMA members are in a martensitic state. A power supply supplies current to heaters that are connected to one of the tubes to control switching of the SMA between memory states. Heating causes rotation of the actuator in a clockwise or counter-clockwise rotational direction, as desired. The electrical energy passing through the heater(s) causes the SMA to which the heater is connected to transition from its martensitic to austenitic state, resulting in the rotation. Control of the electrical power to the heaters allows holding the actuator in a selected rotational position or allows rotation in either rotational direction.","To maintain a specific rotational position in a loaded condition, the '228 device requires continuous electrical power to the heater elements for both SMA tubes. This shortcoming of the '228 device adds significant system weight and complexity and requires excessive power. The '228 device requires the addition of thermal insulation to isolate the tubes thermally or a skillful design so that the heater for one tube does not heat the wrong tube and, thereby, unintentionally create an actuator malfunction.","Other known SMA rotary actuators use a single SMA member to produce the desired reciprocating rotation at desired intervals. These devices use the SMA member to provide rotation in one direction, while using a mechanical spring, a flexure, or another suitable restorative device to provide rotation of the actuator in the return direction. The force achievable with mechanical springs is limited. Large springs having adequate force add considerable weight and mass to the actuator mechanism, which lessens performance and restricts their implementation. The mechanical springs also deteriorate over time, which limits the reliability of the actuator.","A need exists for a SMA rotary actuator to provide any or all of the following properties: (1) controllable torque either in low or high amount, (2) operation in both rotational direction using switching of the state of a single SMA member, locking at a desired rotational position without requiring constant supply of power to heaters associated with the SMA members, or (3) return rotation without applying electrical power. Such a rotary actuator should also be capable of generating a significant torque over a large angle of rotation. A small size and low weight also is beneficial for an improved device. The actuator of the present invention addresses these needs.","The present invention relates to improved control and operating efficient for a shape memory alloy (SMA) device using a thermoelectric device to pump heat between the SMA and a heat sink. In one preferred embodiment, the SMA device is a rotary actuator (SMA torque tube) and the heat sink is another rotary actuator associated with the first in antagonistic relationship. Such a device is particularly suited for flexing control surfaces in aircraft, particularly a rotocraft blade. Each actuator preferably includes a locking mechanism to allow shutdown of power to the SMA devices.","A preferred rotary actuator of the present invention includes an actuator assembly having a torque tube formed of a shape memory alloy (SMA). A superelastic NiTinol return spring or another SMA torque tube in antagonistic relationship is associated with the torque tube to bias the torque tube toward an initial position. A torque tube heating element, especially a thermoelectric device, transfers heat from the SMA to switch it between states. Such switching causes rotation to an object connected to the actuator or generates a torque upon that object. In a preferred embodiment the torque causes blade twist in a rotocraft blade.","We can increase the payload of a rotocraft by changing the blade twist distribution between hover (where a highly twisted blade is desired) and forward flight (where a less twisted blade is better). The preferred actuator of the present invention uses a SMA because of its high strain capability. The SMA is attached near the root of the rotor. A passive torque tube transfers torque generated by the switching of the SMA between the rotor root and the tip. Multiple stages can be used to implement a nonlinear optimum twist distribution better than current systems. Possible combinations of SMA quasi-static and piezo dynamic control also appear attractive. The development of magnetically activated SMA materials (ferromagnetics) introduces the possibility of both dynamic and quasi-static control without need for hydraulic systems. A payload gain of about 900 pounds is achievable with a twist change in the blade of an order of 8 degrees. Such a twist requires an input torque of about 24,000 inch-pounds for a full-scale blade. A minimum weight system rotates an SMA actuator about 30\u201360 degrees to wrap up a passive torque tube that is torsionally soft (relative to the blade stiffness). The passive torque tube then transfers the torque to the blade to produce the desired 8 degree twist. This system also reduces the impact of blade torsional dynamics where design must avoid resonances close to any of the harmonics of the spin speed.","A preferred rotary actuator of the present invention rotates or torques an object to which it is attached. The actuator includes a shape memory alloy (SMA) torque tube, a superelastic return spring connected to the torque tube, and a torque tube heater, especially one or more thermoelectric devices, positioned in contact with or near the torque tube to control switching of the SMA between memory states. The torque tube is longitudinally twisted relative to the superelastic return spring. The heater causes the torque tube to enter an austenitic state in which the torque tube returns to an untwisted configuration. Cooling the torque tube causes it to return to a martensitic state, thereby allowing the superelastic return spring to retwist the torque tube to the initial rotational position.","A preferred locking assembly includes a housing, a lock socket having locked and unlocked positions, a spring positioned between the socket and the housing, and at least one SMA actuator rod stretched while in a martensitic state to interconnect between the housing and the lock socket to achieve the desired locking condition. A heating element is associated with the SMA rod to heat the rod to control its switching between states. The torque tube and the superelastic return spring are also usually located within the housing with either the torque tube or the superelastic return spring being connected to the housing. In a first position, the socket cannot be rotated separately relative to the connector. In the other socket position, however, the socket is rotatably disengaged from the connector. The spring continuously urges the socket into its first (locked) position. The actuator rod or rods are trained for memory in length. Activating the heating element causes the rod to shrink. Then, the socket moves to its second position to allow rotation of the connector and the attached superelastic return spring.","A helicopter blade twist rotation system of the present invention twists a helicopter blade having a blade root end, a blade tip end, and a longitudinal spar extending from the blade root end toward the blade tip. The preferred blade twist rotation system connects our SMA rotary actuator to the blade spar near the blade root, and connects a torsionally flexible passive torque tube to the blade spar. The passive torque tube is connected to the rotary actuator and to the blade near to the blade tip. Rotation of the rotary actuator rotates the torque tube with rotation of the proximal end being greater than rotation of the torque tube distal end. Such twisting of the blade can produce a greater than 80% reduction in vibration, a 5\u201310 dB reduction in BVI acoustic noise while providing the payload increase (about 15% of the rated capacity for the V-22).","The present invention is primarily described with reference to a preferred SMA rotary actuator. The concept of controlling the SMA device with a thermoelectric device is braodly applicable to a host of SMA device applications. Operation of the actuator is achieved with a switchable SMA member that is prestrained in one position. Mechanical rotational force is provided by the SMA member to an object when thermal energy is applied to the SMA member to the point where the SMA material changes from the martensitic condition to the austenitic condition. The speed of rotation is controlled by the rate and amount of heat applied to the SMA member. Rotational position is monitored by a sensor and a desired position is held by a locking mechanism. When rotation in the opposite direction is required, the lock is disengaged and a superelastic SMA return spring provides the mechanical force required to rotate the SMA member (and hence the output of the device) back to the neutral position.","A rotary actuator  formed in accordance with the present invention includes an actuator assembly  and preferably a locking assembly . The actuator assembly provides torque between two objects. The actuator assembly includes a SMA torque tube  and a torsional superelastic return spring . The torque tube  is twisted while in a martensitic state and then attached at both ends to the spring  using mating pin and pin-hole pairs. The spring  is composed of a nickel-titanium (NiTinol) SMA whose composition and processing is such as to enhance superelastic properties. The preferred SMA provides a high energy spring at actuator operating temperatures. In the superelastic form, the material does not exhibit shape memory properties during normal use. Heating the SMA torque tube  causes the tube to return to its memory (pretwisted) shape, thereby causing angular rotation in one direction. Rotation occurs because the strength of the austenitic torque tube is greater than the resisting strength of the superelastic return spring.","After discontinuing the application of heat, the torque tube cools and returns to its martensitic state. The spring  rotates the actuator assembly in the opposite direction, thus causing the tube  to return to its previous twisted state. The locking assembly  is provided to keep the actuator assembly  in a desired angular orientation without having to apply heat continuously. This type of actuator is suited for use in rotocraft blades, wind turbines, propellers, control surfaces for airplane wings, fan blades, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIGS. 1\u201311","FIGS. 12 and 13","FIGS. 14A and 14B","FIGS. 15A and 15B","FIGS. 16A and 16B","FIGS. 17 and 18","FIG. 19"]},"Referring to , the actuator assembly  includes the torque tube , the spring , a connector , and a heating element  for the torque tube (.)

The connector  connects the torque tube  to the locking assembly  and also connects the assembly to an object to be rotated .","In , the SMA torque tube  is shaped as a cylinder having a proximal end , a distal end , and an intermediate portion . The ends ,  are preferably structurally reinforced to provide sufficient integrity during connection with the superelastic return spring . First and second retaining holes ,  extend through the distal end . Each hole is formed in an orientation transverse to the torque tube longitudinal centerline. The proximal end  includes a first retaining hole  formed in a like manner.","The dimensions of the torque tube  will vary according to the design requirements of a particular application. In general, the torque tube inner and outer diameters influence the amount of torque available from the actuator and should be selected accordingly. The tube  is formed of a shape memory alloy, e.g., 55-NiTinol or the like. Since the torque tube  will be repeatedly switched between its martensitic and austenitic states, it is important to select an alloy having a transition temperature that is appropriate for that application. Prior to assembly, the torque tube must undergo torsion strain and recovery cycling to be trained in memory.","The superelastic return spring  is preferably shaped as a rod having a distal end , a proximal end , a tube-connection portion  located near the proximal end , and an intermediate portion  extending between the tube-connection portion  and the proximal end . The tube-connection portion  includes a retaining hole  oriented transverse to the torque tube longitudinal centerline. The distal end  includes first and second retaining holes ,  formed in a like manner.","The tube-connection portion  and distal end  shown in  have a diameter that is larger than the intermediate portion  diameter. The spring  may alternatively be formed having a single diameter. Similar to the torque tube , the superelastic return spring ends ,  are structurally sufficient to provide a sure connection with the torque tube . The specific dimensions of the torque tube  spring  will depend on the to the design requirements of a particular application, e.g., the torsional loading requirements, the angle of rotation, etc.","As shown in , the preferred connector  is a relatively short tubular member having a first end , a second end , and a middle portion . The connector first end  is connected to the proximal end  of the superelastic return spring.

The structure  is attached to the housing, generally with thermal epoxy, to keep it from rotating. Gaps between the torque tube  and heating element  are filled with thermal grease to improve thermal conductivity between the two. The grease also allows the tubular structure to function as a bearing to hold the SMA torque tube.","The tubular structure  is formed from a heat conductive material, e.g., brass, copper, aluminum, steel, Inconel, titanium, silver, gold, etc. The structure walls are formed of a thickness sufficient to provide even heat distribution. The first and second thin layers ,  are also formed from a thermally conductive material, though, significantly less thick than the tubular structure, and, preferably, thermally conductive epoxy due to the ease at which it may be applied. The first layer is thinner (or, more specifically, less thermally resistive) than the second layer so that during heating, more heat will flow toward the SMA torque tube than to the housing. The second layer should still be sufficiently thermally conductive to promote rapid heat transfer to the housing. In this regard, a design compromise must be made between the desired response time and power required to heat the torque tube  versus the time needed to cool the tube to affect its transition back to the martensitic state.","When power is supplied to the heating element, heat flows from the heating element  or  to the torque tube . With the current off, the heating element  conducts heat from the torque tube  to the housing , which acts as a heat sink for the actuator. Conductive heat transfer to the housing improves response time.","If heating element  is used, the actuator assembly  is assembled by placing the element  () concentrically around the intermediate portion  of the return spring  (). The combination is inserted into the interior of the torque tube . The power leads  of the heating element  pass through one or more longitudinal slots  formed in the outer surface of the distal end  of the return spring and are connected to a power source (not shown). The torque tube  and return spring  are secured to each other by placing a retaining pin  through aligned holes ,  on the torque tube and return spring.","If heating element  () is used, the tubular structure  is attached to the housing. The return spring  is inserted into the interior of the torque tube .

A second retaining pin  is inserted through aligned holes  and  in the proximal ends of the torque tube and return spring. The twisted (biased) torque tube and untwisted return spring are slip fit into the housing  or housing\/heating element . When using element , the gap between the torque tube  and element  is filled with thermal grease.","When the heating element  or  is activated, heating causes the torque tube to change to its austenitic state, and, in doing so, to return to its pre-strained (or untwisted) configuration. Rotation of the torque tube  during this transition of the SMA causes the return spring  to rotate when the torque tube  cools and converts back to the martensitic state, the return spring forces the torque tube back to its untwisted configuration.","A superelastic return spring provides the advantage of maintaining a generally constant force over the actuation stroke and provides a high energy density relative to other choices for springs. The actuation (retwisting) is automatic and passive.","A locking assembly of the present invention includes a socket  (, , ), a yoke  (, ), a housing  (), a compression spring  (, ), a pair of linear SMA actuator rods  (, , ), and a pair of rod heating elements  (, .)

Therefore, in an austenitic state, the SMA cylinders will lengthen to their memory size.","To assemble locking assembly , opposed inner faces ,  of the housing are stretched apart and the brake cylinder  is inserted into the housing through-hole  until the cylinder aligns with the housing longitudinal hole . The housing faces are released and the shaft  is inserted into the housing longitudinal hole  and the cylinder . The shaft  is held with pins . The shaft  is connected to the return spring  via the connector , and the brake housing  is connected to the housing  through two screws , \u2032 that interconnect between the housing proximal end  and corresponding screw holes , \u2032 in the housing.","The assembled brake housing  is under tension, being stretched by the inserted cylinder. A significant frictional force is applied between the cylinder end surfaces and the housing's inner faces , . Because the shaft  is connected to the cylinder  and the cylinder is frictionally restrained from rotating, the shaft  and the return spring  are also restrained from rotating.","Activating the heating elements , \u2032 heats the pair of SMA cylinders , \u2032, causing them to elongate and push the opposed platforms , \u2032 and , \u2032 apart, which releases their frictional contact with the cylinder ends. The shaft  is thereby free to rotate with the return spring  when the SMA torque tube  is heated.","The locking assembly is usually engaged, thereby preventing actuator rotation in its passive or rest condition. Upon application of heat to the linear SMA actuator rods  or the SMA cylinders , \u2032 and their transition into the austenitic state, however, the lock is released and the actuator assembly is activated to provide torque.","A rotary actuator of the type described can provide a significant amount of torque in one direction of rotation or both directions, if desired. If only one direction of torque is required, then the heat to the SMA torque tube may be discontinued and the return spring may be used to zero the actuator. If it is desired to still provide some resistance during the return path, the SMA torque tube may be heated according to a schedule that produces the desired resistance. If torque is required in both directions of rotation, the return spring may be increased in strength and heat may be varied appropriately.","The preferred rotary actuator generates high mechanical rotational force, can be locked into multiple positions without continuous use of electrical power, and automatically returns to the neutral position when the lock disengages.","The benefits of the actuator of the present invention are particularly advantageous when applied to rotocraft blades.  shows a rotary actuator used to twist a rotocraft blade  (shown in phantom) about a longitudinal axis. Traditionally, the blade includes a longitudinal twist profile that is of a fixed geometry, determined as a compromise between the blade position desired for optimal hover performance and the blade position desired for optimal cruise performance. Many systems use an actuator to twist the blade by nearly the full amount rotated by the actuator. For example, a 12 degree actuator rotation would produce about a 12 degree wing tip rotation. These systems require a heavy, stiff, torque tube having only minimal torsional distortion properties. Heavy torque tubes are impractical for rotocraft blade applications.","Our preferred SMA rotary actuator  provides sufficiently high angle output and high torque output to allow the use of a torsionally flexible passive torque tube that is lightweight compared with stiff torque tubes. Instead of a one-to-one correlation between the actuator rotation angle and the blade tip rotation angle, our actuator rotates much more than is necessary at the blade tip and produces the desired blade tip rotation. Further, the present invention actuator is sufficiently small to fit into thin rotocraft blades.","Referring to , the blade includes a blade root  connected to a conventional hub (not shown) and a blade tip . The blade comprises a structural spar  extending longitudinally and a surrounding aerodynamically-shaped structure . Referring to , the cross-sectional shape of the spar is generally rectangular. The cross-sectional shape of the skins is of a cambered airfoil. Other shapes may be used. A rotary actuator  is attached within the spar near the blade root. Shown in , the rotary actuator housing distal end is connected to helicopter blade root structure using a blade connection mechanism . Referring to , the rotary actuator housing distal end is shaped to mate with the inner spar surface to further reducing the possibility of rotary motion between the housing and the spar.","A passive torque tube  is positioned within the blade spar and includes a distal end  connected to the blade tip  via a tip connection mechanism . The passive torque tube  further includes a proximal end  connected to the rotary actuator . The rotary actuator  shown in  is the embodiment described above with reference to . Therefore, the passive torque tube proximal end  is connected to the actuator connector second end . Various support components  are optionally provided and located along the distance of the passive torque tube  within the spar.","During use, the angular output of the rotary actuator  is much greater than the angle needed at the blade tip. The passive torque tube proximal end  follows the actuator output. The connection of the passive torque tube  at the blade tip provides a counter-acting rotational torque at the tube's distal end . The result is a twist rotation of the spar such that the resulting blade tip rotation angle is of the desired amount. The passive torque tube  is preferably sized and formed according to the angular twist requirements of the blade, the stiffness of the spar and surrounding structure, and the angular twist capability of the actuator.","In one preferred embodiment, rotation of the rotary actuator by about 50 degrees causes rotation of the passive torque tube by about 42 degrees and rotation of the blade by about 8 degrees. Preferred maximum rotary actuator rotations are in the range of about 30\u00b0\u201360\u00b0. Preferred passive torque tube maximum rotations (as measured end-to-end) are in the range of about 18\u00b0\u201354\u00b0. Preferred maximum longitudinal blade tip rotations are in the range of about 6\u00b0\u201312.","The rotary actuator allows the helicopter blade twist angle to be changed between cruise and hover operating conditions, significantly improving helicopter performance. This blade twist system minimizes system weight and minimally impacts rotocraft blade torsion stiffness.","A preferred actuator of the present invention possesses nearly the energy density of a traditional hydraulic actuator, but it is electrically controllable. The actuator competes with hydraulics in applications requiring slow to modest switching, although thermoelectric devices  () improve the switching rate by controlling the total heat involved with operation of the actuator. The thermoelectric devices function much like heat pipes to contain heat within the vicinity where it is beneficial to switch the SMA materials. The drawbacks associated with resistance heating of the SMA or other heating designs are largely avoided. Many applications for the actuator are possible. In the aerospace area, control surface actuation is obvious, including thrust vector control. Single event applications, like speed brakes, might also be possible. Actuation of landing gear, especially in cold weather or at high altitude, is another possible application. In industrial areas, the devices are suitable for lifting, positioning, holding, or moving objects, especially in cold temperatures where hydraulics have problems. A myriad of applications for automobiles and farm equipment that use hydraulic systems today could be converted to electrical actuation.","One way to cool the SMA in our actuators efficiently is to use thermoelectric devices . Instead of relying upon heat flow (a temperature gradient between materials or areas), however, to generate a voltage in a thermocouple mode for the thermoelectric devices, we supply power to the device(s)  to cause heat to flow from one side of the device to the other side. The efficiency (i.e., the Coefficient of Performance or COP) of a thermoelectric device can be roughly categorized by the heat flow divided by the input power. Where large thermal gradients naturally exist, little additional electric power need be supplied to a thermoelectric device to maintain it in the cooling mode, as is understood with the Seebeck effect.","Advanced thermoelectric devices and their performance including discussion of the Peltier effect and Seebeck effect is provide in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/972,636, which we incorporate by reference. Thermoelectric devices suitable for use in the present application are commercially available from MELCOR (Materials Electronic Products Corp.) and other sources. Devices providing high COP are preferred.","Ferromagnetic SMA, if achieved will provide large, free strain when compared with the similar piezo, electrostrictive and magnetostrictive materials. Currently, 4.5% field switched ferromagnetic material has been demonstrated, and 0.5% reversible strain has similarly been shown. Nevertheless, much work remains between the current compositional (alloy formulation) studies on small laboratory samples of material and implementation of these ferromagnetic SMA materials in practical applications. Such development work includes identifying the magnetic field levels necessary to energize these materials. Ten percent (10%) reversible strain materials are thought possible. The robustness of SMA materials, their high potential energy density, rapid development, and the like justify continuing this research. The University of Washington research concentrates on field induced martensitic transformation and development of materials where the Curie temp is close to the martensitic transformation temperature. Such alloys would require temperature control in the system, but would allow rapid actuation of cyclic operation if the internal material losses are small. Others are researching twin boundary motion (similar to a thermomechanical SMA) to allow operating over a large temperature range. There are a wide variety of materials being investigated, but currently the NiMnGa and Fe (Ni,Pd Co,Ti) alloys are receiving significant effort.","A major challenge for the blade twist application is to package the actuator within the \u00bd\u2033 thick blade, particularly if a lock is included in the actuator package. Our preferred actuator consists of a NiTinol torque tube, a superelastic return spring, and a NiTinol actuated lock. This actuator provides 120 in-lb output but weighs only 0.29 pounds. The NiTinol torque tube is only a small part (17%) of this weight.","The survival temperature requirements for helicopters usually dictate use of a high temperature SMA material to avoid inadvertent actuation. One of the key requirements is to meet the response and simultaneous actuation requirement to keep the blades from excessive vibration. While a CH-47 blade is considerably more slender than a V-22 blade, its actuation torque requirements are higher because of the tip softness on the V-22 blade.","In our preferred actuator, the actuation torque is developed by a thin wall binary NiTinol tube. It is important to minimize the amount of NiTinol and thus decrease its thermal response time. The large (60\u00b0) rotation can be developed by a few inches of NiTinol within its load\/strain capabilities. The superelastic NiTinol return spring provides a positive return load to guarantee the blade returns to its untwisted condition. The key challenges in developing the actuator were in load\/packaging, thermal response, developing NiTinol fabrication techniques, NiTinol creep, and linear controllability. Successful tubes have been tested for over 12,000 cycles, but we are still striving to achieve lighter designs by reducing the wall thickness of the tubes while still achieving the desired loads. The thermal response improves as less SMA material is used in each tube.","The lock allows unpowering the actuator when the rotocraft is in its cruise mode. The lock, however, adds considerable complexity. Positive engagement designs (i.e., locks) allow limited angular resolution while other designs (i.e., brakes) permit infinite resolution by relying on friction. The preferred lock uses a multi-tooth load sharing spline () to allow packaging within the blade.","For control, we use an angular transducer (potentiometer of Hall effect device) and PID control electronics with a PWM drive amplifier. By using large integral gains, we have been able to deal with NiTinol hysteresis. Linear control has been routinely demonstrated before with antagonistic SMA elements, but here the small superelastic rod provides this return torque.","Even more challenging is the control of the integrated actuator and lock. The tube can be rotationally positioned as above, but the additional issue was engaging and disengaging the fine tooth spline under load. With the lock disengaged, the tube was rotated to the desired angle under load. The electronics stored the tube temperature required at the given load & angle, and then engaged the NiTinol actuated spline lock (the actuator is unpowered during forward flight). To disengage the lock and retwist the blade (i.e., upon landing), the torque tube is heated to the appropriate temperature to carry the load, and the lock disengaged. Having the torque tube carry the load minimizes binding on the spline lock during disengagement by the linear NiTinol actuation rods.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0102"},"figref":"FIGS. 17 & 18","b":["111","171","173","175","177","179","171","179"]},"Rapid heat flow between the SMA materials allows higher response speeds, reduces power requirements for the system, and reduces weight. The additional TECs connect the actuator to the load for long-term thermal control. Electrical heaters might also be used with each tube to provide better overall thermal control and to enhance speed further.","Antagonistic tubes  and  in opposition enhances the overall efficiency. In an alternative embodiment, however, the second active SMA tube can be replaced with a passive thermal sink and return spring, as we have described for the embodiments where TECs are not included. Without the TECs, low speeds of about 0.1 Hz or less are required because the SMAs cool slowly without active heat transfer.","In slightly different terminology,  shows an actuator having first and second opposed torque tubes  and  formed from shape memory alloy, like NiTinol.
