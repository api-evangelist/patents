In the present state of affairs, however, various layers are often formed between the support and the photosensitive layer for the purposes of, e.g., covering any defects of the surface of the support, protecting the photosensitive layer from any electrical breakdown, improving its charging performance, improving the blocking of injection of electric charges from the support into the photosensitive layer, and so forth.","Among such layers formed between the support and the photosensitive layer, a layer containing metal oxide particles is known as the layer formed for the purpose of covering any defects of the surface of the support. The layer containing metal oxide particles commonly has a higher electrical conductivity than a layer not containing any metal oxide particles (e.g., 5.0\u00d710to 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm as volume resistivity). Thus, even where it is formed in a large layer thickness, any residual potential at the time of image formation can not easily come to increase, and hence any defects of the support surface can be covered with ease.","The covering of defects of the support surface by providing between the support and the photosensitive layer such a layer having a higher electrical conductivity (hereinafter \u201cconductive layer) makes the support surface have a great tolerance for its defects. As the results, this makes the support have a vastly great tolerance for its use, and hence brings an advantage that the electrophotographic photosensitive member can be improved in productivity.","Patent Literature 1 discloses a technique in which tin oxide particles doped with phosphorus are used in a layer formed between the support and the photosensitive layer. Patent Literature 2 also discloses a technique in which tin oxide particles doped with tungsten are used in a protective layer formed on the photosensitive layer. Patent Literature 3 still also discloses a technique in which titanium oxide particles coated with oxygen deficient tin oxide are used in a conductive layer formed between the support and the photosensitive layer. Patent Literatures 4 and 5 still also disclose a technique in which barium sulfate particles coated with tin oxide are used in a layer formed between the support and the photosensitive layer. Patent Literature 6 still also discloses a technique in which titanium oxide particles coated with indium oxide doped with tin (indium oxide-tin oxide) are used in a layer formed between the support and the photosensitive layer.","PTL 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H06-222600","PTL 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2003-316059","PTL 3: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2007-047736","PTL 4: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H06-208238","PTL 5: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H07-295270","PTL 6: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H11-007145","However, studies made by the present inventors have revealed that charging lines comes to tend to occur in reproduced images when images are formed in a low-temperature and low-humidity environment by using an electrophotographic photosensitive member employing as the conductive layer any layer containing such metal oxide particles as the above. The charging lines refer to line-like faulty images appearing in the direction perpendicular to the peripheral direction of the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member, which are caused by a lowering of uniformity in surface potential (i.e., non-uniform charging) of an electrophotographic photosensitive member when the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member is electrostatically charged, and tend to remarkably appear when halftone images are reproduced.","An object of the present invention is to provide an electrophotographic photosensitive member that can not easily cause such charging lines even where it is an electrophotographic photosensitive member employing as the conductive layer the layer containing metal oxide particles, and a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus which have such an electrophotographic photosensitive member.","The present invention is an electrophotographic photosensitive member which comprises a support, a conductive layer formed on the support, and a photosensitive layer formed on the conductive layer, wherein;","the conductive layer contains a binding material, and titanium oxide particles coated with tin oxide doped with phosphorus or tungsten.","The present invention is also a process cartridge which integrally supports the above electrophotographic photosensitive member and at least one means selected from the group consisting of a charging means, a developing means, a transfer means and a cleaning means, and is detachably mountable to the main body of an electrophotographic apparatus.","The present invention is still also an electrophotographic apparatus which comprises the above electrophotographic photosensitive member, and a charging means, an exposure means, a developing means and a transfer means.","According to the present invention, it can provide an electrophotographic photosensitive member that can not easily cause charging lines even where it is an electrophotographic photosensitive member employing as the conductive layer the layer containing metal oxide particles, and a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus which have such an electrophotographic photosensitive member.","The electrophotographic photosensitive member of the present invention is an electrophotographic photosensitive member having a support, a conductive layer formed on the support, and a photosensitive layer formed on the conductive layer. The photosensitive layer may be a single-layer type photosensitive layer which contains a charge-generating material and a charge-transporting material in a single layer, or may be a multi-layer type photosensitive layer formed in layers of a charge generation layer which contains a charge-generating material and a charge transport layer which contains a charge-transporting material. A subbing layer may also optionally be provided between the conductive layer and the photosensitive layer.","As the support, it may preferably be one having conductivity (a conductive support). For example, a metallic support may be used which is made of a metal, such as aluminum, an aluminum alloy or stainless steel. Where aluminum or an aluminum alloy is used, usable are an aluminum pipe produced by a production process having the step of extrusion and the step of drawing, and an aluminum pipe produced by a production process having the step of extrusion and the step of ironing. Such aluminum pipes can achieve a good dimensional precision and surface smoothness without requiring any surface cutting and besides are advantageous in view of cost as well. However, burr-like protruding defects tend to come on the surfaces of these non-cut aluminum pipes, and hence it is especially effective to provide the conductive layer.","In the present invention, for the purpose of covering any defects of the surface of the support, a conductive layer which contains a binding material and titanium oxide (TiO) particles coated with tin oxide (SnO) doped with phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W), is formed on the support. The titanium oxide (TiO) particles coated with tin oxide (SnO) doped with phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W) are hereinafter also termed \u201cphosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles\u201d.","The conductive layer may preferably have a volume resistivity of 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less, and much preferably 5.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less. If a layer having too high volume resistivity is provided on the support as the layer for covering any defects of the surface of the support, the flow of electric charges tends to stagnate therein to tend to increase in residual potential. Also, from the viewpoint of keeping the charging lines from occurring, too, it is preferable for the conductive layer to have a low volume resistivity. The conductive layer may on the other hand preferably have a volume resistivity of 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or more, and much preferably 5.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or more. If the conductive layer has too low volume resistivity, the electric charges flowing through the conductive layer may be so large in quantity that dots and\/or fog due to the injection of electric charges from the support into the photosensitive layer may tend to occur in reproduced images when images are repeatedly formed in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment.","How to measure the volume resistivity of the conductive layer of the electrophotographic photosensitive member is described below with reference to .","The volume resistivity of the conductive layer is measured in a normal-temperature and normal-humidity (23\u00b0 C.\/50% RH) environment. A tape  made of copper (Type No. 1181, available from Sumitomo 3M Limited) is stuck to the surface of a conductive layer  to make it serve as an electrode on the surface side of the conductive layer . A support  is also made to serve as an electrode on the back side of the conductive layer . A power source  and a current measuring instrument  are respectively set up; the former for applying voltage across the copper tape  and the support  and the latter for measuring electric current flowing across the copper tape  and the support .","To make the voltage applicable to the copper tape , a copper wire  is put on the copper tape , and then a tape  made of copper like the copper tape  is stuck from above the copper wire  to the copper tape  so that the copper wire  may not protrude from the copper tape , to fasten the copper wire  to the copper tape . To the copper tape , voltage is applied through the copper wire .","A background current value found when any voltage is not applied across the copper tape  and the support  is represented by I(A), a current value found when a voltage of 1 V having only a direct-current component is applied across the copper tape  and the support  is represented by I (A), the layer thickness of the conductive layer  is represented by d (cm) and the area of the electrode (copper tape ) on the surface side of the conductive layer  is represented by S (cm), where the value expressed by the following mathematical expression (1) is taken as volume resistivity \u03c1 (\u03a9\u00b7cm) of the conductive layer .\n\n\u03c1=1\/()\u00d7(\u03a9\u00b7cm)\u2003\u2003(1)\n","In this measurement, the level of electric current of extremely as small as 1\u00d710A or less is measured, and hence it is preferable to make the measurement by using as the current measuring instrument  an instrument that can measure an extremely small electric current. Such an instrument may include, e.g., a pA meter (trade name: 4140B) manufactured by Yokogawa Hewlett-Packard Company.","Incidentally, the volume resistivity of the conductive layer shows the like value in either of measurement made in the state only the conductive layer has been formed on the support or measurement made in the state the respective layers (photosensitive layer and so forth) on the conductive layer have been stripped off the electrophotographic photosensitive member so as to leave only the conductive layer on the support.","In the present invention, composite particles having core particles (titanium oxide (TiO) particles) and coat layers (phosphorus (P)- or tungsten (W)-doped tin oxide (SnO) layers) are used as the metal oxide particles to be used in the conductive layer. This is to improve dispersibility of metal oxide particles in a conductive layer coating fluid used in forming the conductive layer. If any phosphorus (P)- or tungsten (W)-doped tin oxide (SnO) particles (particles composed of only phosphorus (P)\u2014 or tungsten (W)-doped tin oxide (SnO)) are used as the metal oxide particles, the metal oxide particles in the conductive layer coating fluid tend to have a large particle diameter, so that protruding spotty defects may occur on the surface of the conductive layer or the conductive layer coating fluid may become low stable.","The titanium oxide (TiO) particles are used as the core particles, because their use is highly effective in keeping the charging lines from occurring, and further because such particles have so low transparency as to easily cover any defects on the surface of the support. On the other hand, if, e.g., barium sulfate particles are used as the core particles, this makes it difficult to keep the charging lines from occurring. In addition, because of their high transparency as metal oxide particles, this may additionally require any material for covering the defects on the surface of the support.","Not any uncoated titanium oxide (TiO) particles, but the phosphorus (P)- or tungsten (W)-doped tin oxide (SnO) coated titanium oxide (TiO) particles are used as the metal oxide particles, because such uncoated titanium oxide (TiO) particles tend to make the flow of electric charges stagnate when images are formed, to tend to result in an increase in residual potential.","In addition, the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles are more highly effective in keeping the charging lines from occurring than titanium oxide (TiO) particles coated with oxygen deficient tin oxide (SnO). Further, compared with the titanium oxide (TiO) particles coated with oxygen deficient tin oxide (SnO), the former particles are less causative of any increase in volume resistivity in a low-humidity environment and any decrease in volume resistivity in a high-humidity environment, an also have superior environmental stability.","Incidentally, how to produce the phosphorus (P)- or tungsten (W)-doped tin oxide (SnO) coated titanium oxide (TiO) particles is also disclosed in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open No. H06-207118 and No. 2004-349167.","In order for the conductive layer to keep its volume resistivity within the above range, it is preferable to use, in preparing the conductive layer coating fluid used in forming the conductive layer, phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles having a powder resistivity of from 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or more to 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less. The phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles may more preferably have a powder resistivity of from 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or more to 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less, much preferably from 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or more to 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less, and much more preferably from 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or more to 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less. If the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles have too high powder resistivity, it is difficult to control the conductive layer to have the volume resistivity of 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less, or 5.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less. If on the other hand the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles have too low powder resistivity, the electrophotographic photosensitive member to be produced tends to have a low chargeability.","In the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles, the tin oxide (SnO) may preferably be in a proportion (coverage) of from 10% by mass to 60% by mass, and much preferably from 15% by mass to 55% by mass. To control the coverage of the tin oxide (SnO), a tin raw material necessary to form the tin oxide (SnO) must be compounded when the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles are produced. For example, such compounding must be what has taken account of the tin oxide (SnO) that is formed from a tin raw material tin chloride (SnCl). Here, the coverage of the tin oxide (SnO) is defined to be a value calculated from the mass of tin oxide (SnO) that is based on the total mass of the tin oxide (SnO) and the titanium oxide (TiO), without taking account of the mass of the phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W) with which the tin oxide (SnO) is doped. Any too small coverage of the tin oxide (SnO) makes it difficult to control the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles to have the powder resistivity of 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less. Any too large coverage thereof tends to make the titanium oxide (TiO) particles non-uniformly coated with tin oxide (SnO), and also tends to result in a high cost.","The phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W) with which the tin oxide (SnO) is doped (hereinafter also phosphorus or tungsten \u201cdoped to tin oxide\u201d) may preferably be in an amount (dope level) of from 0.1% by mass to 10% by mass based on the mass of the tin oxide (SnO) to be doped (the mass not inclusive of that of the phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W)). Any too small dope level of the phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W) with which the tin oxide (SnO) is doped makes it difficult to control the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles to have the powder resistivity of 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less. Any too large dope level of the phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W) with which the tin oxide (SnO) is doped makes the tin oxide (SnO) have a low crystallizability to make it difficult to control the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles to have the powder resistivity of from 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or more to 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less. In general, the doping of tin oxide (SnO) with phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W) can make particles have a low powder resistivity.","The powder resistivity of the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles is measured in a normal-temperature and normal-humidity (23\u00b0 C.\/50% RH) environment. In the present invention, a resistance measuring instrument manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (trade name: LORESTA GP) is used as a measuring instrument. The measurement object phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles are compacted at a pressure of 500 kg\/cmto prepare a pellet-shaped measuring sample. The powder resistivity is measured at an applied voltage of 100 V.","In order to more keep the charging lines from occurring, it is preferable for the electrophotographic photosensitive member to have a dielectric loss tan \u03b4 at frequency 1.0\u00d710Hz, of from 5\u00d710or more to 2\u00d710or less.","About the relationship between the charging lines and the dielectric loss tan \u03b4 of the electrophotographic photosensitive member, its details are unclear, and the present inventors consider it as stated below.","In the following, with respect to the direction of rotation of an electrophotographic photosensitive member, this side of a charging region (the region where the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member is electrostatically charged by a charging means) is called a charging region upstream side, and its opposite side is called a charging region downstream side. First, after the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member has been provided with electric charges on the charging region upstream side, the electric charges come provided in a smaller quantity on the charging region downstream side, so that there may be a case in which areas having been sufficiently charged and areas not having been sufficiently charged are mixedly present on the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member. In such a case, a potential difference may come about on the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member to come into non-uniform development, where line-like faulty images (tone non-uniformity) may occur in reproduced images in the direction falling at right angles with the peripheral direction of the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member. Such faulty images are the charging lines.","As one of the causes of this phenomenon, dielectric polarization is considered. The dielectric polarization is a phenomenon where displacement of electric charges takes place in a dielectric placed into an electric field. One type of this dielectric polarization is the orientation polarization that is caused by changes in direction of dipole moments in any molecules constituting that dielectric.","The relationship between the orientation polarization and the surface potential of the electrophotographic photosensitive member is described below, correlating it with how an electric field changes which has been applied to the electrophotographic photosensitive member when its surface is electrostatically charged.","The surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member is provided with electric charges on its charging region upstream side, whereupon the electric charges get on the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member. While the electric charges get on the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member, an electric field is produced by these electric charges (hereinafter called \u201cexternal electric field\u201d). Because of this external electric field, dipole moments inside the electrophotographic photosensitive member gradually come into polarization (orientation polarization). The sum of vectors of the dipole moments having thus polarized comes to the electric field that has been produced inside the electrophotographic photosensitive member as a result of the polarization (hereinafter called \u201cinternal electric field\u201d). With lapse of time, the polarization progresses, and the internal electric field becomes larger.","Next, taking account of the electric field intensity that applies to the whole electrophotographic photosensitive member, and where the electric charges on the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member are constant in quantity, the external electric field that such electric charges make up is constant. On the other hand, the internal electric field becomes larger with progress of the orientation polarization. The total sum of electric field intensities applying to the whole electrophotographic photosensitive member may be found by adding the external electric field and the internal electric field, thus it is considered that the total sum of electric field intensities decreases gradually with progress of the polarization.","In the course of progress of orientation polarization, the layer thickness of each layer of the electrophotographic photosensitive member substantially does not change, and hence the potential difference and the electric field are considered to stand a proportional relation, where the total sum of electric field intensities decreasing with progress of the orientation polarization causes a decrease in surface potential of the electrophotographic photosensitive member.","In order to estimate the progress of this orientation polarization, the dielectric loss tan \u03b4 is used in the present invention. The dielectric loss tan \u03b4 is the heat loss of energy that is based on the progress of orientation polarization in an alternating-current electric field, and serves as an index of time dependency of the orientation polarization. That the dielectric loss tan \u03b4 is large at a certain frequency means that the progress of orientation polarization at the time that corresponds to such a frequency is great. The decrease in surface potential of electrophotographic photosensitive member that is caused by the progress of orientation polarization is influenced by how far the orientation polarization progresses during the time (usually about 1.0\u00d710second) starting when the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member is provided with electric charges on its charging region upstream side and ending when the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member is provided with electric charges on its charging region downstream side. If the orientation polarization is not completed during this time, the orientation polarization may inevitably progress before the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member is provided with electric charges on its charging region downstream side, and hence the electrophotographic photosensitive member decreases in its surface potential, as so considered.","Thus, it is considered that measuring the dielectric loss tan \u03b4 enables prediction of the charging lines, and extent thereof, caused by the decrease in surface potential of electrophotographic photosensitive member that is attended by the progress of orientation polarization.","How to measure the dielectric loss tan \u03b4 of the electrophotographic photosensitive member is described below.","First, the electrophotographic photosensitive member is cut along its surface into small pieces (10 mm\u00d710 mm each). Where the electrophotographic photosensitive member is cylindrical, pieces with curved surfaces are each so stretched with a vise or the like as to become planar. On a piece made planar, gold (an electrode) of 600 nm in thickness is vacuum-deposited to prepare a measuring sample. In the present invention, it is vacuum-deposited by means of a sputtering apparatus (trade name: SC-707 QUICK COATER) manufactured by Sanyu Denshi Co., Ltd. This measuring sample is left to stand for 24 hours in a normal-temperature and normal-humidity (23\u00b0 C.\/50% RH) environment. After leaving, the dielectric loss tan \u03b4 of the electrophotographic photosensitive member measuring sample is measured in the like environment under conditions of a frequency of 1.0\u00d710Hz and an applied voltage of 100 mV. In the present invention, the dielectric loss tan \u03b4 is measured with an impedance analyzer (trade name: Frequency Response Analyzer Model 1260, Dielectric-Constant Interface Model 1296) manufactured by Solartron Co., Ltd.","The measuring sample may also be prepared by forming each layer like that of the measurement object electrophotographic photosensitive member on a support around which an aluminum sheet has been wound, thereafter cutting the aluminum sheet with each layer into small pieces (10 mm\u00d710 mm each), and then vacuum-depositing the gold (an electrode) thereon. Even with use of the measuring sample thus prepared, it shows the like value as above.","The volume resistivity of a conductive layer and the dielectric loss tan \u03b4 of the electrophotographic photosensitive member having the conductive layer have a correlation, where the dielectric loss tan \u03b4 of the electrophotographic photosensitive member having the conductive layer shows a tendency to increase with an increase in the volume resistivity of the conductive layer.","Where conductive layers have the like volume resistivity, the dielectric loss tan \u03b4 of the electrophotographic photosensitive member having the conductive layer containing the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles shows a tendency to come lower than the dielectric loss tan \u03b4 of any electrophotographic photosensitive member having a conductive layer containing conventional metal oxide particles. Hence, the use of the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles makes it easy to keep charging lines from occurring while keeping dots and\/or fog from occurring.","The conductive layer may be formed by coating a conductive layer coating fluid obtained by dispersing the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles in a solvent together with a binding material, and drying and\/or curing the wet coating formed. As a method for dispersion, it may include, e.g., a method making use of a paint shaker, a sand mill, a ball mill or a liquid impact type high-speed dispersion machine.","As the binding material (binder resin) used for the conductive layer, it may include, e.g., phenol resin, polyurethane resin, polyamide resin, polyimide resin, polyamide-imide resin, polyvinyl acetal resin, epoxy resin, acrylic resin, melamine resin, and polyester resin. Any of these may be used alone or in combination of two or more types. Also, of these, from the viewpoints of control of migration (melt-in) to other layers, adhesion to the support, dispersibility and dispersion stability of the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles and solvent resistance after film formation, hardening resins are preferred, and heat-hardening resins (thermosetting resins) are much preferred. Still also, of the thermosetting resins, thermosetting phenol resins and thermosetting polyurethane resins are preferred. Where such a thermosetting resin is used as the binding material for the conductive layer, the binding material to be contained in the conductive layer coating fluid serves as a monomer, and\/or an oligomer, of thermosetting resin.","The solvent used in preparing the conductive layer coating fluid may include, e.g., alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol; ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and cyclohexanone; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and propylene glycol monomethyl ether; esters such as methyl acetate and ethyl acetate; and aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene.","In the present invention, the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles (P) and binding material (B) in the conductive layer coating fluid may preferably be in a mass ratio (P\/B) of from 1.0\/1.0 or more to 3.5\/1.0 or less. Any too smaller quantity of the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles than the binding material may make it difficult to control the conductive layer to have the volume resistivity of 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less or 5.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less. On the other hand, any too larger quantity of the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles than the binding material may make it difficult to control the conductive layer to have the volume resistivity of 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or more or 5.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or more. Any too larger quantity of the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles than the binding material may also make it difficult to bind the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles, to tend to cause cracks in the conductive layer.","From the viewpoint of covering any defects of the surface of the support, the conductive layer may preferably have a layer thickness of from 10 \u03bcm or more to 40 \u03bcm or less, and much preferably from 15 \u03bcm or more to 35 \u03bcm or less.","In the present invention, the layer thickness of each layer, inclusive of the conductive layer, of the electrophotographic photosensitive member is measured with FISCHERSCOPE Multi Measurement System (mms), available from Fisher Instruments Co.","The phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles in the conductive layer coating fluid may preferably have an average particle diameter of from 0.10 \u03bcm or more to 0.60 \u03bcm or less, and much preferably from 0.15 \u03bcm or more to 0.45 \u03bcm or less. If the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles have too small average particle diameter, such oxide particles may come to agglomerate again after the conductive layer coating fluid has been prepared, to make the conductive layer coating fluid low stable or cause cracks in the conductive layer. If the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles have too large average particle diameter, the surface of the conductive layer may come so rough as to tend to cause local injection of electric charges therefrom into the photosensitive layer, so that dots may conspicuously appear in white background areas of reproduced images.","The average particle diameter of the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles in the conductive layer coating fluid may be measured by liquid-phase sedimentation in the following way.","First, the conductive layer coating fluid is so diluted with the solvent used in preparing the same, as to have a transmittance between 0.8 and 1.0. Next, a histogram of average particle diameter (volume base D50) and particle size distribution of the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles is prepared by using a centrifugal automatic particle size distribution measuring instrument. In the present invention, as the centrifugal automatic particle size distribution measuring instrument, a centrifugal automatic particle size distribution measuring instrument (trade name: CAPA700) manufactured by Horiba, Ltd. is used to make measurement under conditions of a number of revolutions of 3,000 rpm.","In order to keep interference fringes from appearing on reproduced images because of interference of light having reflected from the surface of the conductive layer, a surface roughness providing material for roughening the surface of the conductive layer may also be added to the conductive layer coating fluid. Such a surface roughness providing material may preferably be resin particles having an average particle diameter of from 1 \u03bcm or more to 5 \u03bcm or less (preferably 3 \u03bcm or less). Such resin particles may include, e.g., particles of hardening rubbers and of hardening resins such as polyurethane, epoxy resin, alkyd resin, phenol resin, polyester, silicone resin and acryl-melamine resin. Of these, particles of silicone resin are preferred as being less agglomerative. The specific gravity of resin particles (which is 0.5 to 2) is smaller than the specific gravity of the phosphorus- or tungsten-doped tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles (which is 4 to 7), and hence the surface of the conductive layer can efficiently be roughened at the time of formation of the conductive layer. However, the conductive layer has a tendency to increase in volume resistivity with an increase in content of the surface roughness providing material in the conductive layer. Hence, in order to control the volume resistivity of the conductive layer to be 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less, the content of the surface roughness providing material in the conductive layer coating fluid may preferably be from 1 to 80% by mass, and much preferably from 1 to 40% by mass, based on the mass of the binding material in the conductive layer coating fluid.","To the conductive layer coating fluid, a leveling agent may also be added in order to enhance the surface properties of the conductive layer. Pigment particles may also be added to the conductive layer coating fluid in order to improve covering properties of the conductive layer.","Between the conductive layer and the photosensitive layer, a subbing layer (also called a barrier layer or an intermediate layer) having electrical barrier properties may be provided in order to block the injection of electric charges from the conductive layer into the photosensitive layer.","The subbing layer may be formed by coating on the conductive layer a subbing layer coating fluid containing a resin (binder resin), and drying the wet coating formed.","The resin (binder resin) used for the subbing layer may include, e.g., water-soluble resins such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl methyl ether, polyacrylic acids, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, polyglutamic acid, casein, and starch; and polyamide, polyimide, polyamide-imide, polyamic acid, melamine resin, epoxy resin, polyurethane, and polyglutamate. Of these, in order to bring out the electrical barrier properties of the subbing layer effectively, thermoplastic resins are preferred. Of the thermoplastic resins, a thermoplastic polyamide is preferred. As the polyamide, copolymer nylon or the like is preferred.","The subbing layer may preferably have a layer thickness of from 0.1 \u03bcm or more to 2 \u03bcm or less.","In order to make the flow of electric charges not stagnate in the subbing layer, the subbing layer may also be incorporated with an electron-transporting material.","The photosensitive layer is formed on the conductive layer (a subbing layer).","The charge-generating material used in the photosensitive layer may include, e.g., azo pigments such as monoazo, disazo and trisazo, phthalocyanine pigments such as metal phthalocyanines and metal-free phthalocyanine, indigo pigments such as indigo and thioindigo, perylene pigments such as perylene acid anhydrides and perylene acid imides, polycyclic quinone pigments such as anthraquinone and pyrenequinone, squarilium dyes, pyrylium salts and thiapyrylium salts, triphenylmethane dyes, quinacridone pigments, azulenium salt pigments, cyanine dyes, xanthene dyes, quinoneimine dyes, and styryl dyes. Of these, preferred are metal phthalocyanines such as oxytitanium phthalocyanine, hydroxygallium phthalocyanine and chlorogallium phthalocyanine.","In the case when the photosensitive layer is the multi-layer type photosensitive layer, the charge generation layer may be formed by coating a charge generation layer coating fluid obtained by dispersing the charge generating material in a solvent together with a binder resin, and drying the wet coating formed. As a method for dispersion, a method is available which makes use of a homogenizer, ultrasonic waves, a ball mill, a sand mill, an attritor or a roll mill.","The binder resin used to form the charge generation layer may include, e.g., polycarbonate, polyester, polyarylate, butyral resin, polystyrene, polyvinyl acetal, diallyl phthalate resin, acrylic resin, methacrylic resin, vinyl acetate resin, phenol resin, silicone resin, polysulfone, styrene-butadiene copolymer, alkyd resin, epoxy resin, urea resin, and vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer. Any of these may be used alone or in the form of a mixture or copolymer of two or more types.","The charge generating material and the binder resin may preferably be in a proportion (charge generating material:binder resin) ranging from 10:1 to 1:10 (mass ratio), much preferably from 5:1 to 1:1 (mass ratio), and much more preferably from 3:1 to 1:1 (mass ratio).","The solvent used for the charge generation layer coating fluid may include, e.g., alcohols, sulfoxides, ketones, ethers, esters, aliphatic halogenated hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds.","The charge generation layer may preferably have a layer thickness of 5 \u03bcm or less, and much preferably from 0.1 \u03bcm or more to 2 \u03bcm or less.","To the charge generation layer, a sensitizer, an antioxidant, an ultraviolet absorber, a plasticizer and so forth which may be of various types may also optionally be added. An electron transport material (an electron accepting material such as an acceptor) may also be incorporated in the charge generation layer in order to make the flow of electric charges not stagnate in the charge generation layer.","The charge transporting material used in the photosensitive layer may include, e.g., triarylamine compounds, hydrazone compounds, styryl compounds, stilbene compounds, pyrazoline compounds, oxazole compounds, thiazole compounds, and triarylmethane compounds.","In the case when the photosensitive layer is the multi-layer type photosensitive layer, the charge transport layer may be formed by coating a charge transport layer coating fluid obtained by dissolving the charge transporting material and a binder resin in a solvent, and drying the wet coating formed.","The binder resin used to form the charge transport layer may include, e.g., acrylic resin, styrene resin, polyester, polycarbonate, polyarylate, polysulfone, polyphenylene oxide, epoxy resin, polyurethane, alkyd resin and unsaturated resins. Any of these may be used alone or in the form of a mixture or copolymer of two or more types.","The charge transporting material and the binder resin may preferably be in a proportion (charge transporting material:binder resin) ranging from 2:1 to 1:2 (mass ratio).","The solvent used in the charge transport layer coating fluid may include, e.g., ketones such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone, esters such as methyl acetate and ethyl acetate, ethers such as dimethoxymethane and dimethoxyethane, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene, and hydrocarbons substituted with a halogen atom, such as chlorobenzene, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride.","The charge transport layer may preferably have a layer thickness of from 3 \u03bcm or more to 40 \u03bcm or less, and much preferably from 5 \u03bcm or more to 30 \u03bcm or less, from the viewpoint of charging uniformity and image reproducibility.","To the charge transport layer, an antioxidant, an ultraviolet absorber, a plasticizer and so forth may also optionally be added.","In the case when the photosensitive layer is the single-layer type photosensitive layer, the single-layer type photosensitive layer may be formed by coating a single-layer type photosensitive layer coating fluid containing a charge generating material, a charge transporting material, a binder resin and a solvent, and drying the wet coating formed. As these charge generating material, charge transporting material, binder resin and solvent, the above various ones may be used.","For the purpose of protecting the photosensitive layer, a protective layer may also be provided on the photosensitive layer. The protective layer may be formed by coating a protective layer coating fluid containing a resin (binder resin), and drying and\/or curing the wet coating formed.","The binder resin used to form the protective layer may include, e.g., phenol resin, acrylic resin, polystyrene, polyester, polycarbonate, polyarylate, polysulfone, polyphenylene oxide, epoxy resin, polyurethane, alkyd resin, siloxane resin and unsaturated resins.

The electrophotographic photosensitive member thus charged is then exposed to exposure light (imagewise exposure light)  emitted from an exposure means (an imagewise exposure means; not shown) for slit exposure, laser beam scanning exposure or the like. In this way, electrostatic latent images corresponding to the intended image are successively formed on the peripheral surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 1. Voltage to be applied to the charging means  may be only direct-current voltage or may be direct-current voltage on which alternating-current voltage is kept superimposed.","The electrostatic latent images thus formed on the peripheral surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 1 are developed with a toner of a developing means  to form toner images. Then, the toner images thus formed and held on the peripheral surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 1 are transferred to a transfer material (such as paper) P by applying a transfer bias from a transfer means (such as a transfer roller) . The transfer material P is fed through a transfer material feed means (not shown) to come to the part (contact zone) between the electrophotographic photosensitive member 1 and the transfer means  in the manner synchronized with the rotation of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 1.","The transfer material P to which the toner images have been transferred is separated from the peripheral surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 1 and is led into a fixing means , where the toner images are fixed, and is then put out of the apparatus as an image-formed material (a print or copy).","The peripheral surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member 1 from which toner images have been transferred is brought to removal of the toner remaining after the transfer, through a cleaning means (such as a cleaning blade) . It is further subjected to charge elimination by pre-exposure light  emitted from a pre-exposure means (not shown), and thereafter repeatedly used for the formation of images. Incidentally, the pre-exposure is not necessarily required where the charging means is a contact charging means.","The apparatus may be constituted of a combination of plural components integrally joined in a container as a process cartridge from among the constituents such as the above electrophotographic photosensitive member 1, charging means , developing means , transfer means  and cleaning means  so that the process cartridge is set detachably mountable to the main body of an electrophotographic apparatus. In what is shown in , the electrophotographic photosensitive member 1 and the charging means , developing means  and cleaning means  are integrally supported to form a cartridge to set up a process cartridge  that is detachably mountable to the main body of the electrophotographic apparatus through a guide means  such as rails provided in the main body of the electrophotographic apparatus.","In the charging means of process cartridge and electrophotographic apparatus of the present invention, a roller-shaped charging means (charging roller) may preferably be used. As constitution of the charging mean, it may be constituted of, e.g., a conductive substrate and one or more cover layers formed on the conductive substrate. At least one layer of the cover layers is also provided with conductivity. Stated more specifically, as preferable constitution, it may be constituted of a conductive substrate, a conductive elastic layer formed on the conductive substrate and a surface layer formed on the conductive elastic layer.","The charging roller may preferably have a surface of 5.0 \u03bcm or less in ten-point average roughness (Rzjis). In the present invention, the ten-point average roughness (Rzjis) of the surface of the charging roller is measured with a surface profile analyzer (trade name: SE-3400) manufactured by Kosaka Laboratory Ltd. More specifically, using this surface profile analyzer, the Rzjis is measured at arbitrary six spots on the surface of the charging roller, and an arithmetic mean value of values found at the six spots is taken as the ten-point average roughness (Rzjis) of the surface of the charging roller.","If the surface of the charging roller has too large ten-point average roughness (Rzjis), the toner and its external additives tend to adhere to the surface of the charging roller, so that faulty images caused by staining of the surface of the charging roller may occur. Also, inasmuch as the surface of the charging roller is controlled to have the ten-point average roughness (Rzjis) of 5.0 \u03bcm or less, the difference in discharge level that is due to difference in height of surface profile of the surface of the charging roller can be kept small. Thus, this can keep any faulty images such as dots from occurring because of any faulty charging caused by the profile of the surface of the charging roller.","The present invention is described below in greater detail by giving specific working examples.
