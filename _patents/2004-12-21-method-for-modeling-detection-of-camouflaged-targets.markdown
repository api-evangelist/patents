title: Method for modeling detection of camouflaged targets
abstract: The methods for determining the probability of detection of a thermally camouflaged target at various ranges by the sensor includes determining an “inherent” temperature difference, ΔT, between the target and its immediate surroundings. Once ΔTis determined, a scaled Ncycle criterion, or the number of resolvable cycles needed by the sensor for a fifty percent probability of detection, is determined according to the relationship N=A/(ΔT)+C, where A, B and C are constants that are predetermined according to whether the immediate surroundings are of a woodland or a littoral nature. The scaled Ncycle criterion is then used in an empirical Target Transfer Probability Function (TTPF) defined by P=(N/N)/(1+(N/N)), where E=2.7+0.7(N/N), in order to determine the probability of detection of the thermally camouflaged target.

More particularly, the present invention applies to an analytical method for predicting the detection of a camouflaged target by systems that image in the mid- and far-infrared spectral bands.","Accurate predictions of electro-optical imager performance (in terms of the range at which the imager will detect a target) are important for several reasons. The predictions serve as a guide for system development by providing a means for comparing different systems while still in their design phase, and they can be used to decide if systems with a specific design will meet established requirements. The predictions are also used in war game simulations that directly influence the development of engagement tactics. Thus, it is very important to be able to model the performance of sensors, in terms of the probability that they will detect a given target at a particular range.","One of the primary modeling techniques known in the prior art is the ACQUIRE model. The ACQUIRE model uses several parameters in order to develop an empirical Target Transfer Probability Function (TTPF). The TTPF then predicts the probability of detection for the particular target at various ranges with some confidence.","The ACQUIRE model, however, suffers from certain limitations. Specifically, camouflaged and reduced signature targets have long presented problems for modeling target acquisition performance, and the ACQUIRE model loses integrity when the target is thermally camouflaged. Stated differently, the ACQUIRE method for comparing sensor performance is relatively insensitive to target temperature contrast, and field studies have determined that the ACQUIRE method generally overestimates the range at which low thermal contrast targets are detected. This inaccuracy in prediction modeling has hampered the evaluation of camouflage effectiveness, and it hinders the development of engagement tactics for various weapons systems.","To compensate for the above limitation, one solution often used by war gamers involves adjusting the ACQUIRE cycle criterion, or the ACQUIRE Nvariable, in accordance with available data for the vehicle of interest or its surrogates. Ndescribes the number of cycles across a target that must be resolved to achieve a 50 percent probability of detection. For example, the standard manner of accounting for parameters that the ACQUIRE method does not directly model (for example, target motion, varying scene clutter levels and camouflage) has typically been to decrease the ACQUIRE cycle criterion, N, for moving targets (moving targets are easier to spot) or increase the Ncycle criterion for camouflaged vehicles (which has the effect of making them more difficult to spot). But it has heretofore been unclear how much Nmust be adjusted to achieve an accurate prediction. If Nis increased too much, an underestimation of sensor performance results. Conversely, if the ACQUIRE methodology described above is used to predict the detection range of a thermally camouflaged target, an inaccurate prediction results. A further disadvantage of requiring special test and\/or analyses for each situation is that it leads to great inefficiencies and long delays associated with acquiring appropriate data for use in estimating lower contrast target performance.","In light of the above, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a method for predicting the detection range of low thermal contrast targets. It is another objective of the present invention to provide a method for accurate modeling of thermal sensor performance in the detection of a thermally camouflaged target. Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a method for target acquisition modeling which predicts sensor performance against low thermal contrast (camouflaged) targets without perturbing the prediction performance against high thermal contrast (uncamouflaged) targets. Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a modeling method which more accurately predicts sensor performance against low contrast targets without requiring highly detailed knowledge of the scenario within which the detection takes place. It is another goal of the present invention to provide a method for modeling of target acquisition and prediction which can be accomplished relatively easily in a cost-effective manner.","A method for predicting the detection range of a thermally camouflaged target in accordance with the present invention includes the step of defining a number of cycles resolved N, or the number of cycles resolved by a particular sensor against a particular target at a particular range R. The cycle criterion N is given by:\n\n=()()\/\n\nwhere Cis the characteristic size of said target (in meters) and is given by the square root of the cross-sectional area of the target, and fis the frequency in cycles per milliradian resolved by said given sensor at the target's apparent thermal contrast. The \u201capparent\u201d contrast of a target is its contrast through the atmosphere at range. This is to be distinguished from a target's \u201cinherent\u201d contrast which is calculated right at the target and which does not include any atmospheric effects in the calculation. The invention uses the inherent contrast to predict an Nfor the camouflaged case and the apparent contrast to predict for that target what the probability of detection is for a particular range. However, the apparent contrast is used to predict the ability of the sensor to resolve a target at range. A special case of the cycle criterion N is N, or the number of cycles required to be resolved by the sensor in order to achieve a fifty percent (50%) probability of detection, also known as the \u201ccycle criterion.\u201d\n","The ACQUIRE model uses a standard Nfor uncamouflaged targets. To account for thermal camouflage effects, the methods of the present invention include a method to determine the proper Nfor camouflaged targets without the requirement to do a field test. The first step of this process is determining the inherent temperature difference, \u0394T, between the target and its immediate surroundings. \u0394T, also referred to as the target's thermal contrast, is calculated according to the formula:\n\n\u0394=(()),\n\nwhere Tis the average temperature of the target, Tis the average background temperature of the immediate surroundings of the target and Sis the standard deviation of the target temperature, i.e., the variation within the target.\n","Once N and \u0394Tare found, the methods of the present invention include the step of scaling the Nvariable with the inherent \u0394Tvariable to account for thermal camouflaging of the target according to the relationship:\n\n\/(\u0394)\n\nwhere A, B and C are empirically determined constants. The constants A, B and C are chosen according to the nature of the background of the target, which affects the target clutter that is observed by a sensor. For a woodland (moderate clutter) background, the constant A is predetermined to be 6, the constant B is predetermined to be 2 and the constant C is predetermined to be 1.5. For a littoral (low clutter) background environment, the constants A, B and C are predetermined to be 0.75, 2 and 0.75, respectively.\n","Once the scaled criterion Nis determined as described immediately above, the method of the present invention includes predicting a range using the ACQUIRE model, and inputting the scaled cycle criterion N. The ACQUIRE model defines a Target Transfer Probability Function (TTPF) that is given by:\n\n=()\/(1+()),\n\nwhere E=2.7+0.7(N\/N). Other expressions for E, however, could be used with the TTPF above within the ACQUIRE model.\n","The probability of detection can then be calculated using the above TTPF. Alternatively, the TTPF probability P can be plotted as a function of range, and the probability at which a thermally camouflaged target can be detected at a given range can be determined by referencing the graph of the TTPF.","By way of background, and referring initially to , a simplified diagram of image chain  that illustrates the important components of target acquisition problem is presented. As shown, the radiance  from the scene  is a complex function of thermal radiance from target  and the immediate background thereof , with the nature of the complex function described in greater detail below. The emitted or reflected radiation  passes through the atmosphere , where some of the radiance is absorbed or scattered. Background radiation can also be scattered into the same path toward the imaging system.","After passage through the atmosphere as described above, radiation  is received by imaging system . Within imaging system , optics  gather the radiation and form an image of the scene at the image plane of the system. A single detector  (or an array of single detectors ) samples the incident radiation. The image can be sampled in various ways: A single detector or an array of detectors can rapidly scan across an image, or a two-dimensional array can simply stare at the scene. The sampled incident radiation is transduced into electrical signals which are processed by electronics  and formatted for observation at a display . The user  views the image and tries to make a decision as to whether a target of interest is within the sensor's field of view.","There are several factors that affect target detection, including, but not limited to, the factors listed in the below Table.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"FACTORS AFFECTING THE IMAGING CHAIN"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"7pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Major Factor","Subfactors",{}]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Target and","Type","Motion"]},{"entry":[{},"Background","Size","Shadow"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Shape","Masking"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Contrast","Camouflage"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Temperature","Clutter"]},{"entry":[{},"Environment","Visibility","Illumination level"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Cloud cover","Attenuation"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Sun Angle","Transmittance"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Solar Loading","Scattering"]},{"entry":[{},"Platform","Crew size and","Altitude"]},{"entry":[{},{},"interaction","Range"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Vibration environment","Speed"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Target exposure time"]},{"entry":[{},"Sensor parameters","Sensor type","Sample rate"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Spectral band","Interlace"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Field of view","Frame rate"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Resolution","LOS panning"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Dynamic Range","capability"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Sensitivity","Field of regard"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Search field size"]},{"entry":[{},"Observer","Training","Visual acuity"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Motivation","Search pattern"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Experience","Fatigue"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Prebriefing","Age"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Stress"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"The Table above illustrates the complexity of the modeling process depicted by imaging chain . No single model of a target acquisition process can possibly account for all of the above-listed factors. Because of this, many models frequently incorporate simplifying assumptions, and they are usually validated for only a small portion of possible missions or situations for which sensor performance assessment is desired.","The prior art ACQUIRE model includes range prediction methodologies for target detection and recognizes that the probability of detecting, recognizing, and identifying a target is a function of the number of equivalent cycles resolved on the target by the sensor. For a target at a given range, and with an apparent signature, the number of equivalent cycles resolved is given by:\n\n=()()\/\n\nwhere Cis the characteristic size of the target (meters), R is the range to the target (kilometers), and fis the frequency (cycles\/milliradian) resolved by the sensor for the target with the target's apparent contrast.

ACQUIRE uses a curve fit to the TTPF that is given by:\n\n=()\/(1+()),\n\nwhere E=2.7+0.7(N\/N.

The ACQUIRE process can be used for detection, recognition or identification of a target, and is used widely in the visible and infrared spectrums.","The ACQUIRE model is relatively insensitive to reductions in thermal signature contrast of a target (i.e., if the target is thermally camouflaged), however, and the ACQUIRE model loses integrity once the target is thermally camouflaged. Referring now to  and , the effects of thermal camouflage can be shown.  is a graph of the probability of detection as a function of resolved cycles, while  is a graph of the probability of detection of a target as a function of its range from the sensor.

Similarly, in , the predicted range of detection using the aforementioned \u201cstandard\u201d N50 value of 1.5 for a camouflaged vehicle is shown by curve , while the range of detection that was actually observed is depicted by curve . By cross-referencing , it can be seen that the ACQUIRE model did not accurately model the sensor performance for detection of the thermally camouflaged vehicle.","Typically, the Nvariable is scaled upward to account for thermal camouflaging effects. The present invention avoids the continuing necessity for field and perception tests to define this adjustment by describing a relationship between Nand the inherent thermal contrast, \u0394T, of the target vehicle.
