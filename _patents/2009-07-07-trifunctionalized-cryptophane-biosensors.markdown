Specifically, the invention relates to methods and systems for the detection of target entities using the signal observed in a noble element complexed to the biosensor.","Xenon-129 biosensors offer exciting potential for the simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of multiple frequency-resolved biomolecular targets. In addition to being a relatively abundant isotope of a non-toxic noble gas, the xenon-129 nucleus is spin-\u00bd and can be laser-polarized to increase nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals more than 10,000-fold. The polarizability of the xenon electron cloud imparts considerable environmental sensitivity to the chemical shift of the Xe nucleus, producing a nearly 300 ppm Xe NMR chemical shift window in common solvents. This sensitivity facilitates the simultaneous detection of monatomic Xe in different chemical environments. Biosensors exploiting this property have been generated by attaching a xenon-binding cryptophane-A moiety to protein-specific ligands such as biotin or protease-specific peptides. Cryptophane-based biosensors can be spectrally and spatially resolved in MR imaging and the cryptophane has been shown to be a competent xenon binder under near-physiological conditions.","Accordingly, there is a need in the art for improved xenon-binding host molecules in both organic and aqueous phase.","In one embodiment, the invention provides a biosensor comprising a hyperpolarized noble element complexed with a tri-functionalized cryptophane, wherein the tri-functionalized cryptophane is comprised of first and second cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) units.

In an exemplary embodiment, the intermediate is tri-(2-bromoethyl)cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) and the tri-functionalized cryptophane is tri-propargyl cryptophane.","In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of synthesizing a biosensor having increased affinity for a noble element, comprising the steps of: mediated by Cu(I), coupling a tri-functionalized cryptophane with an affinity tag; and complexing a hyperpolarized noble element with the tri-functionalized cryptophane coupled tag, wherein the tri-functionalized cryptophane includes first and second cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) units and wherein a dipole moment exists between said first and second cyclotriveratrylene (CTV).","In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of detecting the activity of a \u03b1-carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoenzyme in a biological sample of a subject, comprising the step of contacting the biological sample with a biosensor comprising a hyperpolarized noble element complexed to a tri-functionalized cryptophane coupled affinity tag, wherein the affinity tag is specific to said \u03b1-carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme; and analyzing the signal in said element, whereby a signal indicates activity of said \u03b1-carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme.","In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of diagnosing a disease associated with \u03b1-carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme expression in a subject, comprising the step of obtaining a biological sample from said subject; contacting the biological sample with a biosensor comprising a hyperpolarized noble element complexed to a tri-functionalized cryptophane coupled affinity tag, wherein the affinity tag is specific to said \u03b1-carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme; analyzing the signal in said element; and comparing the signal obtained from the sample with a signal obtained under the same conditions in a standard.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for screening for a candidate agent capable of modulating the activity of a protein in a biological sample, comprising the step of contacting a first portion of the biological sample with a biosensor comprising a hyperpolarized noble element complexed to a tri-functionalized cryptophane coupled affinity tag, wherein the affinity tag is specific for the protein sought to be modulated and analyzing the signal of said element; contacting a second portion with the candidate agent screened; contacting the second portion with the same biosensor; and comparing the detected signal in the second portion, whereby a difference in the signal between the first and second portions indicates said agent being capable of modulating the activity of the protein.","Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description examples and figures. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and the specific examples while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.","The invention relates to biosensors with improved solubility and affinity to a noble element. Specifically, the invention relates to methods and systems for the detection of target entities using the signal observed in a noble element complexed to the biosensor.","In one embodiment, provided herein is a biosensor comprising a hyperpolarized noble element complexed with a tri-functionalized cryptophane, wherein the tri-functionalized cryptophane is comprised of first and second cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) units.

In an exemplary embodiment, the intermediate is tris-(2-bromoethyl)cyclotriveratrylene and to the tri-functionalized cryptophane is tri-propargyl cryptophane.","In one embodiment, provided herein is a method of synthesizing a biosensor having increased affinity for a noble element, comprising the steps of: mediated by Cu(I), coupling a tri-functionalized cryptophane with an affinity tag; and complexing a hyperpolarized noble element with the tri-functionalized cryptophane coupled tag, wherein the tri-functionalized cryptophane comprises two cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) units and wherein a dipole moment exists between said first and second cyclotriveratrylene (CTV).","In another embodiment, provided herein is a method of detecting the activity of a \u03b1-carbonic anhydrase (CA) isozyme in a biological sample of a subject, comprising the step of contacting the biological sample with a biosensor comprising a hyperpolarized noble element complexed to a tri-functionalized cryptophane coupled affinity tag, wherein the affinity tag is specific to said \u03b1-carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme; and analyzing the signal in said element, whereby a signal indicates activity of said \u03b1-carbonic anhydrase isozyme.","In one embodiment, provided herein is a method of diagnosing a disease associated with \u03b1-carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme expression in a subject, comprising the step of obtaining a biological sample from said subject; contacting the biological sample with a biosensor comprising a hyperpolarized noble element complexed to a tri-functionalized cryptophane coupled affinity tag, wherein the affinity tag is specific to said \u03b1-carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme; analyzing the signal in said element; and comparing the signal obtained from the sample with a signal obtained under the same conditions in a standard.","In another embodiment, provided herein is a method for screening for a candidate agent capable of modulating the activity of a protein in a biological sample, comprising the step of contacting a first portion of the biological sample with a biosensor comprising a hyperpolarized noble element complexed to a tri-functionalized cryptophane coupled affinity tag, wherein the affinity tag is specific for the protein sought to be modulated and analyzing the signal of said element; contacting a second portion with the candidate agent screened; contacting the second portion with the same biosensor; and comparing the detected signal in the second portion, whereby a difference in the signal between the first and second portions indicates said agent being capable of modulating the activity of the protein. The term \u201csignal,\u201d as used herein, refers to a signal detectable using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), radiographic imaging, or other imaging modality. In one example, the signal is a chemical shift that can be detected by NMR.","In one embodiment, the biosensor of the invention is used in an in vivo application. In another embodiment, the biosensor of the invention is used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In another embodiment, the biosensor of the invention is used in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In another embodiment, the biosensor of the invention is used in positron emission tomography (PET). In another embodiment, the biosensor of the invention is used in any in vivo detection method known to one of skilled in the art. In another embodiment, the biosensor of the invention is used in an in vitro application. In another embodiment, the biosensor of the invention is used in an ex vivo application.","In another embodiment, the biosensor of the invention can be used to diagnose a disease, wherein the disease is associated with an organ or a tissue that can be accessed readily by the biosensor. In another embodiment, the biosensor of the invention can be used to diagnose a disease of lung, brain, or breast, where the biosensor can be readily delivered. Examples of a disease diagnosed by the biosensor of the invention include, but are not limited to, a cancer, a glaucoma, an epilepsy, a disease associated with \u03b1-carbonic anhydrase, an asthma, a stroke and a tuberculosis.","The invention relates, in one embodiment, to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biosensors with improved solubility and affinity to a noble element. In another embodiment, the invention relates to methods and systems for the detection of proteins using the chemical shift observed in a noble element complexed to the biosensor resulting from a change in the xenon local environment as the result of protein binding or enzyme activity.","In one embodiment, provided herein is a new cryptophane-A derivative functionalized with three acetic acid groups that was synthesized. In another embodiment, tricarboxylate cryptophane was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fluorescence quenching assay to have a xenon association constant of 33,000 Mat 293 K, which is the highest affinity for xenon measured for any host molecule to date. Fluorescence lifetime measurements of tricarboxylate cryptophane in the presence of varying amounts of xenon confirmed static quenching by the encapsulated xenon and the presence of a second conformer in solution. As would be readily understood by a person skilled in the art, the fact that the entropy term for binding xenon to the cages created by the two cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) units in water is favorable (negative), the binding affinity for xenon improves as the temperature increases (going from rt to 37\u00b0 C., physiological temp). (See also Table 2 and ). Therefore, in one embodiment, the xenon 33,000 Massociation constant at 293 K increases to about to 50,000 Mat 310 K.","In one embodiment, acid-base titrations and aqueous nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of tricarboxylate cryptophane and a previously synthesized tri-triazole propionate cryptophane (TTPC) show how the steric bulk of the cryptophane core and solvation of carboxylate anions affect in one embodiment, the aqueous behavior of the molecule. In one embodiment, the crown-saddle (CS) conformer of tricarboxylate cryptophane is detectable in aqueous solution, whereas only the crown-crown (CC) conformer of tri-triazole propionate cryptophane is observed.","In another embodiment, provided herein is the construction of target-specific xenon biosensors wherein the trifunctionalizing procedure described herein enables the resultant molecule to have substituents that enhance solubility of the sensors provided herein in up to three positions, while one or two positions in certain embodiments, are reserved for specific targeting or attachment of fluorophores or radiolabels. In one embodiment, xenon is a better fluorescence quencher of tri-acetic acid (TAAC) than tri-triazole propionate cryptophane (TTPC), based on the longer fluorescence lifetime of TAAC, and longer timescale for collisional quenching. In another embodiment, xenon is a poor fluorescence quencher in these systems, despite the fact that it occupies almost half the volume of the cryptophane cavity, and in certain embodiments collides, on average, hundreds of times with each chromophore before the S\u2192Selectronic transition occurs from the one excited 1,2-dialkoxybenzene molecule in the cryptophane.","In one embodiment, the hyperpolarized noble element used in the biosensors described herein, which are used in the methods provided herein is Xe or any of its radioactive isotopes. Accordingly in one embodiment the isotope of xenon used in the biosensors described herein, used in the methods provided is Xe, or Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe, Xe or their combination in other discrete embodiments.","The xenon biosensor described herein may be used in any suitable imaging technique known to one of skilled in the art for detecting various diseases or conditions (e.g., tumor). Examples of imaging techniques may include, but are not limited to, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).","Current limitations in developing Xe MRI contrast agents for in vivo studies include the difficulties of synthesizing large quantities of functionalized cryptophanes and delivering laser-polarized Xe to living tissue. Improved methods for synthesizing xenon biosensors are crucial to developing this technology for in vivo applications. Because the lifetime of hyperpolarized Xe is relatively short in biological fluids, in one embodiment hyperpolarized Xe is continuously or repeatedly delivered to the site of the cryptophane, thereby maintaining signal intensity. Thus, in one embodiment, xenon biosensors described in the systems, methods and kits described herein utilize Xe MR spectroscopic identification of biomarkers in the lungs, where hyperpolarized xenon could be delivered through semi-continuous inhalation. In another embodiment, for application in less accessible target areas, such as the breast, hyperpolarized xenon and said biosensors are delivered through direct injection. Xenon gas (specifically Xe and Xe) may also be used in other imaging techniques, for example, SPECT.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"sup":["127","127"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"sup":["133","133","133","133","133","133","133"]},"In one embodiment, provided herein is a biosensor comprising a hyperpolarized noble element complexed with a tri-functionalized cryptophane, wherein the tri-functionalized cryptophane is comprised of a first and second cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) unit having a dipole moment therebetween. In another embodiment, the biosensor comprising a hyperpolarized noble element is complexed with at least one affinity tag coupled to a tri-functionalized cryptophane, wherein the affinity tag is a target-specific tag and whereby reaction between the affinity tag and the target induces change in the chemical environment of the noble element resulting in a detectable chemical shift.","In another embodiment, provided herein is a method of synthesizing a biosensor having increased affinity for a noble element, comprising the steps of: mediated by Cu(I), coupling a tri-functionalized cryptophane with an affinity tag; and complexing a hyperpolarized noble element with the tri-functionalized cryptophane coupled tag, wherein the tri-functionalized cryptophane is comprised of two cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) units and wherein a dipole moment exists between said first and second cyclotriveratrylenes (CTVs).","In one embodiment, the terms \u201chyperpolarize\u201d, \u201cpolarize\u201d, and the like are used interchangeably and mean to artificially enhance the polarization of certain noble gas nuclei over the natural levels at thermal equilibrium. Such an increase is desirable in other embodiments because it allows stronger signals corresponding to better NMR images and spectroscopy signals of the gas in the body. As is known by those of skill in the art, hyperpolarization can be induced in one embodiment by spin-exchange with an optically pumped alkali-metal vapor or by metastability exchange in another embodiment.","In one embodiment, the term \u201cchemical shift\u201d refers to circumstances whereby, for a Xe-129 atom having a particular NMR resonance frequency within a cryptophane or related to organic cage which shields the xenon nucleus from the external magnetic field to a certain extent, a change in the environment of the cryptophane cage will result in a change of the ability of the cryptophane to shield the xenon from the magnetic field. The resulting shift of the NMR resonant frequency, in one embodiment, is referred to as a \u201cchemical shift\u201d and the degree of shielding depends on the degree to which the very polarizable xenon nucleus is perturbed within a given cryptophane. In one embodiment, the xenon biosensor may be used as SPECT agents, by taking advantage of the very high signal (from radioactive xenon isotopes) per nucleus to identify rare species in vivo. In some embodiments, by targeting many xenon nuclei to a tumor, for example, target molecules can be detected and the tumor may also be detected at an early stage.","In one embodiment, the reaction of the affinity tags, which are coupled to the tri-functionalized cryptophane, used in the systems, methods and kits described herein by the corresponding targets described herein, induces change in the ability of the tri-functionalized cryptophane to shield the complexed hyperpolarized noble element from the applied magnetic field, resulting in a chemical shift that is detectable by NMR; and is specific to the target sought to be detected.","In one embodiment, the term \u201caffinity tag\u201d refers to any substituent that can be covalently attached to the tri-functionalized cryptophane moieties of cyclotriveratrylene comprising the cage in which the noble element is enclosed, capable of reacting with a target compound and inducing change in the microenvironment of the biosensors, thereby inducing a change of resonant frequency of the noble element entrapped between the two tri-functionalized cryptophane moieties of cyclotriveratrylene. In one embodiment, the affinity tag is an enzyme substrate, or a folate, a glucose moiety, a peptoid, a small molecule, a peptide such as RGD or their combination in other discrete embodiments of the affinity tags used in the biosensors and methods described herein.","In one embodiment, the term \u201csubstrate\u201d refers to a substance acted upon by an enzyme in a biochemical reaction. After the biochemical reaction, at least one product is generated due to the action of the enzyme on the substrate. A \u201csoluble substrate\u201d refers in another embodiment, to a substrate which is not membrane bound. The term \u201cenzyme\u201d refers to any protein that catalyzes a biochemical reaction. Proteins having non-amino-acid to modifications such as glycosylation or containing other non-proteinaceous components such as metal ion prosthetic groups are included within this definition.","In one embodiment, the affinity tag is folate (5-methyltetrahydropteroylglutamate) and the target sought to be imaged is any cell that overexpressed the folate binding protein (FBP) or has a high level of cell-surface folate receptors. Many cancer cells upregulate folate receptor relative to healthy cells, which makes folate a useful targeting moiety.","In another embodiment, the term \u201cprotein\u201d or \u201cpolypeptide\u201d or \u201cpeptide\u201d is used in its broadest sense to refer to a compound of two or more subunit amino acids, amino acid analogs, or other peptidomimetics. As used herein, the term \u201camino acid\u201d refers to either natural and\/or unnatural or synthetic amino acids, including glycine and both the D or L optical isomers, and amino acid analogs and peptidomimetics. A peptide of three or more amino acids is commonly called an oligopeptide if the peptide chain is short. If in another embodiment, the peptide chain is long, the peptide is typically called a polypeptide or a protein. Full-length proteins, analogs, and fragments thereof are encompassed by the definition. The terms also include postexpression modifications of the polypeptide, for example, glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation and the like. In another embodiment, as ionizable amino and carboxyl groups are present in the molecule, a particular polypeptide may be obtained as an acidic or basic salt, or in neutral form. In one embodiment, a polypeptide may be obtained directly from any source organism, or may be recombinantly or synthetically produced.","In one embodiment, the term \u201cspecific\u201d, in reference to the binding of two molecules or a molecule and a complex of molecules, refers to the specific recognition of one for the other and the formation of a stable complex, as compared to substantially less recognition of other molecules and the lack of formation of stable complexes with such other molecules. In another embodiment, \u201cspecific\u201d, in reference to binding, means that to the extent that a molecule forms complexes with other molecules or complexes, it forms at least fifty percent of the complexes with the molecule or complex for which it has specificity. In one embodiment, the molecules or complexes have areas on their surfaces or in cavities giving rise to specific recognition between the two binding moieties. Exemplary of specific binding are antibody-antigen interactions, enzyme-substrate interactions, polynucleotide hybridizations and\/or formation of duplexes, cellular receptor-ligand interactions, and so to forth in other embodiments.","In one embodiment, the affinity tags used in the biosensors described herein, which, in certain embodiments are used in the methods provided herein, are specific for cathepsins, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), glucose transporters, somatostatin receptor, etc. A person skilled in the art would readily recognize that many targets have a target-specific affinity tag which is capable of being attached to the tri-functionalized cryptophane molecules described herein.","In one embodiment, the hyperpolarized noble element used in the biosensors utilized in the systems, methods and kits provided herein, is xenon, or in another embodiment, an isotope of xenon. An isotope of xenon, xenon-129, has non-zero nuclear spin (i.e., I=\u00bd) and therefore is a nucleus which, in one embodiment, is suited to study by nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The nuclear magnetic resonance signals obtainable from Xe are extraordinarily sensitive to local environment and therefore very specific to environment.","In another embodiment, xenon interacts with proteins and lipids in plasma, which reduces the contribution of entropy (T\u0394S|=0.12) relative to Xe binding of triacetic acid-functionalized cryptophane (TAAC) in buffer.","In another embodiment, the Xe isotope is, in principle, suited to NMR uses, but is 26% naturally abundant and has a sensitivity relative to H (in conventional NMR) of 2.12\u00d710. In another embodiment, the resonance frequency of Xe spans an enormous range (0-300 ppm) over the gas and condensed phase, and is exceptionally sensitive to chemical environment. Its longitudinal relaxation time, T, is huge (practically at least 3000 s in the pure gas phase, and theoretically perhaps as long as 56 hrs at 1 atm, and is particularly sensitive to chemical environment, Oconcentration, and the effects of other relaxation promoters. Its transverse relaxation time is also susceptible to relaxation promoters.","Noble gases may be hyperpolarized for use in one embodiment, through any of various means known in the art, such as spin-exchange interactions with optically pumped alkali metal vapor. The optical pumping and spin-exchange can be performed in the absence of an applied magnetic field, or in another embodiment, using modest fields of about 1 G or larger. Pumping in the NMR magnet bore at fields of several Tesla is also possible. The maximum steady-state Xe nuclear polarization achievable depends in certain embodiments, to on the time constant characterizing the spin exchange with the alkali metal and the time constant characterizing the relaxation (T) due, in an embodiment, to contact with the surfaces of the pumping cell. In another embodiment, with Tof 20 min, polarizations of 20-40% are practicable, and polarizations of 70% or more are attainable in other embodiments. The long Tof the gas allows in one embodiment for samples to be manipulated, even stored as Xe ice, and transported on time scales of hours or even days, without serious loss of magnetization.","In another embodiment, TAAC exhibits higher affinity for xenon than any known host molecule. The agreement between the fluorescence quenching and ITC data validates in one embodiment the use of both techniques for the determination of xenon binding constants. The additional stabilization of \u22120.37 kcal\/mol of the Xe@TAAC complex relative to Xe@TTPC demonstrates in one embodiment, that differently functionalized cryptophane cores lead to different xenon binding affinities. In one embodiment, introducing ionizable groups close to the cryptophane that create a molecular dipole moment along the cavity leads to improvements in xenon binding. Accordingly and in one embodiment, the functionalizing moieties used in the biosensors and methods described herein, are selected based on their ability to create the optimal dipole moment for the imaging target. In another embodiment, increasing the dipole moment of the cryptophane cage (and xenon affinity) used in the biosensors described herein which, in other embodiments are utilized in the methods described herein, is done by introducing heteroatoms within the cage. In one embodiment nitrogen and sulfur atoms were incorporated into the tri-functionalized cryptophane cages, which should in certain embodiments improve xenon binding.","In one embodiment, the term \u201cdipole moment\u201d refers to an asymmetric charge distribution inside a neutral molecule. The dipole moment is considered to be the product of the magnitude of the charges multiplied by the distance of separation between the charges. Dipole moment is measured in units of Debye. In the vapor phase, the water molecule, for example, has a dipole moment of 1.84 Debye. In another embodiment, the dipole moment between the two CTV units used in the biosensors and which are utilized in the methods described herein, have a dipole moment between about 3 and about 30 Debye.","In one embodiment, there are two or three affinity tags coupled to the tri-functionalized cryptophane used in the biosensors utilized in the methods described herein. In certain embodiments, when more than one affinity tag is coupled to the tri-functionalized cryptophanes described herein, these affinity tags could be the same or different. Accordingly and in one embodiment, the tri-functionalized cryptophanes used herein comprise a substrate as an affinity tag as well as two antibodies, specific for the enzyme corresponding to the coupled substrate. In another embodiment, the affinity tag is three benzenesulfonamide substituents.","The term \u201cfunctionalized\u201d refers in one embodiment to the modification of the cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) moieties with chemical groups that impart target functional properties and the process of attaching such groups is defined as \u201cfunctionalization\u201d. In one embodiment, triphenol cryptophane is functionalized by reacting it with a triazole propionate radical, thereby obtaining a tritriazole propionate cryptophane (TTPC).

These receptors consist of an \u03b1- and a \u03b2-subunit, which associate non-covalently in defined combinations. To date, 18 \u03b1-subunits and 8 \u03b2-subunits have been identified, which to associate selectively to form at least 24 integrins. In certain embodiments, integrins transduce messages via various signaling pathways and influence proliferation and apoptosis of tumor cells, as well as of activated endothelial cells. Unique combination of integrins on the cell surface allows in other embodiments, for cells to recognize and then respond to a variety of extracellular ligands. Integrin \u03b1\u03b2is a prominent member of the integrin family. It has been implicated in the pathophysiology of malignant tumors where it is required for tumor angiogenesis and is highly expressed on both endothelial cells in neovasculature and highly aggressive human carcinomas.

In one embodiment, the tri-functionalized cryptophane biosensors described herein, obviates the need for attaching chiral (e.g. peptides in certain embodiments) moieties to the cryptophane cage, which when attached, produce diastereomers. This is since the tri-functionalized cryptophane itself is chiral, and exists as a racemic mixture of enantiomers, unless it is synthesized in enantiomerically pure form. Diastereomers such as peptide-containing cryptophanes, are different compounds, which produce different Xe-129 NMR chemical shifts, make it more difficult to interpret the Xe-129 NMR spectrum, and lead to lower S\/N as the signal is spread out amongst many peaks.","In one embodiment, the mono-, di-, tri- or tetra-RGD peptides used as the affinity tag in the compositions and methods described herein, are capable of binding integrins other than the \u03b1\u03b2integrin and the methods of imaging cancer in-vivo in a subject described herein, or in another embodiment, the methods of evaluating the efficacy of cancer drug therapy Described herein, or in another embodiment, the methods of detecting a cancer cell in-vivo, are effected through interactions with non-\u03b1\u03b2integrins.

TAAC exhibited a higher quantum yield than TPCC (\u03a6=0.06 vs. 0.01 at 293 K) and a greater degree of quenching upon xenon saturation (F\/F=6 vs. 2). The emission of both molecules was partially quenched by oxygen, implying weak oxygen binding. Because the only chemical difference between TAAC and TTPC is the nature of the pendant solubilizing groups, the lower quantum yield of TTPC could be explained by excited-state quenching by the three triazole rings appended to its cryptophane core. The quantum yield of TAAC is also temperature dependent, with a linear decrease of 0.0007\/K between 283 and 313 K. This temperature dependence is attributed to the increase in molecular motions and accessibility of different cage conformations as the thermal energy of the cryptophane system is increased.","The Stern-Volmer plots for TAAC and TTPC indicate the amount of fluorescence quenching (F\/F) observed at various xenon concentrations (). While a linear correlation is observed at low xenon concentrations, a horizontal deviation from linearity is observed at higher xenon concentrations approaching maxima at F\/F=6 for TAAC and F\/F=2 for TTPC at xenon saturation. Fits to the initial linear sections of the plots give slopes of 19,300 Mand 4,700 M, respectively, for encapsulated xenon quenching (). Horizontal deviations in Stern-Volmer plots are normally observed when there is hindered access to a particular population of fluorophores in a sample While it may be conceivable that a co-encapsulated water molecule could prevent xenon from contacting one of the six 1,2-dialkoxybenzene chromophores of the cryptophane cores of TAAC and TTPC, aqueous NMR measurements found no evidence of encapsulated water, even under degassed conditions (vide infra).","Time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) measurements of the fluorescence lifetimes of TAAC and TTPC were undertaken in an effort to understand the nature of the xenon quenching and the horizontal deviation from linearity in the steady-state Stern-Volmer plots The low quantum yield and short lifetime of TTPC allowed only mono-exponential tailfits to be obtained, giving lifetimes of \u02dc300 ps without encapsulated xenon and \u02dc200 ps when saturated with xenon.","The higher quantum yield of TAAC allowed for decay fits deconvolved from the TCSPC instrument response function. Rigorously purified TAAC in aqueous solution exhibited a double exponential decay (), which was fitted to two exponentials with lifetimes of 1.1 ns (91% of total intensity) and 0.7 ns (9% of total intensity). The smaller amplitude, shorter-lived component is consistent with the presence of another conformer in solution. As a comparison, the lifetime of 1,2-dimethoxybenzene is monoexponential with a lifetime of 1.4 ns. Upon xenon encapsulation, a very short-lived component with lifetime of 0.16 ns replaced the 1.1 ns lifetime. This new lifetime is not expected to be a result of collisional quenching between non-encapsulated xenon and the excited state of TAAC as the diffusion rate of xenon in water (2.2\u00b10.4*10cms) and the short timescale of the fluorescence decays give a root-mean-square distance of 22 \u212b that aqueous xenon must travel to quench the Sstate. At the highest concentrations (\u02dc15 \u03bcM 1 and 5 mM Xe) investigated in these fluorescence experiments, there was an average spacing of 70 \u212b between xenon atoms. Also, given the long residence time of xenon in an aqueous cryptophane cage (30 to ms), xenon exchanging in and out of the cage is not likely a factor in these measurements. From the fluorescence measurements of TAAC with no encapsulated xenon, a natural lifetime (\u03c4) of 19 ns, its reciprocal emissive rate (\u0393) of 5.3*10s, and a nonradiative decay rate (k) of 8.56*10swere obtained. An apparent first-order quenching rate constant for xenon quenching the fluorescence of TCC, k=5.34*10s, was then computed from the lifetime of TAAC saturated with xenon. Based on the observed steady-state quenching and quantum yield of TCC, a \u03a6of 0.01 has been calculated for the species Xe@1. These observations are summarized in a modified static quenching scheme () in which the effect of adding xenon to a solution of TAAC converts the population from the more emissive \u201cempty\u201d TAAC* excited state to a population of less emissive Xe@1*, as governed by the binding affinity of xenon by TCC.","Acid-base titrations of TAAC and TTPC were performed in order to understand the solubility requirements and anion stabilities of the molecules. TAAC exhibited a pKof 4.1, compared to the pKof 3.23 for the analagous 2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)acetic acid. Previous studies of sterically congested acetic acid derivatives have shown pKdifferences of this magnitude. Steric congestion near the carboxylic acid group decreases acidity by preventing efficient solvation of the carboxylate anion. For compound TAAC, this is due to the large nonpolar surface of the cryptophane interfering with the solvation of the carboxylate base. Each acid group attached to TAAC can be approximated as being an acetic acid attached to a \u02dc1 nm diameter nonpolar sphere. Water molecules surrounding the nonpolar cryptophane surface must be ordered, a consequence of the hydrophobic effect. Carboxylate solvation must directly compete with this ordered solvation sphere necessary for the cryptophane core. In addition, based on visual observations of precipitation during the titrations, it was found that TAAC required all three acids to be deprotonated for aqueous solubility while TTPC required only two deprotonations for solubility to 200 \u03bcM.","The carboxylate groups of TTPC are \u02dc5 \u212b farther from the cryptophane core than in TAAC and more easily stabilized through solvation. Titration of TTPC under the same conditions as TAAC yielded a pKof 5.3. The pKdifference between TTPC and the analogous propanoic acid (pK=4.87) is less than one-half of a pKunit, indicative that the carboxylates on TTPC experience less effect from the bulk of the nonpolar cryptophane. Propanoic acid is relevant for comparison to TTPC as the triazoles on TTPC are greater than two methylenes from the acid groups and not expected to contribute electrostatically to their acidity. However, the dipole moments and hydrogen-bond accepting abilities of the three triazoles appended to TTPC are expected to aid solubility.","In order to bind xenon, the cryptophanes in this study must exist in a C-symmetric crown-crown (CC) conformation, in which both cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) units adopt a concave form to create a molecular cavity. However, water-soluble cryptophanes are capable of existing in multiple conformations in aqueous solution. Specifically, a crown-saddle (CS) conformation, in which one of the two CTV units of the cryptophane is in an asymmetric \u201csaddle\u201d conformer was previously proposed. The CTV unit possessing the saddle conformer has been proposed to fill the cavity of the cryptophane, preventing xenon binding.","It should be noted in TTPC () that the protons furthest from the cryptophane core exhibit sharp linewidths (N\u2014CHprotons FWHM=3 Hz for all three conditions) that are not affected by the nature of the various gaseous guest molecules. Degassing the solution with several cycles of pumping under static vacuum significantly sharpened the aromatic and ethylene linker resonances. Because the cryptophane core is chiral (a mixture of Mand Penantiomers), the protons on the methylene connecting the cryptophane (\u201cH\u201d in ) to the triazole are diastereotopic, their resonances separated by 0.04 ppm and geminally splitting each other by 12 Hz upon xenon saturation. Most notably, however, no population of conformers other than the canonical CC form was detected for TTPC.","The degassed aqueous NMR spectrum of TAAC indicated less than 5%, by NMR integration, population of a second species that is consistent with the CS conformer. In addition to the aromatic peaks that are a result of the Csymmetry of the CS conformer, the bridging methylene group peaks at 0.0 and 2.0 ppm that correspond to the CHprotons pointing into the cavity These peaks are not impurities as the H NMR of 1 in d-DMSO (molecular charge=0), shows only CC conformer without the need for degassing or xenon saturation. Another striking feature of TAAC in aqueous solution is the magnitude of diastereotopic chemical shift difference evident in the protons on the methylenes connecting the cryptophane to the carboxyl groups (\u201cH\u201d in ). These protons, as confirmed by to 2-D COSY, had resonances separated by 0.20 ppm with 15 Hz geminal splitting. This large difference in chemical shift between the two methylene protons is indicative of two very different chemical environments. When TAAC was dissolved in d-DMSO, the Hmethylenes appeared as a singlet, with no apparent difference in their chemical environment. This dependence of chemical shift on the solvent and protonation state of TAAC indicates that the diastereotopism observed in aqueous solution is a result of the carboxylate anions being unable access many conformations that could produce magnetic equivalence of the protons. Adopting such conformations would lead to a loss in solvating water molecules and destabilize the anion. It is hypothesized that the CS conformer allows for more efficient solvation of the carboxylates, thermodynamically stabilizing this structure and allowing for its observation.","The NMR and titration data indicates that the CS conformer population of TAAC is caused by the three deprotonated carboxylates being poorly solvated due to their close proximity to the cryptophane core. This poor anion solvation destabilizes the CC conformer. The greater solvation gained through adoption of the CS conformer allows for the observation of both conformers in aqueous solution. The carboxylates of TTPC, being further from the cryptophane core, allow for a more efficient solvation of the anions, which eliminates the gain in solvation associated with adopting the CS conformation.","Although not being unable to isolate the CS conformer of TAAC as a single species in aqueous solution growing a crystal triallyl-cryptophane in the CS conformer was possible. Single crystals of triallyl-cryptophane were obtained via dissolution in hot mesitylene, cooling to room temperature, and subjection to vapor diffusion conditions with n-pentane, triallyl-cryptophane crystallized in the monoclinic space group P2\/n with two of the ally groups experiencing disorder in which there were two possible orientations of the groups.

It was impossible to find an internal void volume of CS-6 using Deep View\/Swiss PDB Viewer as the internal cavity was too small to accommodate the 1.4 \u212b diameter probe. A CS conformer cryptophane possessing m-xylyl linkers between the CTV units has been studied by solution H NMR and single crystal X-ray diffraction To the inventors' knowledge, this is the first published crystal structure of the CS conformer of a cryptophane-A derivative.","Attempts to observe CS-triallyl-cryptophane by NMR spectroscopy through the degassing, heating, and cooling of a solution of triallyl-cryptophane in dmesitylene were unsuccessful. Dissolution in CDClof crystals of CS-triallyl-cryptophane from the same preparation as the X-ray structural determination yielded only the CC conformer in solution. While it is expected that CS-triallyl-cryptophane is destabilized relative to the crown form of cyclotriveratrylene by 3-4 kcal mol, it was concluded from these observations that crystal packing forces on triallyl-cryptophane in the absence of a guest promoted the adoption of the CS conformation.","Interestingly, the allyl-substituted CTV unit of CS-triallyl-cryptophane retained its crown conformation while the methoxy-substituted CTV unit (the second half of the same molecule), assumed the saddle conformation. In order to gain the most stability through solvation of its carboxylate anions, the acid-substituted CTV of compound TAAC undergoes inversion to the saddle isomer in order to maximize the solvent exposure of all three acid groups. However, in assuming the less sterically bulky CS conformation, the carboxylates of TAAC are better solvated regardless of conformation of the carboxylate-bearing CTV unit.","An investigation as to whether xenon binds cryptophane in biological media, was sought as xenon is an anesthetic and associates weakly with many proteins, as well as lipids. TTPC () was synthesized and determined by two complementary techniques to have unprecedented affinity for xenon, in water and human plasma.","Previous determinations of aqueous xenon binding constants for small molecules have relied on NMR measurements either through the analysis of H chemical shifts in the presence of xenon or on the direct integration of free and bound Xe resonances.

From Table 5 and the known thermodynamics of xenon partitioning into water, an upper limit of \u0394H=\u22127.5 kcal\/mol was calculated for the enthalpy of xenon binding to I. Thus, the measured \u0394H of \u22126.04 kcal\/mol, although larger than in buffer, appeared reasonable. Furthermore, the average literature value for xenon solubility in plasma at 310 K is 3.6 mM, which is \u02dc10% higher than in buffer. These results suggest that xenon interacts with proteins and lipids in plasma, which reduces the contribution of entropy (T\u0394S=0.12, Table 1) relative to Xe binding I in buffer.","The \u03b1-carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are zinc metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of COin forming HCO. The active site of an \u03b1-CA contains a catalytically essential Zn coordinated by three histidine residues at the bottom of a 15 \u212b deep cleft, and the tightest binding CA inhibitors developed to date contain a sulfonamide moiety that coordinates to Zn as a sulfonamidate anion. Notably, human isozyme II (CAII) is an ideal model system for exploring new inhibitor designs, some of which can be exploited in biosensing applications. In the present Example, CAII is utilized for the structure-based design of a xenon (Xe) biosensor for potential use as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent.","The Xe isotope has a spin-\u00bd nucleus, a >200 ppm chemical shift window in water, and a natural isotopic abundance of 26% (commercially available up to 86%), which makes it an appealing biomolecular probe for MRI. Moreover, Xe can be laser polarized to enhance MRI signals \u02dc10,000-fold. Although current in vivo MRI applications are limited to functional lung imaging through the diffusion of Xe gas, the encapsulation of Xe within a cryptophane cage (K\u224830 \u03bcM at 37\u00b0 C. in phosphate-buffered solution) facilitates its use as a biosensor that can be targeted to specific proteins using an appropriate affinity tag. For example, racemic mixture of TTPC () has been designed to bind to the CA isozymes (K=60\u00b120 nM against CAII in solution) and yields a distinctive Xe-MRI spectrum when bound to CAII. Reported herein, is the X-ray crystal structure of the CAII-TTPC-Xe complex at 1.70 \u212b resolution.","For structure determination, CAII was overexpressed in and purified then incubated with a 2-fold excess of TTPC, concentrated to 10 mg\/mL, and crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals were cryoprotected in 15% glycerol and subsequently pressurized under 20 atm Xe for 30 min prior to flash cooling and X-ray data collection. The structure was refined to final Rand Rvalues of 0.23 and 0.25, respectively. TTPC coordinates to the active site Zn ion as the sulfonamidate anion, displacing the zinc-bound hydroxide ion of the native enzyme as previously observed in other complexes of CAII with benzenesulfonamide derivatives. The crystallographic occupancies of the biosensor and Zn are refined at 0.5.","The encapsulation of Xe within the cryptophane cage of TTPC is confirmed by inspection of the Bijvoet difference Fourier map calculated from anomalous scattering data (and ). X-ray diffraction data were collected at a wavelength \u03bb=0.9795 \u212b, which is far from the Xe Ledge of 2.27 \u212b. Nevertheless, the anomalous scattering component f\u2033 is 3.4 e for Xe, so the anomalous signal is still prominent at the wavelength of data collection. A second Xe binding site is observed in a hydrophobic pocket defined by A116, L148, V218, L157, V223, and F226 (). The crystallographic occupancies of these Xe sites refine to 0.50 and 0.37, respectively. Anomalous scattering peaks are absent from crystals not subject to Xe pressurization.","Notably, TTPC contains a chiral axis, and the electron density map reveals the binding of equal populations of both enantiomers (each refined with an occupancy of 0.25; ). Overall, the binding of TTPC does not cause any significant structural changes in the active site, and the root-mean-square deviation is 0.34 \u212b for 256 C \u03b1 atoms between the current structure and the unliganded enzyme (PDB 2CBA).","The total surface area of TTPC is \u02dc1500 \u212b, of which \u02dc500 \u212bbecomes solvent inaccessible due to contacts of TTPC within the active site cleft of CAII designated molecule I in . The surrounding CAII molecules in the unit cell (molecules II-IV) sequester an additional \u02dc540 \u212bof the surface area of 1 from solvent. Some structural changes are observed near the outer rim of the active site cleft where the cryptophane binds. The most notable change is observed for Q136, which rotates \u02dc180\u00b0 to make van der Waals contacts with the cryptophane and the symmetry-related cryptophane bound to molecule III in the crystal lattice. Other residues at the active site rim of molecule I that make close contacts with the cryptophane are G132 and P202. Additional structural changes in the crystal lattice result from the binding of TTPC to molecule I: in molecule II, H36 rotates \u02dc90\u00b0 to make a van der Waals contact with the cage, and Q137 of molecule III rotates \u02dc90\u00b0 to donate a hydrogen bond to an ether oxygen atom of TTPC.","Crystals belonged to space group C2 (unit cell parameters a=67.4 \u212b, b=50.0 \u212b, c=81.0 \u212b, \u03b2=107.1\u00b0) and were isomorphous with those of T199P CAII complexed with thiocyanate (PDB 1LG6). Two xenon sites were identified by inspection of the Bijvoet difference Fourier map calculated from anomalous data. The first site is near the opening of the active site cleft, 18 \u212b from Zn and 8 \u212b from the protein chain, and corresponds to the Xe atom encapsulated by the cryptophane (). The second Xe site is a hydrophobic pocket defined by A116, L148, V218, L157, V223 and F226, which is consistent with the known binding interactions of Xe in other systems (). Neither of those Xe sites are occupied in a crystal not pressurized in the xenon chamber.","Because the crystallographic occupancy was thus 0.5 for Xe encapsulated within the cryptophane moiety, and the electron density map indicated the binding of both cryptophane enantiomers, each enantiomer was refined with an occupancy of 0.25 (average B-factor=43 \u212b). A total of 185 water molecules were included in later cycles of refinement.

The relative dearth of strong cryptophane-protein interactions may explain why the affinity of TTPC measured by ITC is only slightly better than that measured for the parent triazole benzenesulfonamide lacking the cryptophane (K=100\u00b110 nM).","Limited hydrogen bond interactions between CAII and the cryptophane moiety of TTPC may be advantageous for the use of cryptophanes as Xe biosensors. Translational and rotational freedom, the consequence of a flexible linker between the cryptophane and the benzensulfonamide, allows the cage to reorient rapidly in situ, independently of the protein, to result in decreased correlation times and narrower line widths that increase the sensitivity of Xe NMR measurements in solution.","A small family of tri-functionalized cryptophanes is developed, each of which gives a distinct Xe-129 NMR chemical shift, and is subsequently functionalized and targeted to a different biomarker. The tri-functionalized cryptophanes are synthesized having different heteroatoms, such as sulfur, nitrogen and the like, as well as different pendant moieties that improve solubility or targeting, and serve to modulate the Xe-129 NMR chemical shift.","Making small changes in the size, composition and polarity of the cryptophane cage has a big effect on Xe-129 NMR chemical shift.","Large quantities of tri-substituted cryptophane to be used for further synthesis of water-soluble modified cryptophanes at milligram-to-gram scales are needed. A shorter, 6-step synthesis of tripropargyl cryptophane (6, ) from commercial starting materials (vanillyl alcohol, 1,2-dibromoethane, and 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde) was developed that avoids the requirement for vanillyl alcohol protection and deprotection steps. The key step is a step that eliminates the need for allyl group protection\/deprotection to obtain a functionalized cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) intermediate by a widely used method. In one example, the step involves the trimerization of compound 1 () to yield tri-(2-bromoethyl)cyclotriveratrylene 2 (), This intermediate is then reacted with three equivalents of benzaldehyde 3 (). Borohydride reduction and cyclization with scandium triflate then gives tri-propargyl cryptophane 6 () in just 6 steps. Overall yield for this synthetic route is 5.3%, and is 3 fewer steps and at least 50% higher yielding than the previously published 9-step procedure. See Hill, P. A., Wei, Q., Eckenhoff, R.
