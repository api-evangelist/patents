title: Systems and methods for communicating from an integration platform to a provisioning server
abstract: A method for communicating from an integration platform to a server that executes object request broker (ORB) software includes receiving user-entered information at the integration platform. The integration platform generates an event based on the user-entered information and publishes the event on a channel subscribed to by a connector associated with the server. The connector receives the event information, transforms the event information to a format compatible with the server and establishes communications with the server. The connector downloads the information to the server and the server updates its database. The connector may also determine whether at least one other system received the event information before downloading the data to the server.

Nos. 60\/276,923, 60\/276,953, 60\/276,955, and 60\/276,954 all filed on Mar. 20, 2001, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates generally to support systems for telecommunications service providers and, more particularly, to providing a connector from an integration platform to a provisioning server.","Telecommunications service providers continually increase the number of services and products they offer to customers. As competition increases, service providers must provide an increased level of support for these services while keeping costs down.","In conventional support systems, a service provider may use a system integrator to develop solutions that tie together multi-vendor hardware systems. The system integrator typically uses a commercial off the shelf (COTS) software package to integrate the various hardware systems.","One problem with using COTS software to integrate multi-vendor hardware systems is that the selected software is often incompatible with all of the existing hardware systems. In this case, the service provider is often forced to replace legacy systems (i.e., existing systems) in order to maintain full functionality.","Another problem with using COTS software to integrate multi-vendor hardware systems is that the selected software package often does not include pre-packaged modules that permit the software to communicate with various hardware platforms. This may cause the system integrator to exclude one or more hardware platforms from the support system.","There exists a need for systems and methods that improve problems associated with providing a system to support various services and products that a telecommunication service provider offers.","These and other needs are met by the present invention where an operational support system (OSS) integrates various hardware and software platforms. The OSS includes a middleware core that may be customized to integrate various applications\/platforms and to ensure that data from one application can be routed to the appropriate destination(s).","According to one aspect of the invention, a method for communicating from a first system to a first server executing an object request broker (ORB) that is common object request broker architecture (CORBA) compliant is provided. The method includes receiving user-entered information at the first system and sending event information to a channel, where the event information is based on the user-entered information and the channel is subscribed to by an ORB connector. The method also includes receiving, by the ORB connector, the event information, transforming the event information to a format compatible with the first server and establishing, by the ORB connector, communications with the first server, where the first server controls access to a first database. The method further includes downloading the transformed event information to the first server, preparing to write the transformed event information to the first database and determining whether a message from a database system has been received. The method also includes signaling the first server to write the transformed event information to the first database when the message from the database system has been received.","Another aspect of the present invention provides a computer-readable medium having stored instructions which when executed by a processor, cause the processor to monitor an input channel for data associated with at least one of adding, deleting and modifying information stored in a server, the server executing an ORB that complies with CORBA. The instructions also cause the processor to receive the data associated with at least one of adding, deleting and modifying information stored in the server, forward the data to a data storage system and receive an indication that the data storage system stored the data. The instructions further cause the processor to establish communications with the server in response to receiving the indication, format the data based on a type associated with the received data and download the formatted data to the server.","A further aspect of the present invention provides a software-based connector for interfacing between an integration platform and a server executing an ORB that is CORBA compliant. The connector includes a transformer module configured to receive input information associated with at least one of a request to change attributes associated with a service or add a new service and transform the data into an appropriate format based on the request. The connector also includes a client module configured to establish communications with the server and download the transformed data to the server.","Other features and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in this art from the following detailed description. The embodiments shown and described provide illustration of the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is capable of modifications in various obvious respects, all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the drawings are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","The following detailed description of implementations consistent with the present invention refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention. Instead, the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims and equivalents.","Systems and methods consistent with the present invention provide a connection from a support system to a redirect server using a flexible software based connector. The connector may also ensure that the data is properly routed to other portions of the support system before storing the data to the redirect server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","120","130","100"]},"The network  may include, for example, the Internet, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wide area network (WAN), a public switched telephone network (PSTN), and\/or some other similar type of network. In fact, the network  may include any type of network or combination of networks that permits routing of information from a particular source to a particular destination.","The user devices  may include a type of computer system, such as a mainframe, minicomputer, or personal computer, a type of telephone system, such as a POTS telephone or a session initiation protocol (SIP) telephone, and\/or some other similar type of device that is capable of transmitting and receiving information to\/from the network . The user device  may connect to the network via any conventional technique, such as a wired, wireless, or optical connection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["120","120","210","220","230","240","250","260","270","280","210","120"]},"The processor  may include any type of conventional processor or microprocessor that interprets and executes instructions. The memory  may include a random access memory (RAM) or another type of dynamic storage device that stores information and instructions for execution by the processor . The memory  may also be used to store temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions by processor .","The ROM  may include a conventional ROM device and\/or another type of static storage device that stores static information and instructions for the processor . The storage device  may include a magnetic disk or optical disk and its corresponding drive and\/or some other type of magnetic or optical recording medium and its corresponding drive for storing information and\/or instructions.","The input device  may include any conventional mechanism that permits an operator to input information to the user device , such as a keyboard, a mouse, a microphone, a pen, a biometric input device, such as voice recognition device, etc. The output device  may include any conventional mechanism that outputs information to the operator, including a display, a printer, a speaker, etc.","The communication interface  may include any transceiver-like mechanism that enables the user device  to communicate with other devices and\/or systems, such as OSS . For example, the communication interface  may include a modem or an Ethernet interface to a network. Alternatively, communication interface  may include other mechanisms for communicating via a data network.","Returning to , the OSS  provides the infrastructure for integrating applications supporting traditional telephony services and applications supporting non-traditional products\/services. Through OSS , customers, using, for example, user device , may manage, configure, and provision services in real time, obtain real-time billing information, and generate reports using a rules-centric middleware core. In one embodiment, a customer may perform these functions through a single point of entry using an Internet accessible web interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["130","130","310","320","330","340","350","360","370","380","390","130"]},"The process management system  acts as the backbone to the OSS  by providing graphical process automation, data transformation, event management, and flexible connectors for interfacing with OSS  components. In one implementation consistent with the present invention, the process management system  uses a Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) based publish-and-subscribe messaging middleware to integrate the different components of the OSS . The process management system  may, for example, be implemented using Vitria Technology Inc.'s BusinessWare software system. Other techniques for integrating the different components of the OSS  may also be used, such as extensible markup language (XML) or Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB).","The network interface , also referred to as the web front end, provides a graphical user interface that allows users (e.g., customers, engineers, account teams, and the like) to access the components of the OSS . The network interface  may include commercial off the shelf (COTS) software or hardware packages, such as Siteminder by Netegrity Inc. and\/or iplanet by Sun Microsystems Inc., custom software or hardware or a combination of custom software\/hardware and COTS software\/hardware.","The network interface  may, for example, allow customers to request a new service or terminate an existing service and monitor or change network or user settings\/preferences. The network interface  may also allow customers to obtain reports and billing information, perform account management and perform trouble reporting and tracking, all in a real time manner. The network interface  may also allow engineers to submit transactions to control and configure network elements and services in a real time manner. The network interface  may also allow account teams to create and cancel accounts, generate sub-accounts from master accounts, access current account data, and access historical account data.","The network interface  authenticates users and controls actions that authenticated users are allowed to execute in the OSS . In one implementation consistent with the present invention, the network interface  allows users access to the components of the OSS  via a single sign-on technique. This single sign-on eliminates the need for users to sign in (or authenticate themselves) in order to access different components of the OSS .","The integrated applications  may include, for example, a data warehouse , an operational data store (ODS) , a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) based server , an LDAP database , a fault management unit , a data collection unit , a billing unit  and a reporting unit . The data warehouse  may include one or more separate databases for storing data. The data warehouse  acts as a repository for service order, account, usage and performance data. In one implementation, the data warehouse  may be implemented as a relational database management system (RDBMS) and may include a server (not shown) that controls access to the data warehouse .","The ODS  may also include one or more separate databases for storing data. The ODS  temporarily stores data that is used in the course of fulfilling, for example, account creation, service order management, and network provisioning operations. The ODS  also stores authentication and authorization data. This data defines user's roles and privileges. Like the data warehouse , the ODS  may be a RDBMS and may include a server (not shown) that controls access to the ODS .","The LDAP server  may be a general directory server that controls access to the LDAP database . The LDAP database  may be an LDAP-based repository that stores information associated with users in a hierarchical, tree-like structure. For example, the LDAP database  may store attributes for a user that may include preferences associated with the following exemplary services: call blocking, follow-me, call forwarding, voice mail, conference calling, single line extension, call screening, quality of service, class of service, dial plan restrictions, dynamic registration, secondary directory number and call transfer. The LDAP database  may store this information as one or more directory entries for each user. Each directory entry may include an identifier associated with the user and a collection of attributes associated with the user. Each of the attributes may include a type and one or more values that identify the user's settings associated with that type. In this manner, the LDAP server  and LDAB database  provide a system that enables the user's preferences regarding various services to be stored, searched, updated and retrieved in an efficient manner. The LDAP server  and LDAP database  are shown as separate devices. It should be understood, however, that these two devices may both be part of the same directory server in implementations consistent with the present invention.","The fault management unit  monitors and manages the operation of the OSS . The fault management unit  may receive information from every device, computer and application in the OSS  via the process management system . In situations where a fault has been detected, the fault management unit  may transmit a trouble ticket identifying the fault to the appropriate system administrator.","The data collection unit  collects usage and performance data for the products supported by the OSS . In one implementation, the data collection unit  utilizes a hierarchical architecture, having a centralized manager that defines and manages collection and data transformation. Individual, lower level gatherers interface with source targets. The data collection unit  may aggregate the gathered data and provide the data to other end-user applications in a desired format. For example, data collection unit  may provide various records to billing unit .","The billing unit  receives customer usage and performance data from the data collection unit  and generates bills for the customer. The billing unit  may be configured with a variety of rating rules and plans and may provide mechanisms to manage and create rating plans. The rating rules may include traditional telephony styled rating rules that include time-of-day, day-of-week, distance-based, flat rate, non-recurring and recurring on a definably regular basis, such as weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc. In an exemplary implementation of the present invention, the billing unit  may provide bonus points, airline miles and other incentives as part of the rules-based rating and billing service.","The billing unit  may provide revenue and billing reports to authorized parties. The billing unit  may further allow customers to access previous invoices and view current charges not yet billed. In an exemplary implementation consistent with the present invention, the billing unit  may transfer rated events and summary records into other billing and revenue systems. For example, billing unit  may receive and transfer billing information or event information to a legacy billing system (i.e., an existing billing system) that generates the actual bill. In alternative implementations, billing unit  may provide hard copy bills and\/or provide electronic bills to a customer. In this implementation, billing unit  may also be configured to perform electronic payment handling.","As customer orders and accounts are created or modified through normal business functions, the OSS  keeps the billing unit  up to date in a real-time manner. Authorized parties may also extract real-time data from the billing unit .","The reporting unit  may interact with various components of the OSS , such as the data warehouse , the data collection unit  and the billing unit , to provide user (i.e., customers, engineers and account team members) with the ability to obtain reports based on real-time data. The reports may include, for example, billing reports, reports regarding the usage and\/or performance of the network, etc.","The traditional telephony systems  may include one or more components that are typically used in a telecommunications network. In one implementation, the traditional telephony systems  include one or more legacy systems, such as an order entry system, provisioning system, billing system, and the like.","The voice portal unit  provides a variety of information services to subscribers. These services may include, for example, banking, brokerage, and financial services, travel and entertainment services, distribution and shipping services, insurance services, health and pharmaceutical services, manufacturing services, and the like. The voice portal unit  may store subscriber profiles to determine a subscriber's device preference (e.g., a cellular telephone, a personal digital assistant, a paging device, and the like) and may also track a subscriber's access to the services provided for billing purposes.","The web center  acts as a virtual call center by queuing, routing and distributing communications from any first location to an appropriate agent at any second location. The web center  allows agents to handle multiple mediums (e.g., inbound telephone calls, faxes, e-mails, voicemail, VoIP transactions, etc.) via a single browser-based interface. In one implementation, the web center  may be implemented using CallCenter@nywhere from Telephony@Work, Inc.","The IPCOM unit  may include one or more devices that provide voice-over-IP (VoIP) services to subscribers. The subscribers may make and receive calls via an IP communications network using, for example, session initiation protocol (SIP) telephones. The IPCOM unit  may support the following services: follow me, call blocking, call forwarding, voice mail, conference calling, single line extension, call screening, quality of service, class of service, dial-plan restrictions, dynamic registration, secondary directory number, and call transfer. Customers may set or change attributes associated with these features via the network interface .","The vBNS+ unit  provides the IP infrastructure for the IP communications network. The vBNS+ unit  may include a group of edge routers for routing packets in the network. The non-integrated applications  may include, for example, a security unit, a trouble ticketing unit, and a fault manager. The security unit may include one or more firewalls for securing the network interface , telephone equipment (e.g., PBX, switch, redirect server, etc.) and network equipment. The trouble ticketing unit manages the issuance and resolution of trouble tickets and the fault manager monitors the hardware components of the OSS .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["310","310","410","420","430","440","450","460","410","310"]},"The processor  may include any type of conventional processor or microprocessor that interprets and executes instructions.

The data collection unit  may then pass this information to billing unit  for billing purposes. The voice portal application servers  may be located at the OSS  or distributed throughout the network .

The network server , also referred to as the proxy server or SIP server, processes the actual calls made over the IP communications network. The network server  directs the calls to CPE enterprise gateways\/routers  or network gateways  based on the type of call and the network-supported features to which a customer subscribes. The network-supported features may include, for example, follow me, call blocking, call forwarding, voice mail, conference calling, single line extension, call screening, quality of service, class of service, dial-plan restrictions, dynamic registration, secondary directory number, and call transfer. As described above, a subscriber may change attributes of these network-supported features using the network interface . The redirect server  may also communicate with the data collection unit .","The CPE enterprise gateways\/routers  may include one or more gateways for linking POTS telephone systems to the IP communications network. The CPE enterprise gateways\/routers  may, for example, connect to a customer's private branch exchange (PBX) and convert TDM voice data into VoIP packets and voice signaling into SIP messages. The CPE enterprise gateways\/routers  may also include one or more routers that receive information from a SIP phone over a network, such as a LAN or WAN.","The network gateways  may include one or more gateways for linking the IP communications network to the PSTN in a well known manner.

The ORB connector  manages the semantics associated with managing event queues on a channel on behalf of the redirect server . According to an exemplary implementation of the invention, the ORB connector  communicates with the redirect server  to enable a user to add, modify or delete information stored in the redirect server database .","For example, as described previously, the redirect server database  may store call processing information, subscriber profiles, network-supported features, etc. The redirect server  may also store information in the redirect server database  that is associated with SIP services to enable the OSS  to perform address validation, feature status checks and provide real-time subscriber feature configuration information. The subscriber features may include information associated with call blocking, follow-me, call forwarding, voice mail, conference calling, single line extension, call screening, quality of service, class of service, dial plan restrictions, dynamic registration, secondary directory number and call transfer for the user. The redirect server  may also store information associated with how the IP communications network is configured. The redirect server  may store this information in redirect server database . When the user wishes to modify information, such as information associated with a subscriber feature or the user's profile, the user may input this information via network interface . The process management system  may receive the information from network interface  and may then implement the user's change via ORB connector , as described in more detail below.","The ORB connector  may also include logic that allows \u201cevent\u201d information to be written to the redirect server database  using a 2-phase commit procedure. The event information may include the user-entered information received via the network interface . By using a 2-phase commit procedure, the process management system  ensures that data written to the redirect server database  is consistent with data stored in other portions of the OSS , as described in more detail below.","The channel source  represents input data associated with user-entered event information. For example, when a user accesses the OSS  to perform some transaction, e.g., update a user profile, the process management system  receives the data via the network interface  and processes the data. In an exemplary implementation consistent with the present invention, the central engine  () publishes an event on a channel, such as the channel corresponding to the channel source . The transformer  subscribes to the channel associated with the channel source  and receives the event information.","The transformer  may then identify the particular type of event received from the channel source . For example, transformer  determines what product or service that the event is associated with and whether the event is associated with a user modifying his\/her profile associated with that particular service\/product. The transformer  may then determine how to format the data associated with the received event. The transformer  may also invoke an ORB client process  to connect to the redirect server . The ORB client  may then transmit the re-formatted event information to the redirect server .","In accordance with an exemplary implementation of the invention, the transformer  may also send the data to various channel targets  subscribed to by other modules\/external systems. For example, according to an exemplary implementation of the present invention, the transformer  may forward event information to a channel subscribed to by a connector associated with the ODS , represented by channel target . It should be understood that in other implementations of the invention, the ORB connector  may forward event information to channels associated with other modules\/externals systems, based on the particular system requirements.","As described previously, the redirect server  stores information associated with a user\/subscriber.

For example, assume that the user wishes to change his\/her IP address from which the user initiates or receives VoIP calls. In this case, the user may access the OSS  with a conventional user device  via network  (). The user may provide a user identification and\/or password and network interface  may determine whether the user is authorized to access\/modify various information stored in the OSS . Assuming that the user is authorized, the OSS  downloads a graphical user interface (GUI) to the user's particular user device  (act ). The GUI may include a number of options associated with the user's account.

The central engine  may then publish the event on a channel (act ).","In the example described above where the event is associated with updating an IP address, the central engine  publishes the event to a channel subscribed to by ORB connector , represented by channel source  (). The ORB connector  then receives the event information (act ). In an exemplary implementation consistent with the present invention, the transformer  extracts the event contents, which may be in the form of an extensible markup language (XML) string. The transformer  identifies the event type based on the received information and converts the event information into an appropriate format based on the event type (act ). For example, in the scenario described above, the transformer  may format the data for output to the redirect server .","The ORB connector  may also open ORB client  to initiate communications with the redirect server  (act ). The ORB client  may establish communications with the redirect server  via, for example, a method call using an Internet inter-orb protocol (IIOP).

For example, the ORB client  may execute an interface definition language (IDL) file that defines the redirect server's  application programming interface (API). In an exemplary implementation of the present invention, the IDL file may be written in a language such as C++. Alternatively, the IDL file may be written in any language that provides CORBA bindings, such as C, Ada, Java, COBOL, Smalltalk, etc. The IDL may specify methods to connect, ping, obtain information, update information, delete information and disconnect to\/from redirect server .

The discussion below with respect to  assumes that the ORB client  is able to establish communications with the redirect server .","Once the connection to the redirect server  is established, the ORB connector  manages and controls the transfer of data to the redirect server . In an exemplary implementation of the present invention, the data traveling from the ORB client  to the redirect server  may be in the form of name value and name value sequence pairs. For example, a name value may include a field name and a field value and a name value sequence may include an array of the name value pairs. The ORB client  may pass the name value and name value sequence pairs to the redirect server .","The transformer  may also publish the event information to other channels, represented by channel target  (act ). These channel targets may be associated with other external systems\/connectors that may be involved in storing or processing information associated with the user's profile, such as the user's IP address. In the example above, the channel targets  may include a channel subscribed to by ODS . In alternative implementations, the central engine  may publish the event to the channel target associated with ODS  at the same time that the event is published to the channel subscribed to by the ORB connector . It should also be understood that the event may be published to any particular channel target associated with another connector based on the particular system requirements.","In either case, the redirect server  receives the event information from ORB client  and initiates an ORB server process  to update the user's preference information (act ). Similarly, the ODS  also receives the event information via a connector designed to interface with this particular system (act ). For example, as described previously, ODS  may be an RDBMS. In this case, one of connectors  that is designed to communicate with an RDBMS may be utilized to establish communications with ODS .","According to an exemplary implementation, the redirect server process  prepares the information to be written to the redirect server database  (act ). For example, the redirect server process  may format the information according to rules associated with storing data in the redirect server database . The redirect server process  may then determine whether the other external system(s) that is associated with the event has provided a \u201cgo ahead\u201d message indicating that it has successfully received the event information and is prepared to make the necessary changes to its database (act ).","For example, when the ODS  has received the event information, the ODS  may provide a message to the redirect server , via the process management system , indicating that it has successfully received the event information and is prepared to make the appropriate updates.","If the redirect server process  receives the message indicating that the ODS  received the event information, the redirect server process  downloads the changes to the redirect server database  (act ). In an alternative implementation, the ODS  may provide a message to the redirect server , via the process management system , when it has received and stored the event information in its database.","In either case, if the redirect server process  does not receive the go ahead indication from the ODS , the redirect server process  may \u201croll back\u201d the transaction to the point prior to receiving the event information from ORB client  (act ). In other words, the redirect server process  returns the redirect server  and redirect server database  to the state they were in prior to receiving the event information. In this manner, the redirect server process  performs a 2-phase commit process. That is, the redirect server  performs all transactions associated with writing to the redirect server database  up to the point of actually storing the data in the redirect server database . The redirect server process , however, does not commit the transaction to the redirect server database  until it receives an indication from the other relevant system(s) that it\/they are also ready to make the necessary changes to its respective database(s). This enables the redirect server  to ensure that the event information will be implemented in all the proper systems\/databases before the redirect server  commits the operation to the redirect server database , thereby maintaining consistency across the various systems in the OSS .","Implementations consistent with the present invention also provide a mechanism for establishing a connection between the ORB connector  and redirect server   after an initial attempt is unsuccessful.  is a flow diagram, consistent with the present invention, illustrating exemplary processing associated with establishing communications with redirect server . Assume that the ORB client  cannot establish a connection with the redirect server  at act  (act ). For example, assume that the redirect server  is offline, busy with another event, or generally unavailable. In this case, ORB client  queues the event (act ).","The ORB client  may also start a thread to check when the connection to the redirect server  can be made, i.e., determine when the redirect server  is available (act ). For example, the ORB client  may open a new thread that periodically \u201cpings\u201d the redirect server  to determine whether the redirect server  is available (act ). If the redirect server  is not available, the ORB client  may re-check the redirect server  every predetermined period of time. The predetermined period may be configurable. In addition, the ORB client  may repeat this process until a positive response is received or may ping the redirect server  a configurable number of times.","When the redirect server  is available, the ORB client  establishes the communication link to the redirect server  and downloads the queued event information to the redirect server  (act ). The redirect server  may then store the event information associated with a particular user in the redirect server database  (act ). It should be understood, however, that the other external system(s), such as the ODS , must also provide an indication that it has received the event information and is also ready to commit the desired update\/deletion\/modification in its database, as discussed above with respect to . In this manner, the two systems, i.e., the redirect server database  and ODS , are updated at the same time. This ensures that the customer will receive the desired service. For example, coordinating the implementation of the user-entered information ensures that the customer will receive the desired VoIP service.","If the redirect server  is still unavailable after a predetermined period of time or after a predetermined number of attempts, the ORB client  may provide an alarm message indicating that the redirect server  is unavailable (act ). This alarm may be sent to a device, such as fault management unit . In implementations consistent with the present invention, the ORB connector  may also provide information as to why the connection with the redirect server  cannot be established. For example, the ORB connector  may indicate that the redirect server  is offline.","The ORB connector , in implementations consistent with the present invention, may also signal the ODS , via process management system , to roll back the previous write operation. In this manner, the data across the OSS  remains consistent.","In another implementation consistent with the present invention, after the ORB connector  receives the event information at act  (), the transformer  may publish the event information to channel target . Channel target , as described previously, may be associated with ODS . In this case, a connector associated with the ODS  receives the event information and forwards the event information to the ODS .","The ODS  may then store the event information. If the ODS  is unable to store the event information due to a data related error (e.g., the user entered information is outside an accepted range) or an equipment problem (e.g., the ODS  is offline), the ODS  may send a signal back to the ORB connector . The ORB connector  may then send an error message back to the user. Assuming that the ODS  write operation is successful, the ODS  may send a message back to the process management system  indicating that the event data has been stored.","After the ORB connector  receives the acknowledgement that the ODS  successfully stored the data, the transformer  invokes the ORB client  to establish communications with the redirect server . Assuming that the ORB client  is able to establish communications with the redirect server process , the event information is then written to the redirect server database .","If the ORB client  is unable to establish communications with the redirect server , the ORB client  may queue the event. Processing may then continue as described previously with respect to . In this implementation, the ODS  receives and stores the event information before the event is forwarded to the redirect server .","If the ORB client  is unable to establish communications with the redirect server  after a predetermined period of time or a predetermined number of attempts, the process management system  may signal the ODS  to roll back the previous write operation. In this manner, the data in the redirect server  and the ODS  remains consistent.","Systems and methods consistent with the present invention provide a flexible connection between a support system and a server executing an ORB to allow a user to add, modify and delete attributes associated with particular telecommunications services. An advantage of the invention is that the same connector can be use to provide connectivity to any other system that executes a CORBA compliant ORB. Another advantage of the invention is that the connector is fault tolerant. For example, when the redirect server  is unavailable, the ORB connector  includes provisions for retrying the connection. This results in a more flexible and reliable system.","A further advantage of the present invention is the system can be easily modified to support various vendors' equipment. For example, the ORB connector  described above essentially uses a two-tiered approach to connect with the redirect server . The first tier deals with the semantics of the physical connection and protocol between the ORB connector  and the target redirect server . The second tier described above in relation to the transformer process deals with transaction completion and fault tolerance. If the particular ORB vendor associated with the redirect server  changes, only the first tier of the connector needs to be modified to support this vendor. Therefore, the ORB connector  facilitates the integration of new systems that use CORBA compliant ORBs, thereby reducing development time and costs.","In this disclosure, there is shown and described only the preferred embodiments of the invention, but, as aforementioned, it is to be understood that the invention is capable of use in various other combinations and environments and is capable of changes or modifications within the scope of the inventive concept as expressed herein.","For example, the present invention has been described mainly in relation to a number of attributes associated with various services\/products offered by a telecommunications service provider.

In addition, the present invention has been described mainly in relation to an integration platform associated with a telecommunications service provider.
