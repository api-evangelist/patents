Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a golf ball. More specifically, the present invention relates to a solid three-piece golf ball with an aerodynamic surface geometry, a relatively thin cover, a high core compression, a high cover hardness and an initial velocity limited to less than 255 feet per second.","2. Description of the Related Art","The traditional golf ball, as readily accepted by the consuming public, is spherical with a plurality of dimples, with each dimple having a circular cross-section. Many golf balls have been disclosed that break with this tradition, however, for the most part these non-traditional golf balls have been commercially unsuccessful.","Most of these non-traditional golf balls still attempt to adhere to the Rules Of Golf, as set forth by the United States Golf Association (\u201cUSGA\u201d) and The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of Saint Andrews (\u201cR&A\u201d), which have placed controls on the construction and performance of golf balls. As set forth in Appendix III of the Rules of Golf, the weight of the ball shall not be greater than 1.620 ounces avoirdupois (45.93 g), and the diameter of the ball shall not be less than 1.680 inches (42.67 mm), which is satisfied if, under its own weight, a ball falls through a 1.680 inches diameter ring gauge in fewer than 25 out of 100 randomly selected positions, the test being carried out at a temperature of 23\u00b11\u00b0 C. In addition, the ball must not be designed, manufactured or intentionally modified to have properties, which differ from those of a spherically symmetrical ball.","One example is Shimosaka et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,916,044, for a Golf Ball that discloses the use of protrusions to meet the 1.68 inches (42.67 mm) diameter limitation of the USGA and R&A. The Shimosaka patent discloses a golf ball with a plurality of dimples on the surface and a few rows of protrusions that have a height of 0.001 to 1.0 mm from the surface. Thus, the diameter of the land area is less than 42.67 mm.","Another example of a non-traditional golf ball is Puckett et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,836,552 for a Short Distance Golf Ball, which discloses a golf ball having brambles instead of dimples in order to reduce the flight distance to half of that of a traditional golf ball in order to play on short distance courses.","Another example of a non-traditional golf ball is Pocklington, U.S. Pat. No. 5,536,013 for a Golf Ball, which discloses a golf ball having raised portions within each dimple, and also discloses dimples of varying geometric shapes, such as squares, diamonds and pentagons. The raised portions in each of the dimples of Pocklington assist in controlling the overall volume of the dimples.","Another example is Kobayashi, U.S. Pat. No. 4,787,638 for a Golf Ball, which discloses a golf ball having dimples with indentations within each of the dimples. The indentations in the dimples of Kobayashi are to reduce the air pressure drag at low speeds in order to increase the distance.","Yet another example is Treadwell, U.S. Pat. No. 4,266,773 for a Golf Ball, which discloses a golf ball having rough bands and smooth bands on its surface in order to trip the boundary layer of air flow during flight of the golf ball.","Aoyama, U.S. Pat. No. 4,830,378 for a Golf Ball with Uniform Land Configuration, discloses a golf ball with dimples that have triangular shapes. The total flat land area of Aoyama is no greater than 20% of the surface of the golf ball, and the objective of the patent is to optimize the uniform land configuration and not the dimples.","Another variation in the shape of the dimples is set forth in Steifel, U.S. Pat. No. 5,890,975 for a Golf Ball and Method of Forming Dimples Thereon. Some of the dimples of Steifel are elongated to have an elliptical cross-section instead of a circular cross-section. The elongated dimples make it possible to increase the surface coverage area. A design patent to Steifel, U.S. Pat. No. D406,623 has all elongated dimples.","A variation on this theme is set forth in Moriyama et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,722,903 for a Golf Ball, which discloses a golf ball with traditional dimples and oval shaped dimples.","A further example of a non-traditional golf ball is set forth in Shaw et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,722,529 for Golf Balls, which discloses a golf ball with dimples and 30 bald patches in the shape of a dumbbell for improvements in aerodynamics.","Another example of a non-traditional golf ball is Cadorniga, U.S. Pat. No. 5,470,076 for a Golf Ball, which discloses each of a plurality of dimples having an additional recess. It is believed that the major and minor recess dimples of Cadorniga create a smaller wake of air during flight of a golf ball.","Oka et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,377 for a Golf Ball, discloses circular and non-circular dimples are square, regular octagonal, regular hexagonal and amount to at least forty percent of the 332 dimples on the golf ball of Oka. These non-circular dimples of Oka have a double slope that sweeps air away from the periphery in order to make the air turbulent.","Machin, U.S. Pat. No. 5,377,989 for Golf Balls with Isodiametrical Dimples, discloses a golf ball having dimples with an odd number of curved sides and arcuate apices to reduce the drag on the golf ball during flight.","Lavallee et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,356,150, discloses a golf ball having overlapping elongated dimples to obtain maximum dimple coverage on the surface of the golf ball.","Oka et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,338,039, discloses a golf ball having at least forty percent of its dimples with a polygonal shape. The shapes of the Oka golf ball are pentagonal, hexagonal and octagonal.","The golf ball rules further require that a golf ball have an overall distance no greater than 296.8 yds (the limit is 280 yds, or 256 m, plus a six percent tolerance for the total distance of 296.8 yds) and an initial velocity no greater than 255.0 ft\/s (the limit is 250 ft\/s or 76.2 m\/s, with a two percent maximum tolerance that allows for an initial velocity of 255 ft\/s) measured on a USGA approved apparatus.","The initial velocity test for conformance is comprised of a large 275 pound wheel that rotates around a central axis at a rate of 143.8 feet per second (striker tangential velocity) and strikes a stationary golf ball resting on a tee. The wheel has a flat plate that protrudes during its final revolution prior to impact with the golf ball. The ball's velocity is then measured via light gates as it travels approximately six feet through an enclosed tunnel. Balls are kept in an incubator at a constant temperature of 23 degrees Celsius for at least three hours before they are tested for initial velocity performance. To test for initial velocity, balls are placed on a tee and hit with the metal striker described above. Twenty-four balls of a particular type make up one test. Each ball is hit with the spinning wheel a total of four times. The highest and lowest recorded velocities are eliminated and the remaining two velocities are averaged to determine the ball speed for that specific ball. The individual speeds of the 24 balls in the group are then averaged, and that is considered the mean initial velocity (IV) of the group for the test.","For USGA conformance purposes, a ball with a mean initial velocity of less than 255.0 ft\/s is considered conforming to the USGA Rule of Golf and can be played in sanctioned events. For reference to the USGA Wheel Test see the USGA web-site at www.usga.com, or reference U.S. Pat. No. 5,682,230 for further information.","Generally speaking, the USGA IV test is designed to be a consistent measurement tool capable of regulating the speed (and ultimately distance) of golf balls. It is commonly known in the industry that golf ball manufacturers perform a simpler test on prototype golf balls and then attempt to correlate the results to the USGA Wheel Test. One type of correlation test is the Coefficient of Restitution (\u201cCOR\u201d) test, which consists of firing a golf ball from a cannon into a fixed plate and taking the ratio of outgoing velocity to incoming velocity.","The Coefficient of Restitution is the ratio of the velocity of separation (V\u2212V) to the velocity of approach (V\u2212V), where COR=(V\u2212V)\/(V\u2212V). The value of COR will depend on the shape and material properties of the colliding bodies. In elastic impact, the COR is unity and there is no energy loss. A COR of zero indicates perfectly inelastic or plastic impact, where there is no separation of the bodies after collision and the energy loss is a maximum. In oblique impact, the COR applies only to those components of velocity along the line of impact or normal to the plane of impact. The coefficient of restitution between two materials can be measured by making one body many times larger than the other so that m(mass of larger body) is infinitely large in comparison to m(mass of the smaller body). The velocity of mis unchanged for all practical purposes during impact and\n\n\n","One particular type of COR test device that is commonly used in the golf ball industry is the ADC COR machine developed by Automated Design Corporation. Based on the definition of COR above, mis a large 400 lb plate fixed vertically that the ball (m) is fired into. The impact of the golf ball to the large fixed plate is an oblique impact. Software developed by Automated Design Corporation accurately calculates the normal velocities given the dimensions of the machine and outputs a value for Coefficient of Restitution as defined above.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,209,485, filed in 1991, discloses a restricted flight golf ball that has a reduced COR. However, the '485 patent also discloses, for comparison purposes, that the TOP FLITE\u00aeXL golf balls, manufactured and sold by Spalding had a COR value of 0.813 when fired at a speed of 125 ft\/s. The '485 patent also discloses that the Spalding SUPER RANGE golf ball had a COR value of 0.817 when fired at a speed of 125 ft\/s. However, the SUPER RANGE golf ball was a non-conforming golf ball and thus had an IV value greater than 255 ft\/s.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,803,831, filed in 1996 discloses in Table 14 a finished solid three-piece golf ball that has a COR of 0.784 at a speed of what is believed to be 125 ft\/s.","Although the prior art has set forth numerous variations for the surface of a golf ball, the prior art golf balls fail to provide an aerodynamic golf ball with a surface that minimizes the volume needed to trip the boundary layer of air at low speeds while providing a low drag level at high speeds and that conforms to the USGA IV limit of 255 feet per second while having a high COR.","The present invention provides a solution to the problem of adhering to the USGA initial velocity limit of 255 feet per second for a golf ball while increasing the distance a golf ball travels when struck with a golf club. The solution is a solid three-piece golf ball with a high PGA compression core, a thin cover and an aerodynamic surface geometry that adheres to the USGA initial velocity limit.","One aspect of the present invention is a golf ball including a core composed of a polybutadiene blend, an intermediate layer, a cover, and an innersphere with a plurality of lattice members forming a predetermined pattern of polygons. The golf ball has a ball Shore D hardness ranging from 45 points to 75 points as measured on the surface of the golf ball, a coefficient of restitution greater than 0.7964 at 143 feet per second, and an USGA initial velocity less than 255.0 feet per second.","Another aspect of the invention is a golf ball that includes a core composed of a polybutadiene blend, an intermediate layer composed of a thermoplastic material, a cover composed of a thermosetting polyurethane material, and an innersphere with a plurality of lattice members forming a predetermined pattern of polygons. The golf ball has a ball Shore D hardness ranging from 45 points to 75 points as measured on the surface of the golf ball, a coefficient of restitution greater than 0.7964 at 143 feet per second, and an USGA initial velocity less than 255.0 feet per second. The core has a PGA compression ranging from 75 points to 120 points. The intermediate layer has a Shore D hardness ranging from 50 points to 75 points as measured on the surface of the intermediate layer.","Yet another aspect of the present invention is a golf ball that includes a solid core composed of a polybutadiene blend, an intermediate layer composed of an ionomer material, a cover composed of a polyurethane material, and an innersphere with a plurality of lattice members forming a predetermined pattern of polygons. The solid core has a PGA compression ranging from 75 points to 120 points, a diameter ranging from 1.35 inches to 1.64 inches, and a mass ranging from 32 grams to 40 grams. The intermediate layer has a Shore D hardness ranging from 55 points to 75 points as measured on the curved surface of the intermediate layer. The cover has a thickness ranging from 0.015 inch to 0.044 inch. The golf ball has a coefficient of restitution greater than 0.7964 at 143 feet per second, and an USGA initial velocity less than 255.0 feet per second. The golf ball also has a ball Shore D hardness ranging from 50 points to 75 points as measured on the surface of the golf ball.","Having briefly described the present invention, the above and further objects, features and advantages thereof will be recognized by those skilled in the pertinent art from the following detailed description of the invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","As shown in , a golf ball of the present invention is generally designated . The golf ball  has a coefficient of restitution greater than 0.7964 at 143 feet per second, and an USGA initial velocity less than 255.0 feet per second. The golf ball of  is a solid three-piece golf ball  having a core , a cover  and an intermediate layer . Those skilled in the pertinent art, however, will recognize that other golf balls may be utilized without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.","The surface geometry of the golf ball  is a non-dimple surface geometry and will be described in greater detail below.","The golf ball  is finished with either a very thin (microns in thickness) single top coating, or is painted with one or more base coats of paint, typically white, before application of a clear coat. The material of the cover  may be doped for coloring, as is well known in the art.","The core  of the golf ball  is the \u201cengine\u201d for the golf ball  such that the inherent properties of the core  will strongly determine the initial velocity and distance of the golf ball . A higher initial velocity will usually result in a greater overall distance for a golf ball. However, the initial velocity and overall distance of a golf ball must not exceed the USGA and R&A limits in order to conform to the Rules of Golf. Therefore, the core  for a USGA approved golf ball is constructed to enable the golf ball  to meet, yet not exceed, these limits.","The COR is a measure of the resilience of a golf ball. A golf ball having a COR value closer to 1 will generally correspond to a golf ball having a higher initial velocity and a greater overall distance. In general, a higher compression core will result in a higher COR value.","The core  of the golf ball  is generally composed of a blend of a base rubber, a cross-linking agent, a free radical initiator, and one or more fillers or processing aids. A preferred base rubber is a polybutadiene having a cis-1,4 content above 90%, and more preferably 98% or above.","The use of cross-linking agents in a polybutadiene core is well known, and metal acrylate salts are examples of such cross-linking agents. Metal salt diacrylates, dimethacrylates, or mono(meth)acrylates are preferred for use in the core  of the golf ball  of the present invention, and zinc diacrylate is a particularly preferred cross-linking agent. A commercially available suitable zinc diacrylate is SR-416 available from Sartomer Co., Inc., Exton, Pa. Other metal salt di- or mono- (meth)acrylates suitable for use in the present invention include those in which the metal is calcium or magnesium. In the manufacturing process it may be beneficial to pre-mix some cross-linking agent(s), such as zinc diacrylate with the polybutadiene in a master batch prior to blending with other core components.","Free radical initiators are used to promote cross-linking of the base rubber and the cross-linking agent. Suitable free radical initiators for use in the core  of the golf ball  of the present invention include peroxides such as dicumyl peroxide, bis-(t-butyl peroxy) diisopropyl benzene, t-butyl perbenzoate, di-t-butyl peroxide, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di-5-butylperoxy-hexane, 1,1-di (t-butylperoxy) 3,3,5-trimethyl cyclohexane, and the like, all of which are readily commercially available.","Zinc oxide is also preferably included in the core formulation. Zinc oxide may primarily be used as a weight adjusting filler, and is also believed to participate in the cross-linking of the other components of the core (e.g. as a coagent). Additional processing aids such as dispersants and activators may optionally be included. In particular, zinc stearate may be added as a processing aid (e.g. as an activator). Any of a number of specific gravity adjusting fillers may be included to obtain a preferred total weight of the core . Examples of such fillers include tungsten and barium sulfate. All such processing aids and fillers are readily commercially available. The present inventors have found a particularly useful tungsten filler is WP102 Tungsten having a 3 micron particle size) available from Atlantic Equipment, Bergenfield, N.J.","Table One below provides the ranges of materials included in the preferred core formulations of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE ONE"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Core Formulation"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Component","Preferred Range","Most Preferred Range"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Polybutadiene","100 parts","100 parts"]},{"entry":[{},"Zinc diacrylate","\u200220-35 phr","\u200225-30 phr"]},{"entry":[{},"Zinc oxide","\u20030-50 phr","\u20035-15 phr"]},{"entry":[{},"Zinc stearate","\u20030-15 phr","\u20031-10 phr"]},{"entry":[{},"Peroxide","0.2-2.5 phr","0.5-1.5 phr"]},{"entry":[{},"Filler","As desired","As desired"]},{"entry":[{},"(e.g. tungsten)","\u2002(2-14 phr)","(10 phr)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"In the present invention, the core components are mixed and compression molded in a conventional manner known to those skilled in the art. The finished core  preferably has a diameter of about 1.35 to about 1.64 inches for a golf ball  having an outer diameter of 1.68 inches, more preferably a diameter of 1.45 inches to 1.55 inches, and most preferably a diameter ranging from 1.49 inch to 1.515 inch. The core weight is preferably maintained in the range of about 32 grams to about 40 grams. The core PGA compression is preferably maintained in the range of about 75 points to 120 points, most preferably about 90 points to 110 points, and the most preferred is a PGA compression of 90 or 100 points.","As used herein, the term \u201cPGA compression\u201d is defined as follows:\n\nPGA compression value=180\u2212Riehle compression value\n","The Riehle compression value is the amount of deformation of a golf ball in inches under a static load of 200 pounds, multiplied by 1000. Accordingly, for a deformation of 0.095 inches under a load of 200 pounds, the Riehle compression value is 95 and the PGA compression value is 85.","In a preferred embodiment, the cover  is composed of a thermosetting polyurethane material. Preferably the thermosetting polyurethane material is formed from a blend of polyurethane prepolymers and curing agents such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,190,268, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. However, in an alternative embodiment, the cover  is composed of a blend of ionomers, as discussed below in reference to the intermediate layer .","The intermediate layer  is preferably composed of a thermoplastic material or a blend of thermoplastic materials (e.g. metal containing, non-metal containing or both). Most preferably the intermediate layer  is composed of at least one thermoplastic material that contains organic chain molecules and metal ions. The metal ion is sodium, zinc, magnesium, lithium, potassium, cesium, or any polar metal ion that serves as a reversible cross-linking site and results in high levels of resilience and impact resistance. Suitable commercially available thermoplastic materials are ionomers based on ethylene copolymers and containing carboxylic acid groups with metal ions such as described above. The acid levels in such suitable ionomers may be neutralized to control resiliency, impact resistance and other like properties. In addition, other fillers with ionomer carriers may be used to modify the specific gravity of the thermoplastic material blend to adjust the moment of inertia and other like properties. Exemplary commercially available thermoplastic materials suitable for use in an intermediate layer  of a golf ball  of the present invention include, for example, the following materials and\/or blends of the following materials: HYTREL\u00ae and\/or HYLENE\u00ae products from DuPont, Wilmington, Del., PEBAX\u00ae products from Elf Atochem, Philadelphia, Pa., SURLYN\u00ae products from DuPont, and\/or ESCOR\u00ae or IOTEK\u00ae products from Exxon Chemical, Houston, Tex.","The Shore D hardness of the intermediate layer  is preferably 50 to 75. It is preferred that the intermediate layer  has a hardness of between about 65-70 Shore D. In a preferred embodiment, the intermediate layer  has a Shore D hardness of about 68. It is also preferred that the intermediate layer  is composed of a blend of SURLYN\u00ae ionomer resins.","SURLYN\u00ae 8150, 9150, and 6320 are, respectively, an ionomer resin composed of a sodium neutralized ethylene\/methacrylic acid, an ionomer resin composed of a zinc neutralized ethylene\/methacrylic acid, and an ionomer resin composed of a terpolymer of ethylene, methacrylic acid and n-butyl acrylate partially neutralized with magnesium, all of which are available from DuPont, Polymer Products, Wilmington, Del. It is well known in the art that one may vary the amounts of the different types of resins in order to adjust the hardness of the final material.","The intermediate layer  may include a predetermined amount of a baryte mixture. The baryte mixture is included as 8 or 9 parts per hundred parts of the ionomer resins. One preferred baryte mixture is composed of 80% barytes and 20% of an ionomer, and is available from Americhem, Inc., Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, under the trade designation 38534X1.","A preferred embodiment of the golf ball  of the present invention is a solid three-piece golf ball. However, an alternative embodiment has a wound layer between the intermediate layer  and the cover  such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,379,266, filed on Mar. 16, 2000, for a Four Piece Golf Ball, which pertinent parts are hereby incorporated by reference. The core  is composed of a polybutadiene blend as described above. The core  has a diameter between 1.45 inches and 1.55 inches, and most preferably 1.49 inches. The core  has a PGA compression of preferably 90 points or 100 points. The intermediate layer  is preferably composed of substantially equal parts of the ionomer resins, SURLYN 8150 and SURLYN 9150, with a range of 40 to 60 parts of SURLYN 8150 to a range of 60 to 40 of SURLYN 9150. The ionomer blend of materials is preferably injection molded over the core to a thickness of between 0.040 inch to 0.080 inch, and most preferably 0.075 inch. The Shore D hardness of the materials of the intermediate layer  is preferably between 62 to 75 Shore D as measured according to ASTM D-2290, except the measurement is performed on the curved surface of the intermediate layer  by tearing off the cover  and using an Instron Shore D Hardness measurement device. The cover  is preferably composed of thermosetting polyurethane material, preferably formed from a tri-blend of polyurethane prepolymers and curing agents. The cover  is preferably cast over the intermediate layer  and core , in a casting process such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,395,218 for a System and Method for Forming a Thermoset Golf Ball Cover, filed on Feb. 01, 2000 and hereby incorporated by reference. The cover  preferably has a thickness of between 0.015 inch to 0.044 inch, and most preferably 0.020 inch. The Shore D hardness of the golf ball , as measured on the golf ball is between 55 Shore D points to 70 Shore D points, and most preferably 65 Shore D points. The hardness of the golf ball  is measured using an Instron Shore D Hardness measurement device wherein the golf ball  is placed within a holder and the pin is lowered to the surface to measure the hardness. The average of five measurements is used in calculating the ball hardness. The ball hardness is preferably measured on a land area of the cover .","The overall diameter of the golf ball is approximately 1.68 inches, and the weight is approximately 45.5 grams. Those skilled in the pertinent art will recognize that a golf ball  with a larger diameter such as 1.70 inches is within the scope and spirit of the present invention. The preferred golf ball  has a COR of approximately 0.8152 at 143 feet per second, and an initial velocity between 250 feet per second to 255 feet per second under USGA initial velocity conditions.","Several golf balls  of the present invention were tested for COR against golf balls currently on the market. The balls were kept in an incubator at a constant temperature of 23 degrees Celsius for at least three hours before they were tested for COR performance. To test the COR of a particular ball type, six balls were loaded into a COR machine and fired one at a time through a cannon via compressed air. The test begins by firing the first balls at approximately 80 feet per second, and ends with the last ball firing approximately 180 feet per second. Each of the six balls is fired eight times for a combined 48 shots over the range of speeds between 80-180 feet per second.","To determine the COR of a golf ball at any specific incoming velocity, a third-order polynomial curve is fit through the 48 data points and constrained at the origin. This polynomial fit is extremely accurate (with an R^2 fit value greater than 0.999) and allows the COR to be determined at an exact speed of 143 fps without actually having to achieve that specific cannon velocity. The COR is then obtained by plugging in 143 into the third-order polynomial equation and taking the ratio of outgoing velocity to incoming velocity to calculate the coefficient of restitution. For reference to the ADC COR machine see Automated Design Corporation web-site at www.automateddesign.com.","Table Two illustrates the results of COR testing of commercially available golf balls. The Callaway Golf RULE 35\u00ae golf balls (FIRMFEEL and SOFTFEEL), the Titleist PRO V1 392, Nike TOUR ACCURACY, Spalding STRATA TOUR PROFESSIONAL, and the Bridgestone BIIM, are all solid three-piece golf balls.

As shown in , the golf ball  has an innersphere  with an innersphere surface . The golf ball  also has an equator  dividing the golf ball into a first hemisphere  and a second hemisphere . A first pole  is located ninety degrees along a longitudinal arc from the equator  in the first hemisphere . A second pole  is located ninety degrees along a longitudinal arc from the equator  in the second hemisphere .","Descending toward the surface  of the innersphere  are a plurality of lattice members . In a preferred embodiment, the lattice members  are tubular, however, those skilled in the pertinent art will recognize that the lattice members  may have other similar shapes. The lattice members  are connected to each other to form a lattice structure  on the golf ball . The interconnected lattice members  form a plurality of polygons encompassing discrete areas of the surface  of the innersphere . Most of these discrete bounded areas  are hexagonal shaped bounded areas , with a few pentagonal shaped bounded areas , a few octagonal shaped bounded areas , and a few quadragonal shaped bounded areas . In the embodiment of , there are 380 polygons. In the preferred embodiment, each of the plurality of lattice members  are connected to at least another lattice member . Each of the lattice members  meets at least two other lattice members  at a vertex . Most of the vertices  are the congruence of three lattice members , however, some vertices are the congruence of four lattice members . These vertices are located at the equator  of the golf ball . The length of each of the lattice members  ranges from 0.005 inch to 0.01 inch, thereby defining an outersphere of at least 1.68 inches.","The preferred embodiment of the present invention has reduced the land to almost zero, since only a line of each of the plurality of lattice members  is in a spherical plane at 1.68 inches, the outersphere. More specifically, the land area of traditional golf balls is the area forming a sphere of at least 1.68 inches for USGA and R&A conforming golf balls. This land area is traditionally minimized with dimples that are concave into the surface of the sphere of the traditional golf ball, resulting in land area on the non-dimpled surface of the golf ball. However, the golf ball  of the present invention has only a line at an apex  of each of the lattice members  that defines the land area of the outersphere of the golf ball .","Traditional golf balls were designed to have the dimples \u201ctrip\u201d the boundary layer on the surface of a golf ball in flight to create a turbulent flow for greater lift and reduced drag. The golf ball  of the present invention has the lattice structure  to trip the boundary layer of air about the surface of the golf ball  in flight.","As shown in , a 1.68 inches outersphere, as shown by dashed line , encompasses the lattice members  and the innersphere . The volume of the lattice structure  as measured from the bottom of each lattice member  to the apex  is a minimal amount of the volume between 1.68 inches outersphere  and the innersphere . In the preferred embodiment, the apex  lies on the 1.68 inches outersphere . Thus, over 90 percent, and closer to 95 percent, of the entire volume of the golf ball  lies below the 1.68 inches outersphere .","As shown in , the distance h and h\u2032 of the lattice members  from the bottom of each lattice member  to an apex  will vary in order to have the golf ball  meet or exceed the 1.68 inches requirement. For example, if the diameter of the innersphere  is 1.666 inches, then the distance h of the lattice members  in  is 0.007 inch, since the lattice member  on one hemisphere  is combined with the corresponding lattice member  on the second hemisphere  to reach the 1.68 inches requirement. In a preferred embodiment, if lattice members  having a greater distance h\u2032 are desired, such as in , then the innersphere  has a lesser diameter. Thus, the diameter of the innersphere  in  is 1.662 inches, while the distance h\u2032 of the lattice members  is 0.009 inch, thereby resulting in an outersphere with a diameter of 1.68 inches. As shown in , the width of each of the apices  is minimal since the apex lies along an arc of a lattice member . In theory, the width of each apex  should approach the width of a line. In practice, the width of each apex  of each lattice member  is determined by the precision of the mold utilized to produce the golf ball . The precision of the mold is itself determined by the master used to form the mold. In practice, the width of each line ranges from 0.0001 inch to 0.001 inch.","Although in the cross-section of the lattice members  shown in  are circular, a preferred cross-section of each of the plurality of lattice members  is shown in . In such a preferred cross-section, the lattice member  has a contour  that has a first concave section , a convex section  and a second concave section . The radius Rof the convex portion  of each of the lattice members  is preferably in the range of 0.0275 inch to 0.0350 inch. The radius Rof the first and second concave portions  and  is preferably in the range of 0.150 inch to 0.200 inch, and most preferably 0.175 inch. Ris the radius of the innersphere, which is preferably 0.831 inch. Ris the radius of the outersphere, which is preferably 1.68 inches.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in , A, B and C. In this embodiment, the golf ball  has a parting line  that corresponds to the shape of a polygon defined by the plurality of lattice members  about the equator . Thus, if the polygons have a hexagonal shape, the parting line  will alternate along the lower half of one hexagon and the upper half of an adjacent hexagon.
