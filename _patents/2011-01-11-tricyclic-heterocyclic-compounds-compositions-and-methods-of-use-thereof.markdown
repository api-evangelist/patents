Janus kinases (JAK), including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2 are cytoplasmic protein kinases that associate with type I and type II cytokine receptors and regulate cytokine signal transduction. Cytokine engagement with cognate receptors triggers activation of receptor associated JAKs and this leads to JAK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins and ultimately transcriptional activation of specific gene sets (Schindler et al., 2007, J. Biol. Chem. 282: 20059-63). JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 exhibit broad patterns of gene expression, while JAK3 expression is limited to leukocytes. Cytokine receptors are typically functional as heterodimers, and as a result, more than one type of JAK kinase is usually associated with cytokine receptor complexes. The specific JAKs associated with different cytokine receptor complexes have been determined in many cases through genetic studies and corroborated by other experimental evidence.","JAK1 was initially identified in a screen for novel kinases (Wilks A. F., 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86:1603-1607). Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that JAK1 is functionally and physically associated with the type I interferon (e.g., IFNalpha), type II interferon (e.g., IFNgamma), IL-2 and IL-6 cytokine receptor complexes (Kisseleva et al., 2002, gene 285:1-24; Levy et al., 2005, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 3:651-662; O'Shea et al., 2002, Cell, 109 (suppl.): S121-S131). JAK1 knockout mice die perinatally due to defects in LIF receptor signaling (Kisseleva et al., 2002, gene 285:1-24; O'Shea et al., 2002, Cell, 109 (suppl.): S121-S131). Characterization of tissues derived from JAK1 knockout mice demonstrated critical roles for this kinase in the IFN, IL-10, IL-2\/IL-4, and IL-6 pathways. A humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 pathway (Tocilizumab) was recently approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (Scheinecker et al., 2009, Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 8:273-274).","Biochemical and genetic studies have shown an association between JAK2 and single-chain (e.g., EPO), IL-3 and interferon gamma cytokine receptor families (Kisseleva et al., 2002, gene 285:1-24; Levy et al., 2005, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 3:651-662; O'Shea et al., 2002, Cell, 109 (suppl.): S121-S131). Consistent with this, JAK2 knockout mice die of anemia (O'Shea et al., 2002, Cell, 109 (suppl.): S121-S131). Kinase activating mutations in JAK2 (e.g., JAK2 V617F) are associated with myeloproliferative disorders (MPDS) in humans.","JAK3 associates exclusively with the gamma common cytokine receptor chain, which is present in the IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 cytokine receptor complexes. JAK3 is critical for lymphoid cell development and proliferation and mutations in JAK3 result in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (O'Shea et al., 2002, Cell, 109 (suppl.): S121-S131). Based on its role in regulating lymphocytes, JAK3 and JAK3-mediated pathways have been targeted for immunosuppressive indications (e.g., transplantation rejection and rheumatoid arthritis) (Baslund et al., 2005, Arthritis & Rheumatism 52:2686-2692; Changelian et al., 2003, Science 302: 875-878).","TYK2 associates with the type I interferon (e.g., IFNalpha), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-23 cytokine receptor complexes (Kisseleva et al., 2002, gene 285:1-24; Watford, W. T. & O'Shea, J. J., 2006, Immunity 25:695-697). Consistent with this, primary cells derived from a TYK2 deficient human are defective in type I interferon, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-23 signaling. A fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the shared p40 subunit of the IL-12 and 11-23 cytokines (Ustekinumab) was recently approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (Krueger et al., 2007, N. Engl. J. Med. 356:580-92; Reich et al., 2009, Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 8:355-356). In addition, an antibody targeting the IL-12 and IL-23 pathways underwent clinical trials for treating Crohn's Disease (Mannon et al., 2004, N. Engl. J.

Stereoisomers include diastereomers, enantiomers, conformers and the like.","\u201cChiral\u201d refers to molecules which have the property of non-superimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term \u201cachiral\u201d refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.","\u201cDiastereomer\u201d refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties or biological activities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography such as HPLC.","\u201cEnantiomers\u201d refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another.","Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., -(1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and l or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \u201cracemic mixture\u201d and \u201cracemate\u201d refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.","The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.","A \u201csolvate\u201d refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of the present invention. Examples of solvents that form solvates include water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine. The term \u201chydrate\u201d refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water.","A \u201csubject,\u201d \u201cindividual,\u201d or \u201cpatient\u201d is a vertebrate. In certain embodiments, the vertebrate is a mammal. Mammals include, but are not limited to, farm animals (such as cows), sport animals, pets (such as cats, dogs, and horses), primates, mice and rats. In certain embodiments, a mammal is a human.","\u201cTherapeutically effective amount\u201d means an amount of a compound of the present invention that (i) treats or prevents the particular disease, condition or disorder, (ii) attenuates, ameliorates or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder, or (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition or disorder described herein. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and\/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and\/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and\/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can, for example, be measured by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and\/or determining the response rate (RR). In the case of immunological disorders, the therapeutic effective amount is an amount sufficient to decrease or alleviate an allergic disorder, the symptoms of an autoimmune and\/or inflammatory disease, or the symptoms of an acute inflammatory reaction (e.g. asthma). In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount is an amount of a chemical entity described herein sufficient to significantly decrease the activity or number of B-cells.","\u201cTreatment\u201d (and variations such as \u201ctreat\u201d or \u201ctreating\u201d) refers to clinical intervention in an attempt to alter the natural course of the individual or cell being treated, and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, preventing metastasis, decreasing the rate of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments, compounds of the invention are used to delay development of a disease or disorder or to slow the progression of a disease or disorder. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder, (for example, through a genetic mutation) or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.","The terms \u201ccompound(s) of this invention,\u201d and \u201ccompound(s) of the present invention\u201d, unless otherwise indicated, include compounds of formula I and stereoisomers, tautomers, solvates, metabolites, salts (e.g., pharmaceutically acceptable salts), and prodrugs thereof. Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds that differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds of formulas I, II and III, wherein one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by deuterium or tritium, or one or more carbon atoms are replaced by C- or C-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention.","Inhibitors of JAK1 Kinase","One aspect of the invention provides compounds of formula

Prodrugs may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula I with an activated group, such as acyl groups, to bond, for example, a nitrogen atom in the compound of formula I to the exemplary carbonyl of the activated acyl group. Examples of activated carbonyl compounds are those containing a leaving group bonded to the carbonyl group, and include, for example, acyl halides, acyl amines, acyl pyridinium salts, acyl alkoxides, acyl phenoxides such as p-nitrophenoxy acyl, dinitrophenoxy acyl, fluorophenoxy acyl, and difluorophenoxy acyl. The reactions are generally carried out in inert solvents at reduced temperatures such as \u221278 to about 50\u00b0 C. The reactions may also be carried out in the presence of an inorganic base, for example potassium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate, or an organic base such as an amine, including pyridine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, triethanolamine, or the like.","Synthesis of JAK1 Inhibitor Compounds","Compounds of formula I may be synthesized by synthetic routes described herein.

Alternatively, the transformation may be carried out by chemical reduction using for example a metal, e.g. tin or iron, in the presence of an acid such as hydrochloric acid.","In a further example, amine (\u2014CHNH) groups may be obtained by reduction of nitriles (\u2014CN), for example by catalytic hydrogenation using for example hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst, for example palladium on a support such as carbon, or Raney nickel, in a solvent such as an ether e.g. a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran, at an appropriate temperature, for example from about \u221278\u00b0 C. to the reflux temperature of the solvent.","In a further example, amine (\u2014NH) groups may be obtained from carboxylic acid groups (\u2014COH) by conversion to the corresponding acyl azide (\u2014CON), Curtius rearrangement and hydrolysis of the resultant isocyanate (\u2014N\u2550C\u2550O).","Aldehyde groups (\u2014CHO) may be converted to amine groups (\u2014CHNR\u2032R\u2033)) by reductive amination employing an amine and a borohydride, for example sodium triacetoxyborohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride, in a solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon, for example dichloromethane, or an alcohol such as methanol, where necessary in the presence of an acid such as acetic acid at around ambient temperature.","In a further example, aldehyde groups may be converted into alkenyl groups (\u2014CH\u2550CHR\u2032) by the use of a Wittig or Wadsworth-Emmons reaction using an appropriate phosphorane or phosphonate under standard conditions known to those skilled in the art.","Aldehyde groups may be obtained by reduction of ester groups (such as \u2014COEt) or nitriles (\u2014CN) using diisobutylaluminum hydride in a suitable solvent such as toluene. Alternatively, aldehyde groups may be obtained by the oxidation of alcohol groups using any suitable oxidising agent known to those skilled in the art.","Ester groups (\u2014COR\u2032) may be converted into the corresponding acid group (\u2014COH) by acid- or base-catalysed hydrolysis, depending on the nature of R. If R is t-butyl, acid-catalysed hydrolysis can be achieved for example by treatment with an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid in an aqueous solvent, or by treatment with an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid in an aqueous solvent.","Carboxylic acid groups (\u2014COH) may be converted into amides (CONHR\u2032 or \u2014CONR\u2032R\u2033) by reaction with an appropriate amine in the presence of a suitable coupling agent, such as HATU, in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane.","In a further example, carboxylic acids may be homologated by one carbon (i.e. \u2014COH to \u2014CHCOH) by conversion to the corresponding acid chloride (\u2014COCl) followed by Arndt-Eistert synthesis.","In a further example, \u2014OH groups may be generated from the corresponding ester (e.g. \u2014COR\u2032), or aldehyde (\u2014CHO) by reduction, using for example a complex metal hydride such as lithium aluminium hydride in diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, or sodium borohydride in a solvent such as methanol. Alternatively, an alcohol may be prepared by reduction of the corresponding acid (\u2014COH), using for example lithium aluminium hydride in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, or by using borane in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran.","Alcohol groups may be converted into leaving groups, such as halogen atoms or sulfonyloxy groups such as an alkylsulfonyloxy, e.g. trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy or arylsulfonyloxy, e.g. p-toluenesulfonyloxy group using conditions known to those skilled in the art. For example, an alcohol may be reacted with thionyl chloride in a halogenated hydrocarbon (e.g. dichloromethane) to yield the corresponding chloride. A base (e.g. triethylamine) may also be used in the reaction.","In another example, alcohol, phenol or amide groups may be alkylated by coupling a phenol or amide with an alcohol in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a phosphine, e.g. triphenylphosphine and an activator such as diethyl-, diisopropyl, or dimethylazodicarboxylate. Alternatively alkylation may be achieved by deprotonation using a suitable base e.g. sodium hydride followed by subsequent addition of an alkylating agent, such as an alkyl halide.","Aromatic halogen substituents in the compounds may be subjected to halogen-metal exchange by treatment with a base, for example a lithium base such as n-butyl or t-butyl lithium, optionally at a low temperature, e.g. around \u221278\u00b0 C., in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, and then quenched with an electrophile to introduce a desired substituent. Thus, for example, a formyl group may be introduced by using N,N-dimethylformamide as the electrophile. Aromatic halogen substituents may alternatively be subjected to metal (e.g. palladium or copper) catalysed reactions, to introduce, for example, acid, ester, cyano, amide, aryl, heteroaryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, thio- or amino substituents. Suitable procedures which may be employed include those described by Heck, Suzuki, Stille, Buchwald or Hartwig.","Aromatic halogen substituents may also undergo nucleophilic displacement following reaction with an appropriate nucleophile such as an amine or an alcohol. Advantageously, such a reaction may be carried out at elevated temperature in the presence of microwave irradiation.","Methods of Separation","In each of the exemplary Schemes it may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and\/or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and\/or purified (hereinafter separated) to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization or trituration from a solvent or solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including, for example: reverse-phase and normal phase; size exclusion; ion exchange; supercritical fluid; high, medium, and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus; small scale analytical; simulated moving bed (SMB) and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography.","Another class of separation methods involves treatment of a mixture with a reagent selected to bind to or render otherwise separable a desired product, unreacted starting material, reaction by product, or the like. Such reagents include adsorbents or absorbents such as activated carbon, molecular sieves, ion exchange media, or the like. Alternatively, the reagents can be acids in the case of a basic material, bases in the case of an acidic material, binding reagents such as antibodies, binding proteins, selective chelators such as crown ethers, liquid\/liquid ion extraction reagents (LIX), or the like.","Selection of appropriate methods of separation depends on the nature of the materials involved. Example separation methods include boiling point, and molecular weight in distillation and sublimation, presence or absence of polar functional groups in chromatography, stability of materials in acidic and basic media in multiphase extraction, and the like. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.","Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereoisomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereoisomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of the present invention may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column or supercritical fluid chromatography.","A single stereoisomer, e.g. an enantiomer, substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., , John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994; Lochmuller, C. H., 113(3):283-302 (1975)). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See: , Irving W. Wainer, Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1993).","Diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, \u03b1-methyl-\u03b2-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.","Alternatively, the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., , John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994, p. 322). Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester, e.g. (\u2212) menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base, or Mosher ester, \u03b1-methoxy-\u03b1-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob, 47:4165 (1982)), of the racemic mixture, and analyzing the NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (WO 96\/15111). By method (3), a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase (W. J. Lough, Ed., Chapman and Hall, New York, (1989); Okamoto, 513:375-378 (1990)). Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as optical rotation and circular dichroism. The absolute stereochemistry of chiral centers and enantiomers can be determined by x-ray crystallography.","Positional isomers, for example E and Z forms, of compounds of formula I, and intermediates for their synthesis, may be observed by characterization methods such as NMR and analytical HPLC. For certain compounds where the energy barrier for interconversion is sufficiently high, the E and Z isomers may be separated, for example by preparatory HPLC.","Pharmaceutical Compositions and Administration","Another embodiment provides pharmaceutical compositions or medicaments containing the compounds of the invention and a therapeutically inert carrier, diluent or excipient, as well as methods of using the compounds of the invention to prepare such compositions and medicaments. In one example, compounds of formula I may be formulated by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH, and at the desired degree of purity, with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed into a galenical administration form. The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound, but preferably ranges anywhere from about 3 to about 8. In one example, a compound of formula I is formulated in an acetate buffer, at pH 5. In another embodiment, the compounds of formula I are sterile. The compound may be stored, for example, as a solid or amorphous composition, as a lyophilized formulation or as an aqueous solution.","Compositions are formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice.

In another embodiment, oral unit dosage forms, such as tablets and capsules, contain from about 5 to about 100 mg of the compound of the invention.","The compounds of the invention may be administered by any suitable means, including oral, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal, transdermal, parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, intradermal, intrathecal, inhaled and epidural and intranasal, and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration.","The compounds of the present invention may be administered in any convenient administrative form, e.g., tablets, powders, capsules, solutions, dispersions, suspensions, syrups, sprays, vapors, suppositories, gels, emulsions, patches, etc. Such compositions may contain components conventional in pharmaceutical preparations, e.g., diluents, carriers, pH modifiers, sweeteners, bulking agents, and further active agents.","A typical formulation is prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention and a carrier or excipient.

The formulations may also include one or more buffers, stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents, diluents and other known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug (i.e., a compound of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof) or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product (i.e., medicament).","An example of a suitable oral dosage form is a tablet containing about 2 mg, 5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg, or 500 mg of the compound of the present invention compounded with about 95-30 mg anhydrous lactose, about 5-40 mg sodium croscarmellose, about 5-30 mg polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K30, and about e.g., 1-10 mg magnesium stearate. The powdered ingredients are first mixed together and then mixed with a solution of the PVP. The resulting composition can be dried, granulated, mixed with the magnesium stearate and compressed to tablet form using conventional equipment. An example of an aerosol formulation can be prepared by dissolving the compound of the present invention, for example 5-400 mg, in a suitable buffer solution, e.g. a phosphate buffer, adding a tonicifier, e.g. a salt such sodium chloride, if desired. The solution may be filtered, e.g. using a 0.2 micron filter, to remove impurities and contaminants.","An embodiment, therefore, includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I, stereoisomers, tautomers, solvates, metabolites, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof. In a further embodiment includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I, stereoisomers, tautomers, solvates, metabolites, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.","Another embodiment includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I stereoisomers, tautomers, solvates, metabolites, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof, for use in the treatment of a hyperproliferative disease.

The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with one or more additional drugs, for example an anti-hyperproliferative, anti-cancer, cytostatic, cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory or chemotherapeutic agent. The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the compound of this invention such that they do not adversely affect each other. Such agents are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

The phrase \u201cradiation therapy\u201d refers to the use of electromagnetic or particulate radiation in the treatment of neoplasia. Radiation therapy delivers doses of radiation sufficiently high to a target area to cause death of reproducing cells, in both tumor and normal tissues. The radiation dosage regimen is generally defined in terms of radiation absorbed dose (rad), time and fractionation, and must be carefully defined by the oncologist. The amount of radiation a patient receives will depend on various considerations but two of the most important considerations are the location of the tumor in relation to other critical structures or organs of the body, and the extent to which the tumor has spread. Examples of radiotherapeutic agents are provided in Hellman, Principles of Radiation Therapy, Cancer, in Principles I and Practice of Oncology, 24875 (Devita et al., 4th ed., vol 1, 1993). Alternative forms of radiation therapy include three-dimensional conformal external beam radiation, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), stereotactic radiosurgery and brachytherapy (interstitial radiation therapy), the latter placing the source of radiation directly into the tumor as implanted \u201cseeds\u201d. These alternative treatment modalities deliver greater doses of radiation to the tumor, which accounts for their increased effectiveness when compared to standard external beam radiation therapy.","Articles of Manufacture","Another embodiment includes a method of manufacturing a compound of formula I.
