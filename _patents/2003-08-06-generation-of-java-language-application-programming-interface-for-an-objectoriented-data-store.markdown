Field of the Invention","Embodiments of the invention relate to the field of management software, and more specifically, to project management.","2. Description of Related Art","Project management is becoming more and more complex. In enterprise applications, the sizes of projects are typically quite large, including complex databases and involving a large number of participants. The complex interactions among the various team members, process flows, tools, and databases have created difficulties to project managers. The project manager has to keep track of the progress of the project, communicate with stake holders, during the initiation, planning, executing, controlling, and closing phases of a project. Team members have to use the tools of the trade, exchange ideas, generate and review project documentations and\/or reports, update information, communicate with the project manager regarding progress of their work, etc.","Existing techniques for project management have a number of drawbacks. First, most traditional techniques are not convenient to users or team members because of lack of support and\/or interface to Web-based information sharing. Second, the project information may not be well structured or organized. Users do not have a common format or platform to organize data or information and trace sources of data and information. Third, workflow\/process automation is non-existent.","An application programming interface (API) for a database used for such a project management system may also present many difficulties. Java has become a popular programming language for enterprise business applications. However, not all API's are for clients written in Java. When the database or data store is designed with other languages such as object-oriented languages (e.g, C++), the interface between the clients and the data store may have problems. Two possible solutions include using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). However, these techniques are inefficient to open and close the repository on each call.","An embodiment of the present invention is a technique to interface to a repository. A connection between a client and a repository database is established. The repository database has a repository application programming interface (API). The repository database contains objects related to a project management process. The repository API is communicated with to perform an operation based on parameters passed from the client via the connection. A return value associated with the operation is returned to the client.","An embodiment of the present invention is a technique to interface to a repository.

It is a set of related links that can appear on a user's portal page and provides links to other components, such as project frame set page when used for portal maintenance, and new project web wizard for initial project configuration. The community sidebar page  provides links to the project module database, and to the project frame set page when used for on-going project management. The application server  is an enterprise software that provides application infrastructure for the overall project management system such as CBDD. It serves as an interface layer between the user interface and the system databases and\/or other server components.

The server  includes a web-based portal taxonomy , a process description file , a template importer , a universal repository (UREP) , a UREP database , a project file , a central project module , and a project database . The web-based portal taxonomy  provides tools to create or publish documents to any topic of the newly generated taxonomy. The taxonomy generation may include generation of elements for various phases in a project such as requirement phase, feasibility phase, design phase, development phase, integration and qualification phase, and support phase. The process description file  includes files that are created by user to describe elements of the project.

It allows common features of these types to be defined once. The Process  represents a complete or entire process used to run a project. Usually, a process is defined once and is used for many projects. The Project  models a real-world project that the team is working on. Person  represents a person, a team member, a user, a project member, or an entity who is assigned to carry out a project task. The Role  models similar jobs or roles performed by various project members. Examples of roles are programmer, technician, project manager, draftsman, etc. The Node  represents a phase, a category, or an activity of a project. The Task  represents the actual work items that project members carry out. Examples of tasks are installation of test routines, verification of algorithm correctness, optimization of codes, etc. Tasks typically belong to a particular phase represented by the Node . CheckList  provides for lists of items that are checked off as a project is completed. The CriteriaList  provides for lists of entry and exit criteria that are accomplished before a project transitions from one phase to another phase. The Item  provides a supertype for the CheckList Item  and the CriteriaList Item . It allows common features of these types to be defined once. The CheckList Item  represents the individual checklist items contained in a checklist. The CriteriaList Item  represents the individual criteria contained in a criteria list. The criteria may include entry and exit criteria.","The UREP supports multiple repository sessions, but all database calls in an application are made from the same thread. When there are many instances of the repository component, each representing a repository session, performing database calls in the same thread may degrade performance. The invention creates a separate process for each repository session, therefore, increasing performance. Each process is represented by a virtual machine. In addition, the invention uses Java RMI to access the object-oriented data store in the UREP database. Using the RMI allows the connection between the client and the server to remain open as long as the client needs it, as opposed to the stateless connections used by XML remote procedure call (RPC) and SOAP. Note that the technique in the present invention may be applied for any data-store or repository having any application, not just project management.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","410","420","430","445","440","450","460","455","465","470","480","490"]},"The application server (e.g., WebLogic)  includes a client , and repository components  and .

The parsing C++ files  are for parsing the input XML. An event handler class is used to get the parameter values from the input XML. The header files  are the header files for the C++ files.
