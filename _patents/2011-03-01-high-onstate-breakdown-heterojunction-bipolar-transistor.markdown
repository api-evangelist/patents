title: High on-state breakdown heterojunction bipolar transistor
abstract: A heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) is provided with an improved on-state breakdown voltage V. The improvement of the on-state breakdown voltage for the HBT improves the output power characteristics of the HBT and the ability of the HBT to withstand large impedance mismatch (large VSWR). The improvement in the on-state breakdown voltage is related to the suppression of high electric fields adjacent a junction of a collector layer and a sub-collector layer forming a collector region of the HBT.

The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates generally to semiconductor transistors. In particular, the invention relates to heterojunction bipolar transistors. Heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) offer a much higher speed of operation than the more prevalent metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) or even conventional homojunction bipolar transistors, e.g., pnp or npn silicon transistors. Because HBTs offer high speed, high current driving capability, and low 1\/f noise levels, HBTs are becoming popular for use as integrated switching devices and power amplifier devices in wireless communication systems and subsystems, satellite broadcast systems, automobile collision avoidance systems, global positioning systems, and other high frequency applications. One application in which HBT use continues to increase is in the design and manufacture of wireless electronic devices, such as wireless telephones and other like electronic devices that are capable of communicating with a network in a wireless manner.","As with all wireless electronic devices, the output power characteristics of a power amplifier along with the amplifier's ability to withstand large voltage swings is a concern to both the designer and consumer of the portable wireless device. For example, it is desirable to maximize output power and reliability of the wireless electronic device by providing the device with one or more HBT power amplifiers that maximize power performance and high frequency performance and thus, broad bandwidth operation capability. By providing the wireless electronic device with an HBT power amplifier having an improved on-state breakdown capability often results in a desirable increase in the reliability of the amplifier by improving the ability of the amplifier to withstand large voltage swings. As such, the use of an HBT power amplifier having an improved on-state breakdown capability improves output power characteristics and the ruggedness or the ability of the amplifier to withstand large voltage swings benefits a mobile telephone supporting a digital wireless telephone standard, such as the global system for mobile communication (GSM). Moreover, it is desirable to increase the reliability of an HBT power amplifier provided in a wireless electronic device by lowering the intensity of electric fields within a selected region of the HBT power amplifier.","The present invention addresses the above-described problems associated with electronic devices that transmit digital wireless communications.

The improvements provided in an HBT device are accomplished by suppression of high electric fields near the collector\/sub-collector junction when the HBT device is operating at high current densities and high voltage operations. By insertion of a high doping level layer near the collector\/sub-collector junction or by insertion of a large bandgap material the present invention suppresses the high electric fields near the collector\/sub-collector junction to result in an HBT device having an improved on-state breakdown voltage value.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a heterojunction bipolar transistor is disclosed having a collector region configured to reduce an electric field adjacent to two of the layers forming the region to improve a drain source on-state breakdown voltage.

Nonetheless, the teachings of the present invention, discloses an HBT structure suitable to provide a power amplifier capable of operating under conditions of VSWR>15 and a Vgreater than 5V.","The improved on-state breakdown voltage Vresults from the suppression or reduction of high electric fields near the collector\/sub-collector junction of the compound semiconductor device.

The introduction of collector layer having a high composition of AlGaAs adjacent a sub-collector layer reduces the electric field at the collector\/sub-collector heterojunction, and hence reduces or suppresses the electric field near this junction.","A reduction in the electric field at the junction of a sub-collector layer and a collector layer from between about 6\u00d710V\/cm and about 8\u00d710V\/cm to a reduced level of between about 2\u00d710V\/cm and about 3\u00d710V\/cm is realized and results in an improvement of an on-state breakdown voltage Vvalue of between about 8V and about 10V at a collector current density of between about 60 kA\/cmand about 80 kA\/cm. The high composition AlGaAs increases the bandgap of the collector region in the HBT  and as a consequence diminishes the saturation stored charged density of the device and speeds up device turnoff after the device is biased in the saturation region. As a result, the HBT  is able to realize an improvement in on-state breakdown voltage V, thus improved output power characteristics, and the ability to withstand large voltage swings to result in an improvement in device reliability and operational performance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1","FIGS. 1"],"b":["200","1","1","1","2","200","1","1","1","2"],"sub":"CE"},"The HBT  is formed on a substrate and includes a collector region, a base region, an emitter region, and a contact region.
