These devices include laptop computers, smart phones, TVs, and tablets and each device has its own interface, content metaphor, format, and access method. Users' experience with digital content over different devices is poor for two reasons: 1) the quality of the information delivery is varied and, 2) users are required to learn how to use each device in order to receive their desired information. This learning process is time consuming and does not guarantee the users' success.","In addition, although certain technologies, such as Internet browsers and multimedia players, provide some centralized manner of accessing digital information, such technologies are largely static. As a result, these technologies cannot be customized for individual user preferences.","For example, in the broadcast TV environment, users select and receive information using traditional channel guides. With this technology, user interaction and information customization is extremely limited. The ability to combine broadcast TV content with other forms of information, such as social media, is restricted.","In other information areas such as healthcare, finance, and home security, users want to do more than just access information: users want to combine and interrogate information to produce more meaningful interactions with information and other users.","Various embodiment of the present invention relate generally to monitoring secure sources of information to determine particular aspects, trends, and\/or values associated with the information, and providing one or more alerts in connection with same.","In exemplary embodiments discussed in greater detail below, display of and access to secure user-centric information is provided via the construct of a channel grid framework serving as a desktop on one or more user devices. Multiple authorized channels represented in the channel grid framework, and through which the user receives and\/or interacts with respective portions of the secure user-centric information, are implemented based on information access rights and\/or security protocols respectively associated with the channels.","In one aspect, channel information is monitored to determine one or more events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data, based on one or more threshold conditions or parameters relating to the channel information. For example, monitored channel information may be compared to one or more threshold conditions or parameters, and various criteria for such comparisons may be predetermined\/established (e.g., less than, greater than, equal to, within a certain range, corresponding to a certain pattern or trend, particular time-varying behavior, etc.). In another aspect, if an established condition is met (e.g., the comparison meets one or more criteria, such as exceeding a quantified numerical limit, and\/or multiple similar events trending in a certain direction), a \u201ctrigger\u201d is established upon which one or more alerts may be generated. For purposes of the present disclosure, any information associated with establishing a trigger upon which one or more alerts may be generated is referred to as \u201ctrigger information.\u201d Examples of trigger information may include, but are not limited to, one or more values or other information content associated with monitored channel information that resulted in a trigger (e.g., one or more events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data), one or more date stamps and\/or time stamps associated with values\/information content that resulted in a trigger, identities of one or more content sources providing at least some of the channel information being monitored and resulting in a trigger, and the criterion\/criteria used to establish the trigger.","In other aspects, actionable and\/or non-actionable alerts may be generated (e.g., in response to one or more triggers) on one or more authenticated user devices and\/or other devices. Information relating to determination of one or more events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data (e.g., trigger information) may be transmitted to various devices and\/or stored for archival purposes.","In sum, one embodiment of the present invention is directed to an apparatus to provide secure user-centric information on at least one user platform operated by a user, and to evaluate at least some of the secure user-centric information. The apparatus comprises: at least one communication interface to facilitate wired and\/or wireless communications with the at least one user platform via one or more transmission media; at least one memory to store processor-executable instructions; and at least one processor communicatively coupled to the at least one communication interface and the at least one memory. Upon execution of the processor-executable instructions by the at least one processor, the at least one processor provides and evaluates at least some of the secure user-centric information by: A) implementing, at least in part, a plurality of authorized channels through which the user receives and\/or interacts with, via the at least one user platform, respective portions of the secure user-centric information based at least in part on information access rights and\/or security protocols respectively associated with the plurality of authorized channels, the plurality of authorized channels including at least a first channel through which the user receives and\/or interacts with first channel information constituting a first portion of the secure user-centric information; B) monitoring at least the first channel information so as to determine one or more events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data, based on at least one threshold condition or parameter relating to the first channel information; and if the one or more events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data is\/are determined in B): C) controlling the at least one communication interface to transmit at least one alert to, or transmit data so as to generate at least one alert on, at least one external device; and\/or D) controlling the at least one memory so as to store trigger information relating to the one or more determined events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data.","Another embodiment is directed to a computer-implemented method for evaluating secure user-centric information to be provided on at least one user platform operated by a user. The method comprises: A) electronically implementing, at least in part, a plurality of authorized channels through which the user receives and\/or interacts with, via the at least one user platform, respective portions of the secure user-centric information based at least in part on information access rights and\/or security protocols respectively associated with the plurality of authorized channels, the plurality of authorized channels including at least a first channel through which the user receives and\/or interacts with first channel information constituting a first portion of the secure user-centric information; B) electronically monitoring at least the first channel information so as to determine one or more events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data, based on at least one threshold condition or parameter relating to the first channel information; and if the one or more events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data is\/are determined in B): C) electronically transmitting at least one alert to, or transmitting data so as to generate at least one alert on, at least one external device; and\/or D) electronically storing event information relating to the one or more determined events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data.","Another embodiment is directed to at least one non-transitory computer readable storage medium encoded with processor-executable instructions that, when executed by at least one processor, perform a method for evaluating secure user-centric information to be provided on at least one user platform operated by a user. The method comprises: A) implementing, at least in part, a plurality of authorized channels through which the user receives and\/or interacts with, via the at least one user platform, respective portions of the secure user-centric information based at least in part on information access rights and\/or security protocols respectively associated with the plurality of authorized channels, the plurality of authorized channels including at least a first channel through which the user receives and\/or interacts with first channel information constituting a first portion of the secure user-centric information; B) monitoring at least the first channel information so as to determine one or more events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data, based on at least one threshold condition or parameter relating to the first channel information; and if the one or more events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data is\/are determined in B): C) transmitting at least one alert to, or transmitting data so as to generate at least one alert on, at least one external device; and\/or D) storing event information relating to the one or more determined events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data.","It should be appreciated that all combinations of the foregoing concepts and additional concepts discussed in greater detail below (provided such concepts are not mutually inconsistent) are contemplated as being part of the inventive subject matter disclosed herein. In particular, all combinations of claimed subject matter appearing at the end of this disclosure are contemplated as being part of the inventive subject matter disclosed herein. It should also be appreciated that terminology explicitly employed herein that also may appear in any disclosure incorporated by reference should be accorded a meaning most consistent with the particular concepts disclosed herein.","Following below are more detailed descriptions of various concepts related to, and embodiments of, inventive methods, apparatus and systems for providing and monitoring secure information via multiple authorized channels and generating alerts relating to same. It should be appreciated that various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways, as the disclosed concepts are not limited to any particular manner of implementation. Examples of specific implementations and applications are provided primarily for illustrative purposes.","Various embodiments of the present invention describe an information delivery system for, and methods of, eventing and alerting using multiple information forms and sources across multiple types and\/or brands of electronic devices, such as televisions, mobile devices, and computing devices.","The information delivery system for and methods of the invention provide the display of and access to secure user-centric information via the construct of a channel grid framework serving as a desktop on a user device. The channel grid framework includes multiple user-selectable items that provide access to corresponding \u201cchannels\u201d by which respective portions of user-centric information are delivered to a user. The user and the user device are first authenticated to receive the secure user-centric information, and the user-selectable items included in the channel grid framework on the desktop for the user device are based on information access rights and security protocols defined for the corresponding channels, the user, and the user device.","An aspect of the information delivery system and methods of the invention is the server-side capability to monitor\/interrogate channel information of one or more channels to detect events and generate alerts. In one embodiment, a secure user-centric information provider implements multiple \u201cchannels\u201d through which a user receives and\/or interacts with respective portions of user-centric information, via one or more user platforms, based on information access rights\/security protocols associated with the channels. Channel information in one or more channels is monitored at the server and\/or client to determine one or more events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data, based on at least one threshold condition or parameter. For example, monitored channel information may be compared to one or more threshold conditions or parameters, and various criteria for such comparisons may be predetermined\/established (e.g., less than, greater than, equal to, within a certain range, corresponding to a certain pattern or trend, particular time-varying behavior, etc.).","In one aspect of this embodiment, if an established condition is met (e.g., the comparison meets one or more criteria, such as exceeding a quantified numerical limit, and\/or multiple similar events trending in a certain direction), a \u201ctrigger\u201d is established upon which one or more alerts may be generated. For purposes of the present disclosure, any information associated with establishing a trigger upon which one or more alerts may be generated is referred to as \u201ctrigger information.\u201d Examples of trigger information may include, but are not limited to, one or more values or other information content associated with monitored channel information that resulted in a trigger (e.g., one or more events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data), one or more date stamps and\/or time stamps associated with values\/information content that resulted in a trigger, identities of one or more content sources providing at least some of the channel information being monitored and resulting in a trigger, and the criterion\/criteria used to establish the trigger. In one example, discrete information values or signal data may be based on time of day.","In other aspects, actionable and\/or non-actionable alerts may be generated (e.g., in response to one or more triggers) on one or more authenticated user devices and\/or other devices. Information relating to determination of one or more events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data (e.g., trigger information) may be transmitted to various devices and\/or stored for archival purposes.","Another aspect of the information delivery system and methods of the invention is that is may provide two types of eventing and alerting (1) actionable alerts and (2) non-actionable alerts. With respect to actionable alerts, the user may be alerted to a condition that is important to them. Upon the presence of the alert condition, the user may be presented a means by which to take action on the alert. With respect to non-actionable alerts, the user may be alerted to a condition that is important to them and then may choose or not choose to take action. For example, a non-actionable alert may simply be an informational alert that does not require user action.","Yet another aspect of the information delivery system and methods of the invention is that configuration, user preferences, and session information may be used to determine automatically the optimal method of delivering alert notifications to users. Additionally, if the best method of delivering the alert is unsuccessful and\/or not available, the next best delivery method is attempted.","Still another aspect of the information delivery system and methods of the invention is that data from one or more disparate data sources may be collected and analyzed with respect to performing eventing and alerting operations. Additionally, eventing and alerting processes of the invention may be based on (1) the direct query of any external system and\/or service, and\/or (2) monitoring data (e.g., machine and\/or sensor data) that is collected and stored locally at the server.","Referring to , a high level block diagram of an example of an information delivery system  that includes a personal information delivery (PID) application  for eventing and alerting using multiple information forms and sources across multiple types and\/or brands of electronic devices is presented. Information delivery system  may include an application server  upon which is installed the PID application  that has access to one or more information sources . One or more users  are associated with information delivery system . Users  may be, for example, individuals or groups of individuals. Each user  may have one or more user devices . Application server , the one or more information sources , and user devices  may be connected to a network  by any wired and\/or wireless means. Network  may be, for example, any local area network (LAN) and\/or wide area network (WAN) for connecting to the Internet.","Application server  may be a networked computer, such as the networked server of the owner and\/or provider of PID application . The one or more information sources  may be, for example, networked computers of the owners and\/or providers of the information stored thereon. For example, certain information  may be stored on information sources . Information  may be any information that can be delivered electronically over network  and that is capable of being consumed by users  via their user devices . More particularly, information  of the one or more information sources  may include different types and\/or forms of information, data, and\/or content. Examples of information  may include, but are not limited to, text, graphics, pictures, 3D graphic visualization of objects, sound, sensor data, streaming media data (e.g., streaming video and audio data), web-services data, Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds, image data, eventing and alerting, raw data, any type of information, and the like.","Information  of information sources  may be any information that resides outside of the environment of application server . However, with regard to information to be consumed by users  via their user devices , the invention is not limited to \u201cexternal\u201d information sources, such as information sources . Users  may also consume information from \u201cinternal\u201d information sources (not shown), which are any information sources that reside directly at application server  and\/or directly at user devices and\/or from sensors contained on or communicating with user devices .","PID application  is a software application that facilitates user interaction with multiple information forms across multiple types and\/or brands of electronic devices (e.g., user devices ). Generally, PID application  is operating under a client-server model of computing in which application server  is the server and each user device  is the client.","Preferably, user devices  have a runtime environment that includes, but is not limited to, the following attributes: 1) capability to access multiple different operating systems; 2) capability to access any information that is exposed at the device level; 3) capability to allow software and\/or information updates without interrupting the device and\/or service (i.e., \u201chot\u201d updates); 4) capability to operate offline; 5) capability to maintain state information, and 6) any combinations of the foregoing.","An example of such a runtime environment is the Adobe\u00ae AIR\u00ae 2.5 runtime (available from Adobe Systems Inc, San Jose, Calif.) and the HTML5 runtime. HTML5 is the next major revision of the HTML standard, which is currently under development.","For the purpose of illustration, the present invention is described hereafter with respect to user devices  (i.e., client devices) that are Adobe Air-enabled. Therefore, examples of user devices  may include, but are not limited to, any type and\/or brand of Adobe Air-enabled desktop computer, Adobe Air-enabled laptop computer; Adobe Air-enabled tablet computer; Adobe Air-enabled net-book computing device; Adobe Air-enabled handheld computing device; Adobe Air-enabled personal digital assistant, Adobe Air-enabled enterprise digital assistant, or Adobe Air-enabled portable digital assistant; Adobe Air-enabled telecommunications device including one of an Adobe Air-enabled telephone, Adobe Air-enabled cell phone, and Adobe Air-enabled smart phone; Adobe Air-enabled personal navigation device; Adobe Air-enabled vehicle-based device; Adobe Air-enabled optical disk player; Adobe Air-enabled television; Adobe Air-enabled game console; and the like.","Therefore, an aspect of information delivery system  of the invention is that its operation is not limited to any particular type and\/or brand of client device and\/or to any particular operating system (OS). That is, the operation of information delivery system  of the invention is substantially device-agnostic and\/or OS-agnostic because it may operate, for example, on substantially any Air-enabled client device. Additionally, information delivery system  of the invention is substantially information type-agnostic and\/or information source-agnostic.","User devices  serve as a user platform operated by a user  to facilitate display of, and interaction with, secure user-centric information. Preferably, the set of user devices  belonging to each respective user  is connected in a peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion. In one example, the user devices  of a certain user  may include a mobile phone, a tablet, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, and a television. In this example, the user's mobile phone, tablet, laptop computer, desktop computer, and television are connected (wired and\/or wirelessly) in a P2P fashion.","PID application  of the invention provides a personalized information delivery utility that includes one or more sets of processor-executable instructions executing on one or more processors controlling various other hardware devices, with client-server system architecture, to facilitate delivery of a wide variety of information to a user, via one or more user devices or \u201cplatforms\u201d (clients). Information is displayed on a graphical user interface (GUI) of a given user platform in a \u201cpresentation framework\u201d that is customized based on a \u201cuser context.\u201d The presentation framework is homogenous amongst different user platforms so as to facilitate user familiarity and ease of interaction with displayed information. The presentation framework also facilitates the user's ability to take meaningful \u201creal-time\u201d action(s) in response to the displayed information.","The \u201cuser context\u201d may be with respect to user attributes, such as, but not limited to, identity of the user, an identifier for one or more user devices associated with the user, location, activity, role, event, and any combinations thereof. Further, the \u201cuser context\u201d may be with respect to user preferences, such as, but not limited to, source(s) of information of interest to the user, category\/type of information of interest to the user, priority and\/or importance of information, time (of day, week, month, year) at which information is displayed, and any combinations thereof.","The mechanism of PID application  for providing the user access to and interaction with, for example, information  and\/or any other information is referred to as a \u201cchannel.\u201d That is, the channel is a conduit for delivering information to a user (e.g., providing access to and interaction with information), and is an elemental feature (basic building-block) of PID application . With respect to the PID application , the channel two pieces (1) a visualization piece that is presented on the client device (e.g., user devices ) and (2) the integration piece residing at the server (e.g., application server ). More details of the channel with respect to PID application  are described with reference to .","Referring to , a functional block diagram of an example of a channel  of PID application  for providing users access to and interaction with information and for performing eventing and alerting operations is presented. PID application  may provide at least one channel . Preferably, PID application  provides one or more function-specific channels . There may be a server portion of channel  that is resident at application server  and a client portion of channel  that is resident at each user device . The client side portion of channel  is for presenting and interacting with content. There is a server side portion of channel  provides services and that are always running. More details of the client architecture and server architecture underlying the client and server portions of any channel  are described with reference to .","Any channel  of PID application  provides a gateway to content, such as information  of information sources . Additionally, each channel  has a built in eventing and alerting feature, which will be described in subsequent text. Each channel  may include a visual component  that is formed of a touchlet  and a channel application . Additionally, channel  may include one or more service components  and a configuration component .","Visual component  may be any text and\/or graphic element that may be presented to users  for viewing on the display, screen, and\/or GUI of any user device . With respect to a certain function-specific channel , the design and implementation of visual component  may be channel-specific. That is, visual component  may be used to visually render at least some of the function-specific information on a GUI of a user device  via one or more text and\/or graphic elements, and provide for interaction with the displayed channel information. The invention is not limited to presenting information to users  in a visual fashion only. Other ways (not shown) of conveying information to users  may be, for example, audible indicators (i.e., sound) and\/or tactile indicators (e.g., vibration).","Channel application  may be any application software that is designed to perform singular and\/or multiple related specific tasks and\/or functions of a certain channel . Channel application  is used to manage the visual rendering of at least some of the channel-specific information on a GUI of a user device . Channel application  is also designed and used to manage user interaction with the displayed channel information.","Some channel applications  support implementation of the channel in a \u201cfull screen mode\u201d on the GUI of a user device  once the channel  is deployed on the platform of PID application  and a channel  is invoked by a user (i.e., selected by the user to operate in substantially full-screen mode). A user invokes a certain channel  via its respective touchlet . Touchlet  includes a graphic element associated with its channel  that appears on a portion of the GUI of a user device , as part of the presentation framework, to provide a gateway\/portal to its channel . A touchlet  has multiple behaviors as described with reference to . One example of a function-specific channel  and the associated touchlets  is described with reference to .","The one or more service components  of a channel  are used to access information from outside the environment of PID application . For example, service components  are used to retrieve the information  from the authorized information source(s)  and securely provide the retrieved information  to any visual components  of a channel  for display to user. Additionally, service components  may be used to monitor\/process the channel information (e.g., via event processing and\/or complex event processing (CEP)) to derive \u201csecondary\u201d information (e.g., events\u2014particular changes in state or content of channel information), and provide secondary information to any visual components  for conveying to the user (e.g., alerts).","Every channel  has at least one service that is invokes via service components . For example, one service is an identity service. The identity service may be used for (1) authenticating and authorizing users  to use a channel  and (2) authenticating channels  to invoke one or more services (at the server) in order to access content from, for example, authorized information source(s) . Every service has identity. The authorization and authentication is by channel, in this way authorization and authentication does not have to occur for each information request.","Configuration component  of any channel  includes information that defines the behaviors and \u201cpersonality\u201d of the channel . Configuration component  also includes user preferences. Further, the information in configuration component  defines the services being used, the data being used, alerts, user preferences for the content and alerts, state information, synchronization information, versioning information, and the like.","There are additional authorization aspects of each channel . For example, user authorization may be based on user identity, user role, user device, user\/device location, time, date, day of week, and the like. For example, a certain user  is authorized to access certain content at his\/her workplace location between 8 am and 8 pm, and only with his\/her laptop computer that has a certain MAC address. At application server , configuration queries the identity subsystem (shown in ) to understand any user permissions. The user may be generally authorized to use a channel , but there may be conditions.","Because there is two pieces to each channel , the client side visualization piece and the server side integration piece, an aspect of the invention is that there is operational persistence at the server. Client devices may be shut down, but the channels are still operating on the server and services are still being run. As client devices become available, content will begin to stream.","A \u201cpresentation framework\u201d is the manner in which information (generally multiple types or classes of information) is visually rendered (displayed to a user via a GUI of a user device ) by PID application . The presentation framework is customized at least in part based on a user context (e.g., user attributes and\/or preferences) and the presentation framework may sometimes purposefully constrain the scope and\/or type of the information displayed on a GUI of a user device at any given time. The presentation framework thereby allows a user to interact with more limited information that may be particularly important to them in a given user context. This purposeful limitation on displayed information facilitates the user's ability to meaningfully absorb and respond to the information (e.g., take real-time action and\/or make decisions in response to the displayed information).","PID application  provides a presentation framework that is homogenous amongst different user platforms so as to facilitate user familiarity and ease of interaction with available information; i.e., the presentation framework \u201cfollows a user around\u201d from user device  to user device  and appears the same or substantially the same to the user on any GUI of any user device  on which the \u201cclient portion\u201d of PID application  is installed.","A presentation framework includes one or more user-selectable items, or \u201ctouchlets\u201d that are selectable by a user (e.g., via touch-screen and\/or point and click, sound recognition, movement recognition or image recognition user interfaces) so as to invoke a \u201cchannel,\u201d through which one or more particular types of information are displayed to the user on the GUI of the user platform in a substantially full-screen mode. More details of one example of a presentation framework of PID application  are described with reference to .","Referring to , a screenshot of an example of a client GUI  is presented that shows an example of a channel grid, which is one example of a presentation framework of PID application . Client GUI  may include, for example, a main viewing panel . Additionally, a taskbar  may be provided along the top of main viewing panel  and a navigation bar  may be provided along the bottom of main viewing panel .","Taskbar  may include, for example, standard calendar, time, window controls, and the like. Navigation bar  may include, for example, icons for launching other applications, icons of other user devices , and the like. For example, navigation bar  may include a developer icon , a catalog icon , and certain device icons . The developer icon  may be used to launch a \u201cdeveloper environment\u201d that may be built into the framework of PID application . The catalog icon  may be used to launch an \u201capplication store\u201d by which users  may acquire (e.g., purchase) and then install and synchronize specific channels . Device icons  may depict any types of user devices  in the user's P2P network, such as a mobile phone, a tablet device, any computing device, a television, and the like.","Client GUI  shows an example of a presentation framework that is organized into a grid for presenting channels  to a user  on any user device . In this example, multiple touchlets  are presented in a 3\u00d74 channel grid  in the main viewing panel  of client GUI . For example, 3\u00d74 channel grid  includes touchlets A through L. Each touchlet  in the 3\u00d74 channel grid  of client GUI  represents a channel  of a specific purpose and\/or function. User  may have multiple channel grids of information, which are accessible via the navigation bar . For example, navigation bar  may include certain channel grid icons , which are icons of other channel grids of the user. In one example, channel grid icons  may include an \u201cAt Home\u201d channel grid icon, a \u201cMy TV\u201d channel grid icon, and an \u201cAt Work\u201d channel grid icon. A user  may specify a certain default channel grid in his\/her profile. Additionally, as defined in the user's profile, the default channel grid may change based upon, for example, device type, time, location, prior activities, and the like. Further, user  may be presented an option of several different channel girds from which to select. In one example, the channel grid  shown in main viewing panel  of client GUI  of  may be the user's \u201cAt Home\u201d channel grid.","Presentation of channel grids may change based upon user context or preferences. Generally, PID application  is capable to combine, screen, and\/or synthesize information in any way to present information in an intelligent manner to the user. The invention is not limited to presenting content in a 3\u00d74 or any other n\u00d7n channel grid. Other presentation styles are possible. For example, the touchlets of channels may be presented in a tiled fashion on a 3D cube, a tiled fashion on a 3D globe, a stacked tiled fashion, and the like.","A touchlet  of channel  of , such as touchlets A through L of , has multiple behaviors\u2014(1) a touchlet  may serve as an icon to launch its associated channel application  to full screen mode, (2) a touchlet  may receive dynamically streaming data, such as audio and video data, sensor data, any web-services data, RSS feeds, eventing and alerting, raw data, any type of information, and the like. Data may be pushed to the channel  and its touchlet  in near real time, and (3) a touchlet  may serve as a viewer for presenting information dynamically in near real time.","Additionally, a touchlet  may include substantially all the functionality of a full channel application. The \u201ctouchlet information\u201d typically is related to or derived from the channel information provided by the corresponding channel associated with the touchlet, so that when visually rendered, the touchlet information provides a more limited but nonetheless intuitive representation of the channel information. Therefore, an aspect of the invention is that the construct of a channel  includes two levels of presentation (1) information that is streaming and\/or displayed at the touchlet level and (2) information that is streaming and\/or displayed at the full screen level that is launched via the touchlet.","Unlike standard icons and windows that are static and have little or no built-in intelligence, touchlets  have both static and dynamic behaviors, as well as intelligence. For example, touchlets  can provide information in context (e.g., context based on certain relationships between different data sources, time of day, day of week, geographic location, devices, users, user's role, and the like). Therefore, an aspect of the invention is that touchlets may be designed to present only information that is most interesting and\/or meaningful to the user, and with context. Another aspect of the invention is that touchlets provide mechanisms for taking action and\/or making decisions on that information.","An aspect of the invention is that multiple touchlets in a channel grid may be displaying near real-time dynamic content to the user simultaneously. For example, the twelve touchlets  in 3\u00d74 channel grid  of client GUI  may be displaying near real-time dynamic content simultaneously (e.g., 12 streaming videos) to the user . Again, the content presented in each touchlet is designed to present only what is important to the user without saturating the user with content he\/she does not want or need.","Another purpose and\/or function of a touchlet , such as touchlets A through L of , is that a touchlet  is capable of visually presenting static and\/or dynamic content to a user  in a small window, until such time that the user  launches the associated channel application  in full-screen mode. For example, in near real time, application server  is pushing dynamic information from any sources to one or more touchlets  in near real time.","Referring to , a functional block diagram of an example of a PID application architecture  that is suitable for performing eventing and alerting operations is presented. PID application architecture  is the application architecture of the server side of PID application . That is, PID application architecture  is the application architecture of application server . PID application architecture  may include a facilitation layer  through which all messaging of user devices  (the clients) pass, an integration and process layer , and an integrated services and applications layer .","Facilitation layer  further includes a facilitation server  and certain other servers . Generally, facilitation server  manages the communication between the client (e.g., user devices ) and the server (e.g., application server ). Facilitation server  serves as the gate keeper. In a sense, facilitation server  introduces the client to the integration and process server  and then goes away. Facilitation server  serves as the client representative to the rest of the server stack. In one example, facilitation server  is implemented using a Java server component that provides a set of real-time data management and messaging capabilities. One example of this Java server component may be Adobe\u00ae LiveCycle\u00ae Data Services.","Facilitation server  of the facilitation layer  may include, for example, a client gateway , proxy services , invocation services , inter-client messaging\/synchronization , and a facilitation processor .","Client gateway  may be the direct interface with the client (e.g., user devices ) for handling messaging operations. In one example, client gateway  uses Action Message Format (AMF) and\/or Java Message Service (JMS) for exchanging messages and\/or data between the client and server and\/or between one client and another client.","Servers  of the facilitation layer  may include, for example, a channel server , a content delivery server , a collaboration media server  (e.g., video conferencing server), a stream sync server , an analytics server , an advertising server , a transcoding server , and a media server .","Generally, channel server  is used for the creation and consumption of channels . Channel server  is not utilized in the operation of channels . For example, channel server  may include a repository of channels , a channel application catalog , and a developer module . Channel application catalog  may be an \u201capplication store\u201d of available channels  from which users  may acquire (e.g., purchase), download, and install and synchronize specific channels .","Developer module  may be the \u201cdeveloper environment\u201d that may be built into the framework of PID application . For example, developer module  may be used by software developers to design specific channels . In one example, the developer icon  of client GUI  of  may be used to launch the developer module .","Content delivery server  may be a server for storing and\/or managing any other content that is not managed by, for example, collaboration media server , advertising server , and media server . Collaboration media server  is used to facilitate video conferencing. Stream sync server  is the server that integrates with advertising and analytics as it relates to the client and content that is being presented. An example of using stream sync server  is synchronizing and\/or relating ads on one user device  (e.g., TV) with ads on another user device  (e.g., tablet). Analytics server  is used to configure and administer analytics applications. Advertising server  may be a dedicated server for storing and\/or managing advertising content. Media server  may be a dedicated server for storing and\/or managing various digital media, such as digital videos\/movies, audio\/music, and picture files.","Transcoding server  may be a dedicated server for performing transcoding operations. Transcoding is the ability to adapt digital files so that content can be viewed on different playback devices. Working like an interpreter, a transcoder translates files to a suitable format for the end user. Transcoding servers (e.g., transcoding server ) and services reformat material that would otherwise have to be developed separately for different platforms. Transcoding servers and services are commonly used for adapting content for mobile devices or serving video.","Integration and process layer  may be organized in a standard service-oriented architecture (SOA). Integration and process layer  further includes an integration and process server  along with certain hosting applications , hosted communications applications , and integral identity provider SSO provider . Integration and process server  of integration and process layer  further includes certain platform service components  and certain server channel components .","Platform service components  may include, but are not limited to, a data management subsystem , an eventing and alerting subsystem , a configuration server , a session manager , an administration subsystem , and an identity subsystem .","Data management subsystem  performs the master data management operations of PID application architecture . Master data management may include, for example, correlating user ID (which user are you?) to content and\/or correlating user devices (user has 4 phones, which phone are you?) to content. Associated with data management subsystem  may be an operational data store (ODS) (not shown) and\/or a data warehouse (not shown) for storing temporary data or long term data. The ODS may serve two purposes (1) the ODS is used to store data for historical purposes, because data may not persist or be stored at the source. For example, a channel  may poll a service every few minutes and store the data in the ODS; and (2) the ODS is used in general application usage. For example, there is a background process of any channel  of PID application  that is retrieving data and pushing it to the ODS. Therefore, any data that is presented to the user at the user device  (i.e., at the client device) may be supplied by the ODS. This ensures good response time for the end-user because the network will not have to be continually interrogated for information.","Eventing and alerting subsystem  is used to collect and\/or analyze information from any one or more disparate data sources with respect to certain predetermined or dynamic event conditions. Example of types of information that may be evaluated\/monitored by eventing and alerting subsystem  may include, but are not limited to, text information, graphic information, one or more pictures, one or more videos, audio or digital sound, streaming data, audio or video, content associated with an executing computer application, voice-over-IP communication, instant messaging\/SMS information, video-conferencing information, environmental monitoring information, financial services information, enterprise resource planning information, enterprise content management information, building information, project management information, product lifecycle management information, RSS reader information, remote device control\/interaction information, a three-dimensional graphic visualization of one or more objects and\/or immersive environments, one or more word processing documents, one or more spreadsheets, one or more presentation\/slide shows, email, address book information, and any combinations thereof. CEP systems may also be utilized to evaluate\/monitor event conditions.","Upon detecting the presence of an event condition, eventing and alerting subsystem  transmits alert notifications to users  via one or more user devices . Eventing and alerting subsystem  may include, for example, an event manager component, a notification manager, and a complex event processor. Further, events maybe stored for delivery at a later time or for use in a CEP system.","Once an event is registered in the event manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem , the event manager uses CEP (e.g., via complex query language (CQL) programming) to continually monitor the ODS of data management subsystem  based on event(s) that have been set and\/or to perform a direct query of any external system and\/or service.","Once the event manager recognizes that a certain event condition is present, the notification manager checks the user's configuration, which is at configuration server , as well as the user's session information at session manager  in order to determine how best to notify the end-user. Then, the alert notification is pushed through the client gateway  of the facilitation server  (e.g., via AMF) and to one or user devices  (client devices). As a result, the one or user devices  receive the alert notification and the alert presented to the user  via one or user devices .","Example of types of alerts that may be generated by eventing and alerting subsystem  may include, but are not limited to, visual alerts, auditory alerts, tactile alerts, email messages, SMS text messages, activation of at least one channel of a plurality of channels, and notifications to a law enforcement agency.","A main aspect of a channel  is that eventing and alerting subsystem  provides actionable eventing and alerting capability to the user . That is, channels  of PID application  provide users the ability to take action upon receiving an alert, in which the mechanism for user response to an alert may be conveniently built into the channel itself.","Configuration server  manages device configurations, user profiles, data configurations, application configurations, and the like. Configuration server  is the counterpart to configuration component  of any channel .","Session manager  performs session management and\/or handles state. Session manager  may include, for example, a session module and a policy module. In one example of managing state, a user  is watching TV (one user device ) and decides to pause the TV show and resume watching the TV show on his\/her laptop computer (another user device ). Session manager  stores state information and communicates this state information between user devices  so that the user  can resume watching the TV show at his\/her laptop computer from the same point in the broadcast.","Administration subsystem  is used to perform standard system administration tasks. For example, when a channel  is accepted into the channel application catalog , the administration subsystem  associates what users  are allowed to access the channel. With respect to authorizations, channels are assigned to groups and users. For example, anyone working in the accounting department of a company has access to a certain channel or only a certain user's family members are allowed access to a certain channel.","Identity subsystem  manages the authorization of users, places, times, and things. Identity subsystem  may include, for example, an authorize module and an authenticate module. For example, users must be authorized for content, services must be authorized for content. Accordingly, services check to ensure that users are authorized to access their services.","A main aspect of PID application  of the invention is single sign-on (or universal sign-on) capability, wherein once the user  is activated on the system, the user  is automatically authenticated when accessing any applications that normally require user login, i.e., unified access to all applications. That is, once the user  logs into information delivery system , the user will not be prompted for any other login operations when accessing information and\/or services via PID application . For example, the user  may have one or more secure email services, one or more secure banking and\/or financial accounts, one or more secure web-services accounts, and the like. Login information of all the user's secure accounts is stored, for example, identity subsystem . When a user access these secure accounts, identity subsystem  automatically provides the necessary login credentials to the requesting entity, thereby automatically logging in the user with no further action on the user's part. Because mulitple user devices  may be associated with a user , PID application  requires that the user  login on each of his\/her user devices  as they become available in order to ensure the identity of the user .","In a location-based example, a user  is authorized to use a certain user device  and\/or service only when inside his\/her place of business. Therefore, upon leaving the building the authorization is revoked. In a time-based example, a user  is authorized to use a certain user device  and\/or service only at a certain time of day, perhaps during off-peak hours. Therefore, during off-peak hours the authorization is allowed, but during peak hours the authorization is revoked.","Generally, server channel components  are used to perform the integration. Server channel components  may include Java-based components, such as, but not limited to, a Camel server channel component , a Spring server channel component , a Java server channel component , a JavaScript server channel component , a business process execution language (BPEL) server channel component .","Camel server channel component  may be, for example, the Apache Camel server channel component (available from The Apache Software Foundation). Camel server channel component  is used for the orchestration and integration of services. Spring server channel component  is used for implementing Inversion of Control (IoC) and aspect-oriented programming (AOP). For example, when passing information from one component to another, the components involved have placeholders for data to be injected (or inserted). Spring server channel component  is used to manage this process. Java server channel component  may be implemented via (e.g., Java 2 Platform Standard Edition (J2SE)). JavaScript server channel component  is used for running JavaScript on the server side of PID application . BPEL server channel component  is used to export and import information by using web service interfaces.","With respect to integration and process layer , certain unique tasks are possible, independent of the source of the content. For example, sensor data and streaming media data are being normalized, which allows the capability to combine content. Therefore, a main aspect of the invention is that PID application  is agnostic to the source of the content and agnostic to the user device on which it is presented. From a client perspective, PID application  is agnostic to what content sources are connected.","The components of PID application architecture  communicate via an enterprise service bus  of integration and process server . Enterprise service bus  manages \u201ccalls\u201d in and out of the PID application architecture . A set of adaptors  are connected to enterprise service bus  for interfacing with entities of integrated services and applications layer , which are outside of the environment of application server . That is, adaptors  are connected to enterprise service bus  for handling various communication protocols.","Integrated services and applications layer  may include, but is not limited to, one or more third-party services , one or more relational database management systems (RDBMS) , Parlay X  (i.e., a set of standard Web service APIs for the telephone network), one or more IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) servers , basic wireline telecommunication , one or more communications modules  (e.g., instant message, calendar, mail\/SMS, address book), and one or more directory servers .","An aspect of the invention is that PID application  provides built in security at the application server , which inherently provides security at each user device . Any applications running in the environment of PID application  are checked for viruses, spyware, and the like. In this way, it is ensure that users  are operating in a secure environment.","Referring to , a functional block diagram of an example of client architecture  of PID application  is presented. Client architecture  is the application architecture of the client side of PID application . That is, client architecture  is the application architecture of any user device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0108"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["200","210","212","214","216","200","510","512","514","516","518"]},"Assets  may be, for example, images, descriptive language for the layout of the channel, and the like.

Code  interacts with channel service  in the client. Additionally, code  is cached in client cache  and then transmitted via a client bus  to identity subsystem  (performing authentication and authorization) and then to channel server . Any channels  that are installed on a user device  originate from channel server  (e.g., from channel application catalog ).","Models  may be the data models for the channel . A model system  on the client side may include user-defined models, persistent models, synchronized persistent models, synchronized models, and the like. Associated with model system  may be a persistence service  and a synchronization service . Models  interact with persistence service  and synchronization service  in the client. Persistence service  on the client side communicates with the data management subsystem  on the server side.

Method  of  may include, but is not limited to, the following steps.","At step , authorized channels are implemented (e.g., at least in part by application server ) through which the user receives and\/or interacts with secure user-centric information. For example, using developer module , which is the developer environment that is built into the framework of PID application , developers may design a plurality of authorized channels , through which users  may receive and\/or interact with respective portions of the secure-user-centric information. In particular, these channels may be implemented by the application server  (e.g., via one or more processors executing processor-executable instructions), and users  may access implemented channels via one or more user platforms communicatively coupled to the application server . Respective portions of the secure user-centric information provided by the channels are based at least in part on information access rights and\/or security protocols respectively associated with the plurality of authorized channels . Relevant information associated with implementation of the channels  is stored at channel server .","At step , channel information is monitored to determine one or more events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data, based at least in part on at least one threshold condition or parameter relating to channel information. For example, the event manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem  of integration and process server  continually monitors channel information to determine the presence of one or more events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data, based on at least one threshold condition or parameter relating to certain channel information.","At decision step , if one or more events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data is present, method  may proceed, for example, to step . However, if one or more events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data is not present, method  may return, for example, to step .","For example, monitored channel information may be compared to one or more threshold conditions or parameters and, as discussed in greater detail below, various criteria for such comparisons may be predetermined\/established (e.g., less than, greater than, equal to, within a certain range, corresponding to a certain pattern or trend, particular time-varying behavior, etc.). In one aspect, if an established condition is met (e.g., the comparison meets one or more criteria, such as exceeding a quantified numerical limit, and\/or multiple similar events trending in a certain direction) such that a presence of one or more events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data is determined, a \u201ctrigger\u201d is established upon which one or more alerts may be generated. For purposes of the present disclosure, any information associated with establishing a trigger upon which one or more alerts may be generated is referred to as \u201ctrigger information.\u201d Examples of trigger information may include, but are not limited to, one or more values or other information content associated with monitored channel information that resulted in a trigger (e.g., one or more events, conditions, logical workflows, discrete information values or signal data), one or more date stamps and\/or time stamps associated with values\/information content that resulted in a trigger, identities of one or more content sources providing at least some of the channel information being monitored and resulting in a trigger, and the criterion\/criteria used to establish the trigger.

In this example, eventing and alerting may be based on that state of certain data (e.g., sensor data) that originates from a certain external information source . Further, the data may not persist at the source and, therefore, the ODS of data management subsystem  may be used to store a certain amount of data for processing. By way of example, method  is performing eventing and alerting based on sensor data of a home security system.

Using the example of a home security system, a service of, for example, the \u201cHome Security\u201d channel  interrogates the data from the external application of the home security service provider. For example and referring to , this interrogation of the external home security service provider is performed across enterprise service bus  using a certain adaptor , such as a REST adaptor. In this example, door sensor data, window sensor data, motion sensor data, and\/or smoke detector data is periodically requested (e.g., every 5 minutes) form the external home security service.

Therefore, the event manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem informs the notification manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem  of \u201cmotion detected.\u201d","At step , referring again to , the notification manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem  queries the configuration server  for the user's notification preferences and correlates these notification preferences with session manager  to determine the best notification method. That is, the notification manager queries the configuration server  and determines, for example, that the user has certain online notification preferences and certain offline notification preferences. If online, notify by, for example, the user's active session. If offline, notify by, for example, a txt message, call the user's landline, call a friend of the user, and the like.

For example, by viewing the video feed, the user  may determine that the motion detected was caused by an animal in his\/her backyard. Therefore, the user  may use keypad window  to clear the alert condition.","Referring to , a flow diagram of another example of a method  of performing eventing and alerting using PID application  is presented. Method  includes an example of an actionable alert. In this example, the eventing and alerting process may be based on the direct query of another external system instead of monitoring data that is collected and stored in the ODS of data management subsystem .","By way of example, method  is performing eventing and alerting based on near real-time currency and foreign exchange data of, for example, a currency trading system. In this example, eventing operations of information delivery system  may be based, for example, on the direct query of the currency trading system and the detection of one or more exchange rates at which the user wishes to be alerted via one or more of his\/her user devices . Method  may include, but is not limited to, the following steps.","At step , information from an external source (e.g., third-party web service) is continuously monitored and analyzed by the event manager in near real time. Continuing the example of the currency trading system, an example of a predetermined event of interest for which the user  wishes to be notified (i.e., alerted) may be when 1 Euro is equal to 1.3 U.S. dollars or less (i.e., 1 EUR=1.3 USD or less). Referring again to , the event manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem  uses CEP (e.g., via complex query language (CQL) programming) to continually monitor the currency and foreign exchange data of the currency trading system based on event(s) that have been set.","For example and referring to , the direct query of the external currency trading system is performed across enterprise service bus  using a certain adaptor , such as a REST adaptor. In this example, currency and foreign exchange data is may be pushed form the external currency trading system in near real time to the requesting \u201cCurrency Trading\u201d channel (not shown). Accordingly, the currency and foreign exchange data may be displayed in near real time to the user  via his\/her user device  and\/or analyzed in near real time for performing eventing and alerting operations.","At decision step , referring again to , the event manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem  determines whether an event condition is present. That is, the event manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem  determines whether any condition is present that corresponds to any of the predetermined event(s) of interest for which an alert is to be generated. If the event manager detects an event condition is present, method  may proceed, for example, to step . However, if the event manager detects no event condition is present, method  may return, for example, to step .","At step , referring again to , the event manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem  detects the presence of an event condition and informs the notification manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem  that an event of interest has occurred. Continuing the example of the currency trading system, in one example, the event manager is monitoring whether 1 Euro is equal to 1.3 U.S. dollars or less and detects that currently 1 EUR=1.29 USD and, thus, the condition of 1 EUR=1.3 USD or less is met. Therefore, the event manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem informs the notification manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem  of \u201cExchange rate met.\u201d","At step , referring again to , the notification manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem  queries the configuration server  for the user's notification preferences and correlates these notification preferences with session manager  to determine the best notification method. That is, the notification manager queries the configuration server  and determines, for example, that the user has certain online notification preferences and certain offline notification preferences. If online, notify by, for example, the user's active session. If offline, notify by, for example, a txt message, call the user's landline, call a friend of the user, and the like. Additionally, notifications may be based on user identity, user role, user location, time, date, and the like.","The notification manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem  then queries session manager  to determine the user's connectedness. For example, it is determined whether the user  has an active session as well as any other special conditions, such as, but not limited to, user role, user location, time, date, and the like. In one example, it is determined that the user  has an active session on his\/her laptop computer, which is one user device . As a result, it is determined that the best alert notification method is via the laptop computer of the user .","At step , referring again to , the notification manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem  dispatches the event notification (i.e., alert) through user's logical event queue. For example, the client gateway  of the facilitation server  transmits (via AMF) the alert to one or more user devices . Continuing the example, the alert is transmitted to the laptop computer of the user .","At step , referring again to , the \u201cCurrency Trading\u201d channel at the client device (e.g., user device ) receives and displays the alert to the user . Continuing the example, the requesting the \u201cCurrency Trading\u201d channel continually monitors the client bus  and, thereby, receives and displays the event notification (i.e., alert) to the user . For example, the visual components of a \u201cCurrency Trading\u201d touchlet (not shown) may transition from a non-alert state to an alert state. In one example, the color of the touchlet may change from green to red when 1 Euro is equal to 1.3 U.S. dollars or less (i.e., 1 EUR=1.3 USD or less). Further, a certain text message may be displayed in the \u201cCurrency Trading\u201d touchlet, such as \u201cExchange rate=1.3 or less.\u201d","At step , the user  may launch the corresponding channel application and take certain action. Continuing the example, the user  may touch\/click on the \u201cCurrency Trading\u201d touchlet (not shown) that is indicating the alert and, thereby, launch the corresponding \u201cCurrency Trading\u201d channel (not shown) that allows the user to perform any desired transactions.","Referring to , a screenshot of client GUI  that includes another example of a channel grid  is presented. In this example, the channel grid  may be, for example, the user's \u201cAt Work\u201d channel grid. This channel grid  includes, for example, eleven touchlets  (touchlets A through K), with one channel grid location empty (e.g., touchlet L). Touchlet B is a \u201cStock Watch\u201d touchlet that is associated with a \u201cStock Watch\u201d channel (e.g., \u201cStock Watch\u201d channel  of ). The \u201cStock Watch\u201d channel may provide a mechanism by which a user  may monitor a certain company's stock and\/or financial information. In this example, the \u201cStock Watch\u201d channel is monitoring the stock and\/or financial information of Brocade Communications Systems, Inc (BRCD).","Referring to , screenshots of certain components of an example of a \u201cStock Watch\u201d channel  of PID application  is presented.  shows \u201cStock Watch\u201d channel  operating in a substantially full-screen mode. \u201cStock Watch\u201d touchlet B is provided for presenting dynamic information of, interacting with, and\/or launching \u201cStock Watch\u201d channel . \u201cStock Watch\u201d channel  provides a mechanism for monitoring and\/or reporting certain stock and\/or financial information of a company of interest. In this example, \u201cStock Watch\u201d channel  is monitoring Brocade Communications Systems, Inc (BRCD).","The display of the \u201cStock Watch\u201d channel  may include, for example, a main viewing panel . Additionally, a taskbar  may be provided along the top of main viewing panel  and a navigation bar  may be provided along the bottom of main viewing panel . The display of \u201cStock Watch\u201d channel  may include, for example, an overview window , one or more information windows , and a trading window .","In this example, overview window  shows a plot of the BRCD stock price over some selectable period of time (e.g., last hour, day, week, month, etc), as well as other statistical information about the BRCD stock.  shows two information windows . For example, one information window  displays information about the latest news. The other information window  displays stock information about certain other companies (i.e., companies related to BRCD in some manner). Trading window  provides mechanisms by which the user  may perform stock trading transactions (e.g., buying and selling stock).","The \u201cStock Watch\u201d channel  is a good example of a channel application that to the user is seemingly a single application, but is in fact pulling publicly available information from multiple disparate data sources. For example, the real-time stock price display information in \u201cStock Watch\u201d touchlet B and in the overview window  may originate from the \u201cYahoo! Finance\u201d web service, the related companies display information in an information window  may also originate from the \u201cYahoo! Finance\u201d web service, the plot and other statistical information in the overview window  may originate from the \u201cThe Motley Fool\u201d web service, and the \u201cLatest News\u201d information in an information window  may originate from the \u201cGoogle Finance\u201d web service, trading window  may be supported by the \u201cTD Ameritrade\u201d web service, and the like.","Additionally, the functions of trading window  is an example of using the single sign-on (or universal sign-on) capability of PID application . In this example, the user  is already authenticated at PID application . Therefore, the user  is not prompted for any further login credentials when using trading window , which may be supported by an online trading web-service, such as, but not limited to, TD Ameritrade. In this example, the user's TD Ameritrade login information is already stored in the user's profile\/configuration and is automatically provided as needed by any channel application of information delivery system . The capability of the single sign-on (or universal sign-on) feature is not limited to user login information, user banking and\/or credit card information may also be stored in the user's profile\/configuration. Additionally, the single sign-on (or universal sign-on) feature my include login credentials with respect to the user's different user devices . As a result, payments information may be automatically provided as needed. In the example of TD Ameritrade, any transactions performed via trading window  are handled without prompting the user  for payments information. The aforementioned features of PID application  provide convenience to the user.","Referring to , screenshots of client GUI  of PID application  and another example of a process of eventing and alerting using PID application  is presented. The eventing and alerting process shown in  is one example of implementing method  of  and\/or method  of . In this example, with respect to \u201cStock Watch\u201d touchlet B and \u201cStock Watch\u201d channel , the user  sets an alert for when the BRCD share price rises above a certain value, as follows.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0158","num":"0157"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 15","FIG. 15"],"b":["316","330","116","316","330","334","116","334","116","450","718","700","334"]},"Other controls are provided in alerts window  to generate the alert when the share price is \u201cless than,\u201d \u201cequal to,\u201d or \u201cgreater than\u201d the share price that is entered. In one example, the user sets up an alert to occur when the share price is \u201cless than\u201d $9.23. To activate this eventing and alerting process, the user  may select an \u201cApply\u201d button of alerts window , which closes the window and automatically registers the event in the event manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem  (see ).","Accordingly, the event manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem  begins monitoring the data stream associated, in this example, with the BRCD stock.  show examples of the visual components for this eventing and alerting process. For example, the event manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem  monitors the BRCD data stream and when the BRCD share price is approaching the alert set point (e.g., near $9.23),  shows that the \u201cStock Watch\u201d touchlet B may display a warning state to the user . An example of the warning state is to change the color of the border of the \u201cStock Watch\u201d touchlet B from, for example, black to yellow. The event manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem  continues to monitor the BRCD data stream and when the BRCD share price is \u201cless than\u201d $9.23,  shows that the \u201cStock Watch\u201d touchlet B may display an alert state to the user . An example of the alert state is to change the color of the border of the \u201cStock Watch\u201d touchlet B to red.","As described in method  of  and\/or method  of , in this example, the alert is delivered according to the user's configuration (notification preferences) and session. In summary, the event manager registers the event; the event manager monitors the bus, using CEP and CQL the event manager recognizes a certain condition is present; the notification manager checks the user's configuration and session; once it is determined how to notify the end-user the notification is pushed through the facilitation manager gateway (using AMF) and to the user device (client device); the client device is monitoring the client bus and receives the notification; and the notification is displayed to the user on the client device (e.g., yellow border, red border).","Referring to , screenshots of certain channels of PID application  and an example of a process of combining two or more independent channels to create a new channel (and touchlet) and a process of eventing off of the combined data is presented. In this example, a user  may be a stock broker that hears that Cisco Systems, Inc is interested in buying Brocade Communications Systems, Inc. Therefore, there may be some very specific information that the user  wishes to be informed about regarding this potential transaction. Therefore, the user  may create a new channel and set up the desired alert notifications, as follows.","In this example, the process is using the \u201cLatest News\u201d touchlet A; the \u201cStock Watch\u201d touchlet B, which is BRCD; and the \u201cStock Watch\u201d touchlet C, which is Cisco Systems, Inc (CSCO); which are shown in . That is, in this example the independent channels supporting \u201cLatest News\u201d touchlet A, \u201cStock Watch\u201d touchlet B, and \u201cStock Watch\u201d touchlet C are combined to create a new channel (and touchlet). Then, an eventing and alerting process with respect to the new channel is set up with respect to the combined data.","Referring to , in order to create a new channel, the user  selects an icon  on taskbar , which causes a create channel window  to be displayed to the user . A channels portion  of the create channel window  shows a list of available channels from which to build an alert. For example, the available channels are from the current channel grid  or from any other channel grid of the user . A query builder portion  of the create channel window  provides a query builder function to the user , which is used to generate the CQL that interacts with the event manager of the eventing and alerting subsystem  (see ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0165","num":"0164"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":["116","340","342","338","116","116","452"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0166","num":"0165"},"figref":"FIG. 20","b":["116","340","342","338","342","116","116","452","342","338","450","718","700"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0167","num":"0166"},"figref":"FIG. 21","b":["116","340","342","338","342","116","452"]},"The query builder portion  of the create channel window  allows boolean operations between the selected channels. For example, the user  may be provided AND, OR, ANDNOT, and XOR functions. In this example, the user selects the \u201cLatest News\u201d channel AND the BRCD \u201cStock Watch\u201d channel AND the CSCO \u201cStock Watch\u201d channel. In this way, an alert is generated when the following condition is present: Both the words \u201cBrocade\u201d and \u201cCisco\u201d are detected in the \u201cLatest News\u201d channel AND when a share price \u201cgreater than $9.26\u201d is detected via the BRCD \u201cStock Watch\u201d channel AND when a share price \u201cgreater than $$23.63\u201d is detected via the CSCO \u201cStock Watch\u201d channel.","The query builder portion  of the create channel window  also provides notification settings. For example, the user  may select notify by: Current Device, Email, IM, SMS, Mobile, and the like. The user  may select one or more. The query builder portion  of the create channel window  also provides channel name field. In one example, the user  enters \u201cCustom Alert.\u201d When the setup is complete, the user  selects a \u201cCreate Channel\u201d button to deploy the new \u201cCustom Alert\u201d channel. By pressing the \u201cCreate Channel\u201d button, certain processes occur, such as, but not limited to, the channel server  is updated accordingly, a touchlet is created and loaded into the client, all events set up on the menu are registered with the event manager, the user's configuration is updated with the notification preferences for this channel, the event manager begins monitoring the data streams according to the query. The touchlet is updated in real time as to the status of the three variables.","In this example and referring now to , a \u201cCustom Alert\u201d touchlet L is created and presented in channel grid . The \u201cCustom Alert\u201d touchlet L displays the three components that the channel is eventing off. In this view, the \u201cCustom Alert\u201d touchlet L displays the three components (e.g., news, BRCD, and CSCO), which are all in a no alert condition. In one example, the no alert condition for each component is to display the component in a green color in the \u201cCustom Alert\u201d touchlet L. Therefore,  shows all three components in green to indicate that no alert conditions are present.","Referring now to , two of the three alert conditions are met and the \u201cCustom Alert\u201d touchlet L displays a warning state to the user . In this example, the BRCD and the CSCO conditions are met, but the news condition is not yet met. Therefore, the color of the BRCD and CSCO components may be changed from green to yellow, while the news component remains green. In this way, the user  may perceive a warning that, while the alert condition is not yet fully met, an alert may be eminent.","Referring now to , all three alert conditions are met and the \u201cCustom Alert\u201d touchlet L displays an alert state to the user . In this example, the news, BRCD, and CSCO conditions are met. Therefore, the color of the news, BRCD, and CSCO components in the \u201cCustom Alert\u201d touchlet L may be changed to red. In this way, the user  may receive the notification that the alert condition is fully met.","Referring again to , in this view other alerts are presented in certain touchlets  of channel grid . For example, touchlet H, which may be a business calendar channel, is displaying a \u201cYou have 4 scheduled meetings today\u201d alert. Touchlet I, which may be an email channel, is displaying a \u201c4 unread messages\u201d alert. Both of these alerts are example of non-actionable alerts, as these are informational alerts that do not require user action. For example, the user may choose or not choose to launch the email channel and read his\/her emails. However, if the user should choose to launch the email channel and read his\/her emails, the \u201c4 unread messages\u201d alert is cleared.","Referring now to , the \u201cCustom Alert\u201d channel provides an alert that is actionable. That is, upon receiving the alert via \u201cCustom Alert\u201d touchlet L, the user , who may be a stock broker, may take certain action. By clicking on the \u201cCustom Alert\u201d touchlet L, which may be in an alert state, the associated \u201cCustom Alert\u201d channel  may be presented to the user . For example,  shows the GUI for an example of the \u201cCustom Alert\u201d channel . The GUI for the \u201cCustom Alert\u201d channel  may include, for example, a query parameters portion  and an actions portion .","The query parameters portion  allows the user  to, for example, adjust the query parameters, add more conditions, change conditions, remove conditions, and the like. The actions portion  allows the user  to perform certain actions based on the alert. For example, the actions portion  may provide mechanisms by which the user  may perform stock trading transactions (e.g., buying and selling stock), similar to trading window  of \u201cStock Watch\u201d channel  of , which may be supported by the \u201cTD Ameritrade\u201d web service.","The \u201cCustom Alert\u201d channel  is used to generate an alert that is of particular importance to the user . The \u201cCustom Alert\u201d channel  is an example of the user-centric aspect of PID application  in which only information that is of most importance to the user is processed and\/or presented to the user . The aforementioned process of combining two or more independent channels to create a new channel (and touchlet) and a process of eventing off of the combined data is an example of the capability of PID application  to allow the user  to action based on disparate data that is of interest to the user and conditions set by the user.","While various inventive embodiments have been described and illustrated herein, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily envision a variety of other means and\/or structures for performing the function and\/or obtaining the results and\/or one or more of the advantages described herein, and each of such variations and\/or modifications is deemed to be within the scope of the inventive embodiments described herein.
