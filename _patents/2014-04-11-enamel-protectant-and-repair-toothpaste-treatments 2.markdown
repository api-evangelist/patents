Dentifrices have been widely adopted around the world as the principle means of delivering topical fluoride and obtaining caries preventive benefits.","\u201cWashout\u201d of various enamel protectant and enamel repair ingredients from enamel surfaces by saliva flow, eventually controls the effective residence time of various commercial fluoride, enamel protectant and enamel repair, brushing compositions. To improve enamel protectant and enamel repair effectiveness, commercial, professionally prescribed, fluoride, brushing compositions resort to high levels of fluoride, i.e. 5000 ppm for Rx toothpastes, gels and rinses and to approximately 22,000 ppm fluoride for \u201cin-chair\u201d, professionally applied varnishes. In addition, standard OTC fluoride toothpastes can contain up to 1500 ppm fluoride under the FDA's Fluoride Monograph.","The current market for fluoride brushing products includes: professional and consumer oral care, fluoride treatments, both OTC and Rx brushing products; including: toothpastes, gels, pastes and varnishes. As noted above, Rx fluoride toothpastes and Rx fluoride toothpastes are well outside fluoride Monograph levels containing up to 5000 ppm fluoride. Professional oral care, in-chair, fluoride varnishes contain up to about 22,000 ppm fluoride, while OTC fluoride toothpastes can contain up to 1500 ppm fluoride, the maximum level provided for the Monograph.","The American Dental Association (ADA); the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and oral care professionals including: general practitioners, periodontists, orthodontists, pediatric dentists, etc. as a group; are generally concerned about the trend of increasing fluoride levels. These organizations and oral care professionals generally favor using lower levels of fluoride in various in-chair treatments and various OTC and Rx, oral care, home treatments for patients, provided that enamel protection and repair, achieved with lower fluoride levels, are comparable to the results reported for brushing products with higher levels of fluoride. This preference for lower fluoride-brushing products is driven by the concern over toxicity, fluorosis in children, etc., associated with exposure to high fluoride levels, long term.","It is generally accepted that approximately 90% of the fluoride used in OTC and Rx fluoride brushing treatments is expectorated after use. Thus, the window for fluoride treatment of enamel is essentially limited to the time fluoride is being brushed onto the enamel. In contrast, fluoride varnishes containing 22,000 ppm fluoride, applied to the enamel by an oral care professional, are designed to maintain substantive fluoride levels on the enamel after patient expectoration.","Fluoride varnishes are generally applied professionally, at a frequency of about once every six months with the target audience comprising primarily children.","Dietary fluoride levels have gradually increased due to fluoridated drinking water and the fluoride in water used in food preparation, etc. In addition, most consumers use fluoride: toothpastes, rinses, gels, etc. Extensive literature citations indicate topical fluoride treatments are more effective in protecting and repairing enamel than treatment with systemic fluorides.\n\n","Yet, with all this fluoride available, caries continues to pose a challenge: in children, as well as adults including coronal caries in the elderly, caries in dry mouth patients, caries in immunocompromised patients, caries in patients undergoing medical or dental treatment, etc.","There is a need to improve enamel protectant and enamel repair effectiveness treatments for professional oral care, fluoride procedures, as well as for OTC fluoride products for patient treatment, while reducing the risk associated with exposure to high fluoride levels.","Additionally, there is a need to improve the efficacy of fluoride products in the area of enamel protection and enamel repair, where the efficacy of various fluoride treatments is assessed as a function of the fluoride level used to effect treatment of various conditions of the enamel.","To provide stannous fluoride toothpaste treatments with improved enamel protectant factor (EPF) values and improved enamel repair factor (ERF) values.","To provide stannous fluoride toothpaste treatments with improved EPF and ERF values, where improvements in EPF and ERF values are accompanied by reduced fluoride content in the toothpastes.","To reduce fluoride levels in toothpaste treatments, while attaining comparable or improved EPF and ERF values, compared to current, commercial, fluoride brushing treatments, as well as fluoride brushing treatments described in the prior art.","To improve EPF and ERF values for the enamel of \u201cat-risk\u201d patients.","To improve enamel conditions of \u201cat-risk\u201d patients including immunocompromised patients; cancer therapy, cardio treatment, diabetes, COP patients; etc.","The following terms used throughout this specification and claims to describe features of the toothpastes of the present invention are described below:","\u201cAqueous-free\u201d is defined as: substantially free from water.","\u201cEnamel Protectant Factor (EPF)\u201d is defined as: the percent reduction in enamel solubility divided by the fluoride level in parts per million using FDA method #40.","\u201cEnamel Repair Factor (ERF)\u201d is defined as: the average increase in enamel fluoride concentration divided by the fluoride level of the fluoride brushing product tested using FDA method #33.","\u201cToothpaste treatment\u201d is defined as: an abrasive-based, paste treatment suitable for administration of stannous fluoride to enamel surfaces by brushing with a toothbrush.","\u201cMucoadhesive\u201d is defined as: a substance that is retained for a period of time onto surfaces in the mouth that is not easily removed by the mechanical action of the tongue nor by flow of saliva.","\u201cStable stannous fluoride\u201d is defined as: compositions that, when chemically assayed, substantially retains the level of stannous and\/or fluoride in an unreacted state.","\u201cBiofilm\u201d is defined as: a surface adherent film comprised of bacteria, exuded polysaccharides, etc., that is not easily removed by mechanical means or saliva flow.","\u201cSubstantivity agent\u201d is defined as: a composition that improves the mucosal retention of the desired agents.","\u201cCation bridging\u201d is defined as: electrical attraction between two films or membranes initiated by cation moieties.","\u201cShift in calcium binding from bidentate to monodentate\u201d is defined as: the loss of \u201cchelate\u201d-like binding by calcium cations with a corresponding increase in single ligand binding by calcium cations.","\u201cNonionic surfactant\u201d is defined as: a composition that indicates surface active properties with the absence of charged species.","\u201cCaF moiety\u201d is defined as: a monodentate calcium fluoride ion.","\u201cLinear, polymeric, polycarboxylates, substantivity enhancer\u201d is defined as: a linear polymer with carboxylate substituents that increases retention of compositions onto charged surfaces.","\u201cEmulsion discontinuous phase\u201d is defined as: the minor component in an emulsion that is surrounded by a continuous phase.","\u201cEmulsion continuous phase\u201d is defined as: an emulsion component that surrounds discontinuous phase component.","The present invention is directed to aqueous-free, toothpaste, composition treatments, wherein the toothpastes contain stannous fluoride from between 850 and about 1500 ppm fluoride, in an aqueous-free, substantivity agent. The toothpaste treatments of the present invention protect and repair enamel more effectively than toothpastes and toothpaste treatment containing comparable or substantially higher levels of fluoride, as indicated by comparative EPF and ERF values reported herein.","The unexpected enamel protectant and enamel repair features of the stannous fluoride, toothpaste treatments of the present invention, as detailed below in the Examples, Tables and Drawings; are attributed to unique, aqueous-free, toothpaste composition treatments, which feature:\n\n","The enamel protectant and enamel repair, toothpaste, composition treatments of the present invention form substantive, mucoadhesive gels on enamel in the presence of saliva; which mucoadhesive gels gradually release the stannous fluoride onto enamel. This slow release continues until the mucoadhesive gel is eventually totally solubilized by saliva. This gradual release minimizes the \u201cwash-out\u201d effect traditionally experienced with fluoride brushing treatments. The resultant enamel protectant and enamel repair increases in EPF and ERF values, resulting from the extended enamel residence time of stannous fluoride, calcium and cation bridging associated with microbial fluoride binding to biofilm. This improved, stannous fluoride efficiency, treatment reduces risks associated with elevated fluoride levels.","Aqueous-free, stannous fluoride, toothpaste treatments of the present invention comprise substantivity agents that contain various enamel protectant and enamel repair ingredients. These substantivity agents function as carriers for various enamel protectant and repair ingredients. These substantivity agents are characterized by their ability, in the presence of saliva, to form mucoadhesive gels which are substantive to enamel with biofilm. These substantive, mucoadhesive gels are further characterized by their ability to: (a) gradually dissolve when exposed to saliva flow, and (b) gradually release various enamel protectant and enamel repair ingredients onto enamel surfaces with biofilm as they dissolve. This gradual dissolution feature of these mucoadhesive gels minimizes saliva \u201cwash-out\u201d of enamel protectant and enamel repair ingredients by gradually releasing these ingredients onto enamel surfaces with biofilm. The substantivity agents of the present invention extend the duration of enamel protectant and enamel repair treatments and support cation bridging associated with microbial fluoride binding, thereby enhancing the EPF and ERF values of various toothpaste treatments of the present invention, while simultaneously reducing the level of fluoride required to achieve the unexpected increases in EPF and ERF values.","In as preferred embodiment of the invention, calcium and phosphate components are included in the toothpaste treatments. These are described by Ming Tung in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,037,639; 5,268,167; 5,427,768; 5,437,857; 5,460,803; 5,562,895; by Tung in the American Dental Association Foundation publication, \u201cACP Technology,\u201d; by Schemehorn, et. al., in The Journal of Clinical Dentistry Vol. XXII: No 2. 51-54, 2011; by the 19 references cited by Schemehorn, et. al.; and by the description of various Gantrez\u00ae resins containing calcium, including Gantrez\u00ae M955 available from International Specialty Products, Wayne, N.J., USA.","The aqueous-free, substantivity agents of the present invention hold the various enamel protectant and enamel repair ingredients, including stannous fluoride, calcium and phosphate components, in a condition where these ingredients remain stable and unreacted. When this aqueous-free, substantivity agent is exposed to saliva, it forms a mucoadhesive gel that is substantive to enamel with biofilm. This mucoadhesive gel continues to hold the enamel protectant and enamel repair ingredients onto enamel surfaces with biofilm without the ingredients reacting. These ingredients eventually react upon being released onto saliva and biofilm coated, enamel surfaces.","Eventually, this mucoadhesive, substantivity agent is totally dissolved by saliva, releasing the balance of unreacted enamel protectant and enamel repair ingredients onto saliva and biofilm coated, enamel surfaces.","Aqueous-free, toothpaste treatments of the present invention contain enamel protectant and enamel repair ingredients, suitable for protecting and repairing dental enamel; wherein:\n\n","For purposes of the present invention, saliva soluble, aqueous-free emulsions used as substantivity agents include those emulsions that are comprised of polydimethylsiloxane polymers in nonionic surfactants, as described in U.S. Pat.

One or more PEGs are optionally present in a total amount of about 0.1% to about 10%, for example about 0.2% to about 5% or about 0.25% to about 2%.","Humectants useful for the present invention include, without limitation: polyhydric alcohols such as glycerin, sorbitol, xylitol or low molecular weight PEGs. In various embodiments, humectants can prevent hardening of the toothpastes upon exposure to air. In various embodiments, humectants also function as sweeteners.","Any other desired components may be added to the compositions of the treatments of the present invention, including, for example, additional: mouth-feel agents, pH modifying agents, flavorants, sweeteners, additional anticalculus and Antiplaque agents, abrasives, polishing agents, antimicrobial (e.g. antibacterial) agents such as those described in U.S. Pat.

The study was performed following FDA good laboratory practices.","Purpose of the following in vitro study: to determine the effect of acid challenge to human enamel treated with various fluoride containing brushing products. The effect of the acid challenge was established by measuring the resistance of enamel specimens treated with various fluoride brushing products to an acid challenge; before and after treatment with various fluoride brushing products.","Tooth Preparation:","Three sound human molars were placed in a disc of red boxing wax so that only the enamel surfaces were exposed. Twelve set of three teeth each were prepared for the study. All specimens were cleaned and polished with a flour of pumice slurry and a rag wheel to remove any deposits or stains.","Preparation of Buffered Lactic Acid Challenge Solution:","Two moles (203.58 g of 88.5% pure lactic acid were diluted with approximately 500 ml of distilled water. To this was added a solution of 84 g NaOH dissolved in about 600 ml of distilled water. The total volume was then adjusted to 2000 ml. This was the buffered 1.0 M lactic acid challenge solution.","Another lactic acid solution was prepared by diluting two moles lactic acid to 2000 ml with distilled water. The solution of lactic acid and sodium hydroxide was placed in a 4000 ml beaker, and pH electrodes placed in the solution. The 1.0 M lactic acid solution was used to adjust the pH of the buffered solution to 4.5. To obtain a 0.1 working concentration (for all decalcifications) the 1.0 M buffer was diluted by a factor of 10 with distilled water.","Deprotection:","Before every use, any residual anti-solubility protection afforded by the previous treatment was eliminated. Deprotection of these specimens was accomplished by etching the teeth in the above prepared 0.1 M lactate buffer solution for a two-hour period. Each disc of three specimens was agitated (450 rpm) in about 50 ml of lactate buffer at room temperature during the deprotection period. The teeth were rinsed well with distilled water immediately following deprotection.","Pre-Treatment Etch:","The test was performed using preheated (37\u00b0 C.) tooth sets and lactate buffer. The deprotected tooth sets were mounted on \u00bc inch diameter acrylic rods with molten red boxing wax. Multiplaced stirrers were used for treatments and the etches. All slurries and solutions were pre-heated to 37\u00b0 C. The actual treatments and etches were carried out on the bench top with the preheated solutions. Plastic specimen containers (120 ml) were used for the etching procedure. A \u00bc inch hole was drilled in each container lid to accommodate the plastic rod to which the tooth sets were mounted. A 40 ml portion of 0.1 M lactic acid buffer was placed in each container along with a one-inch magnetic stirring bar. The rod of the first tooth set was pushed through the hole in the lid, placed in the first container and adjusted so that all enamel surfaces were immersed into the buffer solution. The container was then placed on the first magnetic stirrer and stirring was begun. The timer was started at this time. At 30-second intervals the other tooth sets were started in the same manner. After 15 minutes of exposure to the buffered lactate solution, the first set was stopped and the lid and tooth set immediately removed from the container and placed in a tray of distilled water to terminate etching. The other sets were similarly removed at 30 second intervals in the same order that they were initiated and the lactate buffer solutions was retained for phosphorus analysis. The tooth sets were placed back in the 37\u00b0 C. water bath in preparation for the fluoride treatment step.","Treatment:","The treatments were performed using slurries of the fluoride brushing products. The slurries consisted of 1 part fluoride brushing product and 3 parts preheated (37\u00b0 C.) distilled water (9 g:27 ml). Each slurry was mixed for exactly one minute after adding the water. The slurries were NOT prepared ahead of time. They were NOT centrifuged. All tooth sets were treated at the same time (one for each fluoride brushing product). The treatment procedure was similar to the etching procedure with the exception of the slurry in place of the acid. A 30 ml portion of the preheated fluoride brushing slurry was added to the first tooth set, the teeth were immersed in the slurry and the container placed on the first stirrer. The stirrer and timer were started. At 90-second intervals (to allow time for stirring), the other tooth sets were started in the same manner. At the end of the five minutes of treatment, the first set was stopped, the tooth set removed and rinsed well with distilled water. The other sets were removed at 90-second intervals and rinsed well. The treatment fluoride brushing slurries were discarded.","Post-Treatment:","A second acid exposure was then performed by the same method as the pre-treatment etch and the lactate buffer solutions were again retained for phosphorus analysis. The pre and post-treatment solutions were analyzed using a Klett-Summerson Photoelectric Colorimeter.","Repeat Analyses:","The tooth sets were deprotected and the procedure repeated additional times so that each fluoride brushing product was treated and assayed on each tooth set. The treatment design was a Latin Square design so that no treatment followed another treatment consistently.","Calculation of Enamel Solubility Reduction:","The percent of enamel solubility reduction was computed as the difference between the amount of phosphorus in the pre and post acidic solutions, divided by the amount of phosphorus in the pre solution and multiplied by 100.","Treatment Groups:","A. Placebo (deionized water)","B. Positive control 1 Crest\u00ae PRO-HEALTH\u00ae Toothpaste with stannous fluoride @ 1100 ppm fluoride","C. Positive control 2 ClinPro\u00ae 5000 Toothpaste with sodium fluoride at 5000 ppm fluoride","D. Test, stannous fluoride, toothpaste treatment at 1100 ppm fluoride composition as described hereinafter in Example 1.","Statistical Analyses:","Statistical analyses of the individual means were performed with a one-way analysis of variance model using Sigma Stat (3.1) Software. Since the ANOVA indicated significant differences, the individual means were analyzed by the Student Newman-Keuls (SNK) test.","Results and Discussion:","The deionized water negative control was not effective in reducing enamel solubility. The positive fluoride containing controls and the test toothpaste were significantly more effective than the deionized water negative control. The Clinpro 5000\u00ae toothpaste was slightly, significantly more effective than the negative control. The test toothpaste was comparable to the CREST\u00ae PRO-HEALTH\u00ae Toothpaste in reducing enamel solubility.","The results are shown in Table 2 below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0168"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"322pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"ENAMEL SOLUBILITY REDUCTION"},{"entry":"Summary of"},{"entry":"Results"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Pre-Etch","Post-Etch","Delta","Percent",{}]},{"entry":["Group","Treatment","\u03bcP","\u03bcP","\u03bcP","Reduction","EPF**"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["A","Deionized Water","\u2002680 \u00b1 16*","780 \u00b1 19","\u2212100 \u00b1 15\u2002","\u221215.03 \u00b1 2.35\u2002","\u2014"]},{"entry":["B","MI Paste Plus toothpaste","677 \u00b1 28","697 \u00b1 19","\u221220 \u00b1 20","\u20023.92 \u00b1 2.83","0.4"]},{"entry":[{},"treatment (@ 900 ppm"]},{"entry":[{},"fluoride)"]},{"entry":["C","Clinpro 5000\u2009\u00ae toothpawte","702 \u00b1 20","582 \u00b1 14","120 \u00b1 9\u2002","16.96 \u00b1 0.83","0.34"]},{"entry":[{},"treatment (sodium fluoride @"]},{"entry":[{},"5000 ppm)"]},{"entry":["D","Test Toothpaste Treatment","717 \u00b1 18","359 \u00b1 11","358 \u00b1 18","49.71 \u00b1 1.62","4.3"]},{"entry":[{},"(stannous fluoride @ 1150 ppm"]},{"entry":[{},"fluoride)"]},{"entry":[{},"See Example 1"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"*Mean \u00b1 SEM (N = 12)"},{"entry":"**To establish the enamel protection factor (EPF) values for each fluoride brushing treatment tested, the percent reduction in enamel solubility was divided by the fluoride level in parts per million of the brushing product tested.

A core of enamel 3 mm in diameter was prepared from each tooth by cutting perpendicularly to the labial surface with a hollow-core diamond drill bit. This was performed under water to prevent overheating of the specimens. Each specimen was embedded in the end of a plexiglass rod (\u00bc\u2033 diameter\u00d72\u2033 long) using methylmethacrylate. The excess acrylic was cut away exposing the enamel surface. The enamel specimens were polished with 600 grit wet\/dry paper and then micro-fine Gamma Alumina. The resulting specimens were a 3 mm disk of enamel with all but the exposed surface covered with acrylic. Twelve specimens per group were prepared.","Each enamel specimen was then etched by immersion into 0.5 ml of 1M HClO4 for 15 seconds. Throughout the etch period, the etch solutions were continuously agitated. A sample of each solution was then buffered with TISAB (fluoride ion probe buffer) to a pH of 5.2 (0.25 ml sample, 0.5 ml TISAB and 0.25 ml 1N NaOH) and the fluoride content of the solution determined by comparison to a similarly prepared standard curve (1 ml std+1 ml TISAB). For use in depth of each calculation, the Ca content of the etch solution was determined by taking 50 \u03bcl and analyzing for Ca by atomic absorption (0.05 ml qs to 5 ml). These data was the indigenous fluoride level of each specimen prior to treatment.","The specimens were once again ground and polished as described above. An incipient lesion was formed in each enamel specimen by immersion into a 0.1 M lactic acid\/0.2% Carbopol 907 solution for 24 hours at room temperature. These specimens were then rinsed well with distilled water and stored in a humid environment until used.","The treatments were performed using slurries of the various fluoride containing brushing products. The flurries consisted of 1 part fluoride containing brushing product and 3 parts distilled water (9 g:27 ml). Each slurry was mixed for exactly one minute after adding the water. The slurries were NOT prepared ahead of time. They were NOT centrifuged. The 12 specimens of each group were then immersed into 25 ml of their assigned slurry with constant stirring (350 rpm) for 30 minutes. Following treatment, the specimens were rinsed with distilled water. One layer of enamel was then removed from each specimen and analyzed for fluoride and calcium as outlined above (i.e. 15 second etch). The pretreatment fluoride (indigenous) level of each specimen was then subtracted from post treatment, fluoride value to determine the change in enamel fluoride due to the last treatment.","Statistical Analyses:","The results are shown on attached tables.

This 10\u00d7 plus improvement in ERF value over commercial toothpaste treatments represents a major advance in fluoride uptake and enamel hardening effectiveness. Such an advantage in enamel hardening efficiency is particularly critical to patients experiencing: rampant caries, coronal caries, cancer therapy treatments, mucositis treatments, immune deficiency treatments, bone marrow transplants, etc.","The enamel protectant and\/or enamel repair (EPF and\/or ERF) data reported for treatments described in Examples 1 through 6, as detailed in Tables 1 through 8 and in  of the Drawings, suggest the substantivity of stannous fluoride and calcium to the biofilm present on enamel surfaces is enhanced by a shift from bidentate to monodentate calcium binding in the presence of stannous fluoride. This shift in calcium binding in the presence of stannous fluoride results in a most effective binding site configuration for the treatments of the present invention. See:\n\n","See also:\n\n","Calcium binding to biofilm shifts from a bidentate chelation to a monodentate chelation in the presence of fluoride, freeing up Calcium to bind with fluoride, CaF pairs, thereby doubling the calcium binding capacity.","Stable fluoride in the toothpaste treatments of the present invention produces marked reduction in calcium binding affinity and approximately doubles calcium binding capacity. In the absence of fluoride, calcium binding to biofilm is bidentate. Stable fluoride in the toothpaste treatments of the present invention compete with biofilm causing calcium binding to biofilm to become monodentate. This allows the binding of about double the quantity of calcium and of CaF bound to biofilm. Release of fluoride bound by calcium bridging into biofilm fluid as a result of fluoride clearance into saliva will be accompanied by a corresponding release of calcium which, in turn, potentiates the cariostatic effect of fluoride as indicated in the in vitro testing of the treatments of the invention described in Tables 2 through 80 and  of the Drawings.","At least some of the stable fluoride present in the toothpaste treatments of the present invention is bound to calcium ions (sourced from various calcium salts in the present invention and\/or calcium present in the copolymer substantivity enhancer, such as Gantrez\u00ae MS-955). These calcium ions, in turn, are bound to biofilm associated with enamel.","A drop in pH follows exposure of plaque to sucrose which removes some anionic groups by neutralization, thereby liberating calcium and fluoride (as Car) at the very sites where these moieties can do the most good.","The effectiveness of the toothpaste treatments of the present invention depends on three factors:\n\n","Stannous fluoride produces a marked reduction in calcium binding affinity accompanied by an approximate doubling of the calcium binding capacity. In the absence of fluoride, divalent cation binding to plaque is bidentate. Fluoride competes with macromolecular anionic groups, causing binding to become monodentate. Release of fluoride formed by calcium bridging, is accompanied by release of calcium, which potentiates the cariostatic effect of fluoride in the treatments of the present invention.","The presence CaF is required to deliver the enamel protection and repair (EPF and ERF) results required for the toothpaste treatments of the present invention.","Fluoride binding produces a marked reduction in calcium binding affinity, along with a doubling of calcium binding capacity. This indicates that calcium binding changes from bidentate to monodentate. This shift from bidentate to monodentate is a consequence of fluoride replacing an anionic group as one of the calcium ligends in the treatments of the present invention.","The anionic groups to which calcium is no longer bound are then free to bind a CaF ion pair, resulting in a doubling of the calcium binding capacity. Release of fluoride, bound by calcium bridging into plaque fluid, may be accompanied by a release of calcium which will potentiate the cariostatic effect of fluoride.","CaF is taken up by hydroxyapatite and is responsible for the EPF and ERF in vitro data reported for the compositions of the present invention. The ERF values reported for the treatments of the present invention in Tables 3 through 8 and  of the Drawings suggest that the CaF moiety is incorporated into the hydroxyapatite lattice during the remineralization treatment of the present invention.","The toothpaste treatments of the present invention set a new, oral care STANDARD for Enamel Protection and Enamel Repair treatment, while dramatically reducing exposure to elevated levels in various fluoride varnishes, gels and toothpaste treatments."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIGS. 2 through 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIGS. 2 through 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIGS. 2 through 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
