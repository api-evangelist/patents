{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A \u201ccredit card grace period\u201d is generally the time between the end of one's billing cycle and one's payment due date. Essentially, this window, usually between 20 and 25 days, allows a payment to be made for the prior billing cycle's purchases without accruing any interest on those items. The due date, as noted on the credit card statement, is typically the time when the grace period ends, and after that, one will begin accruing interest on any unpaid portion of one's balance if the annual percentage rate (APR) on the card is greater than 0%. However, if one typically carries a balance on the credit card from month to month and fails to pay the account in full, this grace period is ultimately wiped out in some cases.","Some of the different types of credit card grace periods are described below:","Full Grace Period","This type of grace period allows one to carry a balance from prior billing cycles (each billing cycle typically being a month) and still avoid interest on purchases made during the most recent billing cycle, assuming they are paid off entirely within the 20-25 day window. There will still be interest charged on the portion that is carried over, but new purchases paid for within the grace period that correspond to the latest billing cycle will be interest free. Therefore, if a balance is carried over from a previous billing cycle, but the statement balance is paid in full within the grace period, one will be charged interest on the \u201caverage daily balance excluding new purchases,\u201d meaning any balance carried over from previous billing cycles accrues interest by way of average daily balance, with new purchases excluded from this computation. (New purchases are those which are a part of the most recent billing cycle.)","Standard Grace Period","Unfortunately, the above formula is pretty rare, as most credit card issuers charge interest on all purchases immediately if one has a previous outstanding balance. But if the credit card statement balance is paid in full every month, this will work like a full grace period. No interest will be charged as long as the full statement balance payment is made within the allotted time designated by the grace period each month. Therefore, if a balance is carried over from a previous billing cycle, but the statement balance is paid in full within the grace period, one will be charged interest on the \u201caverage daily balance including new purchases,\u201d meaning balances carried over from previous months as well as new purchases accrue interest based on the average daily balance computing model. So in this case, any outstanding balance from a prior billing cycle will essentially eliminate one's grace period because any new charges accrue interest immediately.","No Grace Period","There are also situations where this is no grace period whatsoever. Typically, cash advances and convenience checks have no grace period, and as a result, interest begins to accrue the minute one withdraws the funds. This can also be the case with some department store credit cards.","However, even if a borrower pays off the statement balance within the grace period (whether it is a full or standard grace period), there is currently no benefit or credit given to the borrower for not using those interest free grace period days remaining before the end of the grace period.","In this regard, there is a need for systems and methods that overcome the shortcomings described above and others.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","In consideration of the above-identified shortcomings of the art, systems and methods for","issuing credit for unused interest free grace periods are provided.

For example, computing systems may be connected together by wired or wireless systems, by local networks or widely distributed networks. Currently, many networks are coupled to the Internet, which provides an infrastructure for widely distributed computing and encompasses many different networks. Any such infrastructures, whether coupled to the Internet or not, may be used in conjunction with the systems and methods provided.","A network infrastructure may enable a host of network topologies such as client\/server, peer-to-peer, or hybrid architectures. The \u201cclient\u201d is a member of a class or group that uses the services of another class or group to which it is not related. In computing, a client is a process, i.e., roughly a set of instructions or tasks, that requests a service provided by another program. The client process utilizes the requested service without having to \u201cknow\u201d any working details about the other program or the service itself. In a client\/server architecture, particularly a networked system, a client is usually a computer that accesses shared network resources provided by another computer, e.g., a server.

The client process may be active in a first computer system, and the server process may be active in a second computer system, communicating with one another over a communications medium, thus providing distributed functionality and allowing multiple clients to take advantage of the information-gathering capabilities of the server. Any software objects may be distributed across multiple computing devices or objects.","Client(s) and server(s) communicate with one another utilizing the functionality provided by protocol layer(s).

Communication can be provided over a communications medium, e.g., client(s) and server(s) may be coupled to one another via TCP\/IP connection(s) for high-capacity communication.","In light of the diverse computing environments that may be built according to the general framework provided in  and the further diversification that can occur in computing in a network environment such as that of , the systems and methods provided herein cannot be construed as limited in any way to a particular computing architecture. Instead, the embodiments should be construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the appended claims.","Referring next to , shown is a timeline illustrating an example credit card billing cycle along with example used and unused portions of an interest free grace period. Shown is the billing cycle , with w days in the present example. A billing cycle is usually considered the interval between periodic billings for goods sold or services rendered. Here, the services rendered may be considered the provision of a line of credit to the customer. Although the billing cycle  may, for example, be referred to herein as a credit card billing cycle, the same or similar example timeline  may also apply to billing cycles of other loans including but not limited to: home loans, home equity loans, business loans, student loans, auto loans, personal lines of credit, vehicle loans, etc. Shown is the example timeline  with a point marked as the start of the billing cycle . The exact day of the start of the billing cycle may often be chosen by the borrower or lender, but often occurs on the same day every month. However, the billing cycle need not be monthly, but could be bi-weekly, quarterly, yearly, other intervals of time as well. Also, shown is a point marked as the end of the billing cycle . At the end of the billing cycle , a statement or bill is usually sent to the borrower. This may be a paper bill sent through the mail, but increasingly the bills are being delivered and the payments are being accepted both electronically, thus increasing the chance that the borrower will pay the bill (and the lender will receive the payment) earlier.","Next shown on the timeline is the interest free grace period  offered by many lenders (especially credit card lenders). As described in the background section above, an interest free grace period for credit cards is generally the time between the end of the billing cycle and the payment due date 307. Essentially, this window, usually between 20 and 25 days, allows one to make a payment for the prior month's purchases without accruing any interest on those items if an unpaid balance has not been carried forward from a previous billing cycle. Herein \u201cinterest free grace period\u201d and \u201cgrace period\u201d may be used interchangeably. Also, the \u201cinterest free grace period\u201d or \u201cgrace period\u201d may apply to other types of loans as well as described above with respect to the timeline . As shown in the example, the grace period is x days long and the borrower has paid the full statement balance  y number of days after the end of the billing cycle . This leaves z number of days of unused grace period . Ostensibly, the borrower could have used z more interest free days, but did not, and thus the lender, instead of the borrower, has benefited from the unused z interest free grace period days on the statement balance amount by receiving the payment early.","Referring next to , shown is a flow chart illustrating an example process for issuing credit for unused interest free grace periods. First, the lender sends out a statement or bill at end of the current billing cycle to the borrower with a due date based on current grace period for said billing cycle (i.e., the due date being the next day after the grace period expires). The statement has a statement balance due that the borrower must pay by the end of the current grace period to avoid interest charges on the charges made within the current billing cycle (i.e., the billing cycle to which the statement pertains). It is then determined () whether the interest free grace period has expired. If it has not, then no interest is charged () on the statement balance (which may be subject to certain restrictions depending on the type of grace period, if there was an unpaid balance carried forward from a previous billing cycle, or there are certain dollar amount limits for which the grace period days are interest free).","If the grace period has expired, then it is determined () whether the payment was received by the end of the grace period. As another example, some lenders may allow the payment to have been sent by the expiration of the grace period instead of received. If the payment was not received (or sent) by the end of the grace period, then interest may be charged as if there was no grace period. If the payment was received (or sent) by the end of the grace period, then the number of remaining or unused grace period days (if any) is calculated () with respect to the balance paid. Then a system, such as that having one or more components described above with reference to , calculates a number of extra interest free grace period days (or other award) to award the borrower available for use in the next or subsequent billing cycles based on the number of unused grace period days and the statement balance paid. The process may then be repeated for the next billing cycle starting with sending out () a statement at end of the next billing cycle with a new due date based on current grace period for said billing cycle.","An option may be provided to the borrower wherein the borrower may electronically select a different award instead of receiving one or more of the extra interest free grace period days, the different award may comprise, but are not limited to of one or more of the following: a rebate, a reward, points, a coupon, travel miles, free insurance on purchases, credit card payment protection insurance, skipping one or more payments interest free, cash back, reduced interest rate, putting positive information on a credit report of the borrower, putting positive information on an internal credit report or evaluation of the borrower, instantly reducing a balance due within the current billing cycle, and increasing a credit limit of the borrower.","The exact amount of extra grace period days or other award to issue is variable and may be determined by the lender or selectable by the borrower. These amounts may be calculated using a formula implemented on a computing device taking into account the value of the unused grace period days. For example, the value of the unused grace period days may be based on the number of unused grace period days and the statement balance paid by the borrower. The underlying principle being that the borrower could have used those grace period days to borrow the statement balance (interest free) for an extra number of days equal to that portion of the unused grace period, but gave that money to the lender, who then could earn interest on that money instead. Another factor contributing to the value of interest free grace period days in general may include but is not limited to the credit limit of the borrower, since the borrower has a right to carry a balance equal to their credit limit for the full interest free grace period, even though they may choose not no. Described below are some particular examples of how a lender may calculate and award, \u201crollover,\u201d or otherwise give credit for unused grace period days, however, other processes may be used and these examples are not intended to be limited to the particulars disclosed herein.","Referring next to , shown is a flow chart illustrating an example process for issuing credit for unused interest free grace period days by awarding one or more extra interest free grace period days. The processes described below may be implemented in an automated fashion on one or more processors such as those described in , or the like. First, calculate () the number of unused grace period days (if any) during the current billing cycle. Assign this number to variable z, for example. Then calculate () the interest charge that would have been charged over z days had the balance not been paid by the end of the grace period. Assign this to variable c, for example.","Divide c by a predetermined amount f selected by the lender () and also multiply f times r (r being any remainder left in the calculation of extra grace period days from the previous billing cycle). The higher the amount f is, the higher the paid statement balance would have to be in order for the borrower to earn one or more extra grace period days. For example, the lender may value awarded extra grace period days according to the credit limit of the borrower because the borrower may potentially use any awarded extra interest free grace period days as interest free days against a statement amount equal to the credit limit. Thus, the lender may choose to make f equal to the current credit limit of the borrower, for example.","Then assign () the result of the previous division c\/f and multiplication r*f () to the variable d, for example. If the division is not even, then assign the remainder to the variable r, for example. Finally, give () d extra interest free grace period days () to the borrower for the next billing cycle. Once the end of the next billing cycle is reached (), the process may be repeated, staring again with calculating () the number of unused grace period days (if any) during the current billing cycle.","Referring next to , shown is a flow chart illustrating an example process for issuing credit for unused interest free grace periods by awarding an extra grace period day for each original unused interest free grace period day, each extra awarded grace period day being interest free for an amount up to the previous statement balance paid. First, calculate () the number of original (not added) unused grace period days (if any) during the current billing cycle. Assign this number to variable z, for example. Next, calculate () the statement balance amount paid, assign this to variable p for example. Finally, give () z extra grace period days on top of any previously added grace period days to the borrower for their next billing cycle. The z extra grace period days are interest free on the first $p of the borrowers balance (e.g., average daily balance) in the next billing cycle.","The average daily balance may be calculated by summing the daily outstanding balances and dividing this by the number of days covered in the billing cycle to give an average balance for that period. Other ways of calculating balance may also be used with the processes described herein including but not limited to the adjusted balance, the previous balance and the two-cycle average daily balance. With the adjusted balance, the balance at the end of the billing cycle is may be used and with the previous balance, the balance at the start of the previous billing cycle may be used. The two-cycle average daily balance is the sum of the daily balances of the previous two billing cycles.","Once the end of the next billing cycle is reached (), the process may be repeated, starting again with calculating () the number of original (not added) unused grace period days (if any) during the current billing cycle.","Referring next to , shown is a flow chart illustrating an example process for issuing credit for unused interest free grace periods by awarding an extra grace period day for each original (not added) unused interest free grace period day, each extra awarded grace period day being interest free for an amount up to the previous statement balance paid, and also adding to the amounts up to which the previously unused added grace period days are interest free based on the statement balance paid. First, calculate () number of original (not added) unused grace period days (if any) during the current billing cycle. Assign this number to variable z for example. Then calculate the statement balance amount paid and assign this to variable p for example. Give () z extra grace period days on top of any previously added grace period days to the borrower for their next billing cycle that are interest free on the first $p of their balance (e.g., average daily balance) in the next billing cycle.","Then calculate the total dollar amount of the balances against which the unused grace period days added from previous cycles could have been used. Assign this amount to variable h, for example. Assign () p times the number of the unused grace period days added from previous cycles to the variable j, for example. Multiply the lesser of h and j times 2 and add to h. Assign the result to the variable k. Divide () k by the number of unused grace period days added from previous cycles and assign this to variable s, for example. Assign () the unused grace period days added from previous cycles to be interest free on the first $s of the borrower's balance (e.g., average daily balance) in the next billing cycle (up to the borrower's credit limit amount).","Then determine () whether s is greater than the borrower's credit limit amount. If s is not greater than the borrower's credit limit amount, then once the end of the next billing cycle is reached (), the process may be repeated for the next billing cycle, starting again with calculating () the number of original (not added) unused grace period days (if any) during the next billing cycle. If s is greater than the borrower's credit limit amount, then assign () the amount over which the credit limit is exceeded by s to the variable g, for example. Then give another extra grace period day that is interest free on the first $g of the borrower's balance (e.g., average daily balance) in the next billing cycle. Once the end of the next billing cycle is reached (), the process may be repeated for the next billing cycle, starting again with calculating () the number of original (not added) unused grace period days (if any) during the next billing cycle.","Using the process described above regarding  as an example, say a borrower has a credit limit of $5000 and a 25 day interest free grace period. During their first billing cycle the borrower paid their entire statement balance of $3000 6 days before their grace period ended and thus had 6 unused grace period days at the end of their billing cycle. They are then awarded 6 extra grace period days for use in subsequent billing cycles that are interest free up to $3000 (their paid statement balance) for each extra awarded day. Say the next billing cycle they paid their entire statement balance of $1000 10 days after their grace period started, thus they have 15 days of unused original (not added) grace period days and 6 days after that of unused added grace period days that were interest free up to $3000 each day. Thus, they will be awarded 15 extra grace period days for use in subsequent billing cycles that are interest free up to $1000 for each extra awarded day.","Next the total dollar amount is calculated of the balances against which the unused grace period days added from previous cycles could have been used. This is 6 days at $3000 each (added from the previous billing cycle). So this total is $18,000. Next we multiply the current statement balance paid (p) times the number of the unused grace period days added from previous cycles. since 6 days were added during the previous cycle, this is 6 times $1000, or $6000. Next the lesser of $18,000 and $6000 is multiplied times 2 (resulting in $12,000) to give credit for those unused added grace period days. The lesser of the two is chosen because the borrower could not have used those 6 extra added days as interest free days for an amount more than their current statement balance actually is.","This $12,000 is then added to the previously calculated total dollar amount ($18,000) of the balances for which the unused grace period days added from previous were interest free. This sum is assigned to variable k. Thus, the variable k is now equal to $30,000 ($12,000+$18,000), and then instead of awarding extra grace period days, this $30,000 is distributed evenly over the unused grace period days that were awarded from previous cycles, so each awarded unused grace period day from previous billing cycles will be interest free for up to the same greater amount. This results in those 6 unused grace period days awarded from the previous billing cycle now, instead of $3000, being interest free on the first $5000 (.i.e. $30,000 divided by 6) of the borrower's statement balance for the next billing cycle. $5000 just happens to be the borrower's credit limit, but if the amount calculated happened to be above the credit limit (say $6000), then another extra grace period day would also be awarded that is interest free on the first $1,000 of the borrower's statement balance for the next billing cycle. The entire process may then be repeated for subsequent billing cycles.","It is noted that the foregoing examples have been provided merely for the purposes of explanation and are in no way to be construed as limiting of the present invention.
