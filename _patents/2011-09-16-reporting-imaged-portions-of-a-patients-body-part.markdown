title: Reporting imaged portions of a patient's body part
abstract: Described embodiments include a system, method, and computer program product. In a described system, a receiver circuit receives at least two reference images of a patient body part. Each reference image includes a respective landmark subsurface feature of the patient body part, and each imaged landmark subsurface feature has a respective spatial relationship to a respective region of a surface of the patient body part imaged during a medical examination. A feature matching circuit determines a correspondence between (x) each atlas landmark subsurface feature of the patient body part included in a landmark subsurface feature atlas and (y) each respective imaged landmark subsurface feature. A reporting circuit generates informational data reporting a depiction of an area of the surface of the patient body part by at least two adjacent imaged regions of the surface of the patient body part. A communication circuit outputs the informational data.

Stephen G. Kunin, -, USPTO Official Gazette Mar. 18, 2003. The present Applicant Entity (hereinafter \u201cApplicant\u201d) has provided above a specific reference to the application(s) from which priority is being claimed as recited by statute. Applicant understands that the statute is unambiguous in its specific reference language and does not require either a serial number or any characterization, such as \u201ccontinuation\u201d or \u201ccontinuation-in-part,\u201d for claiming priority to U.S. patent applications. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Applicant understands that the USPTO's computer programs have certain data entry requirements, and hence Applicant is designating the present application as a continuation-in-part of its parent applications as set forth above, but expressly points out that such designations are not to be construed in any way as any type of commentary or admission as to whether or not the present application contains any new matter in addition to the matter of its parent application(s).","All subject matter of the Related Applications and of any and all parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, etc. applications of the Related Applications is incorporated herein by reference to the extent such subject matter is not inconsistent herewith.","For example and without limitation, an embodiment of the subject matter described herein includes a system. For example, a health care provider may acquire images of several different regions of a surface of a cavity or lumen of a patient body part. For example, an image acquisition device, such as a camera mounted on operative distal end portion of an endoscope, may be moved linearly or randomly about the individual patient body part and acquire images during the course of the examination or treatment. For example, the health care provider may want to know whether they acquired images of an entire surface area of the patient body part during the course of the examination or treatment procedure. For example, the health care provider may want to know whether they acquired images of a preselected or predetermined portion of an area of the surface of the patient body part during the course of the examination or treatment procedure. For example, the health care provider may want to know an approximate location of any areas of the surface of the cavity or lumen of the patient body part that are not depicted by the images acquired during the course of the examination or treatment procedure.","In this embodiment, a system includes a receiver circuit configured to receive at least two reference images of a patient body part. Each reference image of the at least two reference images includes a respective landmark subsurface feature of the patient body part (hereafter \u201cimaged landmark subsurface feature\u201d). Each imaged landmark subsurface feature has a respective spatial relationship to a respective region of a surface of the patient body part imaged during a medical examination (hereafter \u201cimaged region\u201d). For example, a landmark subsurface feature may include a physical structure, nerve, void, border, component, tissue, structural feature, or density variation of the body part. In an embodiment, the physical structure may include a duct, a bend or curve in a tubular structure, or an organ such as a colon. For example, the reference image may be captured by a fluoroscope while an endoscope is moving through and acquiring images of the cavity or lumen of the patient body part.","In this embodiment, the system includes a feature matching circuit configured to determine a correspondence between (x) each atlas landmark subsurface feature of the patient body part of at least two atlas landmark subsurface features of the patient body part included in a landmark subsurface feature atlas and each respective imaged landmark subsurface feature of the patient body part included in the at least two reference images. For example, the determination may be performed by determining a correspondence of the imaged landmark subsurface features to the atlas landmark subsurface features, or vice versa. For example, the atlas may include some but not all of the landmark subsurface features found in a region or zone of the patient body part or the atlas may correspond to a particular length, portion, or area of the cavity or lumen of the patient body part. For example, the feature matching circuit may be configured to iteratively determine the correspondence. For example, the system may treat a determined correspondence between an atlas landmark subsurface feature and an imaged landmark subsurface feature as an indication that they are the same landmark (which may be indicated by a \u201c1\u201d). The system infers that the atlas landmark subsurface feature has a spatial relationship with the respective imaged region. For example, the system may treat an absence of a determined correspondence between an atlas landmark subsurface feature and an imaged landmark subsurface feature as an indication that they are the not the same landmark (which may be indicated by a \u201c0\u201d). In an absence of a determined correspondence, the system infers that the atlas landmark subsurface feature has no known spatial relationship with the respective imaged region. For example, in an embodiment, the system saves the determined correspondences [1 or 0] for each respective atlas landmark subsurface feature of the at least two atlas landmark subsurface features.","In this embodiment, the system includes a reporting circuit configured to generate informational data reporting a depiction of an area of the surface of the patient body part by at least two adjacent imaged regions of the surface of the patient body part. The informational data is at least partially based on the determined correspondence. In an alternative, the report circuit is configured to generate informational data reporting a non-depiction of an area of the surface of the patient body part by at least one imaged region. For example, if a particular atlas subsurface feature does not have at least one \u201c1\u201d notation (i.e., all \u201c0\u201d), the system infers that a region of the surface of the patient part having a spatial relationship with the particular atlas landmark subsurface feature was not imaged.","In this embodiment, the system includes communication circuit configured to output the informational data. For example, the system may output the informational data in a format usable in displaying to the health care provider a human-perceivable indication of the determined correspondence for at least one atlas landmark subsurface feature of the landmark subsurface feature atlas. The determined correspondence [1 or 0] for an atlas landmark subsurface feature is expected to be useful to the health care provider in deciding whether they have completely imaged the entire surface of the patient body.","The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. In addition to the illustrative aspects, embodiments, and features described above, further aspects, embodiments, and features will become apparent by reference to the drawings and the following detailed description.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof.

In an embodiment, the system may include the processor . In an embodiment, the system may include the computer storage device . In an embodiment, the system may include the extraction engine .","In an embodiment, the system  includes a comparative-analysis circuit (not shown) configured to detect a change in the region of interest of the mammalian body part at least partially based on the coregistered first depiction of the region of interest and second depiction of the region. For example, the comparative-analysis circuit (not shown) may be configured to detect a change in the region of interest of the mammalian body part using a pattern recognition methodology, or an artificial intelligence methodology. For example, the detected change may include a change in one or more blood vessels in the region of interest, such as number of blood vessels, size of one or more blood vessels, or a pattern formed by blood vessels. In an example, a detected change may include a new pattern of blood vessels, which may indicate a tumor disease state in the region of interest. Such \u201cneo-angiogenesis\u201d can be apparent even at the microscopic level quite early on. In another example, a detected change in a presence of capillary buds or other angiogenesis may indicate inflammation in the region of interest. In a further example, a detected change may include a detected change in a size, color, or border of a lesion in the region of interest. In an example, a detected change may include a change in a pattern of surface topology, which could indicate tumor, polyps, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerations, or the like. In an embodiment, the comparative-analysis circuit may be configured to compare the coregistered first depiction of the region of interest and second depiction of the region of interest and detect a change in the region of interest over time. This is expected to be of assistance to health care providers in diagnosis and treatment of disease.","For example, in use, a change in the region of interest detected by the comparative-analysis circuit may include a change in GI tract (stomach, intestine, colon, rectum, etc.), in lungs, or in blood vessels. The first depiction of the region of interest and the second depiction of the region of interest may be acquired during endoscopic examination the (using capsule endoscopy and traditional colonoscopy) of the body part. The first depiction of the region of interest and the second depiction of the region of interest may be used in comparing images of the same region at two different times to look for a change in disease state or condition and report change, or may be used reporting a \u201cquestionable site\u201d that should be looked at in further detail or providing information on the actual change. For example, in use, a change in the region of interest detected by the comparative-analysis circuit may include a change between in an image taken of a region or interest at one time, e.g. in a state\/condition of no apparent disease, then an image taken of a region or interest taken at a second time, e.g. in a follow-up colonoscopy, comparing a second image of the region and determining the change in state\/condition with no prior knowledge of the state\/condition. The comparison could include a change in a pattern. Information from comparisons can be added to provide more specificity and sensitivity. For example, if there is a change in blood vessels, the information may include a look at topology, or add results of the comparison to a list or report. Another example would be the absence of a disease state, e.g. after treatment with a therapeutic, especially an anti-angiogenic, the tumor or aberrant vascularization will be lessened and even absent. One example would be that a detected new pattern of blood vessels could indicate the onset of a tumor disease state. Such \u201cneo-angiogenesis\u201d may be apparent even at the microscopic level quite early on. Similarly, a detected presence of capillary buds or other angiogenesis may indicate onset of inflammation. Detected changes in patterns of surface topology may indicate tumor, polyps, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerations. For example, in use, a detected change in the region of interest by the comparative-analysis circuit may be used for example in people at risk for certain diseases, in patients to follow progression of a disease state, in patients to assess therapeutic response, post-surgery or other intervention to monitor for relapse. For example, a change in the region of interest detected by the comparative-analysis circuit may include a change in a pattern in a portion of a larger field, where the larger field is used to align the imager.","Further, the system  may include a decision circuit (not shown) operable to recommend or initiate acquisition of additional depictions of the region of interest, acquisition of a higher resolution depiction of the region of interest, acquisition of a depiction of the region of interest at a different wavelength or modality, or acquisition of an enhanced depiction of the region of interest, such with a contrast agent.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0319","num":"0318"},"figref":["FIG. 51","FIG. 49","FIG. 49"],"b":["2400","2410","2328","2420","235"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0320","num":"0319"},"figref":["FIG. 52","FIG. 51"],"b":["2400","2430","2430","2420","2421"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0321","num":"0320"},"figref":["FIG. 53","FIG. 51"],"b":["2400","2440","2400","2441","2442","2443","2444","2445","2441","2442","2443","2444","2445"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0322","num":"0321"},"figref":"FIG. 54","b":["2500","2510","2520"]},"In an embodiment, the computer-readable media  includes a tangible computer-readable media .

For example, if a negative correspondence {all=\u201c0\u201d} for two proximate detected peripheral edge features is found with any other detected peripheral edge feature of the remaining medical images there is no edge overlap and a possible non-imaged region exists.","In an embodiment, the system includes a filter circuit configured to receive a medical image determined by the edge overlap analysis circuit to have a negative correspondence (an absence of an edge overlap). The filter circuit is also configured to determine that the imaged region of the surface of the cavity or lumen of the patient body part included in the received medical image includes an end-region of the cavity or lumen proximate to a terminus of the surface of the cavity or lumen of the patient body part. The filter circuit is also configured to remove the medical image from the at least two medical images (hereafter \u201cfiltered at least two medical images\u201d).","All references cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety or to the extent their subject matter is not otherwise inconsistent herewith.","In some embodiments, \u201cconfigured\u201d includes at least one of designed, set up, shaped, implemented, constructed, or adapted for at least one of a particular purpose, application, or function.","It will be understood that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims, are generally intended as \u201copen\u201d terms. For example, the term \u201cincluding\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincluding but not limited to.\u201d For example, the term \u201chaving\u201d should be interpreted as \u201chaving at least.\u201d For example, the term \u201chas\u201d should be interpreted as \u201chaving at least.\u201d For example, the term \u201cincludes\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincludes but is not limited to,\u201d etc. It will be further understood that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of introductory phrases such as \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca receiver\u201d should typically be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one receiver\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, it will be recognized that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201cat least two chambers,\u201d or \u201ca plurality of chambers,\u201d without other modifiers, typically means at least two chambers).","In those instances where a phrase such as \u201cat least one of A, B, and C,\u201d \u201cat least one of A, B, or C,\u201d or \u201can [item] selected from the group consisting of A, B, and C,\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended to be disjunctive (e.g., any of these phrases would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, or A, B, and C together, and may further include more than one of A, B, or C, such as A, A, and C together, A, B, B, C, and Ctogether, or Band Btogether). It will be further understood that virtually any disjunctive word or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase \u201cA or B\u201d will be understood to include the possibilities of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d or \u201cA and B.\u201d","The herein described aspects depict different components contained within, or connected with, different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely examples, and that in fact many other architectures can be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively \u201cassociated\u201d such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as \u201cassociated with\u201d each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise, any two components so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably connected,\u201d or \u201coperably coupled,\u201d to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably couplable\u201d to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable or physically interacting components or wirelessly interactable or wirelessly interacting components.","With respect to the appended claims the recited operations therein may generally be performed in any order. Also, although various operational flows are presented in a sequence(s), it should be understood that the various operations may be performed in other orders than those which are illustrated, or may be performed concurrently. Examples of such alternate orderings may include overlapping, interleaved, interrupted, reordered, incremental, preparatory, supplemental, simultaneous, reverse, or other variant orderings, unless context dictates otherwise. Use of \u201cStart,\u201d \u201cEnd,\u201d \u201cStop,\u201d or the like blocks in the block diagrams is not intended to indicate a limitation on the beginning or end of any operations or functions in the diagram. Such flowcharts or diagrams may be incorporated into other flowcharts or diagrams where additional functions are performed before or after the functions shown in the diagrams of this application. Furthermore, terms like \u201cresponsive to,\u201d \u201crelated to,\u201d or other past-tense adjectives are generally not intended to exclude such variants, unless context dictates otherwise.","While various aspects and embodiments have been disclosed herein, other aspects and embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The various aspects and embodiments disclosed herein are for purposes of illustration and are not intended to be limiting, with the true scope and spirit being indicated by the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE
