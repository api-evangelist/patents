title: Telephony and applications communication in a non-mobile telephone system
abstract: Technology is described for a non-mobile telephone system which in addition to processing voice signal data and performing telephone functions, can execute applications transferring data responsive to user input received through a graphical user interface of the telephone system. The non-mobile telephone includes a telephony processing system for performing telephone functions, and an applications processing system for executing applications. The two processing systems communicate using a communication protocol between them which is independent of a telecommunication protocol used for voice signal data processed by the telephony processing system.

No. 61\/369,754, entitled \u201cTelephony and Applications Communication in a Non-Mobile Telephone System\u201d filed Aug. 1, 2010; 61\/368,631 entitled \u201cTransferring Data Between a Mobile Communication Device, a Non-Mobile Telephone System and a General Purpose Computer System,\u201d filed Jul. 28, 2010; 61\/370,803, entitled \u201cPairing and Sharing Between a Non-Mobile Telephone System and a Computer System\u201d filed Aug. 4, 2010; and 61\/371,157, entitled \u201cCall Features in a Non-Mobile Telephone System\u201d filed Aug. 5, 2010, all of which are expressly incorporated by reference herein.","This invention relates generally to telecommunication systems, and more specifically to non-mobile telephone systems.","Mobile smartphones have many applications for the personal use of the user on the device itself. They have convenient small touchscreens but, keyboards can be quite small for entry of input with human fingers. Shortcuts in language which have developed due to the small keyboards on mobile communication devices may not be understood or appropriate in a business environment. These factors make the mobile telephone non-ideal for many business environments.","Non-mobile telephones, for example desktop or office phones, are still preferred by many in the office environment. For example, they have better speaker phone and sound quality.","However, the desktop or non-mobile telephone is still typically seen as a device solely for speaking to others remotely and is not viewed as an integral part of a company's computer network. The lack of integration between non-mobile telephones and computer networks may be caused by the various telecommunication protocols which carry calls.","Technology is presented for a non-mobile telephone system comprising a telephony processing system for processing telephone functions and an applications processing system for executing applications for the non-mobile telephone system. The two processing systems communicate with each other using a communication protocol which is independent of any particular telecommunication protocol used for voice signal data processed by the telephony processing system.","In one embodiment, the non-mobile telephone system comprises a graphical user interface which provides visual displays to assist a user in processing telephone calls. In one example, using the independent communication protocol, the applications processing system communicates messages to the telephony processing system for executing telephone functions regardless of protocol for the voice signal data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","102"]},"Furthermore, in some examples, a non-mobile telephone system can receive its voice signal data over a wired connection such as a Plain Old Telephone System (POTS) line or a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) line connection and process the voice signal data in these protocols. For example, VoIP data representing voice signal data may connect to the Internet via a wired Ethernet connection port to the non-mobile telephone system.","In an embodiment, non-mobile telephone systems receive and process voice signal data in a wireless communication protocol such as a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) or other cellular based communications protocols. Furthermore, non-mobile telephone systems for business use typically are connected to a type of private business exchange (PBX), such as a traditional PBX or an Internet Protocol PBX (IP PBX) or a hosted or virtual IP PBX for VoIP. Fixed location telephones using a mobile cellular communication protocol like GSM can also be linked to a type of PBX (see ).","In an embodiment as shown in , a non-mobile telephone system  comprises a handset  and a graphical user interface . As shown, user interface  includes a touchscreen. In an embodiment, the touchscreen is a color touchscreen of 800\u00d7600 16 bit color resolution. In the embodiment, the touchscreen is also eight inches across making it easy to manipulate with fingers or a handheld pointing device such as a pen for the touchscreen. In other embodiments, the telephone system can have an interface (not shown) for a pointing device such as a mouse and an interface (not shown) for a keyboard. In yet another embodiment where the non-mobile telephone system is paired with a general purpose computer system, pairing software allows a user to use a computer keyboard and mouse to update data for non-mobile telephone system .","Additionally, non-mobile telephone system  includes a \u201cdo not disturb\u201d button  and an speaker phone button . Moreover, non-mobile telephone system  can use a Power over Ethernet or standard power adapter.","In an embodiment as shown in , user interface  displays a side menu  including various feature selectors on the touchscreen display area of user interface  that a user can select with his finger or other pointing device. Examples of the feature selectors include a \u201cCall \u201cLog,\u201d a keypad for typing in numbers, a \u201cContacts\u201d selector for accessing contact information for various people or businesses, a \u201cMessages\u201d selector for selecting voicemail and text messages, a \u201cCalendar\u201d selector, a \u201cTo Do\u201d list selector and an \u201cApplications\u201d selector for accessing call features and other services provided by the non-mobile telephone system. Currently displayed is calendar information as illustrated by the example \u201cMtg with Tony, discussing . . . \u201d at 10:00 A.M.","Moving on to the next figure,  illustrates another view of the embodiment of a non-mobile telephone system  with a user interface  illustrating a call log feature display . In this call log display , the caller's information including an identifier  such as a name or number which is displayed along with an indicator of from which number or type of telephone, (e.g. mobile or non-mobile ) the call was made. Additionally, a message indicator  is displayed for those calls for which a voicemail message was left. In some instances, the message may be a text message produced by speech to text software.

For example, the symbol  next to \u201cXYZ\u201d indicates a voicemail message was left at the telephone number associated with this non-mobile telephone system. The \u201cTXT\u201d symbol next to \u201cJack Archer\u201d indicates a text message for him. The symbol  which looks like a cellular phone next to \u201cMike Armann\u201d indicates a voice or text message on the user's mobile telephone in communication with this non-mobile telephone system (further described below). The \u201cIM\u201d symbol next to \u201cLynda Barrett\u201d indicates an instant messaging message from messaging software which can be executing on a paired computer system (further described below).","It should be understood by one having ordinary skill in the art that instant messaging is just an example and that the present invention should not be limited thereto.
