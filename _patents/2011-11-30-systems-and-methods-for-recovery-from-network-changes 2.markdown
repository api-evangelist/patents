{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a U.S. National Stage of International Application No. PCT\/US2011\/062731, titled \u201cSYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR RECOVERY FROM NETWORK CHANGES,\u201d filed on Nov. 30, 2011, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/418,124, titled \u201cSwitching, RBridge, and ARP\/ND Improvements,\u201d filed on Nov. 30, 2010, which international application and provisional application are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties its entirety.","I. Computer Networks","In a computer network, a group of computers and\/or other devices communicate with each other via one or more communication links. One example of a network includes a pair of end stations each having a network interface, where the interfaces are connected to each other via a point-to-point network link. Another example of a network is shown in  and includes multiple computers A- each having one or more network interfaces. Each interface is connected to one or more other interfaces either directly or via one or more of switches A-D. For instance, as shown in , station A may be connected to station B via switch B, and station H may be connected to station I via a shared link to switch D. Yet another example of a network is the Internet, which is a network having many interconnected subnetworks.","Data to be transmitted, such as a file, is often divided into smaller units of data to be transmitted separately over one or more networks and re-assembled at a receiving computer. Each such unit of data is commonly called a \u201cframe,\u201d although it should be appreciated that data can be divided into frames in any suitable way, for example, according to any suitable communication protocol.","Any suitable communication link may be used to communicate data frames between network interfaces. For example, a link may be wired (e.g., electrical or optical) or wireless (e.g., radio, microwave, or infrared). A link may also be virtual (i.e., simulated).","Many network communication protocols have been developed over the years. A common model is the layered networking model, where communication functions are grouped into logical layers. For example, in an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, there are seven layers arranged from top to bottom, each layer providing services to layers above and receiving services from layers below. For instance, Layer 2 (also known as the Data Link Layer) receives data transmission and reception services from Layer 1 (also known as the Physical Layer), and provides physical addressing services to Layer 3 (also known as the Network Layer).","Concepts of communications protocols layers, such as Layer 3 and Layer 2 of an OSI model, are explained in ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union\u2014Telecommunications Standardization Sector) Recommendation X.200, \u201cInformation Technology\u2014Open Systems Interconnection\u2014Basic Reference Model: The Basic Model,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference.","II. Local Area Networks","In a local area network (also referred to as a LAN or local network), frames may be delivered after transiting the network with source and destination Layer 2 addresses, or interface source and destination addresses, associated with the frames unchanged or changed only to a form easily convertible to the original Layer 2 addresses. Examples of such local networks include, but are not limited to, bridged LANs and RBridged campuses.","It should be appreciated that local networks need not be \u201clocal\u201d in a geographical sense. A local network may include components located in a geographical area of any suitable size (e.g., including multiple cities, states, and\/or countries), and may even include components in outer space.","III. Virtual LANs","A local network may be subdivided into multiple overlaid logical networks called Virtual LANs or VLANs. A local network divided into VLANs may have the same physical structure as if not so divided. However, each data frame may, in some fashion, be labeled or categorized to indicate a VLAN to which the data frame belongs. Furthermore, a network interface may, in some fashion, be restricted or categorized in some suitable manner, so that switches may only send frames of certain labeling or categorization through interfaces with corresponding categorization. For example, certain network interfaces may be associated a particular type of traffic associated with a subset of VLANs, such as input traffic or output traffic, so that only that type of traffic associated with that subset of VLANs is sent through the interfaces.","In a local network supporting such VLANs, there may be end stations or switches that are unaware of VLANs and that receive and transmit unlabeled frames on one or more network interfaces of the end stations or switches. Such an unlabeled frame may be classified by an interface of the first VLAN-aware switch at which the frame arrives, to indicate a VLAN to which the frame belongs. The classification may be based on one or more values of one or more fields within the frame. Moreover, there may be VLAN-aware end stations that receive and transmit VLAN-labeled frames on one or more network interfaces, and\/or classify unlabeled frames received on one or more interfaces as being in one or more specific VLANs.","A VLAN may include nested sub-VLANs and, likewise, may be enclosed by other higher-level VLANs. Thus, a \u201cnetwork\u201d in the present disclosure may refer to any physical or virtual network, which may or may not include one or more subnetworks, and may or may not be included in one or more other networks as a subnetwork.","Systems, methods and apparatus are provided for recovery from network changes.","In some embodiments, a method is provided for use by at least one first network device operating in a network, the network comprising at least one second network device having a designated role according to at least one communication protocol, the method comprising acts of: (a) detecting a change relating to the at least one second network device; (b) determining whether the change relating to the at least one second network device is of a type among one or more selected types of changes; and (c) determining whether to inhibit operation of the at least one first network device based at least in part on a result of the act (b).","In some further embodiments, an apparatus is provided, comprising at least one first network device configured to operate in a network, the network comprising at least one second network device having a designated role according to at least one communication protocol, the at least one network device further configured to perform acts of: (a) detecting a change relating to the at least one second network device; (b) determining whether the change relating to the at least one second network device is of a type among one or more selected types of changes; and (c) determining whether to inhibit operation of the at least one first network device based at least in part on a result of the act (b).","It should be appreciated that all combinations of the foregoing concepts and additional concepts discussed in greater detail below (provided such concepts are not mutually inconsistent) are contemplated as being part of the inventive subject matter disclosed herein. In particular, all combinations of claimed subject matter appearing at the end of this disclosure are contemplated as being part of the inventive subject matter disclosed herein.","Some conventional bridging standards have been based on the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). Despite improvements over the years, such as RSTP (Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol) (e.g., as incorporated in Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.1D) and MSTP (Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol) (e.g., as incorporated in IEEE 802.1Q), almost all bridging standards continue to be fundamentally based on the insights of STP, which are now over a quarter of a century old.","Conventional spanning tree works by electing a root bridge based on priority and then building a tree from that root. The priority for a bridge may include a configured priority as a most significant part of the priority and a 48-bit Media Access Control (MAC) address associated with the bridge as a less significant part of the priority.","Without a spanning tree, traffic introduced into an illustrative network shown in  may cycle endlessly around rings formed by Bridges , , and  and by Bridges , , and . STP operates by turning off ports thereby reducing network connectivity to a loop-free tree structure, for example, as shown in . In this example shown, the port at the Bridge  end of the Bridge - link has been disabled and the Bridge  end of the Bridge - link has been disabled. (MSTP allows several different superimposed trees, each handling a different subset of traffic, but this restriction applies to each of them.)","The disabling of ports in conventional STP may have the disadvantage of wasting resources. For instance, spanning tree may reduce throughput by congesting traffic onto the links that remain connected as part of the tree selected by the STP. Further, spanning tree may increase the latency (i.e., time delay) through a network for most traffic because that traffic may not take the fastest or most direct route through the network, but is forced to follow a path within the tree selected by the STP, which may involves more hops. For instance, in the example shown in , traffic from an end station attached to Bridge  to an end station attached to any of Bridges  through  is forced, by spanning tree, to take an extra hop through Bridge .","Varieties of conventional STP may have other disadvantages, such as slow convergence when there are changes in network components (e.g., the addition, repair, removal or failure of bridges and\/or links or the merger of two spanning tree networks). For example, the original STP standard defaults to delays of 30 seconds to respond to network changes. Even Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol configured for minimum delays may block traffic for 4 seconds for certain network failures. Such delays may be damaging for applications that require rapid failover, such as real time voice transmission or process control. For further discussion on some of the above points, see Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request For Comment (RFC) 5556 (\u201cTransparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Problem and Applicability Statement\u201d).","RBridges, or Routing Bridges, implement the IETF TRILL protocols. The TRILL base specification includes the following IETF RFCs, each of which is incorporated herein by reference:","RFC 6325 (\u201cRouting Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification\u201d);","RFC 6326 (\u201cTransparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Use of IS-IS\u201d);","RFC 6327 (\u201cRouting Bridges (RBridges): Adjacency\u201d); and","RFC 6439 (\u201cRouting Bridges (RBridges): Appointed Forwarders\u201d).","TRILL uses link state routing techniques to route on MAC addresses and encapsulate frames with a header including a hop count limit. For example, an implementation of TRILL may be based on the link state routing protocol IS-IS, as described in International Organization for Standardization (ISO) ISO\/IEC 10589:2002 (\u201cIntermediate System to Intermediate System routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the Protocol for providing the Connectionless-mode Network Service (ISO 8473)\u201d).","An area of interconnected physical links and bridges, for example, including at least one bridge and bounded by one or more end stations, may be called a \u201cbridged LAN.\u201d Similarly, an area of interconnected links, bridges, and RBridges, for example, including at least one RBridge and bounded by one or more end stations, may be called an \u201cRBridge campus.\u201d To bridges, an RBridge may appear to be an end station, while, to end stations, including Internet Protocol (IP) routers, RBridges may be as transparent as bridges are. For RBridge purposes, the term \u201clink\u201d may include a bridged LAN.","In some implementations, RBridges may not disable ports to limit all traffic to a spanning tree as does the spanning tree protocol. Instead, RBridges may use the Appointed Forwarder mechanism described in RFC 6439, which is referenced above, to control which RBridge ports will accept or transmit frame directly from or to end stations. Under some circumstances, RBridges may appoint only one RBridge on each link to handle native frames in each VLAN. A native frame is a data frame that is not encapsulated as TRILL Data frame and is received directly from or sent directly to an end station. Furthermore, receipt and transmission of TRILL data and TRILL control frames may not be affected by whether a port is or is not an Appointed Forwarder. However, under some circumstances, an RBridge port that is designated as an Appointed Forwarder may, for loop safety, be temporarily \u201cinhibited\u201d from handing native frames, as explained in RFC 6439.","In some embodiments, one or more RBridge ports may be connected to a link comprising an IEEE 802.1 bridged LAN as specified in the following IEEE standards that are incorporated herein by reference:","IEEE Std 802.1D-2004 (\u201cMedia Access Control (MAC) Bridges\u201d); and","IEEE Std 802.1Q-2011 (\u201cMedia Access Control (MAC) Bridges and Virtual Bridge Local Area Networks\u201d).","In some embodiments, a \u201croot bridge\u201d may be a root bridge established according to Common Internal Spanning Tree (CIST) in a bridged LAN. In this case, some version of the spanning tree protocol may be running in the bridges in that bridged LAN. The spanning tree protocol works through the exchange of BPDU (Bridge Protocol Data Unit) messages. RBridges may receive BPDU messages from immediate neighbor bridges. Each BPDU message may include information as to what the sending bridge detects as the root bridge of the spanning tree in use within the bridged LAN link. This information may include two portions, a priority portion and a bridge identifier portion. The bridge identifier may be unique for each bridge in the bridged LAN. The spanning tree root bridge within a bridged LAN link may be selected as a bridge with a highest priority portion with ties in priority broken by comparison of bridge identifiers. In some embodiments, simultaneous ties in both the priority portion and the bridge identifier portion may be broken using a port identifier.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"The Protocol Version and Flags fields may take on a variety of values. The BPDU type may be zero to indicate a Configuration BPDU containing a Root Bridge Information field. The Root Bridge Information field may include the identification and configurable priority of a root bridge. The Source Bridge Information field may include this same information for the bridge transmitting the BPDU. If the transmitting bridge is the root bridge, then the Root Bridge Information and the Source Bridge Information may be identical. The Root Path Cost field may also take on a variety of values, for example, to indicate the sending bridge's belief as to the cost of the spanning tree path to the root bridge (e.g., zero if the sending bridge believes itself to be the root bridge). This cost may be estimated as an accumulated sum over links traversed on the spanning tree path from the bridge sending the BPDU to the root bridge of, for each such link, the integer part of the quotient of twenty trillion (20,000,000,000,000) divided by the speed of the link in bits per second. In this manner, faster links may be estimated as having lower cost.","The Port Identification field may include a value unique for each port of the switch transmitting the BPDU. The additional fields may take on a variety of values, and the presence of one or more of these additional fields may be dependent on the version of the Configuration BPDU.","If there is a change in a bridged LAN, such as that bridged LAN becoming connected to and merging with another bridged LAN (where this second bridged LAN could be as small as a single bridge), or a failure of a bridge or a connection within the bridged LAN, a spanning tree within the bridged LAN may need to reconfigure. This reconfiguration may lead to a sudden appearance of new connectivity. For example, if two bridged LANs merge, two RBridges, one connected to each of these previously separate bridged LANs, may become connected where previously these RBridges were not connected. Furthermore, while the spanning tree is reconfiguring within this combined bridged LAN, TRILL control messages may be temporarily blocked by the spanning tree protocol, making it harder for the attached RBridges to detect each other and thus detect any changes in connectivity. These control messages may include the so-called \u201cHello\u201d messages whereby RBridges find their neighbor RBridges and determine local connectivity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"The information between the header and trailer may start with one or more IS-IS Hello fields that may in turn begin with one or more fields for one or more IS-IS PDUs (Protocol Data Units). The PDU fields may in turn start with a one byte Intradomain Routing Protocol Discriminator which is a byte of value 0x83. For a TRILL Hello message according to the current TRILL standard, the PDU Type field is 15 to indicate a Level 1 IS-IS Hello PDU but future extensions to TRILL may use PDU Type 16 for a Level 2 IS-IS Hello PDU. It should be appreciated that various techniques described herein are not limited any particular PDU Type value, as other values may also be suitable. Finally, the Source ID field may identify the RBridge sending the Hello message and indicate connectivity from that RBridge to the receiving RBridge, and the TLVs area may include a variety of information encoded in a TLV (Type, Length, Value) format.","As discussed above, some network changes may lead to sudden, undetected appearance of connectivity. The inventor has recognized and appreciated that such undetected connectivity may result in frames looping in the network. For instance, if there are two or more RBridge ports that are Appointed Forwarders on a link for the same VLAN, then a native frame sent onto the link by one such port may be picked up by a second such port, encapsulated into a TRILL data frame in which form the native frame may be sent back through the campus to the first port. The first port may then undo the encapsulation to change the encapsulated frame back to a native frame and again sends the native frame on the link, thereby producing a loop. Such loops may lead to links becoming saturated with looping traffic, which may in turn lead to spreading congestion and conditions sometimes referred to as a \u201cnetwork melt-down.\u201d","In some implementations, the IETF RBridge base protocol mitigates the risk of looping by inhibiting an RBridge port that detects a change in a spanning tree root bridge. Such inhibition may be for a configurable period of time, for example, between zero and 30 seconds, with a default of 30 seconds.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","605","610","615","605","620"]},"In some embodiments, an RBridge port while \u201cinhibited\u201d may ignore any native frames the port receives. Alternatively, or additionally, the port may discard any native frames that would have been sent on that port. This may be done even if those frames are in a VLAN for which the RBridge is an appointed forwarder. In some further embodiments, inhibition may have no effect on the handling of TRILL data or control frames. However, it should be appreciated that an RBridge port may be inhibited in any suitable, as aspects of the present disclosure are not limited in this respect.","The inventor has recognized and appreciated that, while such multiple-second long inhibitions in the handling of native frames may improve loop safety, it may be undesirable not to provide native frame service to end stations for such a lengthy period of time. The inventor has further recognized and appreciated that some types of changes in root bridge information may not warrant RBridge port inhibition. For instance, changes to lower overall priority Root Bridge Information, or changes just in the priority portion of the Root Bridge Information field and not in the bridge identifier portion of the Root Bridge Information field may suggest that only a simple change has occurred in the attached bridged LAN. Thus, port inhibition may be relatively safe in such circumstances. In addition, the inhibition of a port due to an observed root bridge change may be removed before the time-out period expires in certain low-risk scenarios. For instance, the inhibition may be removed early, when the RBridge has established connectivity through the port observing an root bridge change to all RBridges in the RBridge's link-state database that report seeing either the old root bridge or the new root bridge on at least one port.","Following below are more detailed descriptions of various concepts related to, and embodiments of, inventive systems, methods and apparatus for recovery from network changes. It should be appreciated that various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways, as the disclosed concepts are not limited to any particular manner of implementation. For instance, the present disclosure is not limited to the particular arrangements of components shown in the various figures, as other arrangements may also be suitable. Such examples of specific implementations and applications are provided solely for illustrative purposes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"In this example, a BPDU message is received on an RBridge port at step . At step , the Root Bridge Information field in the BPDU is compared to that in a previously received BPDU on that port. If no change is detected, then the process proceeds to step  and the port is not inhibited. If at least one change is detected, the process proceeds to step  to analyze the change detected at the step .","The inventor has recognized an appreciated that, if only a single change has occurred in a bridge LAN link and the overall priority of the root bridge has decreased, it is unlikely that the reduction is due to the connection of an additional bridge or bridges, or to the reconfiguration of a bridge to give that bridge higher priority to be the spanning tree root bridge. For instance, if only a single change has occurred, the probability is very high that no bridges or links have been added or bridges re-configured to increase their priorities. Instead, it is very likely that, a bridge or link has failed, or that a bridge has been re-configured to reduce its priority. In such a case, it is very likely that there has been no increase in connectivity between RBridge ports. Thus, in such situations it may be safe for an RBridge port that is an Appointed Forwarder and detects such a root bridge change to a lower overall priority root ID not to inhibit itself at all.","Accordingly, in the example shown in , the RBridge checks whether the root bridge information has changed to a lower priority value at the step . If that is the case, then the process proceeds to step  and the port is not inhibited. If that is not the case, the process proceeds to step  to further analyze the change detected at the step .","In some embodiments, the bridge information used to decide and identify the spanning tree root bridge is a 64-bit quantity of which the top 16 bits include a configurable priority and a lower 48 bits are a globally unique identifier used for tie breaking when priorities are equal. The inventor has further recognized and appreciated that, if the root bridge information seen out an RBridge port changes only in the configurable priority portion, but the remaining 48-bits are the same, then it may be safe to assume that there has been no change in RBridge port connectivity through the bridged LAN. In such a scenario, it is very likely that the only thing that happened was the root bridge being manually reconfigured to a different priority. Thus, inhibition of the port may not be warranted.","Accordingly, in the example shown in , the RBridge checks whether the bridge identifier portion is unchanged at the step . If that is the case, then the process proceeds to step  and the port is not inhibited. If that is not the case, the process proceeds to step  to further analyze the change detected at the step .","In some implementations of the TRILL protocol, RBridges in a campus run a link state protocol that reliably floods the campus link state information to those RBridges. For each RBridge, the campus link state information may include the set of root bridge information that each RBridge can see out any of its ports.","The inventor has recognized and appreciated that, assuming an RBridge, RB1, had been seeing root bridge Info1 out a port and then sees a different root bridge Info2, RB1 may know, through the link state information, which other RBridges, if any, had been seeing Info1 and\/or Info2 out a port. As soon as connectivity has been restored in the bridged LAN out the port in question, Hello messages may be received on that port from all the relevant RBridges (discussed in greater detail in the following paragraph) connected by the bridged LAN. When such new Hellos have been received, the port inhibition of the RB1 port due to seeing the root bridge change may be removed. If any further inhibition is required for loop safety, such inhibition may be independently caused. When, after seeing new root bridge Info2, the RBridge in question has received and processed a new Hello from all such RBridges, or all that remain if some drop out of the network topology, the RBridge may, with very high probability, assume that connectivity has been restored through the bridge LAN.","In some embodiments, relevant RBridges may be those that are part of the campus of RB1 as revealed in the link state database as seeing either the old or new Root Bridge information. If there are RBridges on the link that are not relevant, the change in root bridge may be due to the merger of two bridged LANs causing the merger of two previously separate campuses. (Note that, in some instances, a campus may have as few as one RBridge with as few as zero end stations attached.) The merged bridged LAN may provide the only connection between the campuses and there may be no danger of a loop in removing the inhibition of the port, whether or not Hellos have been received from the irrelevant RBridges.","Accordingly, in the example shown in , the RBridge waits for a time-out after the step , but also monitors whether a Hello message has been received from every relevant RBridge. The inhibition may be removed at step  when the time-out has expired, or when a Hello message has been received from every relevant RBridge, whichever occurs first.","Various techniques are described above that may reduce the amount of time during which native frame handling is inhibited on an RBridge port after a detected change in root bridge is observed on that port. These techniques may be used separately, or in any suitable combination. Furthermore, any of these techniques may be implemented in any suitable manner, as aspects of the present disclosure are not limited to any particular manner of implementation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["1000","1000","1001","1002","1000","1005","1002","1002","1001","1002"]},"The computer  may have one or more input devices and\/or output devices, such as devices  and  illustrated in .

The use of \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201chaving,\u201d \u201ccontaining,\u201d \u201cinvolving,\u201d and variations thereof herein, is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale.
