No. 11\/124,751, filed May 9, 2005, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,805,107 issued Sep. 28, 2010, which claimed priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) and 37 C.F.R. 1.78(4) based upon then copending U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/629,149 filed Nov. 18, 2004.","Academic schedule development is a process in which every institution of higher education engages to some degree. While technology has been used to automate and improve many business processes in higher education, the process of developing academic schedules has not changed much during the past several years. The primary reasons for this inertia are the complexity and political volatility of schedule creation as well as an aversion to running an institution of higher education like a business.","The room assignment component of academic schedule building has long been acknowledged by mathematicians to be a hard (or NP-complete) problem. NP-complete optimization problems are sufficiently complex that it is not possible to prove one optimal solution. Michael W. Carter and Craig G. Tovey released a study in 1991 entitled ? In which they prove that all but the most simplistic approach to room assignment is NP-complete. Adding to the complexity is the fact that room assignment is only one of the NP-complete problems that make up the entire schedule building process. Meeting time and faculty assignment are also complex, NP-complete optimization problems. The fact that each of these complex components is related to, and constrains, the others makes the academic schedule creation process quite daunting.","Academic departments typically exert significant pressure on the academic schedule development process. \u201cTurf\u201d battles over control of space and prime teaching times are common. Pressure to allow senior faculty to dictate what they teach, when they teach and where they teach is usually high. These political limitations have made it difficult to implement student and efficiency oriented changes to scheduling practices.","Despite their considerable operating budgets, institutions of higher education do not like to be thought of as businesses. An assumed conflict between business and learning motivations appears to be the reason for this phenomenon. Budgetary pressures and competition from for-profit technical schools have only recently forced many institutions to think and act more like businesses.","Academic schedule development includes the following key steps: course offering management, faculty assignment, meeting time assignment, and room assignment.","Course offering management is the first step in academic schedule development. During this step, an institution seeks to determine a) what courses to teach, and b) how many sections of those courses (Course Sections) to offer. These determinations rely on the institution's understanding of student demand for the various courses in their curriculum, which heretofore has been very limited. Demand Analysis, when practiced in higher education, has been limited to studying populations of students who have taken courses in past academic terms. This approach, called Historical Analysis, has been applied to overall demand and subsets of the scheduling week\u2014like Morning, Evening, Weekend\u2014or academic term type\u2014like Fall, Spring, Summer. Institutions with Lock Step curriculum track the size of each group that starts a fixed program of study each academic term. The size of this group, less attrition each term, is the basis for determinations of what to teach and how many Course Sections to offer. Neither approach features the student-specific needs analysis which is the key to significant scheduling process improvements.","Faculty Assignment is the process of matching available faculty members with Course Sections in a timetable. This is typically a highly decentralized process where the academic departments assign their available faculty to the Course Sections that are being offered. Like course offering management, there has been no significant process improvement in this area of academic schedule development.","Meeting time assignment is the process of placing Course Sections into time and day slots. These slots are typically standardized by an institution so that the majority of Course Sections use the standard meeting patterns (e.g., 8:00 AM-8:50 AM MWF might be a standard meeting pattern for three contact hour Course Sections that meet on Monday\/Wednesday\/Friday). Time assignments can be a decentralized (done by academic departments) or a centralized process (done by a central scheduling office). Time assignments attempt to cluster activities in popular (primetime) time slots while spreading assignments out enough to eliminate room and known student conflicts. Room conflicts occur when there are more activities needing a particular group of rooms during a time slot than there are rooms in that group. In manual and automated systems (commercial or homegrown), this type of room scarcity is only discovered after the scheduling process is materially complete and certain activities can not be placed. To eliminate student conflicts, an institution relies on its ability to predict the groups of Course Sections that students will need for an upcoming term so that they can attempt to keep those Course Sections conflict free (and the students can register for those Course Sections). There has been significant progress in commercial software that can automate this assignment process. There has, however, been no progress in the process by which institutions predict which Course Sections must be conflict free for an upcoming term. The best practice has been to study historical patterns at a macro (course) level to discern what courses students might take in the same term. This approach is ineffective in determining potential conflicts between Course Sections, which is the heart of the time assignment problem. This problem is related to the limitation in the process described as Demand Analysis in the course offering management section, above, and it applies to both the Roll Forward and Lock Step approach. Institutions using a Lock Step curriculum have a similar limitation. While it is easy to know which Course Sections a cohort is supposed to take, it is very difficult to track and account for students who deviate from their prescribed schedules. These institutions have an increasingly higher percentage of students who can fall off the prescribed schedules because of transfer credits, failed courses, and an unexpected change in their time of day availability forcing them to take a part-time load.","Room assignment is process of placing Course Sections into rooms. This can be a decentralized (done by academic departments) or a centralized process (done by a central scheduling office). The objective of this step in the schedule development process is typically to assign rooms that will be satisfactory to the faculty and have an appropriate capacity. Assignments must always be made so as to avoid double booking a Course Section with another Course Section or event.","There are a small number of vendors who have developed commercial software applications to address the academic scheduling problem, most notably: CollegeNet (formerly Universal Algorithms based in Portland, Oreg.), Scientia (based in Cambridge, U.K.), CCM Software (based in Dublin, Ireland), Infosilem (based in Montreal, Quebec), and Ad Astra Information Systems (the applicant, based in Kansas City, Mo.). All of these vendors market popular room scheduling tools that provide significant assistance to institutions that are willing to define room attributes and assignment rules and priorities for those rooms.","Some of the firms listed above\u2014notably, Scientia, CCM Software, Infosilem and Ad Astra Information Systems\u2014have developed timetabling tools that feature automated assignment algorithms for meeting times and rooms. In addition to finding a meeting time and room for course sections, timetabling systems attempt to eliminate known conflicts for instructors and students.","With the exception of the present invention, there have been no significant development efforts\u2014commercially or by individual institutions\u2014in the academic schedule development areas of course offering management or faculty assignment. Institutional research departments are common, and technology has allowed these entities to develop more attractive reports with less effort. However, the basic information derived from this analysis is the same as it has been from years\u2014what types of students have enrolled at the institution and what they have taken in the past. While this is valuable information, it does little to tell institutions about the course needs of existing students in their declared areas of study. A further limitation is the fact that Historical Analysis can only tell an institution what students settled for from the finite course availability in the academic schedules in which they registered for courses. It is impossible to tell if the five courses that a student selected are their first choices, or if they wanted to take other courses that were not available. Availability, therefore, significantly distorts any analysis of student demand for courses. Finally, there have been no significant developments in the application of Demand Analysis to govern changes in a Master Schedule.","There are no commercial systems available to assist institutions in making changes to their course offerings based on analysis, and the data typically includes hundreds or thousands of discrepancies between the recommended offerings and the Roll Forward schedule. Without a way to prioritize those discrepancies, academic departments would be asked to abandon the cultural scheduling practices that are common on most campuses and submit to an unacceptable number of changes to the Master Schedule. Simply put, institutions need a system that will allow them to discern the content (how many Course Sections to offer) and time changes that will be most directly benefit students' progress to their degrees. Such a system might distill one hundred content and time changes out of a recommended two thousand possible changes in a Master Schedule of a medium-sized institution (containing approximately three thousand Course Sections).","In the 70's some ambitious institutions experimented with an alternative approach to scheduling, the Demand Driven Approach. This approach features a schedule that is built after students select the courses that they need. The advantage of the Demand Driven Approach is that the supply-demand dilemma of is inherently resolved in that Timetable development is based on the actual course demand. Unfortunately, this approach is fraught with practical limitations. A student who has selected a course must be \u201csectioned\u201d into a given Course Section by the institution without the student's input. Since students have less control over their schedules, they tend to be less satisfied with the result\u2014leading to a high level of changes (add-drop) that ruin an \u201coptimal\u201d schedule. Most colleges and universities (and all popular North American enterprise software systems) have responded to these limitations by adopting the Master Schedule Approach.","Another approach, the Lock Step approach, has been used by many technical colleges. This approach typically features a guaranteed graduation path, provided that the student agrees to completely follow a fixed schedule that the institution dictates. Therefore, Lock Step institutions suffer from being limited to creating schedules for those students that can stay on the prescribed schedule. Since fewer students follow that path today than ever\u2014because of changes in student time of day availability due to work schedules or other commitments, a desire to take a part-time load, or the possibility of failing a course in the degree path\u2014schedule building can only benefit a shrinking portion of their enrollment (often less than 50% of the overall student population).","The Master Schedule Approach conforms to the way most colleges and universities do business and all popular enterprise software systems support the registration process. The limitation of the Master Schedule Approach, as stated above, is that there is little to no good Demand Analysis data to assist in academic schedule development. This deficiency impacts both key components of Demand Analysis addressed below: Quantitative Demand and Joint Demand Analysis. Without better information on demand, Timetable changes can not be based on an adequate understanding of student needs.","While not directly applicable to the academic schedule development process, several vendors have released systems designed to track individual student degree progress. These systems, commonly called Degree Audit, also help institutions evaluate the degree status of individual students. These systems are primarily rules engines wherein an institution configures the often complex degree fulfillment rules of its various programs of study. Typically, these systems have advanced reporting capabilities to output an \u201caudit\u201d on a student for that student or his\/her advisor. Prominent vendors include DARS (owned by Miami University of Ohio and based on its Oxford, Ohio campus), Decision Academic Graphics (based in Ottawa, Ontario), and several prominent enterprise solution providers like SCT Sunguard (based in Malvern, Pa.), Datatel (based in Fairfax, Va.), PeopleSoft (based in California), and Jenzabar (based in Cambridge, Mass.). These systems are limited in their ability to predict student demand for two primary reasons: Audits are designed to be individual student reports (not demand data ready to be aggregated across the student population), and there is limited forward-looking information on recommended or standard course sequencing (a student may have ten courses may be remaining in a degree, but the system doesn't know what that student should take in the upcoming term\u2014first semester of their Junior year). More advanced systems now include a \u201ccourse cart\u201d capability wherein a student may select desired courses for future academic terms. None of these systems, however support the following processes recommended in this application: student availability by time and day, modeling needs against tentative Course Sections in future academic terms, and (most significantly) the aggregation and application of the data from these course carts as a demand analysis exercise that might refine proposed Master Schedule or Lock Step course offerings.","There has been no significant development in the area of academic schedule development designed to minimize energy use. Commonly, institutions schedule rooms so as to maximize space utilization. The focus of space utilization is typically to match the maximum enrollment (course capacity) of a Course Section with the seating capacity of a potential room. This approach is valid when space is at a premium (e.g., during \u201cprimetime\u201d hours). It is not valid when space is not at a premium (e.g., non-primetime hours and\/or a low enrollment term like a Summer term). When space is not at a premium, it is more important to concentrate scheduling into a finite number of HVAC Zones and contiguous time slots within those zones. No academic scheduling systems, heretofore, have recognized this paradigm shift and responded by attempted to pack HVAC Zones.","There has been no significant development in the area of academic schedule development designed to consider parking availability and\/or cost. Commonly, timetabling systems assume available parking when making time and room assignments. Today, with growing enrollments and an increasing number of commuter students and non-academic events at many campuses, available parking is no longer a given.","There has been no significant development in the area of academic schedule development designed to proactively identify space and time bottlenecks before attempting to schedule activities. Timetabling systems assume sufficient space when making time and room assignments. Typically, a small subset of an institution's academic activities requires bottleneck resources\u2014rooms wherein there is full utilization during prime scheduling times. Bottleneck resources are the key to facilitating enrollment growth; in that either a portion these activities must be moved to create room for growth or additional bottleneck type rooms need to be brought on line through renovation or new construction. In the Master Schedule Approach, bottleneck activities occur during popular meeting time slots that are part of the Roll Forward schedule. In the Lock Step model, these activities require a bottleneck room during a range of time slots insufficient to allow all of the activities to be placed. If bottleneck activities are not identified before the scheduling process is started, a subset of those activities will arbitrarily remain unscheduled and have to be moved into an undesirable time slot or room.","There has been little significant development in the area of integration of scheduling systems to enterprise-wide \u201chost\u201d systems at institutions of higher education. These systems (often called Student Information Systems, or abbreviated to SIS) are the master system of record for Timetable development that supports student registration in Course Sections. The common approach for years is for the scheduling system to have a database and a user interface that is totally distinct from the SIS. The primary problems with this approach are data integrity and process flow.","The former issue results from the inescapable difficulties in synchronizing data in the SIS and the scheduling system when both systems allow active editing of the data. There is no way to completely eliminate this problem. The only way to minimize it is to increase the frequency of the bi-directional updates and optimize the speed by which those updates are posted. In any event, this is an unavoidable problem that compromises the quality of the integrated solution.","The latter problem results from those involved in the schedule building process needing to toggle between the two systems to complete required schedule building and time\/room assignment tasks. Users would prefer that advanced scheduling tools were part of the SIS, thus eliminating the need to learn and use two systems.","The five primary components of the invention are Student-Specific Demand Analysis, Application of Demand Data, HVAC Zone-Aware Timetable Optimization, Parking-Aware Timetable Optimization and ERP Integration.","The process of developing student specific demand data to allow more informed academic schedule development is an object of the present invention. The resulting forms of student-specific Demand Analysis\u2014Student-Specific Historical Analysis, Program Analysis and Student Survey\/Modeling\u2014feature the integration of detailed information about each active student and the aggregation of the Demand Analysis for each of these students. This information allows a much richer view of student demand than has ever been available in the prevalent Master Schedule Approach to academic schedule development. The three forms of analysis have different primary benefits.","Student-Specific Historical Analysis facilitates much more effective demand prediction than a simple Historical Analysis because it identifies each individual student's selections during past academic terms. This data can then be grouped by significant demographic sub-populations. For example, a first semester Junior majoring in Business Management will have different course selection tendencies than other sub-populations. Additional demographic data (such as status, gender, day\/night, etc.) can be applied to further refine the sub-populations. Those skilled in the art can easily determine other useful attributes such as: age, nationality and ethnicity. As more or fewer students in the active student population fit in the subpopulations identified in previous academic terms, it can be inferred that the demand for those courses commonly selected by those sub-populations should proportionately grow or shrink. While this approach does not eliminate the distortion of demand from course availability in the schedules of previous academic terms included in the analysis, it does improve an institution's ability to respond to significant fluctuations in sub-populations and their typical course needs. Additionally, the study of Student-Specific Historical Demand can deliver information on common groupings of courses selected by students in the same academic term. Active students in the same sub-populations tend to have the same groupings of course selections (Joint Demand), and the institution can respond to this information by taking steps to reduce potential student conflicts between the Course Sections of these courses by not scheduling them at the same times.","Program Analysis evaluates each active student's degree progress against their declared program of study. All enterprise solution providers provide a place to store information on the courses a student has taken (or for which they have been given transfer credit). The information on program requirements is typically available in Degree Audit systems. The remaining, unsatisfied, course requirements and the likely order in which they will be taken form the core of the Program Analysis. This approach is not limited by the distortion of demand from course availability in prior academic terms, like Historical Demand Analysis. It only considers actual needs, and it can be performed for multiple terms into the future\u2014mapping the projected degree paths of all active students who have declared a program of study. Courses that are absolute program requirements (there are no alternative courses that will satisfy the program requirement) are given the highest weight. Courses with alternative (substitute) courses are given a lower weight, inversely proportionate to the number of alternatives. The seniority of the student is considered in an effort to facilitate on-time graduations (Seniors have a more urgent need to have access to their remaining courses than Juniors), and problem courses (e.g., pre-requisites of other requirements and courses failed in previous academic terms) are given higher weight. Finally, unlike Degree Audit systems, a student's needs are analyzed and aggregated with the needs of other active students. The result is a quantitative and qualitative assessment of course needs that can be used to develop academic schedules.","Student Survey Analysis is a rare practice wherein the institution takes the simplest approach to Demand Analysis\u2014they ask the students want they want to take. The use of the student survey as a Demand Analysis tool has, traditionally, been limited to the Demand Driven Approach. Student Survey Analysis in this invention is the application of a Student Survey to a Master Schedule Approach. Once a student has selected desired courses for upcoming terms (ideally through a goal graduation date), an institution can assess its ability to offer those courses, conflict free, to that student. This analysis, obviously, becomes complex when the selections of many students are included. Another novel enhancement to previous scheduling practices is the addition of a graduation planner component that prompts a student to enter their desired graduation data and place all remaining program requirements tentatively into upcoming academic terms to model the feasibility of that student's goal graduation date. Additionally, a schedule modeling algorithm may be used at the end of the survey, allowing students to see the different schedule combinations available in the Roll forward schedule tentatively planned for future academic terms, and institutions to monitor Course Section (not just course) selections. These steps further refine the Demand Analysis process by adding time, day and potentially instructor preferences. With this enhancement, students can develop plans for upcoming terms and indicate intent while flagging course needs which are unmet in the tentative, Roll Forward schedule. These needs can be assessed and used as an impetus for making changes to the Roll Forward schedule.","The process of applying student-specific Demand Analysis to the Master Schedule Approach is the part of the invention that delivers the greatest benefit to institutions of higher education. During this process, an improved understanding of student needs and tendencies is applied to the academic schedule development process to improve student access to needed courses and to improve operational efficiencies. The process of Roll forward schedule refinement benefits from the most significant advantages found in the Demand Driven Approach and applies those advantages to a Master Schedule Approach. It recognizes that change is likely to be resisted by faculty, and limits suggested changes from the Roll forward schedule to Timetable \u201cmoves\u201d that will yield the highest benefit. Lock step schedule creation applies similar benefits to those institutions that generate fixed curriculum academic schedules from scratch each academic term. Application of Demand Analysis to Lock Step schedules allows needed courses to be provided, conflict free when possible, and unneeded courses to be eliminated.","Roll forward schedule refinement includes four primary elements: quantity low, quantity high, course\/time\/day, and joint demand. Each of these elements considers the numbers of students impacted by course offering changes or conflicts and the qualitative significance of the impact. Quantity low infers the need to add Course Sections to one or more courses to meet projected demand. Quantity high infers the need to remove Course Sections from one or more courses to reduce costs and load on resources. Course\/time\/day infers the need to move one or more Course Sections to different parts of the scheduling week. Joint demand infers the degree to which two or more Course Sections that conflict with each other in the Roll forward schedule are needed and\/or desired by the same students, necessitating that one or more Course Sections by moved to a different time slot. Joint demand information should be used as the primary factor in the selection of meting times for activities. Without this information, institutions are left to make these decisions largely based on the desires of the faculty assigned to the Course Sections. These four elements of the roll forward refinement process collectively help an institution deliver the right number of Course Sections at the right times. The desired result is a schedule that allows more students to graduate on time while eliminating unneeded Course Sections and reducing waste.","Lock step schedule creation is the application of student-specific Demand Analysis to the Lock Step approach. There are several benefits to this approach. First, it eliminates the limitations of the cohort, the group of students who start at the same time in a program and, in a perfect world, have the same schedule through graduation. Students that fall off of a perfect cohort schedule can not be accommodated in the schedule development approach that is based on the cohort. A student based approach verifies each student's progress against their program of study\u2014and, therefore, discerns what each student should take next. Without this data, the system has to default to the cohort, which we know in advance only serves the shrinking group of your students that stay on a \u201cnormal\u201d schedule throughout their careers. Secondly, as students fall off of a cohort schedule (almost always by falling behind the multiple academic term schedule prescribed as the degree the desired path), Demand Analysis using the cohort approach is increasingly inaccurate. Demand for courses in the cohort is inevitably overstated and demand for courses \u201cbehind\u201d the cohort is understated. Additionally, it is much harder to manage general education requirements that are shared by multiple programs (cohorts). Inaccurate demand prevents administrators from maximizing efficiencies by combining low enrollment general education offerings from multiple programs offering on-line offerings as an optional delivery for these courses. Finally, accurately assessing demand early on in the scheduling process allows a scheduler to \u201cnudge\u201d demand from a low enrollment course to a higher enrollment course. This opportunity only becomes available by understanding the student-by-student progress and the pre and co-requisite rules within a program, potentially saving an institution a considerable amount of money.","Minimizing HVAC Zones in use and \u201cpacking\u201d the times in which HVAC Zones are needed can greatly reduce energy usage. Since understanding of the HVAC Zones on various college and university campuses has been lacking, Timetable development has never systematically considered these issues. The approach of HVAC zone aware timetable optimization factors the following issues into Timetable development automatically: opportunity analysis, zone packing and interfacing with automated HVAC systems.","All institutions have a published schedule wherein the buildings are \u201copen for business.\u201d Opportunity analysis determines if any buildings or HVAC zones are not needed for part of the institution's scheduling week. This is accomplished by determining the extent to which scheduling density and alternative uses of space (office hours, computer labs, etc.) impact the minimum operational hours of a building or HVAC zone within a larger building. Space that is required for Course Sections or alternative uses for the entire scheduling week must be not be considered in HVAC zone aware timetable optimization. The remaining buildings or HVAC zones are then targeted to be shut down for contiguous blocks of time within the scheduling week. Zone packing capitalizes on opportunities discovered in the opportunity analysis to reduce the overall hours that space is conditioned. The transition time needed to change the temperature in a building or HVAC zone must be considered in the packing process. Therefore, it is important to not only minimize the hours that a desired temperature must be maintained (hours that space is in use) but also the hours that space is being cooled down or heated up. If a building or HVAC zone is needed for 25% of a scheduling week, zone packing will attempt to assign times to Course Sections so that scheduling is limited to two or three days per week with minimal gaps in usage. Finally, passing updated scheduling information to automated HVAC systems allows those systems to proactively manage the temperatures in spaces used by Course Sections or scheduled non-academic events. This approach has two benefits: increased efficiency and a reduced reliance on motion detectors in schedule rooms.","Available parking is a critical concern when scheduling academic and non-academic activities on a college or university campus. The financial cost of providing adequate parking is a significant component of many new construction and renovation projects. Additionally, adequate parking is an important quality of life and safety issue for those attending classes and events and working at the institution.","Since scheduling processes and commercial software that address higher education scheduling lack an awareness of parking availability, Timetable development has never systematically considered this issue. The approach of parking aware timetable optimization factors the following issues into Timetable development automatically: parking load analysis by subset of scheduling week for academic and non-academic uses, parking inventory and scheduled building-to-parking lot relationship, constraint scheduling that places academic and non-academic activities based (in part) on available parking, and the financial analysis of rental income (stalls) and rental expenses (lots) related to the scheduling process.","Most institutions have detailed demographic information on their student body that allows them to determine, at least anecdotally, an academic parking load factor. Specifically, an institution might know that the majority (75%) of their day students live on campus and walk to class. At night, this percentage might drop to 25%. This simple analysis allows the institution to estimate that their academic parking load factor is three times greater in the evening, given a fixed number of students enrolled in day and night classes.","They should also have an idea about the parking needs of the people attending non-academic activities, and an electronic record of most non-academic activities scheduled during the day and night. Adding this information with fixed parking load by time of day for staff gives the institution a good understanding of parking load factors that they must manage.","Next, the institution must understand the number of spaces in the various parking lots and those spaces used by staff. Similarly, since expecting someone to walk 25 minutes from a parking spot to a class is unreasonable, each building that has rooms that can be scheduled should be related to one or more parking lot that can serve that building.","With this information, the timetabling (academic) and event scheduling (non-academic) processes should include parking availability as a constraint. The timetabling algorithm should automatically avoid significantly overbooking parking during peak scheduling times. The event scheduling module should avoid booking large events into time periods and buildings where parking is already full allocated.","Finally, the system should be able to analyze the financial impact of renting spaces to students or event attendees and paying for additional parking at certain times during the week. If a large event requires additional parking, the system should be able to assess the revenue from the event (including charging for parking) against the costs of the event (including the renting the additional parking).","Like parking, the availability of rooms during prime scheduling times, is a critical scheduling issue. The cost of adding and maintaining new space is considerable. The completion of new construction projects, or the renovation of existing under-utilized facilities, also requires a significant amount of time from conception to the availability of the new or modified space.","The approach of capacity bottleneck optimization factors the following issues into Timetable development automatically: enrollment growth projections and goals, bottleneck identification through scheduling load analysis by room type and time for academic activities, identification of academic activities scheduled in the bottleneck, identification of the quantity of bottleneck activities that need to be moved in order to achieve projected or desired enrollment growth, and prioritization of bottleneck activities that must be moved to a new time slot or room.","The recommended approach to expanding enrollments is an exercise in bottleneck management. Once a bottleneck is removed, enrollments can grow until another bottleneck appears. In this way, adjustments to academic schedules or room inventories for the sake of capacity management are confined to high impact changes that remove bottlenecks. If 10% of an institution's Course Sections are scheduled into a bottleneck, then the focus should be on those activities or the rooms that they need. Moving 10% of the bottleneck activities or adding 10% to the bottleneck room inventory will add 10% to the institution's effective capacity; so a 15,000 student campus can become a 16,500 student campus simply by moving 350 of its 3,500 offerings to different timeslots or adding\/remodeling a few rooms.","Scheduling processes, and commercial software that address higher education scheduling, fail to identify bottlenecks proactively. Timetable development typically involves making all feasible assignments, followed by making concessions for the portion of the activities that are left unscheduled. The unscheduled activities are often those that the scheduler arbitrarily left to assign last, after the bottleneck resources were completely used.","Bottlenecks in upcoming (this academic year) and future (subsequent academic years) schedules should be studied for prior to optimization. For future terms, all institutions have systems in place to project enrollment growth. These systems can range from anecdotal (add offerings to courses that had a waiting list in the previous academic term) to systematic (non student-specific Historical Analysis). Ideally, automated processes to identify bottlenecks periodically (e.g., nightly as updated data is gathered from the Student Information System) would present a user with a current list of bottlenecks throughout the Timetable development process.","In the Master Schedule Approach, a relatively simple analysis of the Course Sections for an upcoming or future schedule should uncover over-allocated rooms during peak times. For example, there are 15 activities needing large lecture rooms with 200+ seats from 9:00 am to 10:00 am on Mondays. If there are only 10 lecture rooms that can accommodate these activities, then this is a bottleneck. Since 5 of those 15 activities must be moved to a different rime slot or a different type of room, all 15 activities must be identified and then analyzed so that the 5 Course Sections that will be required to move can be selected and made systematically.","In the Lock Step model, bottleneck activities require a room type during a range of time slots insufficient to allow all of the activities to be placed. For example, there are 65 activities (each of which run 2 hours) that need a computer lab during the weekday morning time range that spans 20 hours. There are 6 computer labs, all of which can be scheduled during that 20 hour time span. Because there are 130 hours of activity (65 activities multiplied by 2 hours each) and only 120 hours of available computer lab time (6 labs multiplied by 20 hours of lab time), 10 hours of activity (5 activities) can not be scheduled during the morning. Like the Master Schedule Approach, it is helpful to manage this problem proactively and systematically.","The recommended approach to processing bottleneck activities involves an equitable prioritization of those activities and reassigning the portion of those identified activities wherein desired space and\/or time are not available. Examples of the possible criteria for these moves are: balancing allocation of bottleneck resources by department or academic subject, student and\/or instructor time of day availability during alternative timeslots, alternative room availability, etc.","Data integrity and process flow are critically important in any systems that involve multiple users accessing multiple systems. The time-sensitive nature of scheduling, where a delay or error in synchronizing data can allow double-bookings of rooms instructors and\/or students, makes this problem even more acute. Even the best data integration schemes that incorporate event-triggered updates between systems have potential update lag times or errors caused by network issues, differing data validation in the two systems or a variety of other reasons. The only true solution to this problem is to depart from the model of operating a scheduling system entirely on its own native data, part of which is a copy of the SIS data.","Simply put, product design that facilitates the scheduling systems performing all time-sensitive scheduling operations directly against the SIS data eliminates the data synchronization problem. Data is no longer passed between the systems and there are no longer two copies of the data.","To impact process flow issues caused by the users of the systems having to continually toggle between the host SIS and the scheduling system, scheduling functionality must be embedded into the SIS user interface. Scheduling system product design that enables the embedding of frequently used controls from the scheduling system into the SIS makes this possible. Users of the SIS, ideally, will not even know that they are accessing business logic from a remote system. They will simply have new features that will have been effectively added to their SIS.","As a general overview the present invention can included the following components:","1. Student-specific quantitative course demand analysis\n\n","2. Application of demand data\n\n","3. HVAC zone aware timetable optimization\n\n","4. Parking aware timetable optimization\n\n","5. Capacity bottleneck and infeasible optimization\n\n","6. Student Information System Integration\n\n","The following terms and concepts are important in order to understand the key issues in higher education schedule development covered in the invention.\n\n","Student-specific Historical Analysis looks at the courses that individual students took in prior academic terms. The institution should choose prior terms that will be predictive of what will occur in the academic schedule that they are developing. In most cases, this will be \u201clike\u201d terms (e.g., Spring terms will be predictive of Spring terms, Fall terms of Fall terms, etc.). The result of this process is a historical quantitative and Joint Demand for the various courses offered by the institution.","The steps required for this component of the invention are: importing student data, importing schedules from previous terms in the analysis, determining quantitative demand, determining Joint Demand, subdividing quantitative demand and Joint Demand into significant sub-populations, merging data from multiple academic terms included in the analysis, importing data on active students, applying analysis to active students, dividing courses demand into Course Section demand per student, and aggregating the results for the entire student population. More detail for each step follows:","Import student information for all students who enrolled in Course Sections in the academic terms studied in the Historical Analysis from an institution's enterprise information system. This data is typically stored in two linked database tables\u2014one containing the primary student data (student table) and one containing the Course Sections taken, the academic term and the student ID (student\/section table).","Import the Master Schedules (section table) from the academic terms studied in the Historical Analysis and link the student\/section data with the through the course ID of the student\/section table.","Determine quantitative demand for courses for the active student population for the upcoming academic term, based on the weighted average analysis of previous academic terms (weighting typically gives more importance to recent terms over older terms). Tables 1 and 2 are an example of quantitative demand for hypothetical \u201cCourse 1\u201d in two academic terms. The first column in the \u201cAnalysis\u201d portion of Tables 1 and 2 calculates the percentage of all active students in each who took Course 1 in academic terms 1 and 2, respectively.","Determine Joint Demand between courses for overall student population based on analysis of previous academic terms (weighting typically gives more importance to recent terms over older terms). Joint Demand is derived from the last column in Tables 1 and 2. This analysis (shown in Tables 1 and 2) is similar to the quantitative demand analysis, except that the likelihood is based on the percentage of students who took another course and Course 1 (not the percentage of all active students).","Subdivide quantitative demand and Joint Demand into significant sub-populations derived from the student table (e.g., Major, Level, Gender, Day\/Night and Status, etc.). Quantitative demand is broken down (in these tables) by Major, Level, Gender, Day\/Night and Status. The analysis in the bottom portion of these Tables shows the percentage of all active students in a sub-population that took Course 1 during that academic term. In Table 3, each active student that is eligible to take Course 1 for an upcoming academic term has an inferred likelihood that they will take Course 1, based the student's demographic profile.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0151"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Took Course 1",{},{},{},{},{},"Other"]},{"entry":["in Term 1","Major","Level","Gender","Day\/Night","Status","Courses"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Student 1","A","1","M","D","Full-time","2, 3, 4"]},{"entry":["Student 2","A","1","M","D","Full-time","2, 3, 5"]},{"entry":["Student 3","A","1","M","D","Full-time","2, 3, 5"]},{"entry":["Student 4","A","1","M","D","Full-time","2, 3, 5"]},{"entry":["Student 5","A","2","M","D","Full-time","2, 3, 5"]},{"entry":["Student 6","A","2","M","D","Part-Time","5"]},{"entry":["Student 7","B","1","M","D","Full-time","2, 3, 4"]},{"entry":["Student 8","B","1","M","D","Full-time","2, 3, 4"]},{"entry":["Student 9","B","3","M","D","Full-time","3, 4, 5"]},{"entry":["Student 10","C","2","M","D","Full-time","5, 6, 7"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"168pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["All Students - % of","Analysis - % of active students by",{}]},{"entry":["all active students","sub-populations that took Course 1","Joint"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["that took Course 1","Major","Level","Gender","Day\/Night","Status","Demand"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["10 of 25 students (40%)","A - 60%","1 - 40%","M - 67%","D - 50%","FT - 45%","2 - 70%"]},{"entry":[{},"B - 30%","2 - 60%","F - 0%","N - 0%","PT - 20%","3 - 80%"]},{"entry":[{},"C - 20%","3 - 20%",{},{},{},"4 - 40%"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},"5 - 70%"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},"6 - 10%"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},"7 - 10%"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Demographic Breakdown of all Students"},{"entry":"Total Students: 25; Majors -10 (A), 10 (B), 5(C); Level - 15 (1), 5 (2), 5 (3); Gender -15 (M), 10 (F); Day\/Night - 20 (D), 5 (N); Status - 20 (FT), 5 (PT)"}]}}]}}},"The data under the heading \u201cAnalysis\u2014% of active students by sub-populations that took Course 1\u201d are derived in the following manor: Major \u201cC\u201d has 5 active students of which 1 student, or 20%, took Course 1 in term 1.

Once the student enters a desired graduation date, there is a significant benchmark against which success may be judged. Related applications of this approach can include on-time graduation guarantees wherein the institution agrees to provide access to the courses needed to satisfy a degree if the student agrees to stay within the parameters of one or many institutionally approved program \u201cpaths.\u201d","Students select courses from available pool of courses presented by system.

For example, if the parking lot for the hypothetical campus in Table 25 has 1,000 stalls, there would only be an estimated 400 stalls available for academic scheduling during some of that campus' primetime hours in the middle of the week. The timetabling algorithm should automatically avoid overbooking parking during peak scheduling times, unless there is a provision for slightly overbooking spaces and allowing for no-shows.","Many students take two or more classes in different buildings on the same day. These students will typically park near the building where first class is held, and then walk to subsequent classes. Despite this phenomenon, it is not recommended that the parking availability calculations factor parking load on a student-specific basis. It is impossible to predict where a student who attends classes in multiple buildings in the same day will park. Attempting to do so and adjusting parking loads accordingly would make the calculations needlessly complicated. Instead, academic parking load should simply be calculated as the number of students attending classes in a building for any hour of the week.","While timetabling algorithms have never specifically been designed to consider parking availability, similar constraint-based algorithms have been developed and are part of the prior art in this area.","An approach that places a higher priority on academic activities is to limit the \u201creserved\u201d stalls for event activities to only significant institution event users, leaving the remaining events to find times where parking is available (in addition to desirable space). To accomplish this, the event scheduling module should be able to identify and avoid time periods and buildings where parking is already full allocated.","Finally, the system should be able to analyze the financial impact of renting spaces to students or event attendees and of paying for additional parking at certain times during the week. If a large event or a new course offering during certain parts of the week require additional parking, the system should be able to assess the revenue from the event or students (if they are charged for parking) against the costs of the event or classes (from renting the additional parking). Since the financial impact calculations are relatively simple (additional revenue less additional expense), they can be done through reports or in a spreadsheet (and don't need to be dynamically integrated into scheduling software).","The approach of capacity bottleneck optimization factors the following issues into Timetable development automatically: enrollment growth projections and goals, bottleneck identification through scheduling load analysis by room type and time for academic activities, identification of academic activities scheduled in the bottleneck, identification of the quantity of bottleneck activities that need to be moved in order to achieve projected or desired enrollment growth, and prioritization of bottleneck activities that must be moved to a new time slot or room. Capacity bottleneck optimization should be done in Step 2-E () or 4-D (), along with time changes to accommodate student need.","Existing and future enrollment levels should be determined based on Demand Analysis outlined in the first component of the invention. Based on anticipated enrollment, the required Course Sections should be included in academic schedules as outlined in the second component of the invention.","Next, all Course Sections should be pre-assigned to rooms or given room type and room feature preferences so that activities may be given appropriate room assignments. This step is best accomplished using room scheduling software available in the prior art.","Prior to attempting to assign Course Sections to rooms, a load analysis by room type and time should occur. The recommended approach is an enhancement to the room assignment algorithm of a typical room scheduling software application that a) identifies bottleneck rooms and b) isolates those activities that are scheduled into bottleneck rooms. It is recommended that this step be automatically run by a timed process that provides a current bottleneck list to those involved in the Timetable development process in a dashboard format.
