The location information obtaining unit  may include a request unit  and a receiver .","The request unit  obtains a key word from a web page and sends a request to an external server (not shown) for location information relating to the key word. The external server can access a database including the location information. Herein, a key word refers to single key words and\/or key word phrases. The user may directly select a key word from the information provided from a web page. As an example, it is assumed that the web page is a blog describing a famous tourist spot.","The apparatus  may include an interface (not shown), through which a user can input and\/or select a key word derived from text data provided from the web page. The selected key word may relate to location information, such as the name, the address, and\/or the phone number of the location.","According to another exemplary embodiment, the apparatus  may include an extracting unit (not shown) to extract the key word from the website. As an example, text data provided from the web page is analyzed, based on a predetermined criteria, or titles of images or voice files provided from the web page are analyzed, to thereby extract the key word. It is assumed that the web page provides text describing the tourist spot \u2018Bulguksa\u2019, along with an image named \u2018Bulguksa.jpg\u2019. In this example, the extracting unit analyzes the text and titles of the image files, and thereby extracts the key word \u2018Bulguksa\u2019.","If multiple key words are extracted from a web page, the extracted key words are displayed, so that the user may select one of the key words. Once the key word is selected, the request unit  sends a request to an external server for location information relating to the key word. As an example, the request unit  transmits the key word to an open application programming interface (API), which searches for related location information. The open API searches the database run by the external server for the location information related to the key word.","The receiver  receives the location information, which corresponds to the request, from the external receiver. The received location information may include detailed location information, or may include location information that can be used to obtain the detailed location information, such as a name, a phone number, and\/or an address. When different types of location information are received, a list including the different types of location information may be generated and displayed. Then, the user may make at least one selection from the list. An apparatus  to provide location information, which outputs the list of the received location information, will be described with reference to .","The converter  converts the received location information into a format that can be used in the navigation device.
