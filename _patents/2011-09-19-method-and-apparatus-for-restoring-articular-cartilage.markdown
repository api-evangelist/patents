No. 61\/383,823, filed Sep. 17, 2010 by Thomas C. May et al. for METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR RESTORING ARTICULAR CARTILAGE, which patent application is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","This invention relates to medical apparatus and procedures in general, and more particularly to medical apparatus and procedures for restoring articular cartilage.","Articular cartilage is a firm, rubbery tissue that covers the articulating surfaces of bones. Articular cartilage provides a smooth gliding surface for joints and acts as a cushion between adjacent bones.","Articular cartilage can break down due to overuse, injury and\/or disease. This deterioration of articular cartilage can result in substantial pain and swelling for the patient, and can significantly impact patient lifestyle.","Various treatments have been devised to address the deterioration of articular cartilage. In some circumstances, a plug of bone (with a segment of articular cartilage attached thereto) may be harvested from one part of the body and transplanted to another part of the body, e.g., from a non-weight-bearing section of a joint to a weight-bearing section of a joint. In other circumstances, a prosthetic device (having a smooth bearing surface formed thereon) may be installed in place of the deteriorated articular cartilage. However, the aforementioned plug transplantations, and the aforementioned prosthetic device installations, tend to suffer from a number of deficiencies, e.g., limitations on the types and sizes of cartilage defects which can be treated using these approaches, trauma to the body at the donor site in the case of plug transplantations, performance deficiencies in the case of prosthetic devices, etc.","Recent advances in in vitro cell growth has now made it possible to restore articular cartilage by means of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). More particularly, with this approach, a small portion of healthy articular cartilage (sometimes referred to herein as \u201ca tissue biopsy\u201d, or simply \u201ca biopsy\u201d) is first harvested from a non-critical section of a joint (e.g., in the case of a knee or hip, from a non-weight-bearing section of the knee or hip). The harvested tissue biopsy is then sent to a processing laboratory where it is appropriately processed, i.e., to extract healthy chondrocyte cells from the tissue biopsy and then culture those chondrocyte cells on a carrier matrix for a period of time (e.g., several weeks) so as to produce a healthy, vibrant autologous graft. Thereafter, in a follow-up procedure, the implant site is prepared to receive the autologous graft, the autologous graft is properly sized for the implant site, and then the autologous graft is introduced into the body and seated at the implant site.","Preferably the foregoing ACI procedure is conducted as an arthroscopic (i.e., as a minimally-invasive, \u201ckeyhole surgery\u201d) procedure so as to minimize trauma to the tissue of the patient and thereby accelerate the recovery period for the patient.","While the aforementioned ACI procedure offers tremendous advantages for the patient, it currently suffers from the lack of effective arthroscopic instrumentation for (i) harvesting a tissue biopsy from a non-critical section of a joint, and (ii) sizing and seating an autologous graft at an implant site.","Thus there is a need for new and improved arthroscopic instrumentation for (i) harvesting a tissue biopsy from a non-critical section of a joint, and (ii) sizing and seating an autologous graft at an implant site.","The present invention comprises the provision and use of new and improved arthroscopic instrumentation for (i) harvesting a tissue biopsy from a non-critical section of a joint, and (ii) sizing and seating an autologous graft at an implant site.","In one preferred form of the present invention, there is provided an arthroscopic cartilage biopsy tool comprising:","an outer tube comprising a distal end, a proximal end, and a lumen extending between the distal end and the proximal end;","an inner core comprising a shaft having a distal end and a proximal end, and at least one blade mounted to the distal end of the shaft; and","the inner core being rotatably mounted within the lumen of the outer tube such that the at least one blade protrudes beyond the distal end of the outer tube.","In another preferred form of the present invention, there is provided a method for arthroscopically harvesting a tissue biopsy, the method comprising:","providing an arthroscopic cartilage biopsy tool comprising:\n\n","advancing the at least one blade of the arthroscopic cartilage biopsy tool into the tissue which is to be harvested; and","rotating the inner core so as to cause the at least one blade to excise the tissue to be harvested.","In another preferred form of the present invention, there is provided an arthroscopic suction curette biopsy tool comprising:","a hollow tube having a distal end including at least one sharp edge, a proximal end, a lumen extending between the distal end and the proximal end, and a side opening extending through the side wall of the hollow tube and communicating with the lumen.","In another preferred form of the present invention, there is provided a method for arthroscopically harvesting a tissue biopsy, the method comprising:","providing an arthroscopic suction curette biopsy tool comprising:\n\n","applying suction to the lumen at the proximal end of the hollow tube;","manipulating the hollow tube so that the at least one sharp edge excises the tissue which is to be harvested; and","selectively blocking the side opening with a thumb or finger of the user so as to apply suction to the lumen at the distal end of the hollow tube so as to secure the excised tissue to the distal end of the hollow tube.","In another preferred form of the present invention, there is provided an arthroscopic tape measurer tool comprising:","a hollow tube having a distal end, a proximal end, and a lumen extending between the distal end and the proximal end;","a tape ribbon movably disposed within the lumen of the hollow tube, the tape ribbon having length markings thereon; and","movement means for moving the tape ribbon relative to the hollow tube.","In another preferred form of the present invention, there is provided a method for arthroscopically measuring a graft site, the method comprising:","providing an arthroscopic tape measurer tool comprising:\n\n","manipulating the movement means so that the tape ribbon is withdrawn into the interior of the hollow tube;","advancing the distal end of the hollow tube so that it resides adjacent to a graft site;","manipulating the movement means so that the tape ribbon is extended out of the distal end of the hollow tube; and","using the length markings formed on the tape ribbon to measure the graft site.","In another preferred form of the present invention, there is provided an arthroscopic applicator tool and measuring template comprising:","an outer tube having a distal end, a proximal end, and a lumen extending between the distal end and the proximal end; and","an inner rod comprising a shaft having a distal end and a proximal end, and a measuring template mounted to the distal end of the shaft;","the inner rod being movably mounted within the lumen of the outer tube such that the distal end of the inner rod can project out the distal end of the outer tube or be withdrawn into the lumen of the outer tube; and","the measuring template being foldable along its longitudinal axis so that the measuring template can be received within the interior of the outer tube.","In another preferred form of the present invention, there is provided a method for arthroscopically measuring objects and for applying an autologous graft to the anatomy of a patient, the method comprising:","providing an arthroscopic applicator tool and measuring template comprising:\n\n","positioning the measuring template within the outer tube;","advancing the distal end of the outer tube to an interior site; and","advancing the measuring template out of the outer tube and using the measuring template to measure an object at an interior site.","The present invention comprises the provision and use of new and improved arthroscopic instrumentation for (i) harvesting a tissue biopsy from a non-critical section of a joint, and (ii) sizing and seating an autologous graft at an implant site.","1. Novel Arthroscopic Instrumentation for Harvesting a Tissue Biopsy from a Non-Critical Section of a Joint","The present invention comprises the provision and use of new and improved arthroscopic instrumentation (\u201ccartilage biopsy tools\u201d) for harvesting a tissue biopsy from a non-critical section of a joint.","In one preferred form of the invention, and looking now at , two novel cartilage biopsy tools are provided: a novel multi-blade cartilage biopsy tool , and a novel suction curette biopsy tool .","(i) Multi-Blade Cartilage Biopsy Tool  for Harvesting a Tissue Biopsy","Multi-blade cartilage biopsy tool  is shown in detail in . Multi-blade cartilage biopsy tool  generally comprises an outer tube  and an inner core .","More particularly, outer tube  generally comprises a distal end , a proximal end  and a lumen  extending therebetween. If desired, proximal end  of outer tube  may have an enlarged diameter (e.g., as shown at ) relative to the remainder of the outer tube so as to provide a more convenient handle for multi-blade cartilage biopsy tool . In one preferred form of the invention, at least the distal end of hollow tube  is transparent.","Inner core  generally comprises a shaft  having a distal end  and a proximal end . A plurality of radially-extending slits  are formed in distal end  of shaft . Slits  receive blades  so as to mount blades  to the distal end  of shaft . In one preferred form of the invention, and as shown in , blades  are secured to one another so as to form a single element , whereby to facilitate securing blades  to the distal end of shaft  via slits . In one preferred form of the invention, there are four blades , and the blades are set at right angles to one another. Preferably each of the blades  has an angled distal end  in order to facilitate biopsy harvesting when the blades are advanced into articular cartilage and rotated, as will hereinafter be discussed in further detail. In this respect it should also be appreciated that the angled distal ends  of blades  also serve to help capture tissue fragments in the hollow receiving spaces  formed between the blades after the biopsy tissue has been cut away from the donor site by the blades.","Inner core  is rotatably mounted within lumen  of outer tube  so that blades  of inner core  protrude slightly beyond the distal end of outer tube , in order that blades  can engage and excise articular cartilage from a biopsy site, whereby to harvest a tissue biopsy. Preferably blades  protrude beyond the distal end of outer tube  by a distance which is approximately equal to the thickness of the articular cartilage which is to be harvested, in order to facilitate harvesting the desired articular cartilage without also taking significant amounts of the underlying host bone.","In use, multi-blade cartilage biopsy tool  is arthroscopically advanced to a donor site at a non-critical section of a joint so that the distal end of the multi-blade cartilage biopsy tool is adjacent to the donor site. Then multi-blade cartilage biopsy tool  is advanced distally so that blades  penetrate the articular cartilage. Such distal advancement continues until the distal end of outer tube  engages the outer surface of the articular cartilage, whereupon distal movement is stopped. At this point the distal ends of blades  should approximately reach the bony interface between the articular cartilage (which is to be harvested) and the host bone (which is not intended to be harvested). Then inner core  is rotated so that blades  excise the tissue biopsy from the donor site and store the tissue biopsy within lumen  of outer tube  (e.g., in the hollow receiving spaces  formed between the blades ). Preferably such tissue harvesting is conducted under direct visualization using an endoscope, with the transparent distal end of outer tube  allowing the surgeon to observe the harvested tissue being stored within outer tube . At this point multi-blade cartilage biopsy tool  is withdrawn from the donor site, and then the harvested tissue biopsy (i.e., articular cartilage) is withdrawn from multi-blade cartilage biopsy tool  for transportation to a processing laboratory where the autologous graft is created from the harvested tissue biopsy.","Multi-blade cartilage biopsy tool  preferably harvests the tissue biopsy while the joint is being irrigated with fluid (e.g., saline), although such harvesting may also be effected in the absence of irrigation.","(ii) Suction Curette Biopsy Tool  for Harvesting a Tissue Biopsy","Suction curette biopsy tool  is shown in detail in . Suction curette biopsy tool  generally comprises a hollow tube  having an angled distal end  adapted to harvest tissue, a proximal end  adapted for connection to a source of suction, and a lumen  extending therebetween. In one preferred form of the present invention, hollow tube  comprises three separate elements which are integrated together so as to form the composite hollow tube : a distal tube , an intermediate tube  and a proximal tube , with the three tubes being connected to one another so as to provide a substantially rigid structure having the continuous lumen  extending therethrough. Angled distal end  includes sharpened edges  about some or all of its perimeter so as to allow the angled distal end to mechanically separate the desired tissue biopsy from its surrounding bone at the donor site. A side opening  extends through the side wall of the tool (e.g., through intermediate tube ) and connects to continuous lumen  extending through hollow tube , whereby to allow the user to control the magnitude of the suction applied at the distal end of the tool, e.g., by selectively blocking side opening  with a thumb or finger, different levels of suction can be applied to the distal end of the tool. By way of example but not limitation, by completely blocking off side opening  with a thumb or finger, substantially full suction can be applied to the distal end of the tool.","In use, proximal end  of suction curette biopsy tool  is connected to a source of suction and, with side opening  uncovered so that little or no suction is applied to distal end  of the tool, the distal end of suction curette biopsy tool  is arthroscopically advanced to a donor site at a non-critical section of the joint. Then distal end  of the suction curette biopsy tool is brought into engagement with the donor site, and the sharpened edges  at the distal end of the tool are used to mechanically excise the desired tissue biopsy (i.e., articular cartilage) from the surrounding host bone. Then side opening  is blocked (e.g., by the thumb of the user) so that suction is transmitted to the distal end of the tool. As a result, the tissue biopsy excised by sharpened edges  is pulled (by suction) against the distal end of the tool. Preferably the size of the opening  at the distal end of the tool is coordinated with the level of suction applied to the proximal end of the tool so as to apply a level of suction to the tissue biopsy which is adequate to hold the excised tissue biopsy against the tool without damaging the tissue biopsy or drawing the tissue biopsy too far into the lumen  of the tool. Then, with suction being maintained at the distal end of the tool, suction curette biopsy tool  is withdrawn from the donor site. Thereafter, the tissue biopsy is released from the suction curette biopsy tool (e.g., by terminating the suction, and\/or by replacing the suction with positive fluid pressure) and transported to a processing laboratory where the autologous graft is created from the harvested tissue biopsy.","Suction curette biopsy tool  preferably harvests the tissue biopsy while the joint is being irrigated with fluid (e.g., saline), although such harvesting may also be effected in the absence of irrigation.","2. Novel Arthroscopic Instrumentation for Sizing and Seating an Autologous Graft at an Implant Site","The present invention also comprises the provision and use of new and improved arthroscopic instrumentation for sizing and seating an autologous graft at an implant site.","In one preferred form of the invention, two arthroscopic instruments are provided to facilitate sizing and\/or seating an autologous graft at an implant site: an arthroscopic tape measurer tool  () and an arthroscopic applicator tool and measuring template  ().","(i) Arthroscopic Tape Measurer Tool ","Arthroscopic tape measurer tool  is shown in detail in . Arthroscopic tape measurer tool  generally comprises a hollow tube  connected to a handle . Hollow tube  has a lumen  extending therethrough. The distal end  of hollow tube  is preferably angled relative to the longitudinal axis of the remainder of the hollow tube. A tape ribbon  is movably disposed within lumen  of hollow tube  and has size markings  disposed on at least its distal end. The proximal end of tape ribbon  is connected to a slide button  which is movably mounted to handle . It should be appreciated that, as a result of this construction, a user can selectively project the distal end of tape ribbon  out of the distal end of hollow tube  by appropriate movement of slide button  relative to handle .","In use, the distal end of tape ribbon  is initially withdrawn into hollow tube  (e.g., by appropriate movement of slide button  relative to handle ), and then the distal end of arthroscopic tape measurer tool  is arthroscopically advanced into a joint cavity so that the distal end of the tool is located adjacent to a defect site. Next, tape ribbon  is advanced out the distal end of the tool (e.g., by movement of slide button  relative to handle ) and then tape ribbon  is used to measure the size of a cartilage defect which is to be restored with an autologous graft. Measurements may be determined using the markings  disposed on the distal end of the tape ribbon and\/or by using corresponding calibrated measurements  formed on handle  (which match the markings  on the distal end of the tape ribbon). In addition, if desired, the proximal end of measuring tape  could extend out of the proximal end of handle  and include corresponding calibrated measurements on the proximal end of the measuring tape (which would correspond to the markings formed on the distal end of the tape ribbon and to the markings formed on the handle). The cartilage defect size information determined using tape ribbon  is recorded. Then the distal end of tape ribbon  is retracted back into hollow tube  (e.g., by appropriate movement of slide button  relative to handle ), and arthroscopic tape measure tool  is withdrawn from the implant site. The measurements which were made of the cartilage defect using arthroscopic tape measurer  may then be used to size the autologous graft for proper seating at the implant site.","Arthroscopic tape measurer  may be used to measure the size of the cartilage defect while the joint is being irrigated with fluid (e.g., saline), or it may be used to measure the size of a defect in the absence of irrigation.","(ii) Arthroscopic Applicator Tool and Measuring Template ","Arthroscopic applicator tool and measuring template  is shown in . Arthroscopic applicator tool and measuring template  generally comprises an outer tube  and an inner rod . Outer tube  comprises a distal end , a proximal end  and a lumen  extending therebetween. Outer tube  also includes a slot  intermediate its length. In one preferred form of the present invention, at least the distal end of outer tube  is transparent. Inner rod  comprises a distal end  and a proximal end . Inner rod  is movably disposed within outer tube  and comprises a measuring template  disposed at its distal end  and a shaft knob  intermediate the length of inner rod . Shaft knob  extends through slot  in outer tube  so that the disposition of inner rod  vis-\u00e1-vis outer tube  can be manipulated via shaft knob .","Measuring template  is preferably constructed out of a clear material and preferably has a measuring grid  printed thereon. Measuring template  is formed out of material which is (i) capable of folding along its longitudinal axis () so that the measuring template can be received within the interior of hollow tube , and (ii) provides minimal or no adhesion with the autologous graft. As a result of this construction, the user can use shaft knob  to selectively project measuring template  out of the distal end of hollow tube  or withdraw measuring template  back within the distal end of the hollow tube. Preferably, measuring template  has a tapered configuration adjacent to its proximal end (), and preferably the entrance to the distal end of hollow tube  has a tapered configuration (not shown in the drawings), such that retraction of the measuring template into the hollow tube causes the measuring template to automatically self-fold into a tubular configuration as the measuring template is withdrawn into the hollow tube. It will be appreciated that where the distal end of outer tube  is transparent, the folded measuring template  will be visible to the user when the measuring template has been withdrawn into outer tube . See .","In use, the distal end of measuring template  is first withdrawn into hollow tube , and then the distal end of arthroscopic applicator tool and measuring template  is arthroscopically advanced to an implant site. Next, measuring template  is advanced out of the distal end of the tool and used (e.g., under endoscopic visualization) to measure the size of the defect which is to be restored with the autologous graft. These measurements may be recorded by hand, or by camera, or by arthroscopically marking the measuring template in situ (e.g., with a marking pen). Then measuring template  is withdrawn back into the interior of hollow tube , and the tool is withdrawn from the patient.","Next, the measuring template  is reduced in size to match the recorded size of the cartilage defect. This may be done on a \u201cback table\u201d by projecting measuring template  out of the distal end of hollow tube  and then cutting the measuring template down to size, e.g., with scissors. If desired, measuring template  may be returned to the site of the defect to confirm fit. With the sizing of measuring template  confirmed, measuring template  may then be used to size the autologous graft for proper seating at the implant site. By way of example but not limitation, this may be done by placing the autologous graft on the sized measuring template and then trimming off any graft overhang.","Once the autologous graft has been properly sized, the autologous graft is positioned on measuring template  (if it is not already on measuring template ), and then the measuring template is withdrawn into the interior of hollow tube . This action causes the autologous graft, which is seated on the measuring template, to be folded along with the measuring template and carried into the hollow tube along with the measuring template. It will be appreciated that where the distal end of outer tube  is transparent, and where measuring template  is transparent, the autologous graft will be visible to the user when the autologous graft has been withdrawn into outer tube . Then the distal end of the tool is arthroscopically advanced to the implant site. Next, the measuring template (carrying the autologous graft with it) is advanced out the distal end of the tool and positioned adjacent to the implant site. Then the autologous graft is slid off the measuring template and onto the implant site, whereupon the autologous graft will either naturally adhere to the bone bed due to the natural adhesion between the bone bed and the autologous graft and\/or an adhesive or a mechanical device (e.g., a dart) may be used to secure the autologous graft to the bone. Measuring template  is then withdrawn back into the interior of hollow tube , and finally the tool is withdrawn from the implant site.","In connection with the foregoing, it will be appreciated that arthroscopic applicator tool and measuring template  is intended to fold the autologous graft into the interior of the tool for transport to an interior surgical site. To this end, some autologous grafts may be more flexible than others. Therefore, with less flexible autologous grafts, the graft may be formed thinner so as to retain as much flexibility as possible\u2014in this case, a graft of greater height may be formed in situ by sequentially delivering two or more individual grafts, with the individual grafts stacking one on top of another at the surgical site so as to form a final graft of the desired thickness. If desired, cement may be applied between successive layers of the graft to hold the layers in position relative to one another, and relative to the host bone.","Arthroscopic applicator tool and measuring template  may be used to measure the size of the cartilage defect while the joint is being irrigated with fluid (e.g., saline), or it may be used to measure the size of the defect in the absence of irrigation.","Arthroscopic applicator tool and measuring template  is preferably used to deliver the autologous graft to the implant site after irrigation has ceased.","3.
