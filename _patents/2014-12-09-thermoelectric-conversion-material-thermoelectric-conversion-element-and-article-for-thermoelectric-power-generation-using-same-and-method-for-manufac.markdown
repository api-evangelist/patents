Each of the above application(s) is hereby expressly incorporated by reference, in its entirety, into the present application.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a thermoelectric conversion material including a carbon nanotube, a thermoelectric conversion element including the material, and an article for thermoelectric power generation including the same element. In addition, the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing the thermoelectric conversion element.","2. Description of the Related Art","In recent years, in consideration of the global environment, there has been a demand for the transition of fossil energies of the related art into renewable energies. Examples of the renewable energies include solar power generation, wind power generation, wave power generation, vibration power generation, thermoelectric power generation, and the like. However, among the above-described power generations, the thermoelectric power generation is attracting attention since the thermoelectric power generation is capable of directly converting thermal energy into electric power, and is capable of effectively using a huge quantity of unused thermal energy such as exhaust heat from solar power generation, geothermal power generation, hot water heat power generation, an industrial furnace or a vehicle. In addition, the thermoelectric power generation is capable of directly converting thermal energy into electric power, and does not require a movable unit, and thus has been put into practical use of a wrist watch which is operated by using body heat, a power supply in a remote area, a power supply in the space, and the like.","For the thermoelectric power generation, a thermoelectric conversion material capable of converting thermal energy into electric energy and vice versa, and a thermoelectric conversion element (thermoelectric power generation element) produced by processing the thermoelectric conversion material are used. From the viewpoint of the thermoelectric conversion efficiency, the thermoelectric conversion material that has been put into practical use at the moment is an inorganic material, but the inorganic material has problems of a high price, the inclusion of a harmful substance, the complicated step of being processed into a thermoelectric conversion element, and the like. Therefore, studies are underway regarding an organic thermoelectric conversion material that can be manufactured at a relatively low cost, and can be easily formed into a film. For example, US2010\/0319750A and JP2008-305831A report thermoelectric conversion materials for which a carbon nanotube is used.","An object of the present invention is to provide a thermoelectric conversion material having excellent thermoelectric performance, a thermoelectric conversion element including the same material, an article for thermoelectric power generation including the same element, and a method for manufacturing the thermoelectric conversion element.","The present inventors, additionally, have conducted intensive studies regarding an organic thermoelectric conversion material. As a result, it has been found that a composition including a carbon nanotube and a polythiophene polymer in which both the third and fourth positions of a thiophene ring are substituted by alkyl groups exhibits excellent thermoelectric performance, and is useful as a thermoelectric conversion material. The material had a strong electric conduction property and a high thermoelectric force required for thermoelectric conversion, and exhibited excellent thermoelectric performance.

As is clear from the following equation (A), the improvement of the thermoelectric performance requires an increase in the thermoelectric force and the electric conductivity and a decrease in the thermal conductivity. As described above, since the thermoelectric performance is significantly affected by factors other than the electric conductivity, it is not certain whether or not a material generally having a high electric conductivity effectively functions as a thermoelectric conversion material in actual cases. The thermoelectric conversion material of the present invention is capable of realizing a high electric conductivity without decreasing the thermoelectric force as verified in examples described below, and has thermoelectric performance favorable enough to be used as a thermoelectric conversion material.","Performance index ZT=S\u00b7!\u00b7T\/\u03ba(A)","S(V\/K): Thermoelectric force (Seebeck coefficient)","\u03c3(S\/m): Electric conductivity","\u03ba(W\/mK): Thermal conductivity","T(K): Absolute temperature","The thermoelectric conversion material of the present invention includes a carbon nanotube and a polythiophene polymer constituted of a repeating unit represented by Formula (1) described below. Hereinafter, the respective components of the thermoelectric conversion material of the present invention will be described.","[Carbon Nanotube]","Examples of the carbon nanotube (hereinafter, also referred to as CNT) include a single-layer CNT around which a carbon film (graphene sheet) is cylindrically coiled, a dual-layer CNT around which two graphene sheets are concentrically coiled, and a multi-layer CNT around which multiple graphene sheets are concentrically coiled. In the present invention, the single-layer CNT, the dual-layer CNT, and the multi-layer CNT may be singly used, or two or more CNTs may be jointly used. In particular, it is preferable to use the single-layer CNT and the dual-layer CNT which have excellent electric conductivity and semiconductor characteristics, and the single-layer CNT is more preferably used.","The single-layer CNT may be a semi-conductive CNT or a metallic CNT, or may be a combination of a semi-conductive CNT and a metallic CNT. In addition, the CNT may include metal or the like, or may include a molecule such as fullerene. Meanwhile, the thermoelectric conversion material of the present invention may include, in addition to the CNT, nanocarbons such as carbon nanohorns, carbon nanocoils, or carbon nanobeads.","The CNT can be manufactured using an arc discharge method, a chemical vapor deposition method (hereinafter, referred to as the CVD method), a laser abrasion method, or the like. The CNT used in the present invention may be a CNT obtained using any method, but is preferably a CNT obtained using the arc discharge method and the CVD method.","When the CNT is manufactured, fullerene, graphite, or amorphous carbon is generated as a by-product at the same time, and catalyst metals such as nickel, iron, cobalt, and yttrium also remain. To remove these impurities, it is preferable to purify the CNT. There is no particular limitation regarding the method for purifying the CNT, but an acid treatment using nitric acid, sulfuric acid, or the like or an ultrasonic treatment is effective for removing the impurities. It is more preferable to remove the impurities by separation using a filter in conjunction with the above-described treatment from the viewpoint of improving the purity.","After the purification, the obtained CNT can be used with no additional step. In addition, generally, the CNT is generated in a string shape, the CNT may be used after being cut into a desired length depending on usage. The CNT can be cut into a short fiber shape using an acid treatment in which nitric acid, sulfuric acid, or the like is used, an ultrasonic treatment, a frost shattering method, or the like. In addition, it is preferable to carry out separation using a filter in conjunction with the above-described treatment from the viewpoint of improving the purity.","In the present invention, not only the cut CNT but also the CNT that has been produced in a short fiber shape in advance can be used. The above-described short fiber-shaped CNT is obtained in a shape of being oriented in the vertical direction to the substrate surface by, for example, forming catalyst metals such as iron and cobalt on a substrate, and thermally decomposing a carbon compound on the substrate surface at 700\u00b0 C. to 900\u00b0 C. using the CVD method, thereby causing the vapor deposition of the CNT. The short fiber-shaped CNT produced in the above-described manner can be taken out from the substrate using a method such as peeling. In addition, the short fiber-shaped CNT can also be grown on the surface of a catalyst metal using the CVD method after the catalyst metal is supported on a porous supporting body such as porous silicon or on an anodically-oxidized film of alumina. The oriented short fiber-shaped CNT can be produced using a method in which molecules such as iron phthalocyanine containing a catalyst metal in the molecules is used as a raw material, and CVD is carried out in a gas flow of argon\/hydrogen, thereby producing the CNT on the substrate. Furthermore, it is also possible to obtain the oriented short fiber-shaped CNT on the surface of a SiC monocrystal using an epitaxial growth method.","The average length of the CNT used in the present invention is not particularly limited; however, from the viewpoint of manufacturing readiness, film-forming properties, electric conduction properties, and the like, the average length of the CNT is preferably in a range of 0.01 \u03bcm to 1000 \u03bcm, and more preferably in a range of 0.1 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm.","The diameter of the CNT used in the present invention is not particularly limited; however, from the viewpoint of durability, transparency, film-forming properties, electric conduction properties, and the like, the diameter of the CNT is preferably in a range of 0.4 nm to 100 nm, more preferably 50 nm or less, and still more preferably 15 nm or less.","The content of the CNT in the thermoelectric conversion material is, in the total solid content, preferably in a range of 2 mass % to 60 mass %, more preferably in a range of 5 mass % to 40 mass %, and particularly preferably in a range of 8 mass % to 30 mass %.","[Polythiophene Polymer]","The polythiophene polymer used in the thermoelectric conversion material of the present invention has an alkyl-substituted thiophene structure represented by the following formula (1) as a repeating unit.

In the case of polythiphene-2,5-diyl having a thiophene ring with a two-position substitution structure as a structural unit as used in the present invention, the generated polythiophene main chain is significantly twisted due to the steric repulsion between the thiophene rings. The polythiophene main chain having the thiophene ring with a two-position substitution structure as the structural unit is more twisted compared with polythiophene having a thiophene ring with a one-position substitution structure in which only either the third or fourth position of the thiophene ring is substituted as the structural unit.","An example of a method for measuring the twist degree of the polythiophene main chain is a method for measuring the ionization potential of the polythiophene. The ionization potential indicates the energy necessary for a molecule to be ionized, and corresponds to the energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Generally, when the conjugate system of an organic molecule expands, and thus the interaction between orbits in the molecule increases, the energy level of HOMO becomes positively decreased. It is known that the ionization potential of polyalkyl thiophene having a one-position substitution structure is approximately 5.2 eV, and it is possible to determine that, as the ionization potential becomes positively greater than 5.2 eV (the level of HOMO is deep), the degree of conjugation of the polythiophene main chain becomes smaller, that is, the twist degree of the polythiophene main chain becomes greater. Examples of the method for measuring the ionization potential include electrochemical methods such as photoelectric spectroscopy or cyclic voltammetry.","It is considered that, when the thermoelectric conversion material of the present invention includes a polymer made of a repeating unit having a polythiophene structure of the two-position substitution structure together with the CNT, a high electric conduction property can be realized. This is considered to be because the use of polythiophene having a polymer main chain that is significantly twisted causes highly efficient carrier migration as described below. Since carriers (holes) generated in polythiophene (carrier mobility of 0.1 cm\/(V\u00b7s)) which is an electrically conductive polymer are injected into the CNT, and migrate in the CNT which allows the carriers to easily migrate (carrier mobility of 30000 cm\/(V\u00b7s)) at a high speed, a high electric conduction property is developed. Particularly, in a case in which polythiophene having a significantly twisted main chain is used, it is assumed that the HOMO level is deep as described above, and thus holes can more easily inject into the CNT, and consequently, the electric conduction property further improves.","In the polythiophene polymer used in the present invention, the repeating number of the repeating units represented by Formula (1) is preferably in a range of approximately 4 to 2,000. In addition, the molecular weight is, in terms of the weight-average molecular weight, preferably in a range of 5,000 to 250,000, more preferably in a range of 10,000 to 200,000, and still more preferably in a range of 15,000 to 170,000. The weight-average molecular weight can be measured using gel permeation chromatography (GPC).","As the polythiophene polymer used in the present invention, a commercially available product can be used, or a polythiophene polymer can be synthesized using a method of oxidation polymerization using iron chloride in which 2- and 5-position unsubstituted thiophene is used as a raw material monomer or a polymerization method in which a Ni(II) catalyst\/Grignard reagent, for which a 2- and 5-position Br-substituted thiophene is used as a raw material monomer, is used.","The content of the polythiophene polymer in the thermoelectric conversion material is, in the total solid content, preferably in a range of 20 mass % to 80 mass %, more preferably in a range of 30 mass % to 75 mass %, and particularly preferably in a range of 35 mass % to 70 mass %.","[Non-Conjugated Macromolecule]","The thermoelectric conversion material of the present invention preferably includes a non-conjugated macromolecule in addition to the above-described CNT and polythiophene polymer.","The non-conjugated macromolecule used in the thermoelectric conversion material is a macromolecular compound having a conjugated structure with a polymer main chain and exhibiting no electric conduction properties.
