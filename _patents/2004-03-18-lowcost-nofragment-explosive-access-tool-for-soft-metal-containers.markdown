title: Low-cost, no-fragment explosive access tool for soft metal containers
abstract: The invention comprises a device that uses a flexible material, preferably in a mostly square shape. An explosive charge, usually in the form of a sheet of explosives, is cut to fit on the top side of the flexible material. A cutting plate, having orthogonal grooves on the top, is placed under the flexible material. An initiating means is connected to the explosive charge so that upon initiation, the grooves focus the explosive charge so that the cutting plate forms a plurality of petals that press into a soft metal container to create a fragment-free opening in the soft metal target material.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This a continuation in-part of application Ser. No. 10\/339,256, filed on Jan. 9, 2003","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","1. Related Applications","This application claims the non-selected invention pursuant to a restriction requirement related to the above mentioned previously filed application and a new embodiment of the invention as set forth in new .","2. Field of the Invention","The present invention pertains to the field of producing fragment-free access openings, more particularly to the field of using explosive material to produce fragment-free openings in hardened structures such as doors or metal containers and most particularly to the field of using explosive material to produce fragment-free openings in hardened containers that house improvised explosive devices without initiating said devices.","3. Description of the Related Art","Bomb squad technicians regularly deal with packages that are suspected of containing explosive devices. In order to reduce the risks associated with opening such packages, technicians primarily use either robotic tools or explosive access tools that can be initiated from a distance. For certain types of packages or containers, robotic access tools, which often lack precision, power, and are cumbersome, cannot be employed. For these types of packages, such as metal drums or other hardened containers, explosive access tools are the only option.","Various explosive tools have been employed for this purpose. One technique is to employ a linear-shaped charge to create an opening in the hardened container. These shaped charges comprise a chevron-shaped metallic casing, which is usually copper, aluminum, or lead, that contains a quantity of high explosive. The charge cuts the hardened container by accelerating each side of the chevron-shaped wedge into each other, forming a high-velocity metallic jet. However, this technique, like merely using high explosives to directly cut into hardened targets, produces many fragments, which are capable of accidentally initiating any improvised explosive device within the container.","In order to alleviate this fragmentation problem, a device commonly known as the Magic Cube\u2122 was developed and disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,220,166. This device comprises a sheet explosive that is initiated at four different points and a buffer material, made up of three sheets of stacked, low density material, such as polyethylene foam which is placed between the explosive and the target. Various types of tapes and adhesives are required in order to combine these elements and affix the final device to the target. While the device does alleviate the fragmentation problem discussed above under certain circumstances, it does have several problems associated with its intended use. First, due to the complexity of the device, any particular embodiment is designed to operate on only one range of specific \u201cwall\u201d thickness. Second, also due to the complexity of the device, it is relatively expensive. Third, the device only operates effectively against flat surfaces. Finally, the device only works against hardened materials, such as steel, but does not work against softer metals such as aluminum.","Therefore, it is desired to provide a an explosive access tool that produces no fragments, is inexpensive, and can be used on containers, made of varying materials, having various shapes and of varying wall thickness.","The present invention comprises an improved explosive access tool used by bomb squad technicians and others who require access to suspect packages and containers. The invention solves several problems associated with current tools along with using many materials already carried by bomb squad technicians in the field.","Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide an explosive access tool that creates fragment-free openings in target materials.","It is a further object of this invention to provide an explosive access tool that can be employed on non-flat surfaces.","A still further object of this invention is to provide an explosive access tool that is inexpensive compared to present explosive access tools.","A yet further object of this invention is to provide an explosive access tools that can be employed on targets of varying wall thickness.","This invention accomplishes these objectives and other needs related to creating fragment-free openings in target materials by providing a device that uses a flexible material, preferably in a mostly square shape, having substantially orthogonal grooves scored into one side. An explosive charge, usually in the form of a sheet of explosives, is cut to fit the side opposite the grooves, in substantially the same shape as the grooves, without extending beyond the periphery of the flexible material. An initiating means is connected proximately centrally to the explosive charge so that upon initiation, the grooves shape the explosive effect so that a plurality of petals cantilevered are formed in the target material, substantially between the ends of the grooves, to define a fragment-free opening in the target material.","A second embodiment of the invention, preferred for \u201csofter\u201d metal targets, such as aluminum, comprises a cutting plate, preferably made of a material harder than the target, that has deep narrow orthogonal grooves scored on a front side, or pre-punched petal edges formed by a press. These pre-punched petal edges may be heat-treated before being restored to an original flat configuration. A sheet of material, being softer than the cutting plate material, is placed over the grooves or edges. An explosive charge is placed on the sheet of material, positioned in substantial alignment with the grooves or edges on the sheet of material. The explosive charge preferably should not extend beyond the periphery of the sheet of material. Initiating means are used to initiate the explosive charge that creates an explosive force that drives the cutting plate into the target material, akin to the operation of a can-opener, creating a plurality of petals cantilevered from the target material to define a fragment-free opening in the target material.","Finally, the invention also comprises a method of using the device described herein to create an opening in a target material.","The invention, as embodied herein, comprises an explosive access tool used to create fragment-free openings in target materials, often the walls of packages or containers suspected of containing improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The elements of the tool are made up of materials, many of which are already carried by bomb squad technicians, that are relatively inexpensive and light weight. In general, the invention comprises a flexible material that has two crossing grooves scored into one side. The term flexible, as it is used in this application, refers to a non-rigid material, capable of being flexed without the use of outside tools or machinery. Therefore, steel based materials would not be flexible, but materials such as polymeric materials or rubber materials would be flexible. Preferably, the grooves are positioned orthogonal to each other and do not extend to the periphery of the flexible material. An explosive charge, preferably in the form of a sheet of explosive, is placed on the side of the flexible material without the grooves, however, the explosive charge is substantially aligned with the grooves. The explosive charge preferably does not extend beyond the periphery of the flexible material. Initiating means are connected proximately central to the explosive in order to initiate the explosive. The grooves help focus the explosive force to penetrate the target material, creating a plurality of petals cantilevered from the target material, substantially between the ends of the grooves, to define a fragment-free opening in the target material.","Referring to , , , and , the flexible material , has two crossed grooves  scored on a first side . An explosive charge  is placed on the second side  of the flexible material . The explosive charge  is positioned in substantial alignment with the grooves , which are on the side opposite to the explosive charge . The explosive charge  preferably should not extend beyond the periphery  of the flexible material . Optionally, an adhesive means  may be employed to adhere the explosive charge  to the flexible material  and the flexible material  to the target material . Initiating means  are connected to the explosive charge . When the initiating means  is activated, the explosive charge  creates an explosive force, that is partially focused by the grooves . This results in penetration of the target material  to create a fragment-free opening  formed by a series of four petals  cantilevered from the target material . The four petals  are formed in a position substantially between where the ends  of the grooves  were positioned, due to the shaping of the explosive force.","The flexible material  may be selected by one skilled in the art, however, the material will preferably comprise a flexibility sufficient to be placed against non-flat surfaces, such as sides of barrels or car doors. The material  should be of sufficient thickness and possess sufficient hardness to allow the grooves  to be scored, machined, molded, or stamped into one side without compromising the stability of the material . One preferred thickness comprises 1\/16 inch. While almost any shape may be used for the flexible material , a shape that is most conducive to an orthogonal pattern for the grooves  (discussed in more detail below) is preferable, such as a square. The size of the flexible material  is dependent upon the size of the opening that one desires to make in the target material . Preferred sizes comprises 4 and 6 inches square. Polymeric materials are preferred for the flexible material such as ABS plastic. Another preferred material comprises a magnetic material that would allow adhesion to a target material  that is magnetic in nature without the need for adhesive means . An example of such a material is a flexible magnetic sheet material that is a magnetic powder material placed into a thermoplastic base material, manufactured by Magnum Magnetics Corporation.","The width and depth of the grooves  may be selected by one skilled in the art depending upon the amount and type of explosive charge  used as well as the specific container one desires to open. For most steel based containers, it is preferred that the depth of the grooves comprises the majority of the width of the flexible material . For example, for a 1\/16 inch wide flexible material, a preferred groove depth comprises approximately 0.06 inches. The shape of the grooves , preferably comprises a V-shape in order to best focus the force created by the explosion. Preferably, the angle  of the V-shape comprises approximately 45 degrees. The grooves  may be placed in the flexible material by many methods known in the art including, for example, an engraving machine or stamping with a press. The grooves  must cross one another and where the ends  of the grooves are placed upon the flexible material  determines the size of the opening made in the target material . In order to minimize end effect stresses at the apexes of the forming petals , it is preferred that the grooves  comprise orthogonal positions to one another, making an X-shape having angles of about 90 degrees between the grooves. Further, it is preferable that the grooves  do not extend to the periphery of the flexible material . This is in order to help reduce any edge effects from the explosive force that might result in potential fragmentation. Typically, it is preferred that the grooves  remain one-quarter inch or greater from the periphery  of the flexible material .","The explosive charge  can be selected by one skilled in the art based upon the amount of force desired by the user of the device. Preferably, the explosive charge  will be in the form of a sheet explosive that can be cut to a desired size. A preferred type of explosive material comprises pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). Exemplary explosive charges  are 0.043 inch thick and 0.083 inch thick PETN sheet explosives manufactured by E.I. DuPont. The explosive charge  is shaped to be placed directly behind the grooves . Therefore, the preferred shape of the explosive charge  is an X-shape. The thickness of the segments  that make up the X-shape may be selected depending upon the force desired from the explosive force. One preferred segment  thickness for a PETN sheet explosive comprises about 0.5 inches. The explosive charge  should preferably be placed so the grooves  are approximately along the center of each segment . In order to prevent edge effects, as discussed above, the explosive charge  should not extend beyond the periphery of the flexible material . It is preferred that the explosive charge  not extend beyond the grooves , preferably being one-quarter inch or greater from the periphery  of the flexible material . In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the ends  of each segment  may be tapered in order to decrease edge effects as discussed above.","The initiating means  may comprise any type of explosive initiator that will reliably initiate the type of explosive material used as explosive charge . Preferably, the initiating means will be located approximately in the center of explosive charge . One preferred initiating means comprises an electric blasting cap because such a device is standard equipment in a bomb disposal technician's kit.","Referring to , the invention may also include a holder  in order to hold the initiating means  in place against the explosive charge . A lower spring clip  and an upper spring clip  with apertures , located proximately central to the explosive charge , position initiating means . The spring clips  and  are held in place by four positioning tabs  that are approximately equidistant from the center of the flexible material  and held in position with respect to the flexible material  by a strong adhesive means . The positioning tabs have a surface  that is inclined to capture the ends of spring clips  and  which are compressed towards each other by said tab surfaces . Alignment of the spring clips  and  with said positioning tabs  will centrally locate initiating means  with respect to the explosive charge . The spring clips may be of a non-metallic material to minimize fragmentation around the target. The adhesive means  may be any substance that can hold the explosives  against the flexible material  and the device against a target material. Preferably, the adhesive means  comprises regular adhesive tape because it is inexpensive, can reliably hold the relatively light device in place, and minimize fragmentation around the target.","Referring to , another embodiment of the invention is presented. This embodiment of the invention is the same as the embodiments shown in  except that the flexible material  comprises an X-shape, similar to the shape of the explosive charge , that surrounds the grooves . If certain types of materials are used within the device, as discussed above, and for certain applications, this may be a preferred shape for the flexible material . A second material  may also be added to the invention to provide increased explosive force, if necessary. This second material  would be placed atop the explosive charge  and would be shaped similar to the explosive charge  or smaller. The second material  would not extend to the periphery of the explosive charge . Further, the second material  preferably would be a frangible type material to avoid fragmentation. The second material  could be employed in any configuration of the invention that may require increased explosive force.","Referring to , yet another embodiment of the invention is presented. This embodiment of the invention, shown primarily in , is designed to create fragment-free openings in \u201csofter\u201d metals, such as aluminum. Present explosive access tools cannot achieve such openings. A cutting plate , made of a hard material such as steel or a steel based alloy, has two-crossed deep narrow grooves or pre-punched petal edges  formed by a press on a first side . As above, the grooves or edges  are preferably orthogonal. If the edges are pre-punched, the edges may be heat-treated before being restored to an original flat configuration. A sheet of material , being softer than the cutting plate , is placed atop the grooves or edges , on the first side . In order to align the cutting plate  and the sheet of material , one may draw lines on the back side of each. The sheet of material  is preferably the flexible material discussed above. The explosive charge , as described above, is placed atop the flexible material, aligned with the grooves . Again, initiating means  are used to initiate the explosive charge . Upon initiation, the force from the explosive charge  cantilevers through the cutting plate , creating a plurality of petals , that press into the softer metal below and create a second plurality of petals that form a fragment-free opening. Therefore, the cutting plate  acts akin to a can-opener to create the opening in the softer metal.","Referring to , another embodiment, similar to  is depicted. In this embodiment, the grooves  cut completely through the cutting plate , creating four cutting plate squares . The plates are connected via attaching means  back into a \u201cwhole\u201d cutting plate . The attaching means  may be selected by one skilled in the art, however, the preferred attaching means  shown in the figure is tape. For certain softer metals, this embodiment provides a cleaner cut by providing more distinct petals  that press into the softer metal as described above.","The invention also includes method of creating fragment-free openings in target materials using the above described invention.","What is described are specific examples of many possible variations on the same invention and are not intended in a limiting sense. The claimed invention can be practiced using other variations not specifically described above."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention, and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
