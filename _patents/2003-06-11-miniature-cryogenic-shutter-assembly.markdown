title: Miniature cryogenic shutter assembly
abstract: A calibration method for radiometric imaging systems that relies on an absolute measurement of scene radiance (thereby requiring a baseline measurement of zero radiance), and a shutter assembly for taking the baseline measurement of zero radiance which is operable under cryogenic temperatures as low as 80.5K (−192.65° C.) in vacuums measuring <10torr (mm Hg). The shutter assembly generally includes an actuator and a shutter mechanism. The actuator is preferably a miniature solenoid assembly capable of operation in extreme environments (e.g. vacuums of <10torr, temperatures below 90K). The shutter mechanism preferably includes a single shutter blade and is also capable of operation when subjected to extreme environments. The method of using the shutter assembly provides a zero radiance reference measurement for an infrared imaging system, thereby providing a basis upon which absolute scene radiance may be determined.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to infrared imaging system calibration methods and shutter mechanisms used therein and, more particularly, to a calibration method that relies on an absolute measurement of scene radiance (thereby requiring a baseline measurement of zero radiance), and a shutter mechanism operable under cryogenic conditions to measure zero radiance by providing the imaging system with a temporary view of some object possessing zero radiance.","2. Description of the Background","Infrared imaging systems are highly effective, surveillance and\/or diagnostic tools. For example, their ability to \u201csee\u201d radiation wavelengths outside of the visible spectrum may be utilized to sense the movements of humans and animals in the dark (i.e. during nighttime hours), or to call attention to the imminent failure of a mechanical or electrical device by pinpointing the location of an inappropriate heat source. Infrared imagers are also sometimes used as radiometers, devices that measure the radiant output of a source. In such uses the imager must be calibrated in terms of absolute radiance units since radiometric imagers are often to understand the behavior of other infrared sensor types (infrared missile seekers, etc.), and these measure the total absolute scene radiance (that radiance arising from all sources external to the sensor system).","The measurement of absolute radiance is somewhat difficult and usually involves the measurement of a known reference source relative to the system under test. This is a relative measurement, but since it is tied to a reference source of known radiance, the absolute quantity may be evaluated. Specifically, absolute radiance can be measured by taking the difference between the scene radiance signal and the reference radiance signal, and assuming that the camera zeroth signal (the signal resulting from just the camera) is unchanging. This can work for a wide variety of measurements where the scene has either positive or negative contrast with the reference. However, the approach can lead to difficulty, since it is possible that for negative contrast cases the scene radiance signal can fall to the camera zero signal level without the operator being aware of it (it is, after all, an unknown quantity). It is also possible that for certain parametric configurations (gain states) the camera will not be able to encompass both radiance values (reference and target). In other words the camera runs out of dynamic range.","In light of the above, it would be better to have a calibration method that relied on camera characteristics alone to make the measurement, e.g., relying on an absolute measurement of scene radiance (thereby requiring a baseline measurement of zero radiance). This approach has not heretofore been pursued because to effectively implement it the imaging system must be provided with a temporary view of some object possessing zero radiance. To create the temporary view, an object that possesses zero radiance must temporarily fill the field-of-view of the focal plane array of the imager. This requires a shutter mechanism that moves in front of the imaging system aperture, then returns to a non-occluding position, under cryogenic conditions.","Camera shutter mechanisms are well-known, but to effectively maintain an object with \u201czero\u201d radiance the temperature must be very low and the shutter must be a \u201ccold shutter.\u201d Specifically, to effectively remove all radiance from an object in the midwave (3\u20135 \u03bcm) and long wave (8\u201312 \u03bcm) bands that typical imaging systems operate in, that object's temperature must be below 90K (\u2212183\u00b0 C.). While temperatures of that magnitude may be achieved by applying liquified, or nearly-liquified, gas to the object, or by placing the object in interplanetary space (which also exposes the object to a nearly perfect vacuum), conventional camera shutter mechanisms do not function in such environments.","The present inventor is not the first to address the need for shutter assemblies, or apparatus designed to open and close the aperture of an optical instrument, that are operable when subjected to cryogenic conditions (e.g. very low component temperatures). Other examples of shutter mechanisms possessing these attributes may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,661 to Geyer et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,258,874 to Bajat et al., and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,128,796 and 4,995,700 to Barney et al.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,661 to Geyer et al. discloses an articulated device for space vehicles for temporarily sealing the aperture of a space-based optical instrument. The device includes a fixed support element for mounting on the vehicle and an auxiliary element such as a temporary sealing flap mounted to pivot with respect to the fixed support element around a hinge axis between a first configuration (e.g. wherein the aperture is sealed) and a second configuration. The auxiliary element is attached, by a frangible controlled-break component for making temporary connections, to a hinge shaft whose rotation between the first and second configuration is controlled by an actuator. A torsional resilient return device is secured to the auxiliary element and to the shaft while resiliently biasing the auxiliary element to rotate it around the shaft in a predetermined direction. The shaft is substantially loosely engaged in journal bearings that are rigidly fastened to the auxiliary element.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,258,874 to Bajat et al. discloses a device for movement control of a mobile element that moves with respect to a support between two extreme positions. The invention includes an arm that pivots around a rotation axis which supports the mobile element; an elastic torsion rod aligned along the axis, secured respectively to the arm and to the support at axially offset points; two mechanical stops mounted on the support which determine two extreme angular configurations of the arm in which the element is in its extreme positions, the elastic torsion rod tending to bring the arm into a predetermined one of these configurations; two pair of complementary magnetic latching elements mounted either on the support or on the arm, the complementary units of either pair being adapted to be opposite when the arm is in one or the other of the extreme configurations; and launching members mounted on the support designed to give a launching impetus to the arm from each to the other of the extreme configurations.","U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,128,796 and 4,995,700 to Barney et al. disclose magnetically operated shutter mechanisms that will function in cryogenic or cryogenic zero gravity environments to selectively block radiation such as light from passing through a window to a target object such as a mirror or detector located inside a cryogenic container such as a Dewar. The mechanism includes a shutter paddle blade that is moved by an electro-magnetically actuated torquing device between an open position where the target object is exposed to ambient radiation or light, and a closed position where the shutter paddle blade shields the ambient radiation or light from the target object. The purpose of the shuttering device is to prevent the mirror or other target object from being directly exposed to radiation passing through the window located on the side wall of the Dewar, thereby decreasing or eliminating any temperature gradient that would occur within the target object due to exposure to the radiation. A special nylon bearing system is utilized to prevent the device from binding during operation and the paddle blade is also thermally connected to a reservoir containing the cryogen to further reduce the internal temperature.","Unfortunately, each of the above-described, prior art devices is relatively large and complex, and is not adaptable for use in small or medium format cryogenically cooled infrared cameras. Moreover, the prior art mechanisms appear to be prone to temperature variations which would affect their ability to remain fully functional in extreme environments.","There remains a significant need for a cryogenic shutter mechanism that, when actuated, provides the infrared radiation sensor (imaging system) with a view of a very low temperature surface in order to calibrate the zero radiation reference level in the imaging system. To the best of the knowledge of the present inventors, no such apparatus exists, and no one has endeavored to implement a calibration method that relies on an absolute measurement of scene radiance (thereby requiring a baseline measurement of zero radiance using a cryogenic shutter mechanism as described to provide the imaging system with a temporary view of some object possessing zero radiance).","It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an improved infrared imaging system shutter assembly that operates reliably when subjected to cryogenic conditions.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a cryogenic infrared imaging system shutter assembly that, when actuated, provides the infrared imaging system with a view of a very low temperature (i.e. \u201czero radiance\u201d) surface.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a cryogenic infrared imaging system shutter assembly that operates in a sliding guillotine fashion to minimize the effect of extreme temperature variations.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide a cryogenic infrared imaging system shutter assembly that requires a minimal voltage pulse for actuation.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a cryogenic infrared imaging system shutter assembly that is very small in physical size and lightweight, and which is fabricated of strong, lightweight materials for optimum durability and longevity, and yet which is economical to manufacture.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an infrared imaging system calibration method that relies on an absolute measurement of scene radiance (thereby requiring a baseline measurement of zero radiance using the above-described cryogenic shutter assembly to provide the imaging system with a temporary view of some object possessing zero radiance).","These and other objects are accomplished by a miniature cryogenic shutter assembly, operable at temperatures as low as 80.5K (\u2212192.65\u00b0 C.) in vacuums measuring <10torr (mm Hg), for use in infrared imaging systems. The present invention generally comprises an actuator and a shutter mechanism. The actuator is preferably a miniature solenoid assembly capable of operation on a voltage pulse of between 8\u201328 VDC even when subjected to extreme environments (e.g. vacuums of <10torr, temperatures below 90K). The shutter mechanism preferably includes a single shutter blade and is also capable of operation when subjected to extreme environments. Upon application of an appropriate voltage pulse, the shutter blade is moved into position in front of the infrared radiation sensor (i.e. occluding the infrared imaging system's aperture). When the voltage pulse is removed, a spring returns the shutter blade to its original position, reopening the imaging system's aperture.","The miniature cryogenic shutter assembly of the present invention provides a \u201czero radiance\u201d reference measurement for an infrared imaging system, thereby allowing absolute scene radiance to be determined. The present invention is compact enough to fit small\/medium-sized infrared imaging systems and is designed to operate in a vacuum and at extremely low temperatures (e.g. interplanetary space). The present invention is fabricated of a variety of strong, lightweight materials to provide the durability\/longevity required by the nature of its usage. Its design is simple and straightforward, and can be economically manufactured.","In accordance with the method of the present invention, a method of calibrating an infrared imaging system is disclosed in which a miniature cryogenic shutter assembly is used to provide a zero radiance reference measurement, thereby allowing absolute scene radiance to be determined.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","20","30"]},"The absolute radiance measurement will now be described in more detail with reference to , which, is a graphical representation the absolute measurement scheme in accordance with the present invention.","To accomplish the absolute measurement, it is assumed that:\n\nS % L\n","i.e. that the signal coming out of the camera is in some way proportional to the input radiance. Next, a radiometric gain factor is defined, so that\n\n\u2003\u2003(1)\n","Assume L(0)\/L(n)=S(n)*R, where L(n) is the noise equivalent radiance.","So,\n\n()=(Total)\u2212(()+())\u2003\u2003(2)\n\n()=(World)\u2212()\u2003\u2003(3)\n","Where S(m) is the valid measurement signal, S(total) is the total signal from the instrument, S(FPA) is the signal arising from the instrument when the irradiance of the focal approaches 0 and S(n) is the contribution to the instrument signal which arises from all noise sources (shot, photon, etc.). L(m) is the measurable radiance, L(world) is the total radiance of all sources external to the focal plane and L(n) is the radiance analogue of the instrument noise.","Substituting equations (2) and (3) into (1) yields,\n\n((Total)\u2212(()+()))*(World)\u2212()\u2003\u2003(4)\n","Rearranging equation (4) yields the following:\n\n((Total)\u2212(()+()))()=(World)\u2003\u2003(5)\n","If it is assumed that L(World)=L(Scene)+L(Optics), this can be substituted into equation 5 to yield:\n\n((Total)\u2212(()+()))()=(Scene)+(Optics)\u2003\u2003(6)\n","Then, rearranging equation (6) yields the following:\n\n((Total)\u2212(()+()))()\u2212(Optics)=(Scene)\u2003\u2003(7)\n\nor\n\n((Total)\u2212(()+()))()\u2212(Scene)=(Optics)\u2003\u2003(8)\n\nIn practicing the method, equations 7 and 8 are the ones used in actually reducing data from radiometric imagers, but to use them it is necessary to evaluate all the terms. The evaluation of S(Total) and S(0) are obvious, but the evaluation of the other terms is less so.\n","i. Evaluation of S(FPA)","The zero point of the focal plane is the most critical number to know since it establishes the reference point of the system. This number is simple to measure, but requires that the camera be equipped with a cold shutter in accordance with the apparatus of the present invention (as will be described). The cold shutter is mounted to the camera's cold finger so that it is at a very low temperature (<90K) and thus has effectively zero radiance (within the typical 3\u20135 \u03bcm bandpass of a midwave infrared imager this value will be \u02dc9\u00d710W\/sr cm@90K). This shutter is used to occlude the focal plane and S(FPA) is measured. This shutter may be actuated either remotely via an actuator (motor or solenoid) or manually.","ii. Evaluation of S(n)","The noise signal S(n) is somewhat more difficult to define, but an obvious if somewhat simplistic method is to statistically evaluate a scene of uniform radiance and select some sigma multiple to be the noise level. This is done by presenting a source of uniform (but not necessarily known) radiance to the imager, which completely fills the field of view (FOV) and performing a measurement. Other methods which involve statistical evaluation of the noise of a scene can also be used.","iii. Evaluation of R","The evaluation of the radiometric gain R of the system is a straightforward radiometric calibration procedure. For a given parametric configuration (gain state) radiometric imagers are well behaved with respect to frame integration time, so it is best to calibrate at an integration time that yields a good signal\/noise (S\/N) for the available calibration source, even if the measurement is to be performed with a different integration time. It is necessary, however, to be aware that if calibrating with relatively low radiance standards that extraneous factors (path radiance, optics radiance, etc.) can affect the accuracy of the calibration.","One way to avoid the foregoing problem for any calibration is to do a differential calibration. In the differential calibration method, the following can be assumed:\n\nSignal(Source)\u03b1Radiance(Source)+Radiance(path)+Radiance(Optics)\u2003\u2003(9)\n\nand\n\nSignal(Reference)\u03b1Radiance(Reference)+Radiance(path)+Radiance(Optics)\u2003\u2003(10)\n","Eliminating terms and rearranging yields:\n\nSignal(Source)\u2212Signal(Reference)\u03b1Radiance(Source)\u2212Radiance(Reference)\u2003\u2003(11)\n\nand R is defined as\n\nRadiance(Source)\u2212Radiance(Reference)\/Signal(Source)\u2212Signal(Reference)\u2003\u2003(12)\n","iv. Evaluation of L(n)","L(n) can be evaluated empirically, and conceptually it is easiest to think of it as the point where the camera \u201cturns on\u201d. However, this number is defined as S(n)\u00d7R.","v. Evaluation of L(Optics)","An accurate evaluation of the optics radiance is critical for the measurement of low radiance targets (sky, trees, birds, bees, etc.). In accordance with the present method, we fill the field with a scene of zero radiance using a \u201cnull cavity blackbody\u201d, e.g., an emitter cup submerged in a liquid nitrogen bath. A shutter closes the cavity when the source is not in use and a nitrogen bleed system keeps the cavity purged with dry nitrogen. In use, the source is mated to the camera using a foam adapter ring and the shutter is lifted and the measurement is taken. This process takes less than 10 seconds. One advantage of this system is that the emitter surface is at approximately \u2212196EC. At this temperature uncertainties in surface emissivity and temperature become fairly meaningless.","vi. Cyclic Integration","At a given integration time and gain state, even the best radiometric imagers have a limited dynamic range. For example the Santa Barbara Focal Plane SBF125 InSb camera can handle changes in scene radiance of about a factor of 350. An automatic gain control (AGC) system, even if practical, would be of limited utility since as sudden increase in the radiance of a scene segment would result in the loss of information about dimmer segments in the scene. A much better method for achieving a large dynamic range is to sacrifice frame frequency. Several integration time steps are stored in the camera and cycled through on a frame-by-frame basis, this process is called cyclic integration or \u201csuperframing\u201d, a term coined by Santa Barbara Focal Plane. A Superframe consists of 2 or more subframes and is constructed by merging. For example, a camera may have a total frame rate of 120 Hz and be capable of supporting 4 integration times; such a camera would have a Superframe rate of 30 Hz.","The equations 7 and 8 discussed above are especially suited for supporting Superframe cameras. Since these cameras render all frames in absolute radiance units the segmentation and combination of individual subframes is algorithmically trivial, all the operator needs to know are the radiance limits for the individual integration times, quantities that are easily measurable during the calibration process. Such a method for 3 subframes results in an increase in dynamic range from a factor of 350 to approximately 500,000 at a frame rate of 100 Hz (Superframe rate of 33 Hz).","The flowchart in  details the steps involved in generating a Superframe from 4 subframes. The individual frames have been gain and offset normalized for pixel non-uniformity before entering the data stream.","As stated above, the zero point of the focal plane S(FPA) establishes the reference point of the system. This number requires that the camera be equipped with a cold shutter in accordance with the apparatus of the present invention. The cold shutter is mounted to the camera's cold finger so that it is at a very low temperature (<90K) and thus has effectively zero radiance. This shutter is used to occlude the focal plane and S(FPA) is measured.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIGS. 4 and 5","b":"20"},"The miniature cryogenic shutter assembly  generally comprises an actuator  and a shutter mechanism .","The actuator  is preferably a commercially-available, miniature solenoid assembly requiring an actuation signal, or voltage pulse, of between 8\u201328 VDC.

The counter shaft  is formed with a circumferential groove  proximate its opposing distal end and an annular ring  near the midpoint of its length. The counter shaft  and shutter blade  are preferably fabricated of aluminum. Again, these components may also be fabricated of ceramic, composite or other temperature insensitive materials. The surface of the shutter blade  that faces toward the infrared imaging system, when positioned to occlude its aperture, is preferably coated with a layer of non-reflective, flat, black paint or like absorptive coating with a high emissivity (\u03b5>0.95).","The actuator support plate  is a substantially circular plate formed with two, diametrically opposed bosses ,  that define the end points of a groove  that extends completely across a face of the plate .

The spring  is placed over the section of the shaft  protruding through the hole  before the retaining ring  is snapped into the groove  formed proximate the distal end of the counter shaft . The spring force present in this configuration serves to align the aperture  in the shutter blade  with the aperture  formed in the center of the support plate  by pulling the shaft  through the hole  until the ring  formed in the shaft  rests against the inside surface of the boss .","The actuator  may then be attached to the assembly  by inserting its shaft  through the hole  formed in the other boss  extending from the support plate  and connecting the distal end of the shaft  to the bracket  formed on the shutter blade .
