The entire contents of the aforementioned application are incorporated herein by reference.","Technical Field","The present disclosure relates generally to wireless communication networks, and more particularly but not limited to adaptive scheduling of heterogeneous packets across a downlink communication channel in the wireless communication networks.","Background","In present day scenario, rapid increase in mobile subscriber base and recent emergence of applications such as MMOG (multimedia online gaming), mobile TV, web 2.0, high definition video streaming, live meeting etc., have resulted in large scale increase of mobile data usage. Typically, a base station has a limited cell bandwidth of 1.4 to 20 MHz. As a result, users will be faced with service refusal, degradation in quality of service. Also, performance of the base station may be degraded due to increased handover delays, underutilization of radio resources etc.","For example LTE (long term evolution) network tries to address the above issues, by providing high sector capacity through a frequency reuse factor of 1, improve end-user throughputs by providing faster download and upload rates, scalability and reduced user plane latency through simplified architecture and bringing significantly improved user experience with full mobility.","In a LTE network, the backhaul connectivity between the base station (referred to as evolved node B eNodeB or eNB) and core network will be completely packet-switched network (all Internet Protocol based). A packet-switched network imposes challenges on eNB to achieve overall network performance and efficient resource utilization because of inherent issue of non-guaranteed packet arrival rate in the core network. Thus it leads to the fact that, high network bandwidth do not always conclude in better network performance.","The LTE has simplified base station or eNB architecture with each layer in the protocol stack playing a vital role. The network architecture of the eNB comprises a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer, a radio link control (RLC) layer, and a medium access control (MAC) layer. Downlink scheduling of the data packets is the main functionality of the MAC layer. However, due to uncertainty in wireless channel conditions, huge traffic load, and uneven packet arrival pattern, the performance of the MAC layer in providing downlink scheduling in a high speed wireless communication network is greatly hampered.","In view of the above drawbacks, there is a need for an improved downlink scheduler that can improve performance of the high speed wireless communication network.","Disclosed herein is a method for efficient scheduling of downlink data traffic at a base station. The method may include receiving, at a first protocol layer, one or more downlink data packets from a second protocol layer; classifying the one or more downlink packets into one or more categories of packets based on transmission type and radio transmission state of the one or more downlink packets; scheduling one or more first packets from each of the one or more categories of packets based on a pre-determined priority order of the one or more categories of packets and a predetermined packet transmission share associated with each of the one or more categories of packets; transmitting the one or more first packets from the one or more categories of packets in a transmission time interval; updating a pre-determined priority order of the one or more categories of packets and a pre-determined packet transmission share associated with each of the one or more categories of packets after a predetermined time interval; and scheduling one or more second packets from the one or more categories of packets based on the updated pre-determined priority order of the one or more categories of packets and a predetermined packet transmission share associated with each of the one or more categories of packets in the transmission time interval subsequent to the updating.","In an aspect of the invention, a system for efficient scheduling of downlink data traffic at a base station is disclosed. The system may include one or more hardware processors; and a memory storing instructions that, when executed by the one or more hardware processors, cause the one or more hardware processors to perform operations.
