title: System and method for noise filtering data compression
abstract: Noise filtering data compression removes noise differences from successive frames in a video signal. This is accommodated by accessing successive frames corresponding to a video signal. Frequency domain representations, for example first row and first column coefficients in the quantized DCT result matrix, are used to determine whether the block in the current frame should be considered identical to the corresponding block in the previous frame. If such is the case, the block data is rendered identical such as by overwriting one for the other. This removes any noise differential between the corresponding blocks from the successive frames.

No. 60\/861,978, filed on Dec. 1, 2006 by Takashi Kosaka and entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Data Compression,\u201d the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to data compression and more particularly to data compression by eliminating unnecessary data representative of noise in related video frames.","2. Description of the Related Art","For motion compression by MEPG, MPEG treats the video as a frame unit, and uses differences between the continuous frames to perform compression. That is, compression relies upon the fact that the similarities between successive frames do not need to be repeatedly stored; instead, only the differences between the frames generally need to be stored.","Motion picture data converted to A\/D contains noise (this noise is not photo's random noise) that varies per frame unit. However, to the human eye these noises are present even where sequential frames in the motion picture appear to be the same. For example, even when a motion-less object is recorded in a controlled environment, the resulting frame data will have different pixel values in the RGB domain.","A P-Picture for a system like MPEG uses difference data to perform motion compression. Compression rate increases where there is a lot of difference data. Since the noise data is treated as difference data, the compression rate decreases as a result of noise, even if the noise is for a picture having motion-less objects as described above.","The present invention provides noise filtering data compression. According to one aspect, noise filtering data compression removes noise differences from successive frames in a video signal. This is accommodated by accessing successive frames corresponding to a video signal (e.g., a current frame and a previous frame). It is determined whether a component of a given block in the current frame should be considered identical to the component of the corresponding given block in the previous frame by comparing respective representations of the components of the blocks in the frequency domain. For example, coefficients in the quantized DCT result matrix may be compared to support this determination. When it is determined that the component of the given block should be considered identical to the component of the corresponding given block in the previous frame, they are caused to be identical. For example, this may be done by overwriting the relevant block data for the current block with that from the previous block.","In one example, determining whether the component of the given block in the current frame should be considered identical to the component of the corresponding given block in the previous frame may comprise accessing respective frequency domain result matrices for the component in the current frame and the previous frame, and determining that the component of the given block in the current frame should be considered identical to the component of the corresponding given block in the previous frame where a plurality (or majority) of the values in the first row and a plurality (or majority) of the values in the first column in the respective frequency results matrices are equal as between the current frame and the previous frame. In one embodiment, the first five values in the row and column of respective 8\u00d78 frequency results matrices may be effective.","The present invention can be embodied in various forms, including business processes, computer implemented methods, computer program products, computer systems and networks, user interfaces, application programming interfaces, and the like.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous details are set forth, such as flowcharts and system configurations, in order to provide an understanding of one or more embodiments of the present invention. However, it is and will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required in order to practice the present invention.","According to one aspect, the present invention determines whether successive portions of a frame (e.g., an 8\u00d78 pixel block) should be considered identical, and if such is the case, ensures that substantially identical noise is represented for the same corresponding portion (e.g., the same corresponding 8\u00d78 pixel block) in successive frames. By doing this, the data inherits the same noise, and as a result there will be no difference due to differences in the noise data. This reduces differences due to such noise and thus increases the compression rate.","In one example, successive 8\u00d78 pixel blocks are determined to be identical by comparing the first row and the first column of coefficients in the DCT result matrix (following DCT transform and quantization) for the same position in a picture. The comparison is performed on a block-by-block basis, within respective frames.","In one example, the noise is made to be substantially identical by rewriting frame N's data over the original N+1 frame per luminance and chrominance difference signal components.","As described above, the present invention may be embodied in various forms, including but not limited to computer systems and computer program products. By way of example, the computer system may implement a processor and memory, with the former executing instructions stored in memory to carry out the functionality described herein. It is understood that any conventional computing component may be implemented. It is also understood that the computing component may be a personal computer, laptop computer, consumer electronics, portable computer, cellular phone, etc.","The inputted motion pictures perform compression per frame unit, and judge the existing motion pictures that are same between frame N and frame N+1. This judgment is not based on finding the exact match between the motion pictures. Instead, comparison of characteristics that the motion pictures share facilitates the decision.","The precondition for the decision is done by YUV conversion that divides the motion picture in 8\u00d78 regions. Alternatively, RGB or other conversion may be implemented, but YUV conversion is discussed primarily below to avoid confusion. If the inputted motion pictures are already in YUV, then each element is divided into 8\u00d78 regions. The original data for the divided luminance and chrominance difference signal components are stored.","The filter performs DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) to luminance and chrominance difference signal components, and then executes quantization. The quantization is done by multiplying Table 1 by a floating point number's coefficient (e.g., 0.02\u2266coefficient\u22662.55). When the coefficient's value is small, closer examination of quantization luminance and chrominance difference signal components is done, and as the coefficient's value increases, the level of examination decreases.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE I"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"17, 17, 21, 24, 28, 36, 41, 47,"]},{"entry":[{},"17, 19, 21, 27, 29, 33, 43, 47,"]},{"entry":[{},"19, 21, 27, 35, 39, 41, 45, 49,"]},{"entry":[{},"23, 25, 33, 39, 43, 47, 59, 60,"]},{"entry":[{},"27, 28, 39, 47, 55, 57, 69, 80,"]},{"entry":[{},"37, 39, 47, 68, 69, 71, 73, 81,"]},{"entry":[{},"45, 46, 49, 78, 79, 80, 82, 82,"]},{"entry":[{},"47, 49, 50, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The quantized data makes the 8\u00d78 motion picture's frequency characteristics for luminance and chrominance difference signal components. For the 8\u00d78 data that underwent DCT and quantization processes, (0, 0) becomes the component for direct current, and other values become alternating currents.","DCT assumes that the factors in 8\u00d78 areas are physically continuous values (like water surface or film). When the factors are physically continuous, the resulting frequency matrix of DCT concentrates to (0,0) (e.g., if all values are same, the resulting frequency of DCT has only value of (0,0)). When the factors in 8\u00d78 area are discontinuous values, the result of the frequency matrix is diffusion. However the diffusion of values in the matrix has characteristics by the discontinuous line (boundary) in 8\u00d78 areas. The discontinuous line (boundary) has direction in 8\u00d78 area. The characteristic is related by the direction of the discontinuous line (boundary). When the direction of the discontinuous line (boundary) is vertical in 8\u00d78 areas, the resultant frequency matrix is strongly affected in the first row of the matrix.  is a schematic diagram illustrating an example of a vertical discontinuous line and corresponding DCT signal data ().","Also, when the direction of the discontinuous line (boundary) is the horizontal, the result frequency matrix strongly affects the first column of the matrix.  is a schematic diagram illustrating an example of a horizontal discontinuous line and corresponding DCT signal data (). If the direction of the discontinuous line (boundary) is horizontal and vertical, the first row and the first column of the matrix are affected by DCT calculation.","Therefore, the decision whether one has the same 8\u00d78 picture in two frames compares the first row and column of the DCT result matrix in the same position of the picture. Also, high order of the first row and column in the matrix represents high frequency value of luminance and chrominance different signal components. High frequency component might be 0 by the quantization.","To further explain the significance of the first row and column of the DCT result matrix, it is noted that the DCT result matrix represents frequency characteristics of Y, U and V. The frequency characteristics comes together low frequency by the DCT. The low frequency represents major characteristics of the 8\u00d78's Y, U and V. Comparison of more than the first row and column results in the collection of high frequency characteristics, and these high frequency characteristics might be noises or unknown value.","As also noted, the human eye cannot recognize high frequency in the picture particularly as it changes from frame-to-frame. Therefore the system compares a pair of Y, U or VcN(x+a,y+a) and Y, U or VcN\u22121(x+a,y+a) (where a ranges from 0 to n) in the first row and column. When the YcN(x,y) and YcN\u22121(x,y) is different, the corresponding 8\u00d78 block in the physical position of (x, y) is different (e.g., there is motion, or the scene has changed).","When the filter decides that the data have the same characteristics, frame N's original data is rewritten over the original N+1 frame per luminance and chrominance difference signal components. By doing this, noise gets inherited in frame intervals; therefore, there is no more difference in noise data.","To further explain, it is noted that the result of frequency matrix of DCT in Y, U and V, does not represent physical position in the original 8\u00d78 block. In case of two dimensional matrix of the DCT's result represents frequency order. The lowest (such as DC) is in location (0,0) and the high frequency is in location (7,7) of the 8\u00d78 matrix.","When the result matrix of the DCT and the quantization has high frequency coefficients, the original 8\u00d78 data (Y, U and V) has the following:","(1) The original 8\u00d78 block has discontinuous region(s); and","(2) The original 8\u00d78 block has specific texture of the object's surface or noises.","When the original 8\u00d78 block has discontinuous regions, the result matrix strongly affects the first row or column. (See, e.g., ). This is why the first row and column in frame N and frame N\u22121 are preferably compared at each result of the matrix. When the same DCT result matrix for Frame N and Frame N\u22121 is different, the original 8\u00d78 block is quite a different picture in the same position.","When the process is finished, frame N+1's data becomes frame N's data, and then prepares to perform the same process over for this newly created frame N. The process thus determines whether blocks should be considered identical and removes additional noise, which increases compression efficiency.","The details of the determination and comparison of coefficients is further explained as follows. Of course, the frame data is represented by RGB24 pixel data. RGB24 pixel data is converted to YUV data, where Y, U and V represent the frame pictures. Each Y, U and V is divided 8\u00d78 block data by the filter system. For instance, Frame N, x and y is block location in the frame.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003For Y:"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003YN(x,y), YN(x+1,y), YN(x+2,y)...

The DCT module  performs the DCT transform and related operations, and the quantization module  quantizes the resultant DCT result matrix to provide a series of coefficients that comprise the quantized DCT result matrix. The block comparison module  performs the comparison of certain of these coefficients from successive frame data in order to carry out determinations of sameness (i.e., block data that should be considered identical), and the block data management module  carries out filtering, preferably by overwriting the current block data with the previous block data, where such sameness is determined.","The functionality of these modules is further described with reference to , which illustrates another example of a process for noise filtering data compression . The video data for the current frame (N) is received , and YUV conversion is performed  upon the current frame (N) to obtain YUV block data. Particularly the luminance and chrominance components may be denoted as YN(x,y), UN(x,y) and VN(x,y), as described further above.","DCT transform and quantization are performed  to obtain quantized DCT result matrices for respective blocks in the current frame N. These correlate to the YUV block data, and are denoted YcN(x,y), UcN(x,y) and VcN(x,y), also as described further in the detailed equations above. From past processing, the corresponding quantized DCT result matrices for the previous frame have been retained (e.g., in the memory\/buffer). These are denoted YcN\u22121(x,y), UcN\u22121(x,y) and VcN\u22121(x,y). With this data available, a comparison  of the first row and first column of the quantized DCT result matrices for respective blocks in the current frame N of the video data is made. This comparison is ultimately performed for all of the blocks in the frame.","If the first row and the first column are determined to be different, then it is determined that there is motion in the picture, information that should be retained, so the processing does not overwrite the current block data (or component thereof) in that case. However, if the first row and first column of quantized DCT result matrix for a component of a given block (e.g., say the given block where x=9, y=11) are determined to be the same, then it is determined that there is not motion in the picture. In this instance, the processing overwrites the YUV block data of the current frame with corresponding YUV block data from the previous frame. Specifically, it sets YN(9,11)=YN\u22121(9,11) where the first row and column of quantized DCT results matrices YcN(9,11) and YcN\u22121(9,11) are determined to be the same. The determination that a rows\/columns are the same may rely upon a subset of the values in the rows\/columns, preferably a majority of the coefficients. Alternatively all of the coefficients may be examined.","The above comparison and overwriting continues until () all of the blocks have been processed for the frame, which may then be encoded (e.g., MPEG)  and stored, transmitted or otherwise processed further. The process proceeds to the \u201cnext\u201d current frame and the described process is repeated.","Thus embodiments of the present invention produce and provide noise filtering data compression.
