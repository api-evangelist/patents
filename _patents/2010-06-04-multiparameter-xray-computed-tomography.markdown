The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to the field of x-ray imaging. More particularly, embodiments of the invention relate to methods, systems, and apparatus for imaging, which can be used in a wide range of applications, including medical imaging, security screening, and industrial non-destructive testing to name a few.","2. Description of the Related Art","Since its invention in 1973, X-ray computed tomography (CT) has revolutionized medical imaging and become a cornerstone of modern radiology. Improving resolution and reducing dose are two critical factors in biomedical applications and remain the focuses of CT research. With the emergence of multislice spiral CT in 1998, cone-beam scanning is recognized as a major mode for medical CT and widely used in numerous diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Moreover, the rapid development of small animal models, especially those with genetically engineered mice, has generated the need for preclinical imaging, reaching image resolution in the micron range. These scanners, while producing high spatial resolution images, do not allow high contrast and low dose imaging in either patients or animal models. For example, many normal and diseased tissues such as cancers display poor image contrast in current X-ray images as they have very similar attenuation characteristics.","X-ray mammography is currently the most prevalent imaging modality for screening and diagnosis of breast cancers. The use of mammography results in a 25%-30% decreased mortality rate in screened women, however, a multi-institutional trial funded by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) suggested that approximately 30% of cancers were not detected by screening mammography, and 70%-90% of biopsies performed based on suspicious mammograms were negative. Some false negative and false positive diagnoses often led to missed cancers and inappropriate biopsies.","Conventional medical x-ray imaging, such as mammography, relies on the attenuation contrast mechanism. Biological soft tissues encountered in clinical and pre-clinical imaging (such as breast tissue, gray-white brain matter, liver, mouse tissues, etc.), however, consist mainly of light elements. As a result, the elemental composition is nearly uniform without much density variation. Because of the insufficient contrast between the healthy and malignant tissues, some early-stage tumors cannot be identified using attenuation contrast imaging. In some cases, the x-ray attenuation contrast is relatively poor and cannot offer satisfactory sensitivity and specificity, a key factor limiting the success rate in diagnosing diseased tissue.","Specifically for diagnosing breast cancer, although X-ray CT of the breast can potentially improve diagnostic accuracy over mammography, the state-of-the-art breast CT scanner is still based on the attenuation mechanism. As a result, the use of breast CT requires an intravenous contrast medium and a high radiation dose, since elemental composition is almost uniform with little density variation in breast tissues. Still, it is rather difficult for breast CT to discern early-stage breast cancers.","Absorption and scattering are two largely independent properties of an object. Generally speaking, each is an important factor in characterizing an object optically. The literature already reported that scattering coefficients contain important physiological and pathological information for cancer screening and other purposes. The x-ray scattering in the biological tissue provides an effective contrast mechanism for x-ray imaging that may well outperform or effectively complement attenuation-based imaging. Scattering-based imaging can improve or enable diagnosis for early-stage cancer, and has widely applications to soft tissue imagings. By reconstructing both absorption and scattering properties, x-ray CT can be elevated to the next level with major healthcare benefits.","Driven by major practical needs for better X-ray imaging, exploration into contrast mechanisms other than attenuation has been active for decades, especially in terms of small angle scattering (essentially, Rayleigh scattering) and refraction of X-rays, which are also known as dark-field and phase-contrast imaging, respectively.","Up to now, X-ray Rayleigh scattering-based imaging has been limited to in vitro studies, incapable of volumetric cone-beam scanning, lack of rigorous reconstruction theory, and made little progress into clinical practice.","Since 2006, grating-based X-ray dark-field and phase-contrast tomography is being developed using a hospital-grade X-ray tube, instead of a synchrotron facility or microfocus tube. More specifically, for example, Pfeiffer and coworkers proposed a grating interferometer technique to produce dark-field images using a hospital-grade x-ray tube. F. Pfeiffer, M. Bech, O. Bunk, P. Kraft, E. F. Eikenberry, Ch. Br\u00f6nnimann, C. Gr\u00fcnzweig, and C. David, \u201cHard-X-ray dark-field imaging using a grating interferometer,\u201d Nature Materials 7, 134-137 (2008). This technology utilizes the optical interference principles to yield high quality dark-field images. The boundaries and interfaces in the biological tissues produce strong signals in dark-field images, indicating detailed structural contours. Moreover, dark-field images have greater signal-to-noise ratios in soft tissues than bright-field counterparts acquired with the same incident X-ray dose. However, the major problems with this grating-based approach are small sample size, long imaging time, and high fabrication cost.","Such an imaging modality may greatly enhance sensitivity and specificity for soft tissue imaging, revealing subtle structural variation of tissues. However, the data acquisition procedure is quite time-consuming. The gratings with large sizes and high slit aspects are difficult to fabricate and model, especially since the analyzer absorption grating consists of Au pillars encased in epoxy and bounded using a frame.","In 2004, Harding proposed an x-ray coherent scattering imaging method. It uses an x-ray fan-beam to illuminate an object slice for acquisition of coherent scattering data with multiple detector rows. G. Harding, \u201cX-ray scatter tomography for explosives detection,\u201d Radiation Physics and Chemistry 71, 869-881 (2004). The central detector row of this technology receives the transmitted radiation while the out-of-center rows record only scattered radiation. The technique is able to perform a rapid scan of the object and provides a significant increment in image contrast for quantitative analyses. However, scattering cross-talks cannot be avoided in this imaging modality and would significantly degrade image quality. Efficient and high-quality acquisition of x-ray small-angle scattering signals is still a challenge.","Further, for example, to perform tomographic imaging from x-ray small-angle scattering signals, Strobl et al. proposed a method to simulate the broadening of the angular distribution of small angle scattering for dark field tomographic imaging. This broadening is related to both microscopic structure and multiple scattering along the path length through a matter. Strobl, M., W. Treimer, and A. Hilger, \u201c() ,\u201d Applied Physics Letters, 85, 488-490 (2004); and M. Strobl, C. Gr\u00fcnzweig, A. Hilger, I. Manke, N. Kardjilov, C. David, and F. Pfeiffer \u201c-,\u201d Physical Review Letters 101, 123902 (2008).","Harding and coworkers approximate the small-angle scattering propagation as a linear model and directly used the filtered backprojection algorithm to reconstruction scattering contrast images from dark field data. See, G. Harding (2004). However, the propagation of x-ray photons through matter is a complex process, which experiences both absorption and scattering simultaneously. A photon propagation model describes photon interaction with matter, and is essential for tomographic imaging.","Thus what is needed is an imaging modality having sufficient sensitivity and specificity to provide high contrast, high quality x-ray based images. Provided by embodiments of the invention are several novel approaches and associated systems for x-ray small-angle scattering based imaging to produce high-contrast images.","Provided in embodiments of the invention is a varying collimation methodology and other techniques for extraction of small-angle scattering signals for dark field tomography while traditional attenuation-based tomography can also be simultaneously performed in cone-beam geometry. The projection data acquired with a collimator of a sufficiently high collimation aspect ratio contain mainly the primary beam with little scattering, while the data acquired with an appropriately reduced collimation aspect ratio include both the primary beam and small-angle scattering signals. Analysis of these corresponding datasets will produce desirable dark-field signals, which can be used to reconstruct x-ray small-angle scattering images based on the analytic model of the x-ray dark-field developed by the inventors. The data acquisition scheme can be implemented by modifying the collimation technology. Further, it allows volumetric scanning such as with a circular and spiral trajectory.","Also provided by embodiments of the invention is the ability to achieve x-ray dark-field imaging with a multi-pinhole collimator and an anti-wide-angle scattering collimator to acquire x-ray small angle scattering signals. Source x-ray beams transmit through the multi-pinhole collimator to produce fan-shaped multiple pencil beams well separated from each other. One-to-one correspondence between pencil beams and detector elements is established to ensure the small-angle scattering photons generated from each pencil beam propagate toward its corresponding detector element center. The size of a detector element will be larger than that of a common CT detector for acquiring enough small-angle scattering information. An anti-scattering grid is placed in front of detectors to filter out wide-angle scattering photons and allow for small-angle scattering photons to reach its corresponding detector element from each pencil beam. The large size detector element helps fabricate a sufficiently high anti-wide-angle scattering grid to eliminate the cross-talk among scattering signals. The low-resolution induced from larger detectors can be compensated by continuously rotating the detector ring and the source collimator in the range of two neighboring pencil beams to increase the angular sampling rate and enhance the dark-field image resolution. This scheme can acquire high-quality x-ray small-angle scattering signals, allowing a significant reduction of the x-ray dose.","More specifically, provided by embodiments of the invention is an x-ray small-angle scattering photon transport model for development of novel algorithms to reconstruct 3D scattering images. The reconstruction procedure can be effectively implemented with computational complexity comparable to that of conventional attenuation-based CT algorithms.","Generally provided by embodiments of the invention are varying collimation schemes to extract dark-field signals. In embodiments, acquiring x-ray projection data multiple times with varying collimation is a key feature of obtaining high quality, high contrast images.","Embodiments of the present invention provide detection methods for extracting dark-field x-ray small-angle scattering signal data. The projection data acquired with a collimator of a sufficiently high collimation aspect ratio contain mainly the primary beam with little scattering, while the data acquired with an appropriately reduced collimation aspect ratio include both the primary beam and small-angle scattering signals. Analysis of these corresponding datasets will produce desirable dark-field signals, for example, by way of digital subtraction. The acquired extracted dark field signals can clearly reveal the structural information of tissues (or any object subject to the imaging) in terms of Rayleigh scattering characteristics.","Embodiments further provide methods for producing an x-ray image comprising: a) providing at least one first dataset of primary x-ray signals as a majority of its data capable of being presented as a first image of an object subjected to x-ray imaging; b) providing at least one second dataset comprising dark-field x-ray signals and primary x-ray signals as a majority of its data capable of being presented as a second image of the object; c) combining the first dataset and the second dataset using a computer comprising a computer readable medium embedded with processing means for obtaining a target dataset having more dark-field (small-angle scattering) x-ray signals than the first or second dataset alone for producing a target image of the object which has higher contrast quality than the images based on the first or second dataset alone.","Such methods can comprise providing the data using collimator-and-detector assemblies or configurations that differ with respect to collimator height, collimator aperture, imaging geometry, or distance between an object subjected to the imaging and the collimator-and-detector assembly.","Extracting the dark-field signal data can be performed using a computer and computer readable medium embedded with processing means is based on: a) Radon transform with respect to a small-angle scattering coefficient distribution derived from the principle of photon energy conservation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"ln","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["\u03a6","s"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"r","mn":"0"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["R","\u03b8"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}},{"msub":{"mi":["\u03a6","a"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"r","mn":"0"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["R","\u03b8"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}]}}}},{"msubsup":{"mo":"\u222b","mn":"0","mi":"R"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["\u03bc","s"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"r","mn":"0"},"mo":"+","mrow":{"mi":["s","\u03b8"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"s"}],"mo":"\u2062"}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"9.1"}}]}}}}},"where \u03a6(r+R\u03b8) is intensity of transmission photon and \u03a6(r+R\u03b8) is intensity of small-angle scattering photons on a detector, and Eq.

The following detailed description is presented for the purpose of describing certain embodiments in detail and is, thus, not to be considered as limiting the invention to the embodiments described.","Included in embodiments of the invention are methods for extracting x-ray small-angle scattering data and using this segregated data to produce a high quality, high contrast x-ray image. A technique for extracting the x-ray small-angle scattering data involves collecting the x-ray projection data multiple times with varying collimation before an x-ray detector array. In preferred embodiments, each x-ray sum is acquired at least twice using different collimation aspect ratios. The projection data acquired with a collimator of a sufficiently large aspect ratio (otherwise referred to as a high collimation aspect ratio) contain mainly the primary beam with little scattering. In contrast, the corresponding data acquired with an appropriately reduced collimation aspect ratio (otherwise referred to as a small or low collimation aspect ratio) include both small-angle scattering signals and the primary beam signals. Analysis of these paired or corresponding datasets (e.g., by digital subtraction of one dataset from the other) will produce or isolate the desired dark-field signals, in addition to traditional transmission measurement.","Conventionally, an anti-scattering grid is coupled with an area detector to eliminate x-ray scattering photons. The intensity of scattered radiation into a detector cell is determined by the height of the anti-scattering grid. The lower the height of the anti-scattering grid is, the more the scattered photons enter the detector cell. The height of the anti-scattering grid is typically selected to reject scattered photos as much as feasible subject to the cost associated with the fabrication process.","In embodiments of the invention, and depending on a specific imaging application, the height of the anti-scattering grid can be selected appropriately so that only the primary and small-angle scattering signals are intercepted. The resultant projection is denoted as PS. Then, the height of the anti-scattering grid can be increased significantly so that small-angle scattering signals are also rejected to acquire essentially only the transmission data. The corresponding projection is denoted as PT. Hence, the difference between PS and PT is understood to be closely correlated to the desirable small-angle scattering signals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"More specifically, as shown in , an imaging system  according to embodiments of the invention comprises an x-ray source  for producing and directing an x-ray beam  through an object of interest and a collimator-and-detector assembly  for receiving and detecting the x-ray projection data. One embodiment can include use of a dual-height collimator  in combination with a 2D detector array . In such a configuration, as shown, a circular cone-beam full-scan can be performed in combination with a dual-height collimator, for example, disposed in front of a 2D detector array.","In this setting, on the mid-plane each pixel on a given line is irradiated by two and only two x-rays along that same line but with two different collimation heights in the opposite directions respectively, sufficient for extraction of dark-field signals. It is underlined that scatter intensities measured in opposite directions in one full-scan are different from that measured in the same direction with two full-scans, since dark field integrals along the same line are generally asymmetric. Nevertheless, this type of difference can be well modeled and calibrated by the governing equation modified Leakeas-Larsen equation (MLLE), and then, for example, a generalized Feldkamp-type dark-field cone-beam reconstruction can be performed from the resultant dataset. It is possible to apply this technology to other cone-beam scanning trajectories, which could lead to other useful cone-beam algorithms. Actually, varying collimation gives us a new dimension to analyze scattering signals. We may use two or more collimation aspect ratios, depending on specific imaging requirements. It is also possible to have different varying collimation designs, for example, by changing the size of collimators for a fixed collimation height, implementing various collimation aspect ratios. Also, it is possible to vary the x-ray tube voltage or imaging geometry for more information.","X-ray single scattering model. While an x-ray pencil beam propagates along a straight line, this beam would become a source of photon scattering in an object being imaged. The number of scattered photons is directly related to density of matter, which can be quantified by the scattering coefficient. The x-ray scattering tomographic imaging is to reconstruct the scattering coefficient distribution in the object.

There exists a tetrahedron-based inhomogeneous Monte-Carlo optical simulator (TIM-OS) for optical light propagation in complex biological tissue. The core of this simulator is a fast propagation algorithm, which can move particles efficiently in complex geometry represented by tetrahedron finite element mesh. The TIM-OS framework was migrated for x-ray simulation to take advantage of the great speedup in optical simulation that can be achieved with this framework.","X-ray and matter interaction is very complex in general. In this prototype MC x-ray simulator, a simplified x-ray-matter interaction model was considered to cover the three major components in dark-field imaging: Photoelectric effect (absorption), Rayleigh scattering, and Compton scattering. Three parameters were used to describe the x-ray-matter interaction: absorption coefficient (\u03bc), scattering coefficient (\u03bc), and Rayleigh percentage (\u03b2).","The definition of absorption coefficient is the probability of x-ray absorption per unit path length. The scattering coefficient is the probability of an x-ray photon involved in scattering (Rayleigh or Compton scattering) per unit path length. Rayleigh percentage determines the likelihood both Rayleigh and Compton scattering.","After an x-ray photon is launched, a routine will be followed to find out the entering point of the photon into the phantom. While the photon is in the phantom, a step size will be generated based on the local absorption and scattering coefficients as s=\u2212ln(\u03be)\/(\u03bc+\u03bc), where \u03be is an uniform random number from region (0,1). If this photon needs to go across several different regions, the total step size s=\u03a3sis governing by the following equation: \u03a3(\u03bc+\u03bc)s=\u2212ln(\u03be). After the photon moves the free fly step, the photon will be absorbed or scattered based on the ratio of the absorption coefficient and scattering coefficient. If the photon is absorbed, the program will launch a new photon; otherwise, the photon is scattered.","According to \u03b2, the photon scattering will be governed by either the Rayleigh or Compton mechanism. Then, the scattering angle will be found according to the corresponding form factor. Then, the photon will be assigned another step size based on the current local x-ray parameters. These steps will be repeated until the photon moves out of the phantom.","Voxel-based and surface-based schemes are two of the most popular techniques employed in x-ray simulation to deal with a complex geometry. The surface-based scheme uses a triangle mesh to represent the interface between two regions and the surface. In this case, a simulation program needs to determine whether the involved photon moment will hit a triangle for each step. Given a complex geometry, the photon-triangle interaction could be very slow. The voxel-based scheme directly uses a CT reconstruction volume to represent geometry. This may introduce a huge computational overhead when a high-resolution volumetric image is used. The key idea underlying this tetrahedron-based scheme is that by modeling an object as a tetrahedron-based finite element mesh, TIM-OS can specify the photon-triangle interaction rapidly and recursively. In other words, since a photon starts its movement inside a tetrahedron, the ray-triangle interaction would only happen with one of the four triangles of the tetrahedron, reducing the searching space significantly.","Simulation Result.

Likewise, varying collimation heights can also be achieved by varying distance between the x-ray beam source and the detector regardless of where the object being imaged is disposed between the source and the detector. Providing exact distance dimensions would not be appropriate in this situation, as depending on a particular application, actual dimensions may or may not be relevant. What is important with respect to varying the distance between the source and the detector or varying the distance between the detector and the object being imaged is the change in distance from one imaging configuration to another.","Further, for example, to vary collimation height from one imaging scenario using a particular collimator-and-detector assembly configuration with a set collimator height, that collimator-and-detector assembly can be adjusted and set to a different collimator height.
