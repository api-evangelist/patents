Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the translational and post-translational processing and modification (e.g., glycosylation, cleavage (e.g., of signal sequence)) of proteins. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the desired modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. For example, expression in a bacterial system can be used to produce a non-glycosylated core protein product. However, a polypeptide expressed in bacteria may not be properly folded. Expression in yeast can produce a glycosylated product. Expression in eukaryotic cells can increase the likelihood of \u201cnative\u201d glycosylation and folding of a heterologous protein. Moreover, expression in mammalian cells can provide a tool for reconstituting, or constituting, the polypeptide's activity. Furthermore, different vector\/host expression systems may affect processing reactions, such as proteolytic cleavages, to a different extent.","In one embodiment, the host cell comprises two or more orthogonal gene switches.

Safety and tolerance is assessed through physical examinations (including ECOG performance status), vital signs measurements, serum chemistry, urinalysis, hematology, adverse events \u201cside-effects\u201d, and antibodies and cellular immune response to the adenovirus, components of RTS\u00ae, and the activator drug. To evaluate progress, single dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics\/ADME of the activator drug, analysis of hIL-12 levels, other immunomodulator levels, and cellular immune response (T cells) in biopsies of the target tumors, draining lymph nodes, and peripheral circulation, as well as a serum cytokine profile is measured.","For instance, 16 subjects with stage III and IV melanoma are divided into four cohorts with cohorts 1 and 2 containing three subjects and cohorts 3 and 4 containing 5 subjects. All subjects will receive a single intratumoral injection of 5\u00d710autologous DC transduced with adenoviral vector encoding human IL-12 and one or more other immunodulators under the RTS\u00ae control. For example, the subjects are administered an intratumoral injection of autologous DC transduced with adenoviral vector encoding human IL-12 under the RTS\u00ae control and an immunomodulator such as IL-15 or IL-21.","The subjects will receive a single daily oral dose of the activator drug (cohort 1: 0.01 mg\/kg, cohort 2: 0.1 mg\/kg, cohort 3: 1.0 mg\/kg or cohort 4: 3 mg\/kg) the first dose starting approximately 3 hours prior to the DC injection on day 1 and continuing for 13 more consecutive days. Additional injection(s) of adenovirally transduced autologous dendritic cells in combination with 14 single (once) daily oral doses of activator drug may be administered to eligible subjects who meet the criteria for pretreatment. Safety, tolerance, and dendritic cell function are assessed for all subjects in each group of cohort 1 for up to one month after injection of the in vitro engineered dendritic cells before enrolling subjects to receive the next highest dose of the activator drug. The safety assessment will continue in all subjects for 3 months after the initial injection of the engineered dendritic cells with the possibility of extending the follow-up period to a total of six months to monitor subject safety if toxicity is observed or the subject receives additional injection(s) of the dendritic cells.","Such a study demonstrates the safety and tolerance of a single or multiple intratumoral injection(s) of adenoviral transduced autologous dendritic cells in combination with the oral activator drug in subjects with melanoma. The study provides steady-state pharmacokinetics\/ADME of the oral activator drug. The study demonstrates functionality of the RTS\u00ae in subjects by measuring hIL-12 expression and the expression of the one or more other immunomodulators of adenovirus transduced autologous dendritic cells in target tumor and\/or draining lymph nodes in response to the activation of the RTS\u00ae by the oral administration of the activator drug. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the immunological effects of the adenoviral transduced autologous dendritic cells in terms of the cellular immune response in the target tumor, draining lymph nodes, and peripheral circulation following oral administration of the activator drug.","Melanoma is selected as an exemplary cancer. Melanoma in particular among solid tumors has been shown to respond to immunotherapy approaches, and melanoma tumors are readily accessible for intratumoral injection and biopsy. The subjects included in the study have unresectable stage III or IV melanoma, which has at least 0.5 cm in diameter, any tumor thickness, any number of lymph node involvement, in-transit metastases, or distant metastases.","It is to be understood that the foregoing described embodiments and exemplifications are not intended to be limiting in any respect to the scope of the disclosure, and that the claims presented herein are intended to encompass all embodiments and exemplifications whether or not explicitly presented herein","All patents and publications cited herein are fully incorporated by reference in their entirety."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 32"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
