The United States government may have certain rights in the invention.","The invention relates to methods of diagnosing the severity of heart failure or cardiac dysfunction in a subject. The invention further relates to monitoring the severity of heart failure in a subject and determining the prognosis of a subject that has suffered from heart failure. This invention also relates to methods of predicting who is at risk for heart failure and cardiac dysfunction when exposed to cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.","Virtually all forms of heart failure are characterized at the cellular level by abnormalities in growth and survival of cardiac myocytes. Animal studies have shown that the epidermal growth factor Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) is a critical regulator of these processes. NRG-1 is released from microvascular endothelial cells and acts as a paracrine growth factor via the ErbB family of tyrbsine kinase receptors expressed in cardiac myocytes to regulate myocyte growth, differentiation, and the stress response.","Important insights come from the cardiotoxic side effects of the chemotherapeutic agent trastuzumab (Herceptin\u00ae), a monoclonal antibody directed against ErbB2 (Her2) that blocks NRG-1\/ErbB signaling and is used to treat receptor-positive breast carcinoma. Exposure to trastuzumab can induce a clinically significant cardiomyopathy that often reverses after discontinuation of therapy.","From a public health standpoint, cardiac remodeling is the central feature of congestive heart failure, which accounts for 6.5 million hospital days each year. Heart failure has now become the fourth leading cause of adult hospitalizations in the US, and in adults greater than 65 years of age, it is the leading cause of hospitalizations. Five million Americans suffer from chronic heart failure, and the prevalence of this condition is rising. Overall, the prognosis for heart failure patients is poor. In 2001, nearly 53,000 patients died of heart failure as the primary cause, and the number of heart failure deaths has increased over time.","Currently, novel mechanistic biomarkers can improve our understanding of the complex syndrome of heart failure and might be more useful as a multimarker strategy for establishing diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring response to therapy.","Chemotherapy utilized in the treatment of breast cancer has potential negative effects on specific organs, with cardiac toxicity being a devastating complication associated with a poor prognosis. As both the incidence of breast cancer rises and the survival rates of patients improve, the magnitude of the problem has become increasingly significant. More than 2 million breast cancer survivors in the US alone are at risk for cardiotoxicity with the cardiovascular disease risk potentially exceeding that of recurrent cancer. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab, used to treat ErbB2 (Her-2) positive breast cancers, are associated with a 4-27% rate of heart failure and cardiac dysfunction worsened by anthracyclines.","Currently there is a lack of an established marker that is able to identify individuals at high risk of adverse cardiac events with exposure to chemotherapy. Accordingly, there exists a need to identify specific mechanistic biomarkers that are able to discriminate patients at risk for heart-failure and cardiac dysfunction when exposed to chemotherapy.","In one embodiment, the invention relates to a method for diagnosing heart failure severity in a subject at risk for heart failure, said method comprising: obtaining a biological sample from said subject; and analyzing said sample to determine the level of over-expression or under-expression of a biomarker associated with heart failure severity, and comparing said level of over-expression or under-expression to that of a pre-determined standard; wherein, and in another embodiment, said biomarker is NRG-1\u03b2.","In one embodiment, the invention relates to a method of monitoring response to therapy in a subject having suffered from heart failure said method comprising: obtaining a biological sample from said subject; and analyzing said sample to determine the level of over-expression or under-expression of a biomarker associated with heart failure severity, and comparing said level of over-expression or under-expression to that of a pre-determined standard; wherein, and in another embodiment, said biomarker is NRG-1\u03b2.","In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method of providing a prognosis for a subject having suffered from heart failure, said method comprising: obtaining a biological sample from said subject; and analyzing said sample to determine the level of over-expression or under-expression of a biomarker associated with heart failure severity, and comparing said level of over-expression or under-expression to that of a pre-determined standard; wherein, and in another embodiment, said biomarker is NRG-1\u03b2.","In one embodiment, the invention relates to a method for identifying a subject at risk of a chemotherapy-induced disease, said method comprising: obtaining a biological sample from said subject; and analyzing said sample to determine the level of over-expression or under-expression of a biomarker associated with heart failure severity, and comparing said level of over-expression or under-expression to that of a pre-determined standard; wherein, and in another embodiment, said biomarker is NRG-1\u03b2.","In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method for detecting a biomarker associated with heart failure severity in a subject, said method comprising: obtaining a biological sample from said subject; and analyzing said sample to determine the level of over-expression or under-expression of a biomarker associated with heart failure severity, and comparing said level of over-expression or under-expression to that of a pre-determined standard; wherein, and in another embodiment, said biomarker is NRG-1\u03b2.","Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description examples and figures. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and the specific examples while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.","The invention provided herein relates in one embodiment to a method for diagnosing heart failure severity in a subject at risk for heart failure, the method comprising: obtaining a biological sample from the subject; analyzing said sample to determine the level of over-expression or under-expression of a biomarker associated with heart failure severity, and comparing said level of over-expression or under-expression to that of a pre-determined standard; wherein, and in another embodiment, said biomarker is NRG-1\u03b2.","In another embodiment, the term \u201cnucleic acid\u201d refers, in one embodiment, to the phosphate ester polymeric form of ribonucleosides (adenosine, guanosine, uridine or cytidine; \u201cRNA molecules\u201d) or in another embodiment, to deoxyribonucleosides (deoxyadenosine, deoxyguanosine, deoxythymidine, or deoxycytidine; \u201cDNA molecules\u201d).","In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method of monitoring response to therapy in a subject having suffered from heart failure said method comprising: obtaining a biological sample from said subject; analyzing said sample to determine the level of over-expression or under-expression of a biomarker associated with heart failure severity, and comparing said level of over-expression or under-expression to that of a pre-determined standard; wherein, and in another embodiment, said biomarker is NRG-1\u03b2.","In one embodiment, the invention relates to a method for providing a prognosis for a subject having suffered from heart failure, the method comprising: obtaining a biological sample from the subject; analyzing said sample to determine the level of over-expression or under-expression of a biomarker associated with heart failure severity, and comparing said level of over-expression or under-expression to that of a pre-determined standard; wherein, and in another embodiment, said biomarker is NRG-1\u03b2.","In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method for identifying a subject at risk of cardiotoxicity from cancer therapy, the method comprising: obtaining a biological sample from the subject; analyzing said sample to determine the level of over-expression or under-expression of a biomarker associated with heart failure severity, and comparing said level of over-expression or under-expression to that of a pre-determined standard; wherein and in another embodiment, said biomarker is NRG-1\u03b2. In another embodiment, cardiotoxicity from cancer therapy is cardiac dysfunction or heart failure. In another embodiment, the method enables monitoring said subject for cardiac dysfunction.","In another embodiment, alterations in circulating NRG-1\u03b2 levels over time in breast cancer patients exposed to cardiotoxic cancer therapy are associated with incident cardiac dysfunction.","In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method for detecting a biomarker associated with heart failure severity in a subject, the method comprising: obtaining a biological sample from the subject; analyzing said sample to determine the level of over-expression or under-expression of a biomarker associated with heart failure severity, and comparing said level of over-expression or under-expression to that of a pre-determined standard; wherein and in another embodiment, said biomarker is NRG-1\u03b2. In another embodiment, the method further comprises the step of quantifying circulating NRG-1\u03b2 levels, wherein said quantification is enabled by using a novel indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay.","In one embodiment the invention further encompasses functional variants of the NRG-1\u03b2. In another embodiment, the NRG-1\u03b2 is any such NRG-1\u03b2 known in the art including, but not limited to, the following: NP001153473, NP001153471, NP001153467, NP039251, NP039250.","In one embodiment, the NRG-1 system is critical in mediating the cardiac stress response. In another embodiment, in response to oxidative stress, NRG-1\u03b2 expression increases in endothelial cell culture, and whole mouse hearts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury, NRG-1\u03b2 is detected in the perfusate.","In another embodiment, the NRG-1\/ErbB pathway, by promoting cell growth and survival and exerting beneficial neurohormonal effects, is a key modifier of adaptive remodeling and the cardiac stress response. In the adult animal, NRG-1 is expressed in endocardial and myocardial microvascular endothelial cells, and ErbB2 and ErbB4 in cardiomyocytes (). NRG-1 binds to ErbB4, which then homodimerizes or heterodimerizes with ErbB2, a major mediator of NRG-1's actions. NRG-1, stimulated by factors such as endothelin-1 and strain, ischemia and injury, provokes a pro-survival and pro-growth response by activating a variety of downstream signaling pathways, including: Akt\/PI3-kinase, MEK\/ERK, Src\/FAK, and NO synthase (). These signals oppose apoptosis, stimulate myocyte growth, and enhance cell-to-cell coupling. In one embodiment, NRG-1\u03b2 is involved in cardiomyocyte regeneration.","In one embodiment, an increase in circulating NRG-1\u03b2 reflects an impaired compensatory response, and in another embodiment, said increase in circulation is secondary to either an augmentation in NRG-1\u03b2 production or as a result of a reduction in receptor binding or activity. In another embodiment, the cardiac stress associated with heart failure leads to an increase in NRG-1\u03b2, and similar to natriuretic peptides like BNP, NRG-1\u03b2 levels are a marker of the underlying severity of disease.","In another embodiment, the invention encompasses use of NRG-1\u03b2 as a single or panel of biomarkers for potential clinical risk assessment. In another embodiment, this would lead to improved risk stratification and the use of directed therapy to modify known factors that are associated with worse outcomes.","In another embodiment, the methods provided herein further comprise jointly using first a NRG-1\u03b2 biomarker and an additional biomarker. In another embodiment, the association of NRG-\u03b2 with adverse outcomes is independent of the additional biomarker. In another embodiment the additional marker is BNP. In another embodiment, the assessment of the biomarkers jointly improves risk assessment over either marker alone in subjects with heart failure.","In another embodiment, the heart failure is ischemic heart failure, nonischemic heartfailure, hypertensive heart disease, inflammatory heart disease, valvular heart disease, coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy, cardiovascular disease, or cancer therapy-related disease.","In one embodiment, the subject is a human subject. In another embodiment, the subject is classified as having heart failure class I-IV according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA). In another embodiment, heart failure includes from class I-IV and both nonischemic and ischemic heart failure. In another embodiment, the relevance of circulating NRG-1\u03b2 is more prominent in the class III\/IV and ischemic groups. NYHA classes and associated symptoms include class I: No symptoms and no limitation in ordinary physical activity, e.g. shortness of breath when walking, climbing stairs etc. Class II: Mild symptoms (mild shortness of breath and\/or angina) and slight limitation during ordinary activity. Class III: Marked limitation in activity due to symptoms, even during less-than-ordinary activity, e.g. walking short distances (20-100 m). Comfortable only at rest. Class IV: Severe limitations. Experiences symptoms even while at rest. Mostly bedbound patients. In another embodiment, the subject is being monitored for the heart severity. In another embodiment, the subject is undergoing chemotherapeutic therapy.","In one embodiment, subjects are stratified by cardiomyopathy etiology (ischemic versus nonischemic) and heart failure severity (NYHA Class I\/II versus III\/IV).","In one embodiment, the Penn Heart Failure Study (PHFS), is a cohort of subjects with predominantly systolic dysfunction and eccentric hypertrophy, In another embodiment, the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, is a cohort of subjects with renal dysfunction. In another embodiment, PHFS and CRIC represent the full spectrum of cardiac remodeling encountered in clinical practice and a detailed, analytic study of these patients enable which subjects are the most appropriate targets for such an intervention. The PHFS cohort represents a rich population of heart failure subjects with a predominance of eccentric hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction. CRIC includes all remodeling phenotypes in patients with an accelerated course of cardiac remodeling secondary to stimuli associated with renal dysfunction. In another embodiment, the use of these two diverse cohorts enable a comprehensive and systematic depiction of the biologic and clinical significance of circulating NRG-1\u03b2.","In another embodiment, NRG-1\u03b2 is independently associated with heart failure characteristics. In another embodiment, NRG-1\u03b2 is independently associated with transplant-free survival in a chronic heart failure cohort.","In one embodiment, provided herein is a method of determining the longitudinal relationship between circulating NRG-1\u03b2 levels and left ventricular remodeling across the full spectrum of cardiac remodeling in a subject. In another embodiment, the subject has normal, concentric, or eccentric remodeling geometries. In another embodiment, longitudinal studies enable defining the patterns of circulating NRG-1\u03b2 over time, and the effects of changes in NRG-1\u03b2 level on changes in echocardiographic parameters of remodeling and survival. In another embodiment, defining a chronological sequence enables delineating a temporal relationship between exposure (NRG-1\u03b2 level) and outcome (adverse cardiac event or remodeling parameter).","In another embodiment, sustained elevations in circulating NRG-1\u03b2 levels are independently associated with a subsequent increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure and cardiovascular death. In yet another embodiment, circulating NRG-1\u03b2 levels are associated with progressive concentric cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy in a linear fashion in a said subject.","Cardiac remodeling is the broad term used to describe changes in size, geometry, and function of the left ventricle that occur in response to physiologic and pathologic stress. Echocardiographically, this is defined by ventricular geometry and classified as normal, concentric remodeling, concentric hypertrophy, and eccentric hypertrophy. This classification system is based upon measures of relative wall thickness (RWT) and left ventricular mass. RWT is defined by 2\u00d7 posterior wall thickness (PWT) divided by the left ventricular internal diameter at end-diastole (LVIDd), and ventricular mass is defined according to the Penn formula using the measures PWT, LVIDd, and septal wall thickness (0.8\u00d7{1.04[(LVIDd+PWT+SWT)\u2212(LVIDd)]}+0.6 g).","In another embodiment, \u201cconcentric remodeling\u201d refers to an increase in relative wall thickness and lack of cavity dilation with normal cardiac mass. In another embodiment, \u201chypertrophy\u201d refers to the increase in the volume of an organ or tissue due to the enlargement of its component cells. In another embodiment, \u201ceccentric hypertrophy\u201d refers to the development of cavity dilation and lack of increase in wall thickness.","Concentric remodeling reflects an increase in relative wall thickness and normal mass; concentric hypertrophy is marked by both an increase in RWT and mass; and eccentric hypertrophy by an increase in cardiac mass but with a normal RWT. This latter phenotype is often associated with an increase in cardiac volume and decrease in function (i.e. dilated cardiomyopathy). Over time, in response to exogenous stimuli, the ventricle can transition from one geometric phenotype to another. In one embodiment, the pathophysiologic and molecular signals vary according to remodeling geometry, e.g. dilated or thickened.","In one embodiment, the level of expression of the biomarker is determined by comparing it to the level of expression of a standard.

In another embodiment, it refers to pooled samples from subjects having heart failure, cardiac dysfunction, adverse conditions associated with heart failure, or adverse conditions as a result of having chemotherapeutic therapy. In another embodiment, it refers to pooled samples from subjects with known heart failure severity. In another embodiment, the standard may be ethnically- or gender- or age-matched recipients. It is to be understood that the standard may be derived from any subject, or pool of subjects, whose expression profile or profiles, once generated, is sufficient to detect even minute relative differences in expression, when compared to a test sample, or in another embodiment, to a subject that has heart failure, cardiac dysfunction, adverse conditions associated with heart failure, or adverse conditions as a result of having chemotherapeutic therapy. In another embodiment, a standard is determined as such by a skilled artisan.","In one embodiment, the standard is determined by the expression level profile in a healthy subject or pool of subjects.

While a particular diagnostic method may not provide a definitive diagnosis of a condition, it suffices if the method provides a positive indication that aids in diagnosis.","A \u201ctest amount\u201d of a marker refers to an amount of a marker present in a sample being tested. A test amount can be either in absolute amount (e.g., \u03bcg\/ml) or a relative amount (e.g., relative intensity of signals).","A \u201cdiagnostic amount\u201d of a marker refers to an amount of a marker in a subject's sample that is consistent with a diagnosis of a heart failure severity or an adverse cardiological condition from an unknown etiology or as a result of chemotherapeutic therapy. A diagnostic amount can be either in absolute amount (e.g., 1 \u03bcg\/ml) or a relative amount (e.g., relative intensity of signals).","A \u201ccontrol amount\u201d or a \u201cstandard\u201d amount of a marker can be any amount or a range of amount, which is to be compared against a test amount of a marker. For example, a control amount of a marker can be the amount of a marker in a healthy subject. A control amount can be either in absolute amount (e.g., \u03bcg\/ml) or a relative amount (e.g., relative intensity of signals).","In another embodiment, the terms biomarker and antigen are used interchangeably.","In another embodiment, the methods provided herein, comprise protein level (amount) measurements. In another embodiment, the methods provided herein, comprise DNA measurements. In another embodiment, the methods provided herein, comprise RNA measurements. In another embodiment, the methods provided herein, comprise mRNA measurements. In another embodiment, methods of measuring the expression level of a given protein used as a biomarker are known to one of average skill in the art. In another embodiment, methods of measuring the transcription level of a given RNA molecule encoding a protein used as a biomarker are known to one of average skill in the art. In another embodiment, methods of measuring the transcription level of a given mRNA molecule encoding a protein used as a biomarker are known to one of average skill in the art.","Methods for capturing, analyzing, quantifying, etc., biomarkers are know in the art, can be captured with capture reagents immobilized to a solid support, such as any biochip described herein, a multiwell microtiter plate or a resin. Once captured on a substrate, e.g., biochip or antibody, any suitable method can be used to measure a marker or markers in a sample. For example, markers can be detected and\/or measured by a variety of detection methods including for example, gas phase ion spectrometry methods, optical methods, electrochemical methods, atomic force microscopy and radio frequency methods. Using these methods, one or more markers can be detected. MAP analysis represents a highly quantitative and rapid method for simultaneously analyzing a large number of specific antigens using a very small volume of patient plasma. In another embodiment, analysis of circulating antigen levels within a collected biological sample, via MAP, yields results equivalent to an ELISA assay. In another embodiment, MAP yields results with greater efficiency and with a higher throughput capacity, than an ELISA assay.","If desired, the sample can be prepared to enhance detectability of the markers. For example, to increase the detectability of markers, a blood serum sample from the subject can be fractionated by, e.g., Cibacron blue agarose chromatography and single stranded DNA affinity chromatography, anion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography (e.g., with antibodies) and the like. The method of fractionation depends on the type of detection method used. Any method that enriches for the protein of interest can be used. Sample preparations, such as pre-fractionation protocols, are optional and may not be necessary to enhance detectability of markers depending on the methods of detection used. For example, sample preparation may be unnecessary if antibodies that specifically bind markers are used to detect the presence of markers in a sample.","Typically, sample preparation involves fractionation of the sample and collection of fractions determined to contain the biomarkers. Methods of pre-fractionation are well known to those of skill in the art and include, for example, size exclusion chromatography, mass spectrometry, ion exchange chromatography, heparin chromatography, affinity chromatography, sequential extraction, gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography. The analytes also may be modified prior to detection. These methods are useful to simplify the sample for further analysis. For example, it can be useful to remove high abundance proteins, such as albumin, from blood before analysis. Examples of methods of fractionation are described in PCT\/US03\/00531, but are not limited to, various kinds of chromatography (e.g., anion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, sequential extraction, and high performance liquid chromatography) and mass spectrometry. The separation and detection of the proteins in a plasma sample generates a protein spectra for that sample.","Biomarkers in a sample can also be separated by high-resolution electrophoresis, e.g., one or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. A fraction containing a marker can be isolated and further analyzed by gas phase ion spectrometry. In another embodiment, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is used to generate two-dimensional array of spots of biomarkers, including one or more markers. See, e.g., Jungblut and Thiede, Mass Specir. Rev. 16:145-162 (1997).","The two-dimensional gel electrophoresis can be performed using methods known in the art. See, e.g., Deutscher ed., Methods In Enzymology vol. 182. Typically, biomarkers in a sample are separated by, e.g., isoelectric focusing, during which biomarkers in a sample are separated in a pH gradient until they reach a spot where their net charge is zero (i.e., isoelectric point). This first separation step results in one-dimensional array of biomarkers. The biomarkers in one-dimensional array are further separated using a technique generally distinct from that used in the first separation step. For example, in the second dimension, biomarkers separated by isoelectric focusing are further separated using a polyacrylamide gel, such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE). SDS-PAGE gel allows further separation based on molecular mass of biomarkers. Typically, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis can separate chemically different biomarkers in the molecular mass range from 1000-200,000 Da within complex mixtures. The pI range of these gels is about 3-10 (wide range gels).","Biomarkers in the two-dimensional array can be detected using any suitable methods known in the art. For example, biomarkers in a gel can be labeled or stained (e.g., Coomassie Blue or silver staining). If gel electrophoresis generates spots that correspond to the molecular weight of one or more markers of the invention, the spot can be further analyzed by gas phase ion spectrometry. For example, spots can be excised from the gel and analyzed by gas phase ion spectrometry. Alternatively, the gel containing biomarkers can be transferred to an inert membrane by applying an electric field. Then a spot on the membrane that approximately corresponds to the molecular weight of a marker can be analyzed by gas phase ion spectrometry. In gas phase ion spectrometry, the spots can be analyzed using any suitable techniques, such as MALDI or SELDI (e.g., using ProteinChip\u00ae array) as described herein.","Another method available for use in the present invention is gas chromatography. Prior to gas phase ion spectrometry analysis, it may be desirable to cleave biomarkers in the spot into smaller fragments using cleaving reagents, such as proteases (e.g., trypsin). The digestion of biomarkers into small fragments provides a mass fingerprint of the biomarkers in the spot, which can be used to determine the identity of markers if desired.","In one embodiment, the biological sample is analysed for the presence of the biomarker(s). In another embodiment, methods for protein analysis that are well known in the arts and are available for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, Mass Spectrometry, Two-Dimensional Electrophoresis Chromatography High Performance Liquid Chromatography, Reversed-Phase Chromatography Ion Exchange Chromatography, and the like.","In another embodiment, an immunoassay can be used to detect and analyze markers in a sample. This method comprises: (a) providing an antibody that specifically binds to a marker; (b) contacting a sample with the antibody; and (c) detecting the presence of a complex of the antibody bound to the marker in the sample.","An immunoassay is an assay that uses an antibody to specifically bind an antigen (e.g., a marker). The immunoassay is characterized by the use of specific binding properties of a particular antibody to isolate, target, and\/or quantify the antigen. The phrase \u201cspecifically (or selectively) binds\u201d to an antibody or \u201cspecifically (or selectively) immunoreactive with,\u201d when referring to a protein or peptide, refers to a binding reaction that is determinative of the presence of the protein in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics. Thus, under designated immunoassay conditions, the specified antibodies bind to a particular protein at least two times the background and do not substantially bind in a significant amount to other proteins present in the sample. Specific binding to an antibody under such conditions may require an antibody that is selected for its specificity for a particular protein. For example, polyclonal antibodies raised to a marker from specific species such as rat, mouse, or human can be selected to obtain only those polyclonal antibodies that are specifically immunoreactive with that marker and not with other proteins, except for polymorphic variants and alleles of the marker. This selection may be achieved by subtracting out antibodies that cross-react with the marker molecules from other species.","In another embodiment, provided herein is a kit for diagnosing or providing prognosis for a subject developing heart failure, comprising equipment including, but not limited to, assays and analytical tools for the assays, both as described herein below in the exemplification, reagents, standards and instructions for analyzing the expression level of two or more biomarkers in a biological sample of the subject.","Generally, a sample obtained from a subject can be contacted with the antibody that specifically binds the marker. Optionally, the antibody can be fixed to a solid support to facilitate washing and subsequent isolation of the complex, prior to contacting the antibody with a sample. Examples of solid supports include glass or plastic in the form of, e.g., a microtiter plate, a stick, a bead, or a microbead. Antibodies can also be attached to a probe substrate or ProteinChip\u00ae array described above. In one embodiment, the sample is a biological fluid sample taken from a subject. Examples of biological fluid samples include blood, serum, plasma, nipple aspirate, urine, tears, saliva etc. In another embodiment, the biological fluid comprises blood serum. The sample can be diluted with a suitable eluant before contacting the sample to the antibody.","After incubating the sample with antibodies, the mixture is washed and the antibody-marker complex formed can be detected. This can be accomplished by incubating the washed mixture with a detection reagent. This detection reagent may be, e.g., a second antibody which is labeled with a detectable label. Exemplary detectable labels include magnetic beads (e.g., DYNABEADS\u2122), fluorescent dyes, radiolabels, enzymes (e.g., horse radish peroxide, alkaline phosphatase and others commonly used in an ELISA), and colorimetric labels such as colloidal gold or colored glass or plastic beads. Alternatively, the marker in the sample can be detected using an indirect assay, wherein, for example, a second, labeled antibody is used to detect bound marker-specific antibody, and\/or in a competition or inhibition assay wherein, for example, a monoclonal antibody which binds to a distinct epitope of the marker is incubated simultaneously with the mixture.","Methods for measuring the amount of, or presence of, antibody-marker complex include, for example, detection of fluorescence, luminescence, chemiluminescence, absorbance, reflectance, transmittance, birefringence or refractive index (e.g., surface plasmon resonance, ellipsometry, a resonant mirror method, a grating coupler waveguide method or interferometry). Optical methods include microscopy (both confocal and non-confocal), imaging methods and non-imaging methods. Electrochemical methods include voltammetry and amperometry methods. Radio frequency methods include multipolar resonance spectroscopy. Methods for performing these assays are readily known in the art. Useful assays include, for example, an enzyme immune assay (EIA) such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a radioimmune assay (RIA), a Western blot assay, or a slot blot assay. These methods are also described in, e.g., Methods in Cell Biology: Antibodies in Cell Biology, volume 37 (Asai, ed. 1993); Basic and Clinical Immunology (Stites & Terr, eds., 7th ed. 1991); and Harlow & Lane, supra.","Throughout the assays, incubation and\/or washing steps may be required after each combination of reagents. Incubation steps can vary from about 5 seconds to several hours, preferably from about 5 minutes to about 24 hours. However, the incubation time will depend upon the assay format, marker, volume of solution, concentrations and the like. Usually the assays will be carried out at ambient temperature, although they can be conducted over a range of temperatures, such as 10\u00b0 C. to 40\u00b0 C.","Immunoassays can be used to determine presence or absence of a marker in a sample as well as the quantity of a marker in a sample. The amount of an antibody-marker complex can be determined by comparing to a standard. A standard can be, e.g., a known compound or another protein known to be present in a sample. As noted above, the test amount of marker need not be measured in absolute units, as long as the unit of measurement can be compared to a control.","When the sample is measured and data is generated, e.g., by methods described herein such as, but not limited to mass spectrometry, the data is then analyzed by a computer software program. Generally, the software can comprise code that converts signal from the mass spectrometer into computer readable form. The software also can include code that applies an algorithm to the analysis of the signal to determine whether the signal represents a \u201cpeak\u201d in the signal corresponding to a marker of this invention, or other useful markers. The software also can include code that executes an algorithm that compares signal from a test sample to a typical signal characteristic of \u201cnormal\u201d one and determines the closeness of fit between the two signals. The software also can include code indicating which the test sample is closest to, thereby providing a probable diagnosis.","In one embodiment of the present invention, multiple biomarkers are measured. The use of multiple biomarkers increases the predictive value of the test and provides greater utility in diagnosis, categorization of the severity of a subject or patient's condition, patient stratification and patient monitoring. The process called \u201cPattern recognition\u201d detects the patterns formed by multiple biomarkers and greatly improves the sensitivity and specificity of clinical proteomics for predictive medicine. Subtle variations in data from clinical samples, e.g., obtained using methods provided herein and those know in the art, indicate that certain patterns of protein expression can predict phenotypes such as the presence or absence of a certain disease, a particular stage of a disease, or a positive or adverse response to drug treatments.","In one embodiment, the term \u201chomology\u201d or \u201chomologous\u201d refers to a protein from another organism when the encoded amino acid sequence of the protein has a similar sequence to the encoded amino acid sequence of a protein from a different organism and in another embodiment, has a similar biological activity or in another embodiment, similar function. In one embodiment, a protein may have homology or be homologous to another protein if the two proteins have similar amino acid sequences and have similar biological activities or functions. In another embodiment, \u201chomologous\u201d does not necessarily imply that there is an evolutionary relationship between the proteins. In one embodiment, the term \u201chomologous\u201d refers to that the two proteins have similar amino acid sequences and similar biological activities or functions. In one embodiment, a homologous protein exhibits 50% sequence similarity to the wild type protein, or in another embodiment 60% sequence similarity, or in another embodiment 70% sequence similarity. or in another embodiment 80%, 85% or 90% sequence similarity to the wild type protein. or in another embodiment, a homologous protein exhibits 95%, 97%, 98% or 99% sequence similarity.","In one embodiment, the methods of the invention provide for the use of multiple assays, to evaluate differential gene expression. In another embodiment, arrays are used since microarray analysis allows in another embodiment simultaneous gene expression analysis of multiple genes in a high-throughput mode.","In one embodiment, a combination of biomarkers may provide greater predictive value than single markers alone. In another embodiment, the detection of a plurality of markers in a sample increases the percentage of true positive and true negative diagnoses and would decrease the percentage of false positive or false negative diagnoses. Thus, and in one embodiment, the methods of the present invention comprise the measurement of more than one biomarker.","In other embodiments, the measurement of markers can involve quantifying the markers to correlate the detection of markers with a probable diagnosis of the severity of heart failure, regardless of the cause of the heart failure, for e.g. such as when it's cause is as a result of chemotherapeutic treatment. Thus, if the amount of the markers detected in a subject being tested is different compared to a control amount (i.e., higher or lower than the control, depending on the marker), then the subject can be classified as having a certain risk of heart failure.","The correlation may take into account the amount of the marker or markers in the sample compared to a control amount of the marker or markers (up or down regulation of the marker or markers) (e.g., in normal healthy subjects). A control can be, e.g., the average or median amount of marker present in comparable samples of healthy subjects. The control amount is measured under the same or substantially similar experimental conditions as in measuring the test amount. The correlation may take into account the presence or absence of the markers in a test sample and the frequency of detection of the same markers in a control. The correlation may take into account both of such factors to facilitate determining\/practicing the methods provided herein.","In another embodiment, a suitable statistical tool, known to one of skill in the art, is used to determine whether or not a biomarker is over-expressed or under-expressed relative to a standard.","In one embodiment, continuous measures such as NRG-1\u03b2 are described using simple statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, and range) and categorical\/ordinal data (e.g. race, gender, and remodeling geometry) with tables and frequencies.","In another embodiment, graphical methods including histograms, scatter plots, and box plots are used to understand aspects of data quality and examine assumptions that underlie parametric and semi-parametric models.","In one embodiment, to better understand the changes in exposure and outcome over time, individual trajectories are plotted as well as group summaries across time, and Kaplan-Meier plots are used to estimate survival probabilities.","In one embodiment the methods provided herein further comprise managing subject treatment based on the status. Such management describes the actions of the physician or clinician subsequent to determining the severity of heart failure. For example, if the result of the methods of the present invention is inconclusive or there is reason that confirmation of status is necessary, the physician may order more tests. Alternatively, if the status indicates that treatment is appropriate, the physician may schedule the patient for treatment. Likewise, if the result is negative, e.g., the status indicates no need for heart failure treatment is needed, no further action may be warranted. Furthermore, if the results show that treatment has been successful, no further management may be necessary.","The invention also provides for such methods where the biomarkers (or specific combination of biomarkers) are measured again after subject management. In these cases, the methods are used to monitor the status of the severity of heart failure or cardiac dysfunction in a subject. Because of the ease of use of the methods and the lack of invasiveness of the methods, the methods can be repeated after each treatment the patient receives. This allows the physician to follow the effectiveness of the course of treatment. If the results show that the treatment is not effective, the course of treatment can be altered accordingly. This enables the physician to be flexible in the treatment options.","In another example, the methods for detecting markers can be used to assay for and to identify compounds that modulate expression of these markers in vivo or in vitro.","In yet another embodiment, the markers are used in heredity studies to determine if the subject is at risk for developing a more severe case of heart failure.","\u201cSolid support\u201d refers to a solid material which can be derivatized with, or otherwise attached to, a capture reagent. Exemplary solid supports include probes, microtiter plates and chromatographic resins.","\u201cProbe\u201d in the context of this invention refers to a device adapted to engage a probe interface of a gas phase ion spectrometer (e.g., a mass spectrometer) and to present an analyte to ionizing energy for ionization and introduction into a gas phase ion spectrometer, such as a mass spectrometer.

The elution characteristics of an eluant can depend, for example, on pH, ionic strength, hydrophobicity, degree of chaotropism, detergent strength and temperature.","\u201cAnalyte\u201d refers to any component of a sample that is desired to be detected. The term can refer to a single component or a plurality of components in the sample.","The \u201ccomplexity\u201d of a sample adsorbed to an adsorption surface of an affinity capture probe means the number of different protein species that are adsorbed. \u201cMonitoring\u201d refers to recording changes in a continuously varying parameter.","In one embodiment, provided herein is a kit comprising reagents for detecting the gene expression profile, wherein the reagents are nucleic acids, which may hybridize to mRNA isolated from a biological sample.

They should in no way be construed, however, as limiting the broad scope of the invention.","To define the role of NRG-1\u03b2 in human cardiac remodeling and the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, we have engaged in a comprehensive study of NRG-1\u03b2 in PHFS and CRIC subjects (which together represent the entire spectrum of remodeling); an efficient study design (); a reproducible neuregulin assay; rich datasets with both clinical and echocardiographic outcomes; and an experienced, collaborative team of mentors. Studies in PHFS and studies in CRIC nested case-cohorts define the relationship between NRG-1\u03b2 and risk of future clinical outcomes. Studies in CRIC define the relationship between NRG-1\u03b2 and cardiac remodeling.","The Penn Heart Failure Study (PHFS) is an ongoing prospective cohort study of outpatients with chronic heart failure recruited from the Penn Heart Failure and Transplantation program. The primary inclusion criterion is a clinical diagnosis of heart failure, and the cohort is comprised of patients with a broad spectrum of disease. Participants are excluded if they have a noncardiac condition resulting in an expected mortality of less than 6 months, as judged by the treating physician.","At time of study entry, detailed clinical data were obtained using questionnaires administered to the patient and treating physician, with verification via medical records. Variables such as NYHA Class and cardiomyopathy etiology (ischemic versus nonischemic) were determined by the physician based upon all available clinical data and according to standard heart failure clinical practice guidelines. Venous blood samples were obtained at enrollment and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. In this cohort, approximately 68% of the subjects are male, with an overall mean age of 56 years. The cohort is 83% Caucasian and 15% African Americans. There is a predominance of eccentric hypertrophy, and the mean ejection fraction is approximately 32% with primarily NYHA Class II\/III and ACC\/AHA Heart Failure Stage C subjects (Table 1). Cardiomyopathy etiologies include: 32% ischemic, with the remainder of nonischemic cardiomyopathies (68%) primarily distributed among idiopathic (37%), hypertensive (9%), valvular (4.8%), congenital (2.3%), and familial (2%). Nearly 56% of the subjects have had at least 1 cardiac hospitalization since enrollment. The percentage of deaths and transplants to date are each on the order of 10.3-11.9% over a median follow-up of 2.4 years.","Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography with Doppler color flow imaging was performed in all patients at an ICAEL-accredited laboratory within approximately 30 days of blood sampling. Echocardiograms were performed by an experienced sonographer and clinical interpretation performed by a Level III-certified echocardiographer, with all personnel blinded to NRG-1\u03b2 levels. Ejection fraction (EF) was visually estimated by the expert reader, according to standard clinical protocol.","Follow-up events including all-cause mortality and cardiac transplantation were prospectively ascertained every 6 months via direct patient contact and verified through death certificates, medical records, and contact with patients' family members.","All participants provided written, informed consent, and the PHFS protocol was approved by our Institutional Review Board.","Confounders are factors that are associated with the exposure, and independent of the exposure, are a risk factor for the outcome of interest. A confounder can alter the true association between exposure and outcome. Factors that are known to be associated with both the outcomes and exposure are evaluated. Below is a description of potential confounders.","Demographic variables such as age, sex, and race have all been associated with clinical outcomes in subjects with eccentric remodeling. Age is treated both as a continuous variable and categorized according to 10-year increments to explore for nonlinearity. Tobacco use is considered as a potential confounder, and will be classified as current, former, and never. Medication use including ace-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, digoxin, hydralazine\/nitrates, and diuretics are assessed as a binary covariate (yes\/no). Device therapy such as cardiac resynchronization are assessed as a confounder given the beneficial effects of biventricular pacing in decreasing rate of hospitalization and improving survival. Heart failure etiology (ischemic versus nonischemic) and severity (NYHA Class) are considered confounders because survival differences exist according to primary cause of disease and degree of symptomatology. Comorbidities such as history of renal disease (creatinine and glomerular filtration rate as a continuous and categorical variable), hypertension, diabetes (comorbidities will be assessed as yes\/no), and atrial arrhythmia history are considered given our univariate, cross-sectional findings. Duration of heart failure diagnosis is also assessed as a potential confounder. Both the patient's report of heart failure diagnosis and date of first cardiac hospitalization prior to study enrollment. In addition, a measure of cardiac remodeling and function, such as ventricular mass or ejection fraction is included as a potential confounder, given its relationship with survival. In our multivariable analysis, possible confounding by BNP is also assessed, given its associations with cardiac mortality and morbidity in subjects with heart failure and potential relationship with exposure, secondary to neurohormonal effects. BNP is treated as continuous and categorical. Additional potential confounders include exercise capacity, body mass index, and factors related to increased strain, such as blood pressure, and neurohormonal status.","In the 2study (CRIC), the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between changes in NRG-1\u03b2 levels and cardiac remodeling in a random sample of the entire CRIC cohort is assessed. The effects of NRG-1\u03b2 plasma levels at years 1, 2, 3, and 4 are assessed and results are related to echocardiography data obtained at years 1 and 4. The exposure is circulating NRG-1\u03b2 level and the primary outcomes are changes in relative wall thickness (RWT) and left ventricle (LV) internal diameter at end-diastole (LVIDd) are indexed to BSA. Additional secondary outcomes include changes in indexed LV mass, LV end-diastolic volumes (LV EDV), LV indexed end-systolic (LV ESV), LV internal diameter at end-systole (LVIDs), and ejection fraction (EF). All of these outcomes are quantified as part of the core lab interpretation of echoes in CRIC. The following specific analyses, are stratified according to remodeling geometry (normal, concentric remodeling, concentric hypertrophy, and eccentric hypertrophy), given that the relationship between NRG-1\u03b2 and remodeling may differ by strata.","The cross-sectional association between NRG-1\u03b2 at Year 1 and echo parameters of ventricular remodeling and function at Year 1 are defined using linear regression. Subjects are stratified based upon NRG-1\u03b2 level and it is determined if significant differences in echocardiographic parameters of remodeling exist across each ordered strata. The shape of the NRG-1\u03b2 time relationship is assessed according to cardiac geometry.","The baseline or temporal changes in NRG-1\u03b2 levels predict the change in echocardiographic parameters of ventricular remodeling and function over years 1 and 4. As a first step, it is determined if NRG-1\u03b2 levels at Year 1 predict change in remodeling. Next, the temporal changes in NRG-1\u03b2 are assessed. If the pattern appears linear, the following two-stage analysis is performed: a linear model is fitted to the four NRG-1\u03b2 data points at Years 1 through 4 to estimate the annual rate of change in NRG-1\u03b2 for each subject. This annual rate of change in NRG-1\u03b2 as a predictor of change in echocardiography parameters. The change in echocardiography parameters are assessed for normality and log transformed when appropriate. If changes in NRG-1\u03b2 are non-linear over time, multiple indicator variables of change (e.g. year 1 versus year 2, year 1 versus year 3, and so forth or a summary of these changes such as median or maximum change) are used to determine whether there are periods when changes in NRG-1\u03b2 levels are critical to the subsequent outcomes. A simple average of the 4 levels of NRG-1\u03b2, is used after considering the distribution of NRG-1\u03b2 over time.","For the 2and 3studies in CRIC (see ), a similar list of confounders as described above in PHFS is used. Here, the degree of renal dysfunction is considered since it is known to be related to echocardiographic parameters of ventricular remodeling. Stratifying our analyses according to ventricular geometry will help control for the varying degrees of renal dysfunction between the 4 types of remodeling geometry given the association between geometry and renal function. Renal function using glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as measured in CRIC are estimated by the modified simplified MDRD equation (GFR ml\/min per 1.73 m=186\u00d7[serum Cr (mg\/dl)]\u00d7[age]\u00d7[0.742 if female]\u00d7[1.212 if African American]), using locally measured serum creatinine calibrated to a central laboratory. Overall, those variables that have a univariate association with our outcome of interest at an \u03b1 of less than 0.20 are chosen. Model fit is explored using residuals and compared using adjusted R.","The change in NRG-1\u03b2 over time and change in remodeling geometry at year 4 for subjects with normal geometry at year 1, and the change in remodeling geometry at year 4 for subjects with concentric hypertrophy\/remodeling at year 1, will be estimated. The generalized estimating equations (GEE) are used to determine if, among those with normal geometry at year 1, an increase in circulating NRG-1\u03b2 over time is associated with a change in remodeling geometry from normal to concentric remodeling\/hypertrophy at year 4. GEE is used to determine if, among those with concentric remodeling\/hypertrophy and remodeling at year 1, changes in circulating NRG-1\u03b2 over time differ between those with concentric and eccentric hypertrophy at year 4. This will involve the addition of an interaction term, remodeling geometry, in our model.","Analyses are stratified based upon normal geometry, concentric remodeling, concentric hypertrophy, and eccentric hypertrophy, given that remodeling geometry is an effect modifier. In the secondary analyses, GFR, blood pressure, and anti-hypertensive medication are considered as potential effect modifiers.","In the 3study which also involves CRIC (see ) the longitudinal association between NRG-1\u03b2 levels and combined time-to-event outcomes including first heart failure hospitalization and cardiac death is assessed using a case-cohort design.","The sampling scheme for the case-cohort study induces a correlation between subjects in both groups that must be taken into account in the analyses. The basic principle behind the solution to this problem is that a case outside the subcohort is considered to not be at risk until just before the failure, and is thus not included in earlier risk sets. This is accomplished using a weighting term, of which three have been reported in the literature, namely the Prentice, Self and Prentice, and Barlow methods. The Self and Prentice method in STATA 10.0 are used for our analysis, as this weighting scheme has been evaluated in simulation studies and is a valid and powerful method for analyzing these data. The specific analytic plans for the 3study (clinical outcomes study in CRIC) are as follows: A) Describe the association between NRG-1\u03b2 levels at year 1 and the primary outcomes time-to-cardiac death and first heart failure hospitalization via Kaplan-Meier plots and median survival time estimates. B) Assess the univariate association between NRG-1\u03b2 levels at year 1 and primary outcomes via weighted Cox proportional hazards methods as described above. C) Determine whether NRG-1\u03b2 levels at year 1 are an independent risk factor for the primary outcomes after adjustment for clinical risk factors, again using weighted Cox models. Potential confounders are similar to that described above for study 1 in PHFS and study 2 in CRIC. These include age (continuous, categorical), sex, race, tobacco (current, former, never), ventricular mass, renal dysfunction, history of coronary disease, hypertension, diabetes, atrial arrhythmia, and anti-hypertensive medication. From the list of potential confounders, those variables that lead to a 10% change in the estimate of the association between NRG-1\u03b2 and the HR are selected for the outcomes of interest. D) Determine whether temporal changes in NRG-1\u03b2 are associated with survival. In this two-step analysis, a linear model is used to construct an estimate of the rate of change in NRG-1\u03b2 for each subject, and then this estimate is used as a predictor of survival. In addition to including NRG-1\u03b2 as a linear term in the model, it is assessed whether more complicated patterns of change in NRG-1\u03b2 are predictive of survival given that the relationship may be nonlinear. Different indicator variables of change corresponding to the change from year 1 NRG-1\u03b2 (e.g. year 1 versus year 2, year 1 versus year 3, and so forth or a summary of these changes such as median or maximum change) are included. A simple average of the 4 levels of NRG-1\u03b2, are used after considering the distribution of NRG-1\u03b2 over time. Covariates detailed as potential confounders as above are introduced. E) As part of our secondary analyses, the effect modification by remodeling geometry is assessed by introducing a product term in our multivariable Cox models. Ischemic versus nonischemic etiology of heart failure is considered as a potential effect modifier based upon our PHFS findings. Heart failure severity is not as relevant given only NYHA I\/II subjects are included in CRIC. Effect modification by renal dysfunction, is assessed by GFR; hypertension; and common anti-hypertensive therapies will also be explored.","Sample Size and Power","All calculations assume 80% power with a type 1 error rate of 0.05, and two-sided test.

To determine cross-sectional associations between NRG-1\u03b2 and clinical variables at time of study entry, linear regression was used with Ln(NRG-1\u03b2) modeled as the continuous, dependent variable. To determine the association between baseline NRG-1\u03b2 level and risk of death or transplantation, Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used. Univariate models were constructed with NRG-1\u03b2 as the predictor variable and time to all-cause death or cardiac transplantation as the combined outcome. Hazard ratios (HR) were determined for the 4versus 1quartile of NRG-1\u03b2, and for each unit increase in Ln(NRG-1\u03b2) modeled continuously.

Statistical evidence included a univariate association with death\/transplant at a p<0.20 or a change in the HR between NRG-1\u03b2 and death\/transplant by at least 10% after inclusion of the covariate in the model. Models were built in a sequential fashion with the addition of covariates by 1) demographics; 2) cross-sectional associations with NRG-1\u03b2 (tobacco use, atrial fibrillation, bundle branch block, cardiomyopathy etiology); and 3) both statistical evidence and clinical judgment (body mass index, medication use, device therapy, and plasma BNP). The backwards elimination method was used to assess for additional confounding.

Subgroups were identified where the relationship between NRG-1\u03b2 and adverse outcomes may be most informative, i.e. ischemic heart failure and advanced NYHA Class.","The CRIC study is a multi-center prospective cohort study established to study the progression of cardiovascular and renal disease among patients with chronic renal insufficiency. Subjects are recruited based upon age-related entry criteria for glomerular filtration rate. There are approximately 3612 subjects at baseline, and they are followed for up to 5 years. Recruitment was initiated in 2003 and completed in March 2007. Exclusion criteria include life expectancy less than 3 years, NYHA class III or IV heart failure, known cirrhosis, known HIV, prior end stage renal disease, prior organ or bone marrow transplant, immunosuppressive therapy within the prior 6 months, chemotherapy within the past 2 years, polycystic kidney disease, pregnancy and institutionalized patients. Subjects undergo extensive baseline clinical evaluations and return annually for in-person follow-up visits. Telephone interviews take place every 6 months to query about study outcomes and updates on general health. All subjects undergo transthoracic echocardiograms at Years 1 and 4 post-enrollment. These echocardiograms then undergo rigorous quantitative assessment at the Penn Center for Quantitative Echocardiography.","The CRIC study organization consists of the Scientific Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) and seven clinical centers. In this cohort, approximately 55% of the subjects are males, and the mean age is 58 years. There are 45% Caucasians and 47% African-Americans. There is a predominance of hypertension (87%) and diabetes (48%). Preliminary year 1 echo data (n=684) reveal 28.6% of the cohort have normal remodeling geometry, 19.8% concentric remodeling, 29.3% concentric hypertrophy and 22.2% have eccentric hypertrophy.","In terms of clinical outcomes, as of January 2009, there have been  deaths over 7,450 person years. A total of 306 hospitalizations for heart failure have been reported to date. In addition, there have been  hospitalizations for coronary disease, 213 for arrhythmias, and 780 hospitalizations for the composite endpoint of coronary disease, heart failure, arrhythmia, stroke, or peripheral vascular disease.","In the 2study (see ) NRG-1\u03b2 is associated with response and change in cardiac growth and remodeling within a cohort of individuals from CRIC. A random sample of subjects are chosen to conduct the analyses. The analysis is stratified by ventricular geometry, namely normal, concentric remodeling, concentric hypertrophy, and eccentric hypertrophy. Given that Year 1 remodeling geometries are distributed fairly evenly (\u02dc20-29%) across the CRIC study, a random sample provides equal representation of subjects across each of the geometries. For this study, stratified analyses will be important given that the biology of remodeling may differ according to ventricular geometry. All four remodeling geometries in the 2study are included because of the presence of longitudinal data, including serial echocardiograms and repeated measures of NRG-1\u03b2 that are available in CRIC but not PHFS.","Following the studies, it is hypothesized that circulating NRG-1\u03b2 levels are associated with progressive concentric cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy in a linear fashion, whereas the trajectory of circulating NRG-1\u03b2 over time in eccentric hypertrophy is more complex and nonlinear ().","In the 3study which involves CRIC, the entire spectrum of cardiac remodeling are assessed and the associations between NRG-1\u03b2 and clinical outcomes via a case-cohort study are determined. A case-cohort design preserves our ability to study multiple outcomes and use our resources most efficiently by studying a random sample of the entire CRIC population (the cohort) and all cases of disease (first heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death). The subcohort used for the 3study is the same cohort as the 2study, and represents a random sample of all CRIC subjects (). Use of the same subjects in the 2and 3studies maximizes efficiency. The cases are those subjects who have developed the outcomes of interest, cardiac death or heart failure hospitalization, by Year 4 of follow-up. As part of the secondary analyses, the possibility of effect modification by remodeling geometry is assessed, where the study comprises approximately 200 subjects per stratum to perform analyses.","An added major advantage of the case-cohort study design over case-control studies is the ability to study multiple endpoints by using the same subcohort for several disease outcomes. CRIC has data on multiple other potentially relevant outcomes (such as myocardial infarction and major arrhythmic events), and a case-cohort study allows assessment of multiple endpoints. The case-cohort approach has commonly been used in large cohort studies such as Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (ARIC) and provides an unbiased estimate of the relative risk.","A case-cohort design is used to accomplish in the 3study to assess clinical outcomes in CRIC, and the same cohort is used to study echocardiography outcomes for the 2study. Thus, the randomly sampled cohort is used in both 2and 3studies. A random sample of the cohort should provide a fairly uniform distribution of subjects with normal, concentric remodeling, concentric hypertrophy, and eccentric hypertrophy to address the 2study and perform exploratory analyses in the 3study.","It has been observed that patients with chemotherapy-induced heart failure (n=17) from the Penn Heart Failure Study have significant alterations in NRG-1\u03b2 as compared to all other etiologies. In addition, a prospective cohort of breast cancer patients exposed to chemotherapy (doxorubicin and trastuzumab) are followed every 3 months. In this prospective cohort, increases in circulating NRG-1\u03b2 plasma levels over time are associated with incident cardiac dysfunction.","To determine the contribution of variation in NRG\/ErbB signaling on risk of cancer therapy-induced cardiac dysfunction, the relationship between SNP\/haplotype variation in NRG\/ErbB genetics and incident cardiac dysfunction is quantified. The clinical, predictive utility of potential risk variants in this important population is determined. As a result, it is observed that patients who develop incident cardiac dysfunction have elevated levels of circulating NRG-1\u03b2 with exposure to chemotherapy, demonstrating that NRG-1\u03b2 is indicative of cardiac stress and is a marker of dysfunction. The predictive value of an integrated biomarker and a genetic approach are explored. This knowledge facilitates care of patients by personalizing the use of cancer therapy to minimize cardiotoxicity (e.g. alternative regimens for those patients at high risk for cardiotoxicity); identifying patients who benefit from early cardioprotective strategies; and overall improving the cardiovascular health of this population.","Development of novel mechanistic markers (circulating proteins, genetic variations, sensitive imaging parameters) may help improve our understanding of the disease and be useful in risk stratification, as a multi-marker strategy. NRG-1 is paracrine epidermal growth factor whose effects are mediated by the ErbB family of tyrosine kinase receptors. This pathway is necessary for cardiac development, critical for stress-responsiveness, cardiac growth, and maintenance of function. Our data in 899 subjects from the Penn Heart Failure Study show that in chronic systolic heart failure, higher circulating levels of NRG-1\u03b2 are independently associated with heart failure severity and an increased risk of all-cause death or cardiac transplantation.","Objective\/Aim:","The objective of the study was to determine the clinical relevance of circulating neuregulin-1\u03b2 (NRG-1\u03b2) as it relates to chemotherapy cardiotoxicity. The aim was to establish the relationship between circulating NRG-1\u03b2 and incident adverse cardiovascular events in subjects exposed to doxorubicin and trastuzumab.","Methods:","Breast cancer patients receiving doxorubicin followed by trastuzumab were prospectively recruited. Echocardiograms and measures of plasma NRG-1\u03b2 were performed at 3 timepoints: prior to doxorubicin, prior to trastuzumab, and after 3 months of trastuzumab.","Multi-center observational cohort study of Her-2+ breast cancer outpatients receiving doxorubicin and trastuzumab is shown in .
