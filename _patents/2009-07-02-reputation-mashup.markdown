Users may interact with the Internet to obtain various resources (e.g., content and services) and to connect with other people. Because there are many resources and a large number of other people accessible via the Internet, it may be difficult for a user to determine when it is safe to interact with resources and people that the user encounters during online activities.","When a user is unable to determine that a resource or another user is trustworthy, for instance, the user may be uncomfortable and\/or may simply choose to forego some interactions. Accordingly, the inability to make informed trust decisions may detract from the user's online experiences and may have a chilling effect on Internet activities and transactions.","Techniques for reputation mashup are described.

Interaction with the resource by the client is selectively enabled or restricted in accordance with the trust determination made using the combined reputation data.","For example, \u201cBob\u201d may notice a new bike for sale from an online merchant \u201cMikeBike.\u201d \u201cBob\u201d may have limited knowledge regarding the trustworthiness of \u201cMikeBike.\u201d To examine the bike, \u201cBob\u201d may use a browser to navigate to a website for \u201cMikeBike.\u201d When \u201cBob\u201d does so, a reputation module of Bob's computer may operate to obtain and present reputation data corresponding to \u201cMikeBike\u201d via his browser. The reputation data may include reputation data for \u201cMikeBike\u201d compiled from multiple sources, including endorsements from past buyers, ratings from a merchant rating service, and\/or aggregated reputation data supplied to \u201cBob\u201d as a service through an account of \u201cBob's\u201d with a service provider. The data from the multiple sources may be combined and presented via the browser in a uniform format that \u201cBob\u201d has customized to match his preferences. The reputation module may operate to translate and\/or map data collected from the multiple sources to \u201cBob's\u201d customized format.","\u201cBob\u201d is able to see a wide array of reputation data related to \u201cMikeBike\u201d that he may use to make an informed decision regarding whether to trust \u201cMikeBike.\u201d If \u201cBob\u201d determines to trust \u201cMikeBike,\u201d a trust policy of \u201cBob's\u201d computer may enable a purchase transaction for the bike. On the other hand, if \u201cBob\u201d does not trust \u201cMikeBike,\u201d the trust policy may be configured to restrict the purchase transaction for the bike.","In the discussion that follows, a section entitled \u201cExample Environment\u201d describes an example environment and devices, which may be employed to provide reputation mashup in various embodiments. Following this, a section entitled \u201cExample Procedures\u201d describes example techniques related to reputation mashup in accordance with one or more embodiments.

Last, a section entitled \u201cExample Devices\u201d is provided and describes example devices that can be used to implement one or more embodiments.","Example Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","108","108","108","108","108"]},"For the purposes of the following discussion, a referenced component, such as service provider , may refer to one or more entities, and therefore by convention reference may be made to a single entity (e.g., the service provider ) or multiple entities (e.g., the service providers , the plurality of service providers , and so on) using the same reference number.","The service provider  may have one or more processors  and memory . Service provider  is depicted as storing a service manager module  in the memory  that is executable via the one or more processors . Service manager module  represents functionality operable by service provider  to manage various services  that may be made available over the network . For example, various services  may be provided via web pages , or other user interfaces, that are communicated over the network for output by the one or more clients . Service manager module  may manage access to the services , performance of the services , configuration of web pages  to provide the services , and so on.","Some examples of services  include, but are not limited to, a search service, an e-mail service to send and receive e-mail, an instant messaging service to provide instant messages between clients , a social networking service to facilitate connections and interactions between groups of users who share common interests and activities, and a reputation service. The reputation service may assist users in making trust determinations regarding resources (e.g., objects, entities, applications, content, and\/or services) encountered in the course of interactions with one or more service providers , websites, other users and\/or sources of the resources. In at least some embodiments, a reputation service may be configured to compile and provide reputation data from a plurality of reputation sources . Additional examples of services  include a shopping service, a weblog service, productivity service, authentication service, a news service, and an advertisement service, to name a few.","The authentication service may be provided by the service manager module  to authenticate clients to access various services  that may be provided by one or more of the service providers . For example, a client  may provide a username and password that is authenticated by the authentication service. When the authentication is successful, the authentication service may pass a token or use other suitable authentication techniques to enable access to corresponding services . Authentication of the client  to an account may provide access to a single corresponding service provider  and\/or service . Additionally or alternatively, a single authentication may correspond to many services , such that authentication to a single account provides access to many service providers  and\/or to an entire suite of services .","The service manager module  may also manage an accounts database  that may be configured to store a variety of data related to user accounts with the one or more service providers . By way of example and not limitation, an accounts database  is depicted as storing account identifiers  that may be used for authentication and access control (e.g., unique account IDs, usernames, passwords, and so on), reputation data  that may describe reputations for users and resources associated with accounts, and profile data  that may correspond to personal data and pages accessible through various services . A variety of other data  is also contemplated, including service authorizations, user preferences, program files such as documents and spreadsheets maintained online, and other data typically associated with user accounts.","The service provider  is also depicted as storing a reputation module  in memory  that is executable via the one or more processors  to implement aspects of reputation mashup techniques described herein. The reputation module  may compile reputation data  from various sources for communication to clients . In an embodiment, functionality represented by the reputation module  may be implemented as an application programming interface (API) that may be made accessible to the clients  over the network . The client  may make use of the reputation module  via the API to facilitate communication with various reputation sources  and collection of reputation data  from the reputation sources .","The one or more clients  are depicted as having one or more processors  and memory . Memory  is depicted as storing another reputation module  that may be deployed to the client  and is executable via the one or more processors  to implement \u201cclient-side\u201d aspects and\/or other functionality related to reputation mashup techniques described herein. A reputation module  of a client  may operate in conjunction with reputation related functionality that may be provided by the service provider . Additionally or alternatively, a reputation module  of a client  may be configured to operate independently to obtain reputation data  directly from one or more reputation sources , which may include the service provider  and\/or other clients . Thus, the depicted reputation modules  are representative of functionality operable by a client , a service provider , and\/or a client  and service provider  in combination. Further discussion regarding the operation and configuration of one or more reputation modules  in various embodiments may found in reference to the following figures.","To enable various communications over the network , the one or more clients  may also include a communication module . The communication module  is depicted as being stored in memory  and is also executable via the processor  to provide various interactions with service providers  and\/or services . Examples of such interaction include, but are not limited to, communicating one to another, navigating content, searching web pages, accessing services , interacting with a reputation service and\/or reputation sources , performing searches, instant messaging, e-mail, and so forth. The communication module  may be implemented as a browser or other suitable application to obtain and output web pages  from the service provider  over the network . The communication module  may also represent a component of another application used to obtain one or more services  from the service providers . For example, a communication module  may be configured as a component of a desktop reputation and trust application of a client .","As noted above, reputation data  associated with resources may be obtained from third-party sources, such as the one or more reputation sources  depicted in the environment . The one or more reputation sources  are depicted as having one or more processors  and memory . Memory  may store a variety of reputations  that may be associated with resources by way of various resource identifiers . Reputations  may be configured in a variety of ways. Examples of reputations  that may be provided by reputation sources  include endorsements, trust ratings (e.g., 1 to 10 or \u201chigh, medium, low\u201d), comments, a reputation type, threshold values, and other data suitable to describe and\/or assert a reputation for corresponding resources. An endorsement as used herein refers to an assertion by one entity, the endorser, regarding another. For example, a user may endorse an online merchant by asserting the merchant is reputable and\/or has fair payment policies. In another example, a bank may endorse a user as an agent of the bank. Further, an endorsement from an endorser may be supported with other reputation data regarding the endorser. The other reputation data may be configured to describe trustworthiness of the endorser. Thus, including other reputation data with endorsements enables users to make assessments regarding whether or not to trust various endorsements and\/or endorsers.","Reputations  may also incorporate supporting data regarding a resource, such as how long the resource has been available, where it is available, how often others interact with the resource, associated trust assertions like digital certificate and\/or endorsements, and\/or indications as to how often others designate the resource as trusted. It is noted that reputation data  collected for a resource may incorporate one or more reputations  from one or more reputation sources . While  depicts third-party reputation sources , a reputation source  may also be incorporated with a service provider , such as being provided as a service  of the service provider . A client  may also be configured as a reputation source  for other clients.","Having considered devices and components of an example environment, consider now example reputation mashup techniques that may be implemented in the environment using the example components, as well as in other environments.","Example Procedures","The following discussion describes techniques for reputation mashup that may be implemented utilizing the previously described systems and devices. Aspects of each of the procedures may be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or a combination thereof. The procedures are shown as a set of blocks that specify operations performed by one or more devices and are not necessarily limited to the orders shown for performing the operations by the respective blocks. In portions of the following discussion, reference may be made to the example environment  of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","130","104","102"]},"Reputation data is combined for a resource from a plurality of reputation sources (block ). For instance, one or more reputation modules  depicted in relation to  may be configured in various ways to obtain reputations  associated with a resource from a variety of reputation sources . Reputations  for a resource may be obtained in response to an attempt by a client  to interact with the resource. For example, a client  may navigate to a website that provides shareware applications and select a shareware football game for downloading. The client  may access the football game (e.g., the resource) using a communication module  to interact through the service provider  and\/or by directly navigating to a website or uniform resource locator (URL) associated with the game. Before proceeding with the download, reputation module  may operate to obtain and present reputation data  associated with the football game to enable a determination of trust to be made for the game and\/or for a provider of the game.","In particular, a reputation module  may be configured to detect when interaction occurs with resources, such as detecting interaction of the client  with the shareware website and\/or the selected game. In response to detecting the interaction, the reputation module  may identify the corresponding resource. For example, the reputation module  may determine one or more resource identifiers  associated with the website and\/or football game, such as the website URL, a hash sufficient to identify the football game, an account identifier  corresponding to the website or game, or other data suitable to identify the resource. The reputation module  may then conduct a search for reputations  related to the website and\/or game. Additionally or alternatively, reputation module  may generate one or more requests for communication to the service provider  and\/or reputation sources  to obtain corresponding reputation data . The reputation module  may make use of resource identifiers  to perform the searches and\/or requests for reputation data . For instance, the resource identifiers  may be employed to discover data records that match the resource identifier  or are otherwise associated with corresponding resources.","Moreover, the client  may obtain reputation related data for the game directly and\/or with aid from the service provider . For example, client  may communicate directly with one or more reputation sources  to obtain reputations . In this example, the clients may form requests to reputation sources  using resource identifiers  and receive corresponding reputations  in return. Reputations  may represent uncombined pieces of reputation related data that may be combined to produce reputation data  for a resource.","In another example, client  may interact with service provider  to obtain reputation data  by way of a service  provided by the service provider . Here, the reputation data  may represent a \u201cmashup\u201d of data that combines reputations  from multiple sources. In this manner, the client  is able to leverage reputation data  that may have been previously compiled and stored by the service provider  instead of having to individually query each of the reputation sources . Further discussion of a service provider  configured to compile reputation data  on behalf of clients  may be found in relation to  below.","A reputation module  may be further configured to combine reputations  from various sources to facilitate making a trust decision regarding the resource at the client . This may include translating reputations  from the various sources into a uniform format that is supported by the reputation module . The uniform format may include a variety of data fields to facilitate combining data from multiple sources. The reputation module  may be configured in a variety of ways to map data from various sources of reputation data to fields of the uniform format. Examples of data fields suitable to implement a uniform format may be found in relation to the example user interface of  below.","In at least some embodiments, each reputation record for a resource may be categorized according to a reputation type. Reputation types may be defined to categorize reputation records in a variety of ways. For instance, reputation types may include different types for service-based reputations, ratings, endorsements, reputations from friends, reputations from trusted parties, reputations from un-trusted parties, and so forth.","Reputation values may also be normalized to a common scale selected for the uniform format. For instance, each reputation value may be converted to a scale of 1 to 10 that indicates a relative level of trust for a corresponding resource. In addition, data supporting a reputation may be used to populate a comment field of the uniform format. In this way, raw data underlying each reputation record may be made available along with combined reputation data  presented at a client .","Note that different clients  may configure customized mappings and\/or formats to create \u201cclient-specific\u201d uniform formats for combining and presenting reputation data. For instance, clients  may be able to select different normalized scales and define custom reputation types. Further discussion of translating reputation related data into a uniform format may be found in relation to the example user interface of  below.","In the above example of a shareware football game, multiple pieces of reputation data related to the football game may be combined by the reputation module . By way of example, the pieces of reputation information collected for the game may include a rating from a game review site, endorsements from several gamers, feedback from users regarding the shareware website, and a reputation value and\/or related data obtained from a reputation source .","Combining reputation data  from multiple sources enables presentation of a complete picture of available reputation data to a client . Such presentations may include reputations  and underlying data that are organized by the reputation module  into a uniform format as described above and below. Thus, reputation data  for resources may be presented in a consistent and readily understandable format. A trust decision based on the reputation data  may be made at the client  using reputation data  that is obtained directly by the client  and\/or with aid of the service provider .","In particular, when combined reputation data for a resource is available, the combined reputation data is presented for the resource to enable a trust determination to be made for the resource (block ). In the above example, the reputation module  may configure a webpage  for output at the client  that includes the various pieces of reputation information collected for the football game. As noted, the data may be formatted in accordance with a uniform format.","For instance, the data may be presented within a table having various data fields of the uniform format as column headers and a row corresponding to each source of reputation information. In another example, a scrollable list may be presented having individual portions that correspond to each source and incorporate associated reputation data . A variety of other examples are also contemplated. The webpage  may also be configured to include summary data, such as listing of a total number of reputation sources, an overall reputation rating, and\/or a number of favorable ratings to name a few examples.","Based on the presentation of combined reputation data, a determination is made regarding whether the resource is trusted (block ). One way this may occur is by enabling a selection to designate trust for a resource via a webpage  that presents the combined reputation data. For instance, the webpage  configured for the football game in the above example may include a link operable to configure a trust policy for the football game. Selection of the link may enable designating a trust level for the game and\/or configuring settings of the trust policy to control access of the game to computing resources. For example, the trust policy may be configurable to control access of the game and other resources to an operating system, interfaces, applications, processors , memory , and\/or other suitable computing resources associated with the client . A variety of other techniques and selectable controls to enable a designation of trust are contemplated further discussion of which may be found in relation to the following figures.","When the resource is trusted, interaction is enabled with the resource (block ). When the resource is not trusted, interaction with the resource is restricted (block ). In the continuing example, when it is determined that the shareware football game is trusted, downloading of the game may proceed. On the other hand, downloading of the game may be prevented when the football game is not trusted. Further discussion of selectively enabling or restricting interaction with resources based on a determination of trust may also be found in relation to the following figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","300","104","130"]},"Reputation data that corresponds to a resource is aggregated from two or more reputation sources (block ). For example, a reputation module  deployed to a client  may operate to aggregate reputation data  for a resource through interaction with two or more reputation sources . Consider a user \u201cSteve\u201d who may take advantage of a social networking service and\/or other services  provided by the service provider . In the course of interacting with the social networking service, \u201cSteve\u201d may be invited to become friends with another user \u201cKyle,\u201d e.g., invited to add \u201cKyle\u201d to his social network. Before doing so, reputation mashup techniques described herein may be employed to enable \u201cSteve\u201d to examine reputation data  regarding \u201cKyle\u201d and determine if he should trust \u201cKyle.\u201d","In general, aggregation of reputation data may occur responsive to interaction of a client  with one or more services  from a service provider  to facilitate trust determinations for resources associated with the services . In an embodiment, a reputation module  may operate to aggregate reputation data automatically based upon interaction of a client . In the preceding example, reputation module  may operate to aggregate reputation data  corresponding to \u201cKyle\u201d automatically based upon interaction of \u201cSteve\u201d with the invitation. Additionally or alternatively, aggregation may occur responsive to a user selection to cause the aggregation. For instance, \u201cSteve\u201d may make a selection via a webpage  that presents the invitation to cause aggregation of reputation data  related to \u201cKyle\u201d by the reputation module . In each case, an account identifier  of an account of \u201cKyle's\u201d with the service provider  may be employed to discover reputation records related to \u201cKyle\u201d from the service provider  and\/or from reputation sources . The reputation records related to \u201cKyle\u201d may be combined and modified to adhere to a uniform format as described herein.","In some examples, a webpage is output to present the aggregated reputation data for the resource (block ). Further, a control is exposed in the webpage that is selectable to designate trust for the resource based on the aggregated reputation data (block ). In the foregoing example, the reputation module  may operate to cause a communication module  of the client  to output a webpage  that includes aggregated reputation data related to \u201cKyle.\u201d The webpage  may expose a link, button, list box, menu item, icon, or other suitable control that is selectable by \u201cSteve\u201d to designate trust for \u201cKyle.\u201d Accordingly, via the webpage , \u201cSteve\u201d is able to examine reputation data aggregated from various sources regarding \u201cKyle\u201d and may utilize the control to designate trust for \u201cKyle\u201d based on the aggregated reputation data. An example webpage is depicted in  and described in detail below in a section entitled \u201cReputation Mashup Implementation Examples.\u201d","Interaction with the resource is enabled or restricted in accordance with a selection made via the control to designate trust for the resource (block ). In the continuing example, \u201cSteve\u201d may utilize the webpage to designate \u201cKyle\u201d as \u201ctrusted\u201d or \u201cuntrusted,\u201d or to designate trust as \u201clow,\u201d \u201cmedium,\u201d or \u201chigh.\u201d Alternatively, \u201cSteve\u201d may associate a trust level with \u201cKyle\u201d according to a numeric scale, such as from 1 to 10. Subsequent interaction of the client  with \u201cKyle\u201d may be based upon the designated trust that \u201cSteve\u201d associated with \u201cKyle.\u201d For instance, establishing of a friend relationship between \u201cSteve\u201d and \u201cKyle\u201d may be permitted for \u201cmedium\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d trust and prevented for \u201clow\u201d trust.","In an embodiment, a trust policy may be configured and applied to control how resources are permitted to interact with the client . The trust policy may be configured to enable or disable various interactions with the client  at various levels of trust. Reputation mashup techniques may be employed to facilitate designation of trust for various resources. Accordingly, designation of trust for a resource may involve configuring the trust policy to define trust for the resource. Moreover, the trust policy may include a global policy that is applied to each resource and\/or resource specific policies that are configured and applied separately for particular resources or group of resources.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["400","400","102","130"]},"Reputation data regarding a resource is compiled from a plurality of reputation sources (block ).

In the illustrated example, the control portion  appears as a radio control box having options to \u201cTrust Kyle\u201d and \u201cRestrict Kyle.\u201d In particular, by selection of an option from the radio control box and clicking on a \u201cSubmit\u201d button, \u201cSteve\u201d may cause a trust designation for \u201cKyle\u201d to be input and stored. This may include updating of a trust policy of a client  to reflect a trust status for \u201cKyle.\u201d Further, \u201cSteve\u201d may select the \u201cAdvanced Options\u201d button to interact with additional configuration options for the trust policy. For instance, various advanced options may enable \u201cSteve\u201d to control what content and\/or computing resources \u201cKyle\u201d is able to access. The control portion  may also include a \u201cCancel\u201d portion selectable to cancel out of the trust designation for \u201cKyle.\u201d","Example Device",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"],"b":["600","600","104","102","106"]},"The computing device  includes one or more processors or processing units , one or more memory and\/or storage components , one or more input\/output (I\/O) devices , and a bus  that allows the various components and devices to communicate one to another.

Generally, software includes routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, and so forth that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. An implementation of these modules and techniques may be stored on or transmitted across some form of computer-readable media. The computer-readable media may include a variety of available medium or media that may be accessed by a computing device. By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable media may comprise \u201ccomputer-readable storage media.\u201d","Software or program modules, including the reputation module , communication module , service manager module , and other program modules, may be embodied as one or more instructions stored on computer-readable storage media. The computing device  may be configured to implement particular functions corresponding to the software or program modules stored on computer-readable storage media. Such instructions may be executable by one or more articles of manufacture (for example, one or more computing device , and\/or processors ) to implement techniques for reputation mashup, as well as other techniques. Such techniques include, but are not limited to, the example procedures described herein. Thus, computer-readable storage media may be configured to store instructions that, when executed by one or more devices described herein, cause various techniques for reputation mashup.","The computer-readable storage media includes volatile and non-volatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in a method or technology suitable for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data.
