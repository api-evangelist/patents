title: High-yield entangled single photon source
abstract: The various technologies presented herein relate to utilizing photons at respective idler and signal frequencies to facilitate generation of photons at a pump frequency. A strong pump field can be applied at the ωand the ωfrequencies, with the generated idler and signal pulses being utilized to generate a photon pair at the ωfrequency. Further, the idler pump power can be increased relative to the signal pump power such that the pump power P>pump power P. Such reversed operation (e.g., ω+ω→ω+ω) can minimize and/or negate Raman scattering effects. By complying with an energy conservation requirement, the ωand ωphotons interacting with the material through the four-wave mixing process facilitates the entanglement of the ωand ωphotons. The ωand ωphotons can be respectively formed in different length waveguides with a delay utilized to facilitate common timing between the ωand ωphotons.

The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","A number of technologies, such as quantum communication, quantum calculation, etc., rely on a source of photon pairs (e.g., an entangled photon pair comprising an idler photon, \u03c9, and a signal photon, \u03c9) which can facilitate confirmation that a received photon pair is valid. Conventional approaches to providing the photon pairs include parametric down conversion (PDC) which can utilize bulk optics, and also four-wave mixing (FWM) which can utilize fiber optics. A detriment of PDC is that the direction of the photon pair is completely random, hence a pair of photons can be symmetrically opposite but no prediction can be made with regard to the photon direction in either of the positive direction of a first photon or a negative direction of a second photon. Accordingly, large bulk optic lenses are utilized to facilitate capturing as many photons as possible across the range of potential directions, while the collected number of photons is limited by the acceptance angle of the device receiving the photons.","The problem of photon directionality can be addressed by FWM in a waveguide based system, but owing to such effects as Raman scattering, a conventional approach of generating \u03c9and \u03c9based upon a pulse comprising a pair of pumped photons \u03c9and \u03c9can lead to uncertainty regarding whether the \u03c9and \u03c9photons have been formed and received as expected.","For instance, with reference to , an idler photon \u03c9, in idler pulse , and a signal photon \u03c9, in signal pulse , are generated by a pair of pump photons \u03c9and \u03c9, in pump pulses  and , where for degenerate FWM, \u03c9and \u03c9can have a common frequency, \u03c9. As shown in , the frequency of the respective pulses are \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9. In an aspect, the photon pairs can be generated at frequencies \u03c9and \u03c9by inserting a strong field at the pump frequencies \u03c9, hence \u03c9acts doubly as \u03c9and \u03c9. Each pair of pump photons, \u03c9and \u03c9, are effectively destroyed in a pump pulse during the energy exchange occurring between the destroyed pump photons \u03c9and \u03c9, and the newly created \u03c9and \u03c9. Accordingly, per a spontaneous FWM process, the pumped pair \u03c9and \u03c9disappear and the idler\/signal pair \u03c9and \u03c9arise, or the idler\/signal pair \u03c9and \u03c9disappear and the pumped pair \u03c9and \u03c9arise.","A rate of generation of a photon pair \u03c9and \u03c9, rate r, can be determined in accordance with Equation 1:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"r","mn":"1"},"mo":"\u221d","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"\u03b3","mn":"2"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"msub":[{"mi":"P","mrow":{"mi":"p","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}},{"mi":"P","mrow":{"mi":"p","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}],"mrow":{"mo":"\u222b","mrow":{"mo":"\u222b","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"sinc","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u0394","kL"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mn":"2"}}},{"mi":"exp","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"\u0394\u03c9","mrow":{"mi":"p","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}},{"mi":"\u0394\u03c9","mrow":{"mi":"p","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}],"mo":"+"}},"mn":"2"},"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u03c3","mn":"2"}}}}}},{"mo":"\u2146","msub":{"mi":"\u03c9","mrow":{"mi":"p","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}},{"mo":"\u2146","msub":{"mi":"\u03c9","mrow":{"mi":"p","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"]}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eqn","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"where \u03b3=nonlinearity coefficient of a fiber, P=pump power at \u03c9, P=pump power at \u03c9, k=phase propagation constant, L=fiber length, \u03c9=idler photon wavelength, \u03c9=pump photon frequencies, \u03c3=spectral bandwidth of pump pulses.","Further, for a high efficiency of operation in generating photons at \u03c9and \u03c9there is a requirement for two conditions to be satisfied: (a) energy conservation and (b) momentum of conservation (also referred to as phase matching). Energy conservation indicates that a photon pair will always exist, hence, if two existing photons are destroyed at the pump then two new photons will be formed, one idler photon in the idler pulse and one signal photon in the signal pulse, per Equation 2:\n\n\u03c9+\u03c9\u22122\u03c9=0\u2003\u2003Eqn. 2\n","The momentum of conservation is satisfied per Equation 3:\n\n\u22122\u22122\u03b3=0\u2003\u2003Eqn. 3\n","where k, k, and kare the respective propagation constants for the respective \u03c9, \u03c9, and \u03c9& \u03c9, for a forward mixing gain, while the fiber nonlinearity \u03b3 in conjunction with the pump power P can provide a measure of the effect of the fiber nonlinearity for a given pump power.","Theoretically, the total photon distribution between \u03c9& \u03c9and \u03c9& \u03c9should be preserved. Unfortunately, various deleterious effects can affect generation and\/or propagation of the various photons, such an effect being Raman scattering which can scatter photons into different wavelengths, e.g., by a non-linear mechanism.  presents a Raman scattering effect and an associated frequency and bandwidth offsets for photons generated by an oscillator. The Raman gain shape  is presented along with theoretical gain shapes  (for the \u03c9photon) and  (for the \u03c9photon), each gain shape has been normalized individually. In an aspect, the idler photon and signal photon frequencies are determined by the propagation constants and the nonlinearity of the waveguide, per Eqn. 3. It is to be noted that the Raman scattering only occurs on the idler side of the frequency range in optical fibers, with a peak generation of about \u221213 THz, which is the resonant frequency between molecular heat and molecular vibration of a waveguide molecular lattice. In other words, fiber material only dissipates energy from the optical waves to the heat bath (converting high energy, high frequency photons to lower energy, lower frequency, photons), instead of adding energy to the optical wave. Which process dominates depends on material characteristics.","In a waveguide (e.g., a fiber) carrying a \u03c9photon, Raman scattering  can add an uncorrelated photon at \u03c9, which confuses the photon number entanglement between \u03c9and \u03c9. Ideally, a transference of energy between the light field (e.g., the \u03c9photon) and the waveguide molecules is a lossless operation. However, owing to each waveguide molecule being connected to adjacent molecules, some of the transferred energy can be lost as heat radiation dissipating throughout the waveguide structure as the molecular lattice vibrates under the stimulation of the impinging \u03c9photon. The loss of energy to the molecular lattice leads to the overall energy no longer being available to form a photon(s) of the same optical equivalent (e.g., wavelength, frequency, etc.) as that of the impinging \u03c9photon; any new photon which is formed in the waveguide will re-enter the light field but with an energy smaller than that of the impinging \u03c9photon. This Raman process is separate from the desired four-wave mixing process. The consequence of the addition of a photon on the idler frequency via the Raman process is that the number of photons between the idler and that of the signal may differ. To facilitate measurement of the \u03c9photon(s) and the \u03c9photon(s), the respective photons can be split and directed to two separate optical waveguide paths, e.g., an idler leg and a signal leg. A count can be taken on each of the legs to determine the number of \u03c9photon(s) vs. the number of \u03c9photon(s), with, theoretically, the entangled photons generating the same number of photons on both legs. However, per the above, the number of \u03c9photons on the idler leg can be greater than the number of \u03c9photons on the signal leg. The correlation of photons on each leg of a conventional system is no longer 100% pure owing to the Raman scattering contamination.","As shown in , as the rate of generation of the various photons is increased, so the number of unwanted photons being generated as a function of Raman scattering is also increased. Plot  indicates an increase in the rate of entangled photon generation (count per second, cps) as the pump input power is increased from about 0.2 mW to about 1.0 mW. However, as the pump input power is increased there is a corresponding increase in the number of unwanted photons formed, per plot , where plot  is a plot of pump input power vs. coincidence\/accident ratio (plotted in log scale). Coincidence indicates that the number of photons on the idler leg and the signal leg are equal, e.g., for each idler photon there is a corresponding signal photon. Accident indicates the number of photons which are different between the idler leg and signal leg, e.g., there may be X idler photons vs. Y signal photons where X>Y. At about 0.2 mW, plot  indicates a coincidence\/accident ratio of between about 1 in 1000 and about 1 in 10,000. At about 1 mW, plot  indicates the coincidence\/accident ratio has reduced to about 1 in 10, a high degree of Raman scattering contamination is occurring. Hence, while increasing the pump input power (per Eqn. 1, where ris squarely proportional to the pump power P) increases the rate at which the entangled photons are formed, the increased pump input power also results in an increase in the number of unwanted electrons formed. Furthermore, as shown in , the Raman spectrum has such a broad spectrum that it can be difficult to avoid when using a conventional FWM degenerate pumping approach.","Hence, for a system operating based upon detection of a co-formed photon pairing comprising of a \u03c9and \u03c9, the effects of (a) the shifting of the \u03c9photon, and\/or (b) generation of further \u03c9photons from an originating \u03c9photon can lead to an erroneous determination that a received pair of photons \u03c9and \u03c9are actually correlated (e.g., are the original entangled pair). While the FWM mechanism is elastic in terms of energy conservation, Raman scattering fails to conserve the energy leading to breakage of the photon entanglement which can be detrimental to many quantum-based operations. For example, numerous quantum information science applications requires true single-photon source. Having a perfect correlation between the number of photons at the idler and the signal frequencies, one can gate the output of the signal frequency while counting the photons at the idler frequency. Only when the counted number of photons at the idler frequency is one, the gate at the signal frequency opens letting the signal photon out. This is one way of realizing a true single photon source using a perfectly entangled photon pair source. Especially quantum communication strictly requires only one photon at a time. Otherwise, an eavesdropper can tap the extra photon and obtain the information while being unnoticed.","The following is a brief summary of subject matter that is described in greater detail herein. This summary is not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the claims.","Various exemplary embodiments presented herein relate to formation of entangled photons. In an exemplary embodiment a method is presented, the method comprising forming an idler photon, wherein the idler photon has a first resonant frequency and forming a signal photon, wherein the signal photon has a second resonant frequency.

In an embodiment, the first resonant frequency can be less than the third resonant frequency, and the third resonant frequency can be less than the second resonant frequency.","A further exemplary embodiment for forming photon pairs is presented, wherein the embodiment is a system comprising an oscillator configured to generate a first photon and a second photon, wherein the first photon and the second photon can be entangled. The system can further comprise a first waveguide configured to convey the first photon, wherein the first waveguide has a first length, the first photon interacting with the waveguide to facilitate a shift in a first wavelength of the first photon to a second wavelength. The system can further comprise a second waveguide configured to convey the second photon, wherein the second waveguide has a second length, and the second photon can interact with the waveguide to facilitate a shift in a third wavelength of the second photon to a fourth wavelength. In an embodiment, the second waveguide can be shorter than the first waveguide and a time to convey the second photon through the second waveguide can be less than a time to convey the first photon through the first waveguide. The system can further comprise a delay component located at the second waveguide, wherein the delay component can be configured to delay the second photon by a time of duration equal to a difference in the time to convey the second photon through the second waveguide and the time to convey the first photon through the first waveguide. The system can further comprise a multiplexer configured to recombine the first photon with the second photon to form a second pulse. The system can further comprise a third waveguide configured to convey the second pulse, wherein the first photon and the second photon can interact with the third waveguide to facilitate formation of a pair of photons. In an embodiment the pair of photons can have a frequency different to a frequency of the first photon and to a frequency of the second photon.","The above summary presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the systems and\/or methods discussed herein. This summary is not an extensive overview of the systems and\/or methods discussed herein. It is not intended to identify key\/critical elements or to delineate the scope of such systems and\/or methods. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","Various technologies pertaining to the formation of a photon either as a single photon, or a photon pair are presented, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident, however, that such aspect(s) may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing one or more aspects.","Further, the term \u201cor\u201d is intended to mean an inclusive \u201cor\u201d rather than an exclusive \u201cor\u201d. That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from the context, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is satisfied by any of the following instances: X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B. In addition, the articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean \u201cone or more\u201d unless specified otherwise or clear from the context to be directed to a singular form. Additionally, as used herein, the term \u201cexemplary\u201d is intended to mean serving as an illustration or example of something, and is not intended to indicate a preference.","In an embodiment, a strong pump field can be applied at the \u03c9and the \u03c9frequencies, with the generated idler and signal pulses being utilized to generate a photon pair at the \u03c9frequency. Further, the idler pump power can be increased relative to the signal pump power such that the pump power P>pump power P. Such reversed operation (e.g., \u03c9+\u03c9\u2192\u03c9+\u03c9) can minimize and\/or negate the Raman scattering effect for a FWM-based operation. By complying with the energy conservation requirement, per Eqn. 2, the \u03c9and \u03c9photons are entangled, and hence in an aspect, can be indistinguishable. In another aspect, e.g., to satisfy an application requirement, \u03c9and \u03c9can be distinguishable by such techniques as polarization, by wavelength based on waveguide design, etc. The various waveguides presented herein can act in a nonlinear manner (e.g., as a third order, \u03c7, nonlinear process), and hence operate with four lightwaves or pulses having disparate optical frequencies or wavelengths.","As shown in , rather than utilizing the pumped pair of photons \u03c9and \u03c9to generate a pair of photons \u03c9and \u03c9, the operation is effectively reversed whereby the \u03c9and \u03c9photons are pumped to form a pair of photons \u03c9and \u03c9. Hence, while Raman scattering effects can be encountered, e.g., regions  and , the effects can be avoided by utilizing \u03c9and \u03c9as the photons which are transmitted into a photonic crystal fiber (PCF), whereby the respective wavelengths of photons \u03c9and \u03c9can be selected to avoid the wavelength(s) at which Raman scattering can occur.","In comparison with Eqn , a rate, r, of generation of a photon pair \u03c9and \u03c9p can be determined in accordance with Equation 4:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"r","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u221d","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"\u03b3","mn":"2"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"msub":[{"mi":["P","s"]},{"mi":["P","i"]}],"mrow":{"mo":"\u222b","mrow":{"mo":"\u222b","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"sinc","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u0394","kL"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mn":"2"}}},{"mi":"exp","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["\u0394\u03c9","s"]},{"mi":["\u0394\u03c9","i"]}],"mo":"+"}},"mn":"2"},"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u03c3","mn":"2"}}}}}},{"mo":"\u2146","msub":{"mi":["\u03c9","s"]}},{"mo":"\u2146","msub":{"mi":["\u03c9","i"]}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"]}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eqn","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"4"}}]}}}}},"where the rate of photon pair generation ris proportional, in part, to the product of the two pump powers Pand P. Owing to rbeing proportional to the product of the two pump powers Pand Pthe respective pump powers Pand Pdo not have to be identical. Accordingly, in an embodiment the power at Pcan be limited while the power Pcan be increased which correspondingly increases r. In a further embodiment, the power at Pcan be limited while the power Pcan be increased which correspondingly increases r. In an aspect, consideration may have to be given to the available pump power that can be applied to Pwhen increasing the pump power P. In an aspect, the rate of generation of entangled pairs \u03c9and \u03c9can be increased by utilizing PCF.","In another embodiment, when photons \u03c9and \u03c9are pumped with a respective orthogonal polarization (e.g., s\u22a5i), photons \u03c9and \u03c9can be formed in an entangled state which satisfies the Bell state (e.g., having the simplest possible examples of entanglement in accordance with the Bell inequality). As shown in , the power Pcan be increased in orders of magnitude higher than can be achieved with conventional degenerate FWM pumping. Accordingly, owing to the higher power of P, in conjunction with a power P, a higher gain can be applied to a pulse oscillator (e.g., Ti:sapphire pulsed laser) compared with a gain applied to an oscillator in a conventional system (per ).","In an embodiment, FWM is a pumped pulse operation, where the pumped pulse can be \u2018ultra-short\u2019, e.g., about 100 femtoseconds (1\u00d710seconds). However, lasers which operate in the \u2018ultra-short\u2019 pulse duration range can exhibit timing jitter. For example, a timing jitter of about \u00b115 fs can be experienced when operating a laser with a mean of about 100 fs pulse duration. Hence, when utilizing separate pumps at \u03c9and \u03c9the timing jitter can lead to a high probability that the respective photons \u03c9and \u03c9are not aligned in both time and space.","To overcome the jitter effect, advantage can be taken of the phenomenon \u201cself-frequency-shifted Raman soliton\u201d, which is depicted in . , plot , illustrates the effect of intrapulse Raman pumping, according to an embodiment. As a pulse (e.g., \u03c9or \u03c9photon based) propagates down a fiber, the wavelength of the pulse can be shifted to a longer wavelength, as shown in plot , where application of intrapulse Raman pumping can lead to a pulse shift from a lower wavelength region  to a higher wavelength region .
