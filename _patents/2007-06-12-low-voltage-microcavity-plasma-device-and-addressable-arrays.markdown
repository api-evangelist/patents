No. 60\/812,755, which was filed on Jun. 12, 2006.","The invention was made with government support under Contract No. F49620-03-1-0391 awarded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), and Contract No. NSF DMI 03-28162 awarded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The government has certain rights in the invention.","The invention is in the field of microcavity plasma devices, also known as microdischarge devices or plasma devices.","Microcavity plasma devices produce a nonequilibrium, low temperature plasma within, and essentially confined to, a cavity having a characteristic dimension d below approximately 500 \u03bcm. This new class of plasma devices exhibits several properties that differ substantially from those of conventional, macroscopic plasma sources. Because of their small physical dimensions, microcavity plasmas normally operate at gas (or vapor) pressures considerably higher than those accessible to macroscopic devices. For example, plasma devices with a cylindrical microcavity having a diameter of 200-300 \u03bcm (or less) are capable of operation at rare gas (as well as Nand other gases tested to date) pressures up to and beyond one atmosphere. In contrast, standard fluorescent lamps, for example, operate at pressures typically less than 1% of atmospheric pressure. High pressure operation of microcavity plasma devices is advantageous. It is well known, for example, that plasma chemistry at higher pressures favors the formation of several families of electronically-excited molecules, including the rare gas dimers (Xe, Kr, Ar, . . . ) and the rare gas-halides (such as XeCl, ArF, and KrF) that are known to be efficient emitters of ultraviolet (UV), vacuum ultraviolet (VUV), and visible radiation. This characteristic, in combination with the ability of microplasma devices to operate with a wide range of gases or vapors (and combinations thereof), offers emission wavelengths extending over a broad spectral range. Furthermore, operation of the plasma in the vicinity of atmospheric pressure minimizes the pressure differential across the packaging material when a microplasma device or array is sealed.","Another unique feature of microplasma devices is the large power deposition into the plasma (typically tens of kW\/cmor more), which is partially responsible for the efficient production of atoms and molecules that are well-known optical emitters. Consequently, because of the properties of microplasma devices, including the high pressure operation mentioned above and their electron and gas temperatures, microplasmas are efficient sources of optical radiation.","Microcavity plasma devices have been developed over the past decade for a wide variety of applications. An exemplary application for an array of microplasmas is in the area of displays. Since single cylindrical microplasma devices, for example, with a characteristic dimension (d) as small as 10 \u03bcm have been demonstrated, devices or groups of devices offer a spatial resolution that is desirable for a pixel in a display. In addition, the efficiency for generating, with a microcavity plasma device, the ultraviolet light at the heart of the plasma display panel (PDP) can exceed that of the discharge structure currently used in plasma televisions.","Early microplasma devices were driven by direct current (DC) voltages and exhibited short lifetimes for several reasons, including sputtering damage to the metal electrodes. Improvements in device design and fabrication have extended lifetimes significantly, but minimizing the cost of materials and the manufacture of large arrays continue to be key considerations. Also, more recently-developed microplasma devices excited by a time-varying voltage are preferable when lifetime is of primary concern.","Research by the present inventors and colleagues at the University of Illinois has pioneered and advanced the state of microcavity plasma devices. This work has resulted in practical devices with one or more important features and structures. Most of these devices are able to operate continuously with power loadings of tens of kW-cmto beyond 100 kW-cm. One such device that has been realized is a multi-segment linear array of microplasmas designed for pumping optical amplifiers and lasers. Also, the ability to interface a gas (or vapor) phase plasma with the electron-hole plasma in a semiconductor has been demonstrated. Fabrication processes developed largely by the semiconductor and microelectromechanical systems (MEMs) communities have been adopted for fabricating many of the microcavity plasma devices. Use of silicon integrated circuit fabrication methods has further reduced the size and cost of microcavity plasma devices and arrays. Because of the batch nature of micromachining, not only are the performance characteristics of the devices improved, but the cost of fabricating large arrays is also reduced. The ability to fabricate large arrays with precise tolerances and high density makes these devices attractive for display applications.","This research by the present inventors and colleagues at the University of Illinois has resulted in exemplary practical devices. For example, semiconductor fabrication processes have been adopted to demonstrate densely packed arrays of microplasma devices exhibiting uniform emission characteristics. Arrays fabricated in silicon comprise as many as 250,000 microplasma devices in an active area of 25 cm, each device in the array having an emitting aperture of typically 50 \u03bcm\u00d750 \u03bcm. It has been demonstrated that such arrays can be used to excite phosphors in a manner analogous to plasma display panels, but with values of the luminous efficacy that are not presently achievable with conventional plasma display panels. Another important device is a microcavity plasma photodetector that exhibits high sensitivity. Phase locking of microplasmas dispersed in an array has also been demonstrated.","The following U.S. patents and patent applications describe microcavity plasma devices resulting from these research efforts.

Widespread adoption of microcavity plasma devices in displays will hinge on several critical factors, including efficacy (discussed earlier), lifetime and addressability. Addressability, in particular, is vital in most display applications. For example, for a group of microcavity discharges to act as a pixel, each microplasma device must be individually addressable.","Microcavity plasma devices and arrays of microcavity plasma devices are provided that have a reduced excitation voltage.

Also provided is a symmetrical microplasma device for which current waveforms are the same for each half-cycle of the voltage driving waveform. Additionally, the invention also provides devices that have standoff portions and voids that can reduce cross talk.","An embodiment of the invention is a microcavity plasma device having a microcavity formed in a substrate. First and second electrodes are disposed to excite a plasma in the microcavity upon application of a time-varying potential (AC, RF, bipolar or pulsed DC, etc.) between the first and second electrodes. The structure of the devices is that of a dielectric barrier configuration in which dielectric films isolate the first and second electrodes from a plasma formed in said microcavity. A trigger electrode disposed proximate to the microcavity reduces the required voltage potential between the first and second electrodes to ignite a plasma. In preferred devices, a controller (power supply) applies a voltage waveform to the trigger electrode to reduce the required operating voltage applied to the first and second electrodes. In a preferred embodiment, the trigger electrode is disposed opposite the microcavity, and is transparent. Another preferred embodiment is an array of microcavity plasma devices with at least one, and preferably all or a substantial percentage, of the microcavity plasma devices in the array including trigger electrodes.","An embodiment of the invention is a microcavity plasma device having a trigger electrode that reduces the excitation voltage required to be supplied to the first and second electrodes of the device.

One or more dielectric layers isolates the first and second electrodes from a plasma formed in said microcavity. A trigger electrode is disposed proximate to said microcavity. Upon application of an appropriate small voltage to the trigger electrode, the voltage waveforms applied to the first and second electrodes required to excite a plasma in the microcavity can be of a lower voltage than if the trigger electrode had not been used or was not present.","Devices and methods of the invention provide low-voltage addressable microcavity plasma device arrays. In a preferred embodiment, transparent trigger electrodes are positioned opposite microcavities in an array of microcavity plasma devices. The trigger electrodes can be driven with a small time-varying voltage to produce a substantial reduction in the voltage levels required to be supplied to driving electrodes of the microcavity plasma devices in the array. In an example embodiment, the first electrodes are connected electrically to those of microcavities in a row within an array and the second electrodes are connected electrically to those of microcavities in a column within that array. Individual microcavities in the array are addressed, and addressing can be accomplished with voltage waveforms applied to the trigger electrode.","Preferred embodiments will now be discussed with respect to the drawings.

Features may be exaggerated for purposes of illustration. From the preferred embodiments, artisans will recognize additional features and broader aspects of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","10"]},"A microcavity  is defined in a substrate . The microcavity can have any number of shapes. The shape (cross-sectional geometry and depth) of the microcavity, as well as the identity of the gas(es) or vapor(s) in the microcavity , the applied voltage and the voltage waveform, determine the plasma configuration within the cavity and the radiative efficiency of a plasma, given a specific atomic or molecular emitter. Example microcavity shapes include cylinders and inverted pyramids. Preferred embodiment devices include microcavities that have tapered sidewalls. Tapered cavities are relatively inexpensive and easy to fabricate using conventional wet chemical processing techniques for semiconductors. The positive differential resistance of devices with tapered sidewalls permits self-ballasting of the devices and simplifies external control circuitry. Microdischarge devices with tapered cavities also offer an increase in microcavity surface area and control over the depth of the microcavity to be fabricated, thereby enabling straightforward modification of the electrical properties of devices as desired. In addition, increased radiative output efficiencies are obtained by coating the tapered side walls with an optically reflective coating or a coating with a relatively small work function. Additional information regarding particular tapered cavities can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 7,112,918, entitled Microdischarge Devices and Arrays Having Tapered Microcavities, which issued Sep. 26, 2006. The inverted pyramidal shape of the microcavity  in  represents a preferred embodiment and is shown in  and other embodiments to be discussed below.","Substrate  can be formed of any material amenable to semiconductor fabrication processes, including semiconductor, conductor or insulator materials. However, the inverted pyramidal microcavity of  is formed with precision and economically if substrate  is silicon, which is the material of choice in preferred embodiments. In the device  of , the substrate  is conductive and forms a first electrode , which is isolated from a second electrode  by dielectric, and dielectric also isolates the electrodes  and  from the cavity . Specifically, a multi-layer dielectric including first dielectric layers ,  and second dielectric layers ,  achieve the isolation. The dielectric layers ,  and ,  can be, for example, metal oxide, SiO, SiN, or polymer layers. The first and second dielectric layers are preferably formed of different materials. Dielectric performance can be improved with multiple dielectric layers of different materials. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, dielectric films  and  are SiOor SiNwhereas dielectric  is a polymer, e.g., polyimide.","Trigger electrode , which serves to reduce the voltage required to ignite a plasma in microcavity , is also electrically and physically isolated from the microcavity and the other two electrodes by a multilayer dielectric.

A gas or gases, vapor or vapors, or combinations of gas(es) and vapor(s), is sealed in the microcavity by a transparent layer , e.g., glass or plastic. Phosphor , disposed within the microcavity , is useful, for example, to produce color displays. Additionally, the color of an emission from the microcavity is influenced by the type of gas(es) and vapor(s) in the microcavity.

The primary difference between this structure and that of  is the addition of another dielectric layer  above the electrodes  and within the microcavity . Experimental tests indicate that this design is effective in containing the plasma within the inverted pyramidal microcavity . Measurements also indicate no detrimental effects (such as an increased firing voltage) arising from the additional dielectric layer. In a preferred embodiment, the layer  is a polymer, e.g., polyimide and is relatively thick (\u02dc2-15 \u03bcm). Alternating polymer and nitride dielectric layers have shown good performance in experimental embodiments. In a preferred embodiment, layers ,  are nitride layers and layers ,  are polymer layers. In other embodiments, the dielectric layers are formed of ceramic materials. One particular example embodiment has the layer  formed of a low temperature melting glass layer, and it can serve as both a dielectric layer and an adhesive to bond a layer such as layer  (not shown in ).","Another preferred embodiment of the microplasma device is illustrated in cross-section in . This device is double-sided (symmetrical) with two connected cavities , and, therefore, produces identical current waveforms in each half cycle of the driving voltage waveform. To fabricate this structure requires a thin substrate  (preferably silicon) such that etching of the pyramidal microcavities , will breach the Si wafer completely. That is, a hole is formed that is centered on the apex of the two square pyramids. The opening produced by the wet etching process in silicon (100) wafers has a square cross-section. The device of  operates by using the Si substrate  as an electrode common to both microcavity devices. The second electrode  for each of the two devices is the conducting layer lying at the edge of the microcavity opening.

The cavity serving as the cathode switches each half cycle. The dielectric layers in  are the same as those of  and are labeled with similar reference numbers. Another advantage of the structure of  is that a portion of the light produced by the microplasma in either cavity is coupled into the other cavity.

The transparent layer  illustrated in the various embodiments can be, for example, a thin glass, quartz, or plastic layer. The pressure of the discharge medium can be maintained at or near atmospheric pressure, permitting the use of a very thin glass or plastic layer because of the small pressure differential across the transparent layer .","Experimental Devices and Waveforms for Low Voltage Operation","Example experimental devices have been fabricated to demonstrate the invention. Trigger electrodes substantially reduce the voltages required by driving electrodes, e.g., address and sustain electrodes, to ignite a plasma. Small voltage pulses applied to the trigger electrodes show a substantial benefit in a reduction of the driving voltage, which is advantageous in many applications. Microcavity plasma devices of the invention can form the basis for small and large scale high resolution displays.","Experimental data and devices are presented here and illustrate exemplary embodiments. The experimental devices are readily produced in larger formats, as will be appreciated by artisans. Many additional features, aspects and embodiments of the invention will be apparent to artisans. Artisans will recognize additional features and variations, as well as broader aspects of the invention from the data and description presented herein.","Example experimental device structures were fabricated on a Si wafer and included a bottom electrode, which enters each pyramidal Si device and runs along the bottom of the pyramid. This is similar to the structure shown in . The device is powered by two electrodes, the first of which is a 50-100 \u03bcm wide Ni strip that passes through the microcavity and on to the next device. After depositing a multilayer dielectric on top of the first electrode, a second Ni electrode is then patterned onto the device (near the periphery of each microcavity).","In experiments, electrodes were 100-200 \u03bcm wide. Electrodes of this width are easier to align with the trigger electrode and transparent layer. Wide electrodes are also beneficial, as the increased electrode area allows for larger currents, significantly improved array brightness, and a more symmetric plasma produced in each pixel. Also, this structure is free of crosstalk. In the experimental devices, the electrode width is a bit larger than that of the microcavity, leading to the production of plasma outside the mouth of each microcavity. Although the pyramidal microcavity has an aperture of 100\u00d7100 \u03bcm, the aperture narrows to (\u02dc70 \u03bcm)because of the dielectric and electrode films overcoating the cavity. Arrays with 70 \u03bcm wide electrodes have also been fabricated to confine the plasma in the microcavity. Artisans will appreciate that commercial semiconductor fabrication techniques are well suited to readily align small width electrodes with microcavities and with associated trigger electrodes for all of the illustrated embodiments, and for other low voltage arrays of microcavity plasma devices of the invention.","A particular experimental array of microcavity plasma devices was an array of 20\u00d720 microcavity plasma devices. The microcavities in the experimental device had bottom electrodes that were 100 \u03bcm in width and were operated at 600 Torr Ne. During operation, the array showed high uniformity of emission within each microcavity but a slight grading of the intensity across an array of devices. This nonuniformity is attributed to the resistivity of the electrodes because the film thickness of the electrodes was only 0.15 \u03bcm. Increased electrode thickness (e.g. >0.35 \u03bcm) is expected to improve further the uniformity of emission across the array.","Experiments did demonstrate a substantial reduction in the voltage required to ignite a plasma in the microcavities. Specifically, the ignition voltage for Ne\/5% Xe mixtures (600 Torr) is only 180 V for devices with 100 \u03bcm wide bottom electrodes. Devices that are otherwise similar but lacking a trigger electrode required 200 V.","50\u00d750 arrays of experimental devices having the three-electrode device configuration of the embodiment shown in  were tested in detail.  illustrates the convention for the application of voltage waveforms during testing as would be applied by a controller  to reduce the required voltage to ignite a plasma.  shows the voltage waveforms applied by the controller during testing. The voltage waveforms applied to electrodes X and Y were chosen to be mirror images of one another, as shown in . Each pulse (positive or negative) has a temporal width of 10 \u03bcsec. Because of the proximity of electrodes Z and X (an ITO film and Ni electrode, respectively), electrode Z serves as a trigger electrode and the lowest waveform in  is that supplied to electrode Z for the tests to date. Table I presents the results of ignition tests with the 50\u00d750 pixel array. With no voltage waveform applied to electrode Z, array ignition requires both Vand Vto be 165 V. Surprisingly, supplying only 40 V pulses to electrode Z reduces Vby 25 V and Vby 5 V. Further increases in the voltage delivered to the address electrode result in the required value of Vdropping by as much as 42 V. The minimum address electrode voltage measured in testing (when using the trigger electrode) is well below the 80-100 V typically required to address the plasma pixels in a conventional plasma display panel (PDP). It was also found (Table II) that increasing the widths of the pulses supplied to the address electrode (Z) beyond 2-5 \u03bcsec had little effect on array performance.","Use of the trigger electrode as an address electrode is so effective that it was possible to sustain the array with the waveforms illustrated in . Notice that in  that a five-cycle sequence of waveforms identical to those of  is applied to electrodes X and Y, but only one cycle is delivered to the address (trigger) electrode.","Additional variations to the embodiments discussed earlier include: 1) decreasing the Z-X electrode gap (at \u02dc0.5 mm in example prototypes) in order to reduce the address voltage further, and 2) exploiting the pressure dependence of the switching behavior of these arrays. The rise and fall times of the plasma fluorescence, and analyzing the effect on discharge properties of varying the drive waveforms, are also of interest.
