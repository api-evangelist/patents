title: Communications
abstract: A call center associated with an intelligent network has no service-specific executable application software running on its operator positions. Instead, each computer stores a set of templates which define respective screen displays, including text display areas and text input areas, and also a set of corporate logos. When an intelligent peripheral of the network is not able to proceed with a call in accordance with an application, a failure notification is sent to the network, which reroutes, i.e. connects, that call to the call center and sends a message including an identifier for a template to be used by an operator position in generating a screen display. The operator interacts with the customer, obtains information and enters this in the text entry areas, sends a return message to the network, which then sends a message containing an identifier for a template to be used for the next stage of that application.

Field of the Invention","This invention relates to methods of and apparatus for providing communications services, and particularly, but not exclusively, to nodes for use in, and call centres for use with, intelligent networks (INs).","2. Background of Related Art","IN techniques have been understood for some time to offer a flexible and possibly more cost effective route to the development and deployment of advanced telecommunications call handling services than traditional methods. Essentially, IN techniques effectively consist of the separation of call processing functions within a telephone exchange, or equivalent entity, from the service logic which provides the actual telecommunications service\u2014such as \u201cFreefone\u201d type services typified by the 0800 numbering range in the United Kingdom.","According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of operating a node of a communications network, the method including responding to a call from a calling user encountering automatic processing difficulties by the steps of:\n\n","There may be included the step of sending from the node to the call centre first calling user-related information data for inclusion within the screen display corresponding to that selected template.","The first calling user-related information may be sent in said first message.","There may be included the steps of:\n\n","Preferably, there is included the step of sending from the node to the call centre a further message associated with that call and comprising data defining a further one of said set of templates selected in dependence upon the result of said processing.","According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of operating a call centre having operator positions, the method comprising the steps of:\n\n","Preferably, there are included the steps of receiving from the node first calling user-related information, and generating that respective screen display including said first calling user-related information.","The first calling user-related information may be received in the first message.","There may be included the steps of receiving from the calling user second calling user-related information, and entering said second calling user-related information into text entry areas of that respective screen display.","Preferably, there is included the step of sending to the node a second message associated with that call and including at least said second calling user-related information.","According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a node for use in a communications network, the node being arranged to respond to a call from a calling user encountering automatic processing difficulties by\n\n","Preferably, the node is arranged to respond to receipt from the call centre of a second message associated with that call and comprising calling user-related information by processing said calling user-related information.","Preferably, there is included the step of sending from the node to the call centre a further message associated with that call and comprising data defining a further one of said set of templates selected in dependence upon the result of said processing.","According to a fourth aspect of the present invention there is provided a call centre arranged to store at each of a plurality of operator positions a set of templates, each of the templates comprising data for generating a respective screen display at a said operator position; and being arranged to\n\n","Preferably, the call centre is arranged to receive from the calling user second calling user-related information, to enter said second calling user-related information into text entry areas of that respective screen display, and to send to the node a second message associated with that call and including at least said second calling user-related information.","Before describing the Figures in detail, a brief description the functionality of some of the principal components of an intelligent network (IN) will be given as an aid to understanding of the present invention. The principal components of an IN include:\u2014\n\n","The SCP connects to controlled telecommunications networks via an appropriate signalling means. For the public switched telecommunications network (PSTN), this is currently via a modification of ITU-T (formerly known as CCITT) No.7 signalling system (referred to as SS7) using the Intelligent Network Application Protocol. SS7 is a general purpose protocol and may be replaced by a special purpose protocol in the future, but this is not a significant matter for the purposes of the present invention.","SS7 signalling messages flow from a controlled switch of the PSTN, referred to as a service switching point (SSP), to a signalling termination which forms part of the SCP. In practice, the signalling between an individual SSP and the SCP passes via one or more intermediate signalling transfer points (STPs), also known as signalling point relays which enable the messages to be rerouted in the event of a failure in the signalling network\u2014either within the transmission circuits used or the terminating equipment.","The SCP comprises a number of physical and logical functions required to deliver, manage and enable services to be realised. These functions include:\u2014\n\n","The data communications network can be realised as an extended LAN, i.e. one which uses WAN elements to connect individual LANs, or by using a single LAN architecture depending on the number of computer systems required and the technology choice for the data network.","Beginning now the detailed description, there is shown in  an intelligent network (IN)  comprising a service switching function (SSF) comprising a plurality of service switching points (SSPs) , a service control function (SCF) comprising a plurality of service control points (SCPs) , a plurality of intelligent peripherals (IPs) , only one of which is shown, a service management system (SMS) , and a signalling transfer function (STF) comprising a plurality of signalling transfer points (STPs) , only one of which is shown.","A call centre  is coupled to each of the SCPs  via a respective operational command link  shown in dashed line, only one of which is shown, and to one of the SSPs  via a network signalling link , and a traffic data link  shown in continuous thick line.","As is known, some of the SSPs  act as local exchanges and are connected to a plurality of network terminals  via a local access network, not shown, and some of the SSPs \u2032, only one of which is shown, act as trunk exchanges.","For more information on intelligent networks in general the reader is referred to BT Technology Journal Vol.13. No.2. April 1995, the theme of which is network intelligence.","Each SCP  is coupled to an STP  via a respective network signalling link A, and each STP  is coupled to a respective plurality of SSPs  via respective network signalling links B. Each SCP  is also coupled to the SMS  via an operational command link . Each IP  is coupled to the SMS  and to an associated SCP  via respective operational command links  (also known as provisioning links), and to a respective one of the SSPs  via a network signalling link , and a traffic data link .","In , there is shown the software architecture of an SCP , which is based on a distributed processing environment using object oriented, multi-threaded processing software techniques. It will thus be understood that an individual object can support multiple threads of control and multiple messaging sessions with many other objects simultaneously.","The SCP  is shown coupled to the external OSS , which provides customer handling, via a plurality of OSS servers , and to an external transport network domain (TN) , i.e. the telecommunications networks controlled from the SCP , via a plurality of signalling interface servers (referred to as SS7 servers)  arranged to handle signalling messages conforming to the international signalling system known as ITU-T common channel signalling system No.7. The SCP  is also coupled to the TN  via a plurality of IP servers , and a plurality of applications servers .","The distributed processing environment of the SCP  comprises a plurality of databases , and a plurality of database servers  (also known as data servers), each server  being coupled to a respective plurality of the databases , and further comprises a data communications infrastructure (DCI) or network  coupled to the servers , , ,  and , to a plurality of application processors (APs)  and to an SCP management system (MS) , and is realised by a set of software mechanisms (objects) conforming to the specification of an architecture known as common object request broker architecture (CORBA). This structure of the SCP  is well known in the art of intelligent networks.","One or more of the resident applications, also referred to as Services, running on the APs  is Card Service, and a specific example will be given of a use of a Chargecard service, also known as a Calling Card service, provided by British Telecommunications public limited company (BT), which includes the retrieval by a user, also referred to as a customer, of the service of messages recorded by a network-based message recording service (hereinafter referred to as \u201cvoicemail service\u201d), the platform (not shown) for which includes a database for storing deposited spoken messages.","There now follows a description of the processes which occur for a typical call scenario for a message recording service provided by the node. Whilst there are many difference tasks that can occur, every call using the platform proceeds in a similar way to the following description.","Assume that the customer has subscribed to the voicemail service as part of the Chargecard service. When the customer has activated the voicemail service, calls to the customer are automatically connected by the network to the platform and any desired spoken messages (hereinafter referred to as \u201cvoicemail messages\u201d) are recorded for later retrieval by the customer, and the voicemail platform will send information about the voicemail messages (customer account number, caller's name) to the Chargecard application running on the APs  for storage in the databases . The Chargecard application increments a stored calls register (not shown separately) associated with that account number and stores the name in association with an index representing the current position of that voicemail message in a database of the voicemail platform.","When the customer wishes to find out if he has any voicemail messages waiting for him, he dials the service access digits for gaining access to the voicemail service and the PSTN routes the call (regardless of where it has originated on the network) to an SCP .","The Chargecard application controls the operation of the SCP  to perform the following key steps:\u2014\n\n","In this scenario, this first API Resource Command is for generating a \u201cWelcome\u201d announcement and for collecting twelve digits representing the customer's account number and personal identification number (PIN).","The Resource #3 receives the application's command and starts generating the Welcome announcement, \u201cWelcome to Voicemail. Please enter your account number and PIN.\u201d The Resource #3 is arranged to identify digits received at any time after the start of the Welcome announcement, and to stop generating the announcement at the time that the first of these digits is received and recognised.","On receipt of the first digit, Resource #3 sends to the Chargecard application an API Event message including the value of the first received digit. This message is queued on the API Events section of the Call Instance. This Chargecard application requires the first digit to perform an initial part of the account number processing, but not all applications involving account numbers require the first digit for initial processing. The dialogue between the application and the Resource #X has not yet finished, i.e. it remains open, so the Dialogue Id is permitted to remain associated with the Call Instance's IP Resource.","In alternative embodiments Resource #3 contains means to perform validation of the customer's account number and PIN, by accessing a database, not shown, of customer-related data and comparing a retrieved customer-associated PIN with the customer's dialled PIN. The term \u201cdialled\u201d includes both digits manually entered via a telephone instrument or equivalent, and digits spoken by the customer and recognised by Resource #3.","Normally, the customer will enter his eight digit account number and his four digit PIN within a timeout started at the beginning of the announcement, and when twelve digits have been collected the Resource #3 will send a Digits Collected message containing the digits, this message being associated with the same Dialogue Id as was sent to the Resource #3 with the command.","If the Resource #3 fails for whatever reason to collect twelve digits before the timeout, e.g. because of the customer's telephone was faulty, Resource #3 sends a Collection Failure message.","The present invention is concerned with the subsequent handling of calls which do not progress through the steps of the Chargecard application, for example with the reception at the SCP  of a Collection Failure message.","As shown in , the OSS  includes a call centre  comprising an Automatic Call Distribution Private Branch Exchange (ACDPBX)  including a Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) server  connected to a plurality of operator positions , each comprising a telephone  and a computer .","As shown in , the computer , which acts as a CTI client, comprises an internal bus  to which is connected a processor , a RAM , a ROM , and a data communications stack . The ROM  contains an operating system program for controlling the processor , and also contains a CTI program  for the operation of the computer , a stored set of templates  and a stored set of company logos , each template and each company logo having a respective unique identifier.","Each template  comprises a set of data objects which together define the format of a respective Windows-based screen display, this format including background, areas for text display, boxes for text entry, areas for logo display, and the data objects including positioning information.","Upon receipt of the Collection Failure message, the Chargecard application proceeds to connect that call to the call centre , and to send a first template-defining message  (see ) associated with that call and comprising data defining a selected one of said set of templates . In this scenario, the selected template  will be the first of a series for a dialogue between the customer and an operator at the call centre .","The template-defining message , as shown in , comprises inter alia a field  containing an identifier for the template, i.e. the screen format to be displayed; one or more fields -, -, etc. containing respective texts for respective text display areas; and a field  containing an identifier for a company logo, in this case the BT logo. If the customer had been using a British Airways Calling Card then the identifier would have been that for a BA logo. The purpose of displaying a company logo is to supplement any text display identifying the particular card service so as to make it easier for the operator to recognise the provider of that service and be able to interact with the customer in accordance with that service provider's requirements.","The ACDPBX  receives the call, selects an operator position  which is active, i.e. at which an operator is logged on, and not currently engaged, connects that call to that selected operator position and sends the received template-defining message  to the computer  of that operator position .","The CTI program  responds to receipt of that template-defining message  by retrieving the set of data objects corresponding to the template identifier (content of field ), and to the logo identifier (content of field ), retrieving the text content of the fields -, -, etc., and generating a corresponding display.","If for some reason the Chargecard service was not able to collect any digits from the customer, then the normal minimum data sent to the call centre would be the customer's Calling Line Identifier (CLI), unless this had been withheld, and this would be sent in one of the fields -. However, it may, be that the customer had been able to provide some information, e.g. an account number, and this would be sent in another of the fields -. In a variant, the SCP  would use the CLI to access a database and retrieve the corresponding customer details, e.g. name, address, account number, PIN, account status, subscribed services, etc., and these would be sent in respective fields -of the template-defining message .","The operator will interact with the customer, e.g. receiving by voice the customer's account number and PIN. If the call centre has a high level of sophistication, the voice input may be converted by a speech to text converter and entered automatically into respective text entry boxes of the screen display, with the operator overseeing that process to check that the correct data is entered in the appropriate boxes. Alternatively, the operator enters this information manually via the computer keyboard.","When the operator is satisfied that sufficient information has been obtained from the customer, he submits that screen to the Chargecard application. The CTI program  generates a first return message, constituting a second message of the present invention, containing the relevant contents of the boxes, both the data that was supplied in the first template-defining message and the data that was subsequently obtained by the operator, and sends that first return message back to the appropriate SCP . Alternatively, the first return message does not include the data that was supplied in the first template-defining message because this data is already stored in the call context for that call.","The Chargecard application retrieves the account number and PIN from that first return message, performs validation, and if validation is successful, proceeds to a next stage of the Chargecard service and sends to the call centre  the next template-defining message, including any service-related and\/or customer-related information which the operator will need for this next stage.","An advantage of the present invention is that the operator positions do not run any service-specific logic software on the computers , i.e. all service-specific logic software is executed in the SCP , and this thus avoids the data management that would otherwise be needed to ensure that service-specific logic software running in the SCP  was operationally synchronised with service-specific logic software running in the computers  of the call centre . Furthermore, by removing service-specific logic software from the call centre  this reduces the time scale and costs involved in modifying the application software and in developing future operator applications. Also, the present invention enables close coupling of the operator's dialogue with the caller to the normal automatic call processing. In other words, after the operator has obtained the respective information required for completing any empty text boxes of a screen display, instead of handing back control of the call to the IP  so that the service can then proceed automatically, he can, for example, after collecting the caller's account number and PIN, merely request validation, in which case the node returns a further message to the operator (who has in the meantime maintained the voice connection with the caller), this message containing data indicating \u201ccard validated\u201d together with the caller's account details and a further selected template identifier. The operator's computer  maintains a simple call state for that call, whereas the node maintains a complex call state including the call context.","Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words \u201ccomprise\u201d, \u201ccomprising\u201d and the like are to be construed in an inclusive as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of \u201cincluding, but not limited to\u201d.","Windows is a registered trade mark of Microsoft Corporation."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A specific embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
