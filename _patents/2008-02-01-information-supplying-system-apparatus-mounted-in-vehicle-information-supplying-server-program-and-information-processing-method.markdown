Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an information supplying system, an apparatus mounted in a vehicle, an information supplying server, a program, and an information processing method.","2. Description of the Related Art","Recently, apparatuses mounted in a vehicle which can display the present location of the vehicle and a guide for driving the vehicle, such as a path leading to a destination, have been widely spread. Such apparatuses mounted in a vehicle can display a guide for driving the vehicle as described above together with a screen with a map on the basis of the stored map information, GPS (Global Positioning System) for estimating the location of the vehicle and the like.","In addition, roadside devices in which DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communication) functions are provided tend to be equipped along roads through which vehicles run. An apparatus mounted in a vehicle can receive information on traffic jams, information on traffic regulations and the like transmitted from such roadside devices, and can display the state of the traffic jam and the state of the traffic regulations on the screen with a map.","Furthermore, a system has been proposed in which an information providing server that stores map additional information which is to be added to the maps, such as gas stations and convenience stores, as well as advertisement information, transmits the map additional information to be added to maps and the advertisement information to apparatuses mounted in a vehicle via roadside devices so that the apparatuses mounted in a vehicle display a screen with a map on which the map additional information is overlapped along with the advertisement information.","Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-195842, for example, discloses a technology which relates to a system for displaying advertisement information as described above on apparatuses mounted in a vehicle. This is described in further detail. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-195842 discloses a car navigation system where advertisement information for a certain store is transmitted to the apparatuses mounted in vehicles which pass through the neighborhood of a region where the store is located so that the apparatuses mounted in a vehicle display the store's advertisement information.","However, apparatuses mounted in a vehicle, which are included in a car navigation system in the past, display information to be outputted, such as map additional map additional information and advertisement information, transmitted to an unspecified large number of apparatuses mounted in a vehicle from an information supplying server. Accordingly, car navigation systems in the past may merely supply information to be outputted to the users of the vehicles, which is useless for the users.","Accordingly, it is desirable to address the above-identified issue and to provide a novel and improved information supplying system, an apparatus mounted in a vehicle, an information supplying server, a program, and an information processing method, capable of supplying information to be outputted to the users of the vehicles corresponding to their driving history and the current state of the vehicle.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an information supplying system including an apparatus mounted in a vehicle and an information supplying server which can communicate with the apparatus mounted in a vehicle. The information supplying system includes a detection portion for detecting that a predetermined process is carried out in a vehicle, an institution information acquiring portion for acquiring institution information which indicates the institution in a location where the process is carried out, a recording portion for storing the institution information acquired by the institution information acquiring portion in a memory medium, and an extraction portion for extracting the information to be outputted on an institution indicated by the institution information stored in the memory medium from information to be outputted, including map additional map additional information to be added to maps or advertisement information stored in the information supplying server.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus mounted in a vehicle which can communicate with an information supplying server. This apparatus mounted in a vehicle has a detection portion for detecting that a predetermined process is carried out in a vehicle, an institution information acquiring portion for acquiring institution information which indicates the institution in a location where the process is carried out, a recording portion for recording the institution information acquired by the institution information acquiring portion in a memory medium, an information acquiring portion for acquiring information to be outputted from an information supplying server which stores information to be outputted, including the map additional information to be added to maps or the advertisement information, and an extraction portion for extracting information to be outputted concerning the institution indicated by the institution information recorded in the memory medium from among the information to be outputted acquired by the information acquiring portion.","In this configuration, when the detection portion detects that a predetermined process is carried out in the vehicle, such as the engine of the vehicle stalling and monetary accounts being automatically settled, the institution information acquiring portion acquires institution information indicating the institution in a location where the process is carried out, and the recording portion records the institution information in a memory medium. Here, the institution information recorded in the memory medium can be handled equally with the history of the institution used by the user of the vehicle, and in some cases indicates the preferences of the user of the vehicle. In addition, the extraction portion extracts the information to be outputted on the basis of this institution information from the information to be outputted acquired by the information acquiring portion. Accordingly, this apparatus mounted in a vehicle makes it possible to extract the information to be outputted based on the preferences of the user of the vehicle from the information to be outputted acquired by the information acquiring portion.","In addition, this apparatus mounted in a vehicle may further include an output control portion for outputting the information to be outputted extracted by the extraction portion from an output apparatus. In this configuration, the output control portion can output the information to be outputted extracted by the extraction portion on the basis of the preferences of the user of the vehicle from the output apparatus. Accordingly, the output apparatus can output the information to be outputted on the basis of the preferences of the user of the vehicle, and therefore, the user of the vehicle can acquire information on the basis of their own preferences from the output of the output apparatus.","In addition, the extraction portion may determine institution information, of which the number of pieces satisfies a predetermined criterion, from among the institution information indicating the same type of institutions recorded in a memory medium, and may extract the information to be outputted concerning the institutions indicated by the determined institution information. For example, when 10 pieces of institution information indicating institutions named Seven Ten are stored in the memory medium, 2 pieces of institution information indicating institutions named Lawsen are stored in the memory medium and a predetermined criterion is that 5 or more pieces of information are stored in the memory medium, the extraction portion may determine that the institution information concerning Seven Ten is the institution information, of which the number of pieces of information satisfying a predetermined criterion is recorded in a memory medium and may extract the information to be outputted concerning Seven Ten from the information to be outputted acquired by the information acquiring portion. That is to say, the institution information, of which the number of pieces that are stored in the memory medium is greater, can be considered to be more reliable in order to determine the preferences of the user of the vehicle, and therefore, it becomes possible with the apparatus mounted in a vehicle to extract the information to be outputted meeting the preferences of the user of the vehicle better.","In addition, the recording portion may record time information indicating the time when a predetermined process is carried out associated with the institution information in a memory medium, and the apparatus mounted in a vehicle may have a management portion for deleting the institution information, with which the time information indicating the time out of the range from the present time to the set time before is associated in the memory medium. In this configuration, the management portion deletes the institution information, with which the time information indicating the time out of range from the present time to the set time before is associated in the memory medium, and therefore, the extraction portion extracts the information to be outputted using the institution information on the basis of processing of which the elapsed time from when the process is started is within the range of the set time. The preferences of the user of the vehicle may change due to a transition of time or season, and therefore, the apparatus mounted in a vehicle can extract the information to be outputted better following the change in the preferences of the user of the vehicle.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an information supplying server which can communicate with an apparatus mounted in a vehicle. The information supplying server has an institution information acquiring portion for acquiring institution information indicating an institution in a location where a predetermined process is carried out in the vehicle, information to be outputted, including map additional map additional information to be added to maps or advertisement information, a storing portion for storing the institution information acquired by the institution information acquiring portion, an extraction portion for extracting the information to be outputted concerning an institution indicated by the institution information stored in the memory medium from the information to be outputted stored in the storing portion, and a transmission portion for transmitting the information to be outputted extracted by the extraction portion to the apparatus mounted in a vehicle.","In this configuration, the institution information acquiring portion acquires institution information indicating an institution in a location where a predetermined process is carried out, such as the engine of the vehicle stalling and monetary accounts being automatically settled, and institution information acquired by the information acquiring portion is stored in the storing portion. Here, the institution information stored in the storing portion can be handled equally with the history of the institutions used by the user of the vehicle, and in some cases, shows the preferences of the user of the vehicle. In addition, the extraction portion extracts the information to be outputted on the basis of the above described institution information from the information to be outputted acquired by the information acquiring portion, and the output portion transmits the extracted information to be outputted to the apparatus mounted in a vehicle. Accordingly, this information supplying server makes it possible for the information to be outputted on the basis of the preferences of the user of the vehicle to be transmitted to the apparatus mounted in a vehicle.","The extraction portion may extract the information to be outputted concerning the institutions indicated in the institution information of which the stored number of pieces satisfies a predetermined criterion from among the institution information showing the same institutions stored in the storing portion. In the case where 8 pieces of institution information showing the institutions named Enels are stored in the memory medium, 3 pieces of institution information showing the institutions named Shall are stored in the memory medium, and a predetermined criterion is the storage of the greatest number of pieces stored in the memory medium, the extraction portion determines that Enels is the institution information of which the number of pieces stored in the memory medium satisfies the predetermined criterion and can extract the information to be outputted concerning Enels from the information to be outputted acquired by the information acquiring portion. That is to say, the institution information, of which the number of pieces that are stored in the storing portion is greater, can be considered to be more reliable in order to determine the preferences of the user of the vehicle, and therefore, it becomes possible with the information supplying server to extract the information to be outputted more on the basis of the preferences of the user of the vehicle and transmit the information to the apparatus mounted in a vehicle.","The storing portion may store the time information showing the time when the process is carried out in the vehicle so that the time information corresponds to the institution information, and the information supplying server may have a management portion for deleting the institution information, with which the time information indicating the time out of the range from the present time to the set time before is associated in the storing portion. In this configuration, the management portion deletes the institution information, with which the time information showing the time out of the range from the present time to the set time before is associated in the storing portion, and therefore, the extraction portion extracts the information to be outputted using the institution information on the basis of the processing out of the range from when the process starts being carried out and the set time. The preferences of the user of the vehicle may change due to a transition of time or season, and therefore, the information supplying server can extract the information to be outputted following the change in the preferences of the user of the vehicle and transmits the information to the apparatus mounted in a vehicle.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a program for making a computer function as an apparatus mounted in a vehicle which can communicate with an information supplying server and includes a detection portion for detecting that a predetermined process is carried out in a vehicle, an institution information acquiring portion for acquiring institution information which shows the institution in a location where the process is carried out, a recording portion for recording the institution information acquired by the institution information acquiring portion in a memory medium, an information acquiring portion for acquiring information to be outputted from an information supplying server which stores information to be outputted, including the map additional information to be added to maps or the advertisement information, and an extraction portion for extracting map additional information to be added concerning the institution indicated by the institution information recorded in the memory medium from among the information to be outputted acquired by the information acquiring portion.","Such program can make a hardware resource of a computer including, for example, a CPU, a ROM and a RAM carry out functions of the above described information acquiring portion, recording portion and extraction portion. That is to say, it is possible to make a computer function as the above described apparatus mounted in a vehicle using the program.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a program which makes a computer function as an information supplying server which can communicate with an apparatus mounted in a vehicle and includes an institution information acquiring portion for acquiring institution information indicating an institution in a location where a predetermined process is carried out in the vehicle, information to be outputted, including map additional map additional information to be added to maps or advertisement information, a storing portion for storing the institution information acquired by the institution information acquiring portion, an extraction portion for extracting the information to be outputted concerning an institution indicated by the institution information stored in the memory medium from the information to be outputted stored in the memory medium, and a transmission portion for transmitting the information to be outputted extracted by the extraction portion to the apparatus mounted in a vehicle.","This program can make a hardware resource of a computer including, for example, a CPU, a ROM and a RAM carry out functions of the above described institution information acquiring portion, recording portion, extraction portion and transmission portion.

Here, the advertisement information that can be effectively used by the user of the vehicle sometimes differs depending on the time zone. Though the user of the vehicle thinks of going to a certain restaurant in the case where the advertisement information showing the lunch menu of the restaurant is supplied at 11 am, the advertisement information can hardly be effectively used sometimes in the case where the advertisement information is supplied at 8 pm. Therefore, the extraction portion extracts advertisement information in accordance with the time from among the advertisement information acquired by the information acquiring portion as described above, and thus, the advertisement information having high consumer appeal at that time can be supplied to the user of the vehicle.","The information supplying server may transmit advertisement information and location information through any of the communication apparatuses having different ranges of use, and the information acquiring portion may acquire advertisement information and location information through the communication apparatus, of which the range of use includes the location advertisement output indicated by the location information which is associated with the map additional information showing the set destination. Even if a communication apparatus, of which the range of use does not include the advertisement output location on the basis of the set destination, transmits advertisement information and location information on the basis of the destination, the transmitted advertisement information is not immediately outputted by the apparatus mounted in a vehicle, and therefore, this is not effective from the point of view of the amount of communicated data. Therefore, when the information acquiring portion can acquire advertisement information and the location information from a communication apparatus, of which the range of use includes the advertisement output location on the basis of the destination, as described above, the amount of communication and the scale of the hardware can be restricted in the communication apparatus.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an information supplying server which can communicate with an apparatus mounted in a vehicle. This information supplying server is provided with a storing portion for storing the map additional information, advertisement information and the location information indicating the location where a predetermined advertisement is to be outputted, associated with each other, and a transmission portion for transmitting advertisement information and the location information associated with the map additional map additional information indicating the destination set for the vehicle to the apparatus mounted in a vehicle via a communication apparatus.","In this configuration, the transmission portion can transmit advertisement information and location information, associated with the information to be added, to the maps indicating the destination set for the vehicle to the apparatus mounted in the vehicle via a communication apparatus. As a result, it becomes possible to supply advertisement information associated with the set destination to the user of the vehicle in the advertisement output location indicated by the location information associated with the set destination on the basis of the operation of the apparatus mounted in the vehicle.","The advertisement information stored in the storing portion may include a series of pieces of advertisement information which are placed in order relative to each other. In this configuration, the transmission portion transmits the sequence of pieces of advertisement information to the apparatus mounted in the vehicle, and therefore, it becomes possible for the transmission portion to output a sequence of pieces of advertisement information which are placed in order relative to each other to the apparatus mounted in the vehicle, independent of the route through which the vehicle travels in sequence.
