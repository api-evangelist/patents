Namely, in accordance with available resources (such as of voice\/data services ) and rules such as voice rules , data rules , dial-up rules , etc., an external voice communication may be established by, for example, a POTS line connection, an ISDN B channel, a VoIP connection, etc. In accordance with the present invention, resources may be allocated for the processing of such an external call based on the available resources at the particular time and applicable rules (which may include time of day, priority of call, etc.)","Incoming calls are detected by the appropriate cards  and signaled to processor\/system resources . Connections of voice incoming calls to telephones  are established under control of processor\/system resources  over TDM bus .","Still additional operational advantages and features in accordance with still additional preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described.","PBX and Telephony-Related Functions","With the hardware of preferred embodiments as illustrated in , various novel and\/or improved or more efficient communications functions may be obtained. As noted in , with the present invention a plurality of workstations or computers  may be connected to communications system . Although only a single LAN is illustrated in , as illustrated in  two or more LANs may be coupled to communications system , with a plurality of computers coupled to each of the two or more LANs, etc.","In accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention, one or more of computers  may execute a PBX\/telephony control application software program. In accordance with the PBX\/telephony control application, hereinafter referred to as the \u201coffice attendant type\u201d program, control of the telephony and related functions of communications system  may be intelligently managed and controlled. With such an arrangement, one or more computers on the LAN may be used to control incoming and outgoing calls of the office using the computer in a natural and intuitive manner. A telephony headset or telephone preferably is associated with the particular computer that will be running the office attendant type program to enable traditional voice communications with incoming callers, etc.","As illustrated in , a party desiring to control the incoming and outgoing calls and\/or station to station calls of the office (\u201cattendant \u201d) may log-on and run the office attendant type program from one of the computers connected to the LAN connected to communications system . At step , attendant  may be required to enter an appropriate user name\/ID and password in order to recognize attendant  as an appropriate user to assume control of the telephony functions of the office. A network or systems administrator may set up password control for parties authorized to run the office attendant type program. At step , in preferred embodiments the computer running office attendant type program has downloaded to it the current telephone subscriber directory such as over packet bus A or B of  (e.g.: a complete listing of the telephone subscribers; extensions; status information such as do not disturb, forward and forwarding information, forward to voice mail, hunt group information, etc.) from communications system . In this manner, the computer or computers running the office attendant type program may locally contain current subscriber information for controlling the incoming and outgoing calls of the office. In preferred embodiments, communications system  automatically determines when subscriber information changes, e.g., a subscriber has been added to or deleted from the telephone directory, or an extension has changed, or a subscriber's status information has changed, or any state associated with communications system , etc., in order that updates may be timely made available. In such embodiments, computers running the office attendant type program may be updated promptly and automatically by communications system  so as to contain current subscriber information on an ongoing basis to more efficiently control telephony operations of the office. It also should be noted that in preferred embodiments the subscriber information also may include other information, such as the email address and extended directory information including personal information manager (\u201cPIM\u201d) information of the particular subscriber and network identification for a computer associated with the particular subscriber. With such information, net messages or other communications with particular subscribers may be facilitated as more fully described herein.","It also should be noted that this subscriber download concept is applicable in various forms to all computers coupled to communications system . For example, communications system  includes information regarding all users registered in the PBX (i.e., all users having a telephone extension and\/or computer coupled to communications system  such as over the LAN or WAN). Thus, in the event of a subscriber directory change, communications system  may \u201cbroadcast\u201d updated subscriber directory information to all computers coupled to communications system , or, in alternate embodiments, communications system  sends a net message, email or other message to such computers coupled to communications system  that prompts the users of such computers to the availability of the subscriber directory update (e.g., the remote computers receive a message indicating the availability of the subscriber directory update, which preferably includes an \u201caccept\u201d icon and a \u201creject\u201d icon, thereby enabling the user to receive or not receive the update as he\/she may desire).","This concept may be extended to system speed dial buttons (as described elsewhere herein), and other information that may be desirably controlled and distributed in\/from a central location (e.g., communications system ) in a particular office setting. For example, a company organization chart, financial reports, informational reports, etc. may be centrally stored, etc., which may include being maintained by a system administrator-type person for communications system . In accordance with such embodiments, centrally-controlled information may be broadcast to all users, or a selected subset of such users (communications system  also preferably accesses\/stores information regarding the registered users, such as title, department, position within the company; e.g., Vice President, engineering department, sales and marketing department, etc.). Thus, a centrally-maintained document\/file, such as a company organization chart, financial report, etc., may be conveniently distributed to computers coupled to communications system . Preferably, communications system  records which computers receive such information (for example, a record of those computers logged-on and receiving the information at the time it is first distributed), and thereafter may distribute the information to other computers at a later time (for example, at a later time when the users of such computers log-on to communications system ). As described previously, such embodiments also may prompt the individual users whether they wish to receive the information, and thereafter provide the information to those computers whose users affirmatively indicate that they desire to receive the information.","In step , the computer running the office attendant type program optionally may run a configuration routine to more optimally configure the office attendant type program on the particular computer for control of the telephony operations.

Thus, a transferred call may be temporarily parked, with an appropriate message displayed on the computer of the called party, with the parked call either accepted by the called party clicking on accept icon , returned to the user running the office attendant type program or forwarded to voice mail after a parking time out time has elapsed, or the call held longer than the allowed parking time by the called party clicking on wait icon . In certain embodiments, clicking on wait icon  enables the call to be parked indefinitely, while in other embodiments a second, longer and preferably user configurable parking time is enabled (thus preventing a called from being held for an indefinite period of time). If a time out time is exceeded, preferably the call is returned to the user running the office attendant type program or forwarded to voice mail, and still preferably an audible tone or sound is periodically emanated from the computer of the called party while the call is parked, thereby providing a subtle reminder of the existence of the parked call. In certain embodiments, users have the ability to mute or lower the volume of the reminder sound, such as by way of an additional icon in window . In all preferred embodiments, users have the ability to configure and select the particular options described herein that the particular users may desire.","It should be noted that a window  may be displayed in response to a transferred call being returned to the user running the office attendant type program, or it or a similar window may be displayed in response to the user running the office attendant type program \u201clooking ahead\u201d to the status of the extension to which the call is to be transferred. What is important is that the user running the office attendant type program determine that the transfer may not be accomplished, and then optimally be provided with options for processing the call in an expedient manner, such as described elsewhere herein.","It should also be noted that, in the event of a particular user extension being dialed directly without going through the office attendant type program, a window such as window  of  may be displayed on the computer of the called party, either automatically for all calls, or only in the event that the called party has put his telephone on do not disturb, but has configured his extension to receive a message notification of calls, or in the event that the called party is on the line. In such embodiments, communications system  may generate such a window by a suitable message sent over by packet bus to the user's computer. In such embodiments, communications system  may simultaneously ring a user's extension and notify the user of the call with a net message, with the call being accepted, parked or forwarded to voice mail such as described earlier. Of course, in the event that a user previously configured his extension to be automatically forwarded to another extension or location or to voice mail or the like, then communications system  preferably takes the programmed action directly. As an illustrative example, a user may configure his extension so as to route all calls to another extension or to a local or long distance telephone number. Such a user also may configure his extension so as to route all calls as voice over IP (\u201cVoIP\u201d) calls. In the later situation, processor\/system resources  and\/or DSP  may process the incoming voice information (received through the appropriate station card  and via TDM bus , etc.) into appropriate IP packets, which may then be routed, for example, through an HDLC framer\/deframer B, through switch\/multiplexer , over TDM bus  and out over a designated IP connection via WAN services , etc.","As previously described in connection with , a user running the office attendant type program preferably is presented with icon  () and icon  () for generating net messages, such as to send a net message to a user to whom a call is to be transferred, or to otherwise send a net message to a particular user, etc.  illustrates window  as an exemplary net message window that may be generated in response to clicking icon  or .

In accordance with such embodiments, control of the telephony functions of the office may effectively be passed from computer to computer along the same packet bus or from a first computer connected to a first packet bus to a second computer connected to a second packet bus. Thus, telephony control may be efficiently transferred from computer to computer in a flexible and desirable manner, which may include computers at different locations within the office.","It also should be noted that an office attendant-type program also may be run from a location remote from communications system , such as on a computer coupled to WAN services network  of . In such embodiments, a remote computer coupled to communications system  over a WAN network connection may run the office attendant-type program and remotely control the telephony functions of the office, in a manner such as described previously herein. Thus, control of telephony functions may be effectively performed in the office or remotely from the office, with control passed from computer to computer in an efficient and desired manner. Additionally, the user of the remote computer may run an office attendant-type program or a companion program as described elsewhere herein, and from such remote location be coupled to communications system  and remotely reconfigure the telephony and\/or voice mail settings for the particular user. As an example, the remote user may use the remote computer in order to direct telephone calls to his\/her extension to voice mail, or alternatively to have such calls forwarded to another extension or to a remote telephone number. With such embodiments, particular users may remotely access communications system  and, for example, control the forwarding of calls to an internal or remote location. As a particular example, a user using a notebook computer or PDA, etc., may couple to the Internet or WAN, etc., from a remote location, and direct that telephone calls to his\/her office extension be forwarded in a desired manner (e.g., off-premise call forwarding, etc.). With the user able to access communications system  and remotely set and store PBX-type settings remotely, a variety of desired reconfiguration options are presented to the user.","Additional advanced PBX\/telephony-type functions in accordance with other embodiments of the present invention will now be described.","In preferred embodiments, communications system  may dynamically associate physical telephones  with particular user extension numbers. In certain respects, this may be considered like a \u201cDHCP\u201d (described elsewhere herein) for physical telephones. For example, a system administration may run a configuration\/administration program (such as described elsewhere herein) and configure an extension number (e.g., 200) for a particular user, including associated parameters for such user, such as telephony and voice mail options (e.g., user forward settings, including off premise call forwarding, busy forward settings, ring-no-answer forward settings, time of day forward settings, display name for telephones displaying caller names, etc., whether the telephone is configured to be a telephone for a user running an office attendant-type program, etc.). At this time, the system administrator may or may not assign a physical telephone to that extension. Thereafter, the system administrator may notify the user that his\/her extension number is 200. The system administrator also has the ability to enable and\/or assign physical telephones. In the event that the system administrator has not assigned a physical telephone to that user, the user preferably has the ability to assign a physical telephone to his\/her extension. For example, the user may pick up a telephone that has been enabled, and preferably does not have an extension assigned to that telephone, and the user enters a special code, e.g., numbers that communications system  recognizes as a request to assign a physical telephone. In certain embodiments, communications system  audibly informs (such as using DSP ) the user of the status of that physical telephone (e.g., enabled or disabled, presently assigned to an extension, etc.). Thereafter, the user preferably is prompted audibly to enter his\/her extension number. Optionally after a confirmation prompt, communications system  then assigns that physical telephone to the particular user. Still optionally, if the particular user extension is already assigned to another physical telephone, then communications system  un-assigns the other physical telephone at the time a new physical telephone is assigned to the particular user\/user extension.","As will be appreciated, with such embodiments a special code also may be provided to un-assign physical telephones from particular user extensions, which preferably is implemented with password protection for particular users to ensure that the user's extension may not be assigned or re-assigned to physical telephones without the user's authorization or control (e.g., after entry of the extension number, communications system  prompts the user for a password associated with that user extension, and only allows assignment of a physical telephone to that extension if the correct password is entered, etc.). Thus, a user may assign his extension to a physical telephone by picking up that telephone and entering appropriate commands via the telephone keypad, and may un-assign his\/her extension from that physical telephone by similarly picking up the physical telephone and entering appropriate commands via the telephone keypad (or by assigning the extension to a different physical telephone, as previously described), etc. In accordance with such embodiments, various office telephony arrangements may be implemented, such as an office arrangement in which a plurality of cubicles, offices or other physical spaces are provided with physical telephones but are not assigned to particular users. In accordance with such embodiments, particular users may be assigned an extension, and may occupy an available physical space and assign the physical telephone in that physical space with the user's extension. At the end of time for occupying that physical space, the user may un-assign his\/her extension from that physical telephone, and then re-assign the extension to another physical telephone when the user later occupies another physical space, etc.","Additionally, as previously described communications system  may serve as an email server or otherwise serve to distribute email to particular computers (such as computers ) coupled to communications system . Thus, communications system  can store information indicating that a particular user or users have received email. In such embodiments, communications system  preferably provides a visual or audio indication to the user that he\/she has email. As illustrative examples, a special dial tone or message may be generated (such as with DSP ) and presented to the user's telephone so that, when the user picks up his\/her telephone, the special dial tone or message alerts the user that he\/she has email (which also may include a special tone or message indicating that the user has voice mail). As one example, the tone or message may be a particular sound, but preferably is an audible message such as \u201cyou have email,\u201d or \u201cyou have voice mail and email\u201d or \u201cyou have voice mail,\u201d etc. In the event that communications system  is implemented with telephones  having message indicator lamps, a particular lamp or blinking sequence may be used to indicate that the user has email, voice mail or both, etc. In all such embodiments, users may be desirably informed that they have email and\/or voice mail with their telephony device (e.g., telephone).","As described elsewhere herein, communications system  may serve to provide email services to particular users with telephone extensions associated with communications system , etc. In addition, communication system  also provides a platform (such as with processor\/system resources ) on which various management, administration or other types of applications may be run (exemplary such applications are described elsewhere herein). In one embodiment, various WAN and other information is provided using what is known as a SNMP-type protocol; as is known in the art, SNMP stands for Signaling Network Management Protocol, which is a protocol\/method by which network management applications can query or request information from a management agent (such as are implemented in the present invention with processor\/system resources  and appropriate software, etc.). A novel aspect of such embodiments of the present invention is that the voice mail system of communications system  also is implemented in a manner to provide voice mail related information in an SNMP-type form. Thus, in accordance with such embodiments of the present invention, communications system  stores a variety of information relating to voice mail, such as information relating to the status of the voice mail system, failure or alarm-type information, usage statistics, etc. In such embodiments, any tool or application that is SNMP compliant can access and view such voice-mail related information. Exemplary voice-mail-related information that may be made available via SNMP to an SNMP compliant tool or application is set forth in Table 1. With such embodiments, network (WAN and LAN, etc.) and PBX information along with voice mail-related information may be desirably provided using SNMP to a variety of SNMP tools and applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0138","num":"0137"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Label","Where","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["InCalls","TUI","Number of incoming calls answered (all types)"]},{"entry":["MsgCreate","MSS","Number of messages created"]},{"entry":["MsgSent","IMDA","Number of messages sent successfully"]},{"entry":["MsgSendFail","IMFSA","Number of message send failures caused by an error in the Msg Subsystem"]},{"entry":["MsgDelete","MSS","Number of message deleted"]},{"entry":["MbxLogon","MSS","Number of times users logged on successfully"]},{"entry":["MbxLogoff","MSS","Number of times users logged off their mailbox (versus abandoned)"]},{"entry":["TooManyErrors","TUI","Number of times callers were dropped because they made too many errors"]},{"entry":["TooShort","TUI","Number of times messages recorded were too short"]},{"entry":["Restart","TUI","Number of times the AA\/VMS application was restarted\/reloaded"]},{"entry":["MWIOn","MSS","Number of requests to turn MWI On"]},{"entry":["MWIOff","MSS","Number of requests to turn MWI Off"]},{"entry":["MWIFail","MSS","Number of MWI (On\/Off) requests that failed"]},{"entry":["TMOOper","TUI","Number of calls transferred to Operator because of TMO"]},{"entry":["ZeroOper","TUI","Number of calls transferred to Operator because caller dialed \u201c0\u201d"]},{"entry":["ErrorOper","TUI","Number of calls transferred to Operator because of too many errors"]},{"entry":["ErrorPassword","TUI","Number of calls dropped because of too many password errors."]},{"entry":["DiskFull","MSS","Number of times disk was too full to take a message"]},{"entry":["ExtDirInCall","TUI","Number of direct external (trunk) calls into AA\/VMS"]},{"entry":["ExtFwdInCall","TUI","Number of external calls forwarding into AA\/VMS"]},{"entry":["IntDirInCall","TUI","Number of direct internal (station) calls into AA\/VMS"]},{"entry":["IntFwdInCall","TUI","Number of internal calls forwarding into AA\/VMS"]},{"entry":["NewMsg","TUI","Number of \u201cnew\u201d messages recorded and sent by logged on users"]},{"entry":["FwdMsg","TUI","Number of \u201cforwarded\u201d messages recorded and sent by logged on users"]},{"entry":["ReplyMsg","TUI","Number of \u201creply\u201d messages recorded and sent by logged on users"]},{"entry":["MultAddress","TUI","Number of messages sent that had more than one address"]},{"entry":["NameRecord","TUI","Number of times a Name message was recorded"]},{"entry":["GreetRecord","TUI","Number of times a Greeting message was recorded"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Video Conferencing Type Applications","In accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention, advanced video conferencing capability may be readily provided in a variety of office environments.

A broadcast voice mail, for example, could be input through the user's telephone in a conventional manner, and routed (see ) through, for example, DSP  (via TDM bus , switch\/multiplexer , etc.) which converts the voice mail message into an suitable data format, such as what is known as a WAV file, etc., and then sent via (for example) packet bus A and\/or B to a plurality of computers. Communications system  also, for example, can record which users have received or not received the communication so that users may later receive the communication (such as when they log on at a later time). In addition, communications system  also has the capability to parallely process the communication as a message that is to be sent to persons via, for example the Internet. Using an HDLC framer\/deframer as is provided in accordance with the present invention, a user may generate a voice mail or email communication that the communications system sends as packetized data over the LAN to recipients recognized to be users having a computer on the LAN, while generating a suitable HDLC or ATM framed communication to recipients who are reachable over the WAN, such as over the Internet or other IP connection, etc.","Described elsewhere herein are embodiments in which visual representations of pink slips or yellow stick-ons are generated to represent net messages, etc. This concept, in other embodiments, is extended also to voice mail and email messages. While not expressly illustrated, it should be understood that the present invention includes the ability to convert voice information (including voice mail type messages) into a suitable data format so that it may be delivered over the WAN or LAN to various computers coupled to communications system . Similarly, communications system  has the capability also to serve as an email server (in addition to other functions, as described elsewhere herein). Thus, in conjunction with a suitable program running on particular computers coupled to communications system , voice mails may be presented as data files to the various particular computers, and emails and net messages may similarly be presented to the various particular computers (such as described elsewhere herein). In certain alternate embodiments one, two or three visual \u201cstacks\u201d may be presented, for example, with one stack constituting a visual representation or a stack of voice mails (with suitable icons for play, pause, backward, forward, delete, file, freeze\/hold, etc., as well as other icons analogous to those described for net messages), with a second stack constituting a visual representation of a stack or net messages (such as described elsewhere herein), and\/or with a third stack constituting a visual representation of a stack of email messages (with icons similar to those described for net messages, etc.). Such stacks preferably may be minimized or expanded, and desirably provide a unified visual interface for a variety of communications, etc.","It also should be noted that DSP  is desirably utilized in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention. Data streams may be desirably coupled to a resource such as DSP  in order to have, for example, processes such speech\/voice recognition, text to speech conversion, speech to text conversion, compression, translation, etc. Thus, data streams from the LAN, WAN, modem, etc. may be desirably coupled to resources such as DSP  to provide such processes.","It also should be noted that, in preferred embodiments, DSP  is coupled to switch\/multiplexer  in a manner so that it may \u201ctap\u201d into the various TDM data streams. This provides a significant improvement over systems in which data streams must be directed into a resource such as DSP , and then sent from DSP  over a separate channel, etc. (thereby utilizing two channels, etc.). In such embodiments, DSP  can tap into or monitor data streams on particular TDM channels and provide, for example, processing to accomplish recognition (voice or speech, etc.), detection (such as of a fax or modem call, etc.), compression (including compression, transcoding, streaming and storing, etc.), packetizing (such as to prepare a data format such as for an email, etc.). In one illustrative example of such embodiments, communications system  may be programmed so that particular users (e.g., president, technical support, warranty claims line, etc.) automatically have voice mails stored as voice mails and also as an email or other data form. Thus, a voice call may be directed into voice mail, while DSP  concurrently processes the voice data stream into another form (e.g., email, data file, etc.), which may be stored, sent over the WAN or LAN, etc. Having DSP , and particularly configured (such as with switch\/multiplexer ) so as to tap into the various channels, provides significant advantages in a variety of applications.","Referring now to , an embodiment of the present invention including a backup communications capability will now be described.","As illustrated in , backup communication module  preferably is provided in communications system . In the illustrated embodiment, backup communication module  is coupled to bus , which may be a part of processor\/system resources  (such as, for example, bus  of , etc.), and may be a ISA or PCI-type of bus, etc. Coupled to bus  are other components of communications system , such as bus , buffer\/framer , switch\/multiplexer , buses ,  and , cards , WAN services , etc. In general, the various components discussed in connection with  are applicable with embodiments incorporating backup communication module , although such components are not illustrated in .","Backup communications module  preferably includes bus interface  for coupling information to\/from bus , memory  for storing various information, as will described hereinafter, CPU , FLASH or other programmable memory , and modem or other communication unit . Module  preferably includes a standby or backup power supply , although in certain alternate embodiments communication unit  is coupled to, for example, link  of WAN services E, which may be a dedicated telephone line, POTS line, etc., which provides sufficient power to module  so that power supply  is not required. In such alternate embodiments, the various components of module  are implemented in low power CMOS technology or the like, and consume sufficiently low amounts of power so that module  may operate at a suitable speed in order to provide backup communications using only the power provided by link , such as, for example, in the event of a power failure in communications system  or the office in which communications system  is located, etc.","Preferably, memory  receives and stores via bus interface  a variety of information regarding the status and operation of communications system . For example, memory  may store power-on self test data (i.e., status, trace or other information generated during power-on, boot-up, etc.), SNMP data for the PBX, WAN resources, voice mail, LAN resources, etc.), monitor or trace data (such as described elsewhere herein). Preferably, module  receives periodic updates from communications system , including information sufficient to debug, reboot, etc., communications system . Various trace, monitoring, diagnostic or other information may be made available to module  for storage in memory .","The data in memory  preferably is organized in a hierarchical manner, with, for example, various levels of information. Certain information may be so critical that it is retained in memory  until deleted (e.g., a level  category of information, such as critical fault data, etc.). Other information may be retained for a predetermined period of time and then purged, unless, for example, a level  event has occurred (e.g., a level  category of information). Still other information may be retained for a predetermined period of time (the same as or different from the level  period) and then purged, etc. What is important is that a variety of information be provided to memory  and hierarchically retained, which less critical information periodically purged in order to make room for additional information in memory , etc.","Still preferably, CPU  executes what is know as a watch dog timer (WDT) function. In preferred embodiments, a fault monitoring subsystem of communications system  periodically provides a signal\/update indicative of the status of communications system  (e.g., normal, active, ok, etc.). In the event that such a signal or information is not provided in a predetermined interval of time, CPU  may recognize this event as an abnormality and begin a process to communicate with communications system , and\/or initiate a remote communication such as over communications unit  in order to alert a remote user or system of the abnormality, etc.","Preferably, FLASH or other programmable memory  is provided in module . Memory  preferably stores operational programs for module , including, for example, diagnostic, debug, monitor or other routines in order to facilitate a debug, reboot, etc. of communications system . Preferably, the algorithms and\/or programs in memory  may be periodically updated, either over bus , but preferably through link  and communications unit . Programming of memory  remotely, such as over communications unit , enables a remote technician, for example, more flexibility in remotely monitoring, debugging, rebooting, etc. communications system .","As previously described, module  preferably has a dedicate line (e.g., a POTS line) for such backup communications, and telephone  optionally may be coupled to such line for emergency voice calls or the like, etc. In alternate embodiments, however, communications unit is also (or alternatively) coupled to channels of TDM bus . In certain embodiments, a predetermined channel or channels of TDM bus  are dedicated for such backup communications. In other embodiments, communication unit  is coupled to TDM bus  through switch , and in such embodiments dedicated TDM channels are not required.","As will be appreciated, information contained in memory  may be remotely viewed, either through communications unit  or through a connection established through buses  and , etc. Bus interface  enables data transmissions to\/from module  when communications system  is operating in a normal manner, while also having the ability to isolate module  from bus  in the event of a serious abnormality in communications system . It also should be noted that communications unit  preferably is a modem, but communications unit  also could consist of a signaling device to a pager or other wireless communication device, or could be a unit for establishing IP or other packet communications, etc. What is important is that communications unit  have capability to transmit desired information over the choice medium for link  in order to provide desirable backup communications and monitoring of communications system  in accordance with the present invention.","In accordance with such embodiments, the remote user may configure tracing in desirable and flexible manner. Through the use of trace filters, various software components and drivers in effect may be told what trace information to provide, which information is preferably provided to a central storage location in communications system  and made available in real time or by file access to such a remote user.","Although various preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and\/or substitutions are possible without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention as disclosed in the claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above objects and other advantages of the present invention will become more apparent by describing in detail the preferred embodiments of the present invention with reference to the attached drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 7A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIGS. 8A to 8D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIGS. 9A to 9C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIGS. 10A to 10B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIGS. 11A to 11E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIGS. 13A to 13C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 16A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 16B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 16C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 16D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 16E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 16F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 17A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 17B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 17C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 17D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 17E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 17F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 17G"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 17H"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 20"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
