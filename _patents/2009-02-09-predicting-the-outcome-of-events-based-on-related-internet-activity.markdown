title: Predicting the outcome of events based on related internet activity
abstract: Particular embodiments of the present invention are directed to systems and methods for predicting the outcome of events based on internet activity associated with such events. For example, an internet activity metric associated with one or more events may be determined. The internet activity metric may be based at least on the popularity of particular search terms related to the events. The outcomes of the events may also be determined. The determined internet activity metrics and the outcomes of the one or more events may be analyzed to generate an algorithm for predicting the outcomes of subsequent events. For example, an internet activity metric associated with a particular subsequent event (e.g., based at least on the popularity of a particular search term related to the subsequent event) may be determined, and the algorithm may be applied to the internet activity metric to predict the outcome of the particular subsequent event.

Client Nodes & Example Protocol Environment","D. Example Operation","E. Example Computing System Architectures"],"p":["The present disclosure generally relates to analyzing internet activity (e.g., search tem popularity, etc.) to predict the outcome of events.","As the popularity of the Internet has increased, so has the prevalence of Web search engines. A Web search engine is a search engine designed to search for information on the World Wide Web (WWW). Information may consist of web pages, images, information and other types of files. Some search engines also mine data available in newsbooks, databases, or open directories. Unlike Web directories, which are maintained by human editors, search engines operate algorithmically or are a mixture of algorithmic and human input.","Web search engines work by indexing information about many web pages, which they retrieve from the WWW itself. When a user enters a query into a search engine (typically by using key words), the engine examines its index and provides a listing of best-matching web pages according to its criteria, usually with a short summary containing the document's title and sometimes parts of the text.","Some search engines generate metrics that measure internet activity related to particular search terms, topics, links, web pages, web sites, etc., which are sometimes used to allow users to discover the current most popular search terms, topics, links, web pages, web sites, etc. Some example search engine internet activity metrics and search engine features based on internet activity metrics include:","Ask IQ (http:\/\/about.ask.com\/en\/docs\/iq\/iq.shtml),","Dogpile SearchSpy (http:\/\/www.dogpile.com\/info.dogpl\/searchspy\/),","MetaCrawler MetaSpy (http:\/\/www.metacrawler.com\/),","Google Trends (http:\/\/google.com\/trends),","Google Zeitgeist (http:\/\/www.google.com\/intl\/en\/press\/zeitgeist\/index.html),","Lycos 50 (http:\/\/50.lycos.com\/),","Yahoo Buzz Score,","dWoz Search Phrase Lists (http:\/\/www.dwoz.com\/default.asp?Pr=122),","Google AdWords Keyword Tool\n\n","Search Term Research and Search Behavior\n\n","To illustrate one example, Yahoo!'s Buzz Score is a metric that helps identify the popularity of a search term by analyzing the search logs traffic. The metric is proportional to the number of searches for a given term and is normalized against the total number of searches on the network. Buzz Score can be segmented across categories of terms, age-gender segments and user locations.","The present invention provides methods, apparatuses and systems directed to predicting the outcome of events based on internet activity associated with such events. For example, an internet activity metric associated with one or more events may be determined. The internet activity metric may be based at least on the popularity of particular search terms related to the events. The outcomes of the events may also be determined. The determined internet activity metrics and the outcomes of the events may be analyzed to generate an algorithm for predicting the outcomes of subsequent events. For example, an internet activity metric associated with a particular subsequent event (e.g., based at least on the popularity of a particular search term related to the subsequent event) may be determined, and the algorithm may be applied to the internet activity metric to predict the outcome of the particular subsequent event.","Particular implementations of the invention are directed to systems and methods for predicting the outcome of a future event based on internet activity related to that event and related events. A prediction application may collect various data, including (a) an internet activity data metric for the future event to be predicted, (b) internet activity data metrics related to one or more other related events, and (c) data indicating the outcome of such other related events. The prediction application may determine a mathematical relationship between the internet activity metrics and the event outcomes for the related events, and generate an algorithm based on such mathematical relationship for predicting the outcome of the future event. The prediction application may then apply the algorithm to the internet activity data metric for the future event in order to predict an outcome for the future event.","Such methodology may be used to predict any of a variety of event outcomes. For example, the methodology can be used to predict movie box office revenues, music album sales, results of reality shows (e.g., American idol, Big brother etc.), subscriber bases of TV shows, attendance\/ticket sales for various community events, election results, etc.","The present invention can be implemented in a variety of manners, as discussed in more detail below. Other implementations of the invention may be practiced without some or all of specific details set forth below. In some instances, well known structures and\/or processes have not been described in detail so that the present invention is not unnecessarily obscured.","Particular implementations of the invention operate in a wide area network environment, such as the Internet, including multiple network addressable systems. Network cloud  generally represents one or more interconnected networks, over which the systems and hosts described herein can communicate. Network cloud  may include packet-based wide area networks (such as the Internet), private networks, wireless networks, satellite networks, cellular networks, paging networks, and the like.","As  illustrates, a particular implementation of the invention can operate in a network environment comprising network application hosting site , such as an informational web site, social network site and the like. Although  illustrates only one network application hosting site, implementations of the invention may operate in network environments that include multiples of one or more of the individual systems and sites disclosed herein. Client nodes ,  are operably connected to the network environment via a network service provider or any other suitable means.","Network application hosting site  is a network addressable system that hosts a network application accessible to one or more users over a computer network. The network application may be an informational web site where users request and receive identified web pages and other content over the computer network. In particular, the network application may be configured to predict event outcomes based on related internet activity metrics, and may provide a user interface for configuring and managing such predictions. The network application may also be a search engine platform, an on-line forum or blogging application where users may submit or otherwise configure content for display to other users. The network application may also be a social network application allowing users to configure and maintain personal web pages, chat, instant message, play interactive games, etc. The network application may also be a content distribution application, such as Yahoo! Music Launchcast\u00ae, Apple\u00ae iTunes\u00ae, and podcasting servers, that displays available content, and transmits content to users.","Network application hosting site , in one implementation, comprises one or more physical servers  and content data store . The one or more physical servers  are operably connected to computer network  via a router . The one or more physical servers  host functionality that provides a network application (e.g., a news content site, etc.) to a user. As discussed in connection with , in one implementation, the functionality hosted by the one or more physical servers  may include web or HTTP servers, ad serving systems, geo-targeting systems, and the like. Still further, some or all of the functionality described herein may be accessible using an HTTP interface or presented as a web service using REST, SOAP, and\/or other suitable protocols.","Content data store  stores content as digital content data objects. A content data object or content object, in particular implementations, is an individual item of digital information typically stored or embodied in a data file or record. Content objects may take many forms, including: text (e.g., ASCII, SGML, and HTML), images (e.g., jpeg, tif and gif), graphics (vector-based or bitmap), audio, video (e.g., mpeg), or other multimedia, and combinations thereof. Content object data may also include metadata (e.g., titles, captions, descriptions. annotations, etc.) and executable code objects (e.g., games executable within a browser window or frame), podcasts, etc. Structurally, content data store  connotes a large class of data storage and management systems. In particular implementations, content data store  may be implemented by any suitable physical system including components, such as database servers, mass storage media, media library systems, and the like.","Network application hosting site , in one implementation, provides web pages, such as front pages, that include an information package or module describing one or more attributes of a network addressable resource, such as a web page containing an article or product description, a downloadable or streaming media file, and the like. The web page may also include one or more ads, such as banner ads, text-based ads, sponsored videos, games, and the like. Generally, web pages and other resources include hypertext links or other controls that a user can activate to retrieve additional web pages or resources. A user \u201cclicks\u201d on the hyperlink with a computer input device to initiate a retrieval request to retrieve the information associated with the hyperlink or control.","A client node is a computer or computing device including functionality for communicating over a computer network. A client node can be a desktop computer , laptop computer, as well as mobile devices , such as cellular telephones, and personal digital assistants. A client node may execute one or more client applications, (including user interface  discussed below with reference to ), such as a web browser, to access and view content over a computer network. In particular implementations, the client applications allow a user to enter addresses of specific network resources to be retrieved. These addresses can be Uniform Resource Locators, or URLs. In addition, once a page or other resource has been retrieved, the client applications may provide access to other pages or records when the user \u201cclicks\u201d on hyperlinks to other resources. In some implementations, such hyperlinks are located within web pages and provide an automated way for the user to enter the URL of another page and to retrieve that page. The pages or resources can be data records including as content plain textual information, or more complex digitally encoded multimedia content, such as software programs or other code objects, graphics, images, audio signals, videos, and so forth.","The networked systems described herein can communicate over the network  using any suitable communications protocols. For example, client nodes , as well as various servers of the systems described herein, may include Transport Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) networking stacks to provide for datagram and transport functions. Of course, any other suitable network and transport layer protocols can be utilized.","In addition, hosts or end-systems described herein may use a variety of higher layer communications protocols, including client-server (or request-response) protocols, such as the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and other communications protocols, such as HTTP-S, FTP, SNMP, TELNET, and a number of other protocols, may be used. In addition, a server in one interaction context may be a client in another interaction context. Still further, in particular implementations, the information transmitted between hosts may be formatted as HyperText Markup Language (HTML) documents. Other structured document languages or formats can be used, such as XML, and the like.","In some client-server protocols, such as the use of HTML over HTTP, a server generally transmits a response to a request from a client. The response may comprise one or more data objects. For example, the response may comprise a first data object, followed by subsequently transmitted data objects. In one implementation, for example, a client request may cause a server to respond with a first data object, such as an HTML page, which itself refers to other data objects. A client application, such as a browser, will request these additional data objects as it parses or otherwise processes the first data object.","Mobile client nodes  may use other communications protocols and data formats. For example, mobile client nodes , in some implementations, may include Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) functionality and a WAP browser. The use of other wireless or mobile device protocol suites are also possible, such as NTT DoCoMo's i-mode wireless network service protocol suites. In addition, the network environment may also include protocol translation gateways, proxies or other systems to allow mobile client nodes , for example, to access other network protocol environments. For example, a user may use a mobile client node  to capture an image and upload the image over the carrier network to a content site connected to the Internet.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","100","102","104","106"]},"User interface  may comprise any interface allowing a user to interact with prediction application . For example, in implementations in which prediction application  is a network application hosted at a network application hosting site , user interface  may comprise a web browser or other network interface hosted on a client node , . In implementations in which prediction application  is a local application hosted on a client node , , user interface  may comprise a user interface portion of prediction application  allowing a user to interact with the prediction functionality of prediction application .","Internet applications  may include any applications configured to collect or record internet activity data  regarding internet activity by users. Internet activity data  may include any data regarding any action taken by a network user, e.g., browsing history data, search history data, page click data, email data, data regarding actions taken on a social networking application, etc. Example internet applications  may include search engines , social networking applications (e.g., facebook (http:\/\/www.facebook.com), Flickr (http:\/\/www.flickr.com), MySpace (http:\/\/www.myspace.com), del.icio.us (http:\/\/del.icio.us.\/), etc.), as well as any types of packet sniffers, hit counters, network analyzers, etc.","Each search engine  may comprise a search engine designed to search for information on the World Wide Web (WWW). Each search engine  may obtain and index information about numerous web pages. When a user enters a query into a search engine (typically by entering search keywords via a web browser), the search engine  examines its index and provides a listing of best-matching web pages and\/or other data according to particular search engine criteria. Some example search engines  include Yahoo! search, Yahoo News, Google search, Google News, Ask.com, Wikia Search, Lexis Nexis, Craigslist, YouTube, PriceGrabber, Answers.com, WebMD, Live Search, PeekYou, and InfoSpace.","Certain internet applications  may generate internet activity metrics  based on collected internet activity data . An internet activity metric  may comprise any score, index, metric, or other measure of collected internet activity data  regarding one or more particular network objects, e.g., search terms, web pages, web sites, etc. For example, an internet activity metric  may be calculated based at least on the determined popularity (e.g., usage) of one or more search terms over a particular period of time. Example internet activity metrics  generated by internet applications  include the Buzz score by Yahoo!, search metric score by Google Insights, percentage reach by Alexa, etc. Other internet activity metrics  may be generated by prediction application  based on internet activity data  received from internet applications , as discussed below.","Prediction application  is generally configured to predict the outcome of a future event based on internet activity metrics  associated with the future events and one or more related events. As discussed above, prediction application  may receive one or more internet activity metrics  from one or more internet applications . In addition or alternatively, prediction application  itself may generate one or more internet activity metrics  based on internet activity data  received from one or more internet applications . Prediction application  is discussed in greater detail below in the \u201cExample Operation\u201d section.","Each of the functional modules (user interface , prediction application , and search engine(s) ) may be realized by hardware, executable modules (e.g., software, firmware, or other logic) stored on a computer readable medium, or a combination of both. Each functional module, for example, may be hosted on network application hosting site  (e.g., on one or more physical servers ) and\/or one or more client computers , . For example, in some implementations, user interface  may be hosted by a client computer , ; and prediction application  and search engine(s)  may be hosted by one or more physical servers  of a network application hosting site . In other example implementations, user interface  may be hosted by a client computer , ; prediction application  may be hosted by one or more physical servers  of a first network application hosting site ; and search engine(s)  may be hosted by one or more physical servers  of a second network application hosting site . In other example implementations, user interface  and prediction application  may be hosted by a client computer , ; and search engine(s)  may be hosted by one or more physical servers .","In operation, prediction application  may predict the outcome of events in the following general manner. Prediction application  may generate and\/or receive one or more internet activity metrics  associated with one or more events. Prediction application  may then receive (e.g., automatically via a network or manually entered by user) event outcome data  indicating the outcome of the one or more events from any suitable data source, e.g., search data from search engine logs, user click data from web logs, news stories from news aggregation sites, etc. Prediction application  may then analyze the internet activity metrics  and corresponding event outcome data  for one or more events to generate one or more prediction algorithms  for predicting the outcomes of one or more future events, indicated as predicted event outcomes . For example, prediction application  may determine a mathematical relationship between internet activity metrics  and their corresponding event outcome data , generate a prediction algorithm  for using the determined mathematical relationship to determine a predicted event outcome  for a future event, and then apply that algorithm to an internet activity metric  associated with a future event in order to calculate a predicted event outcome  for that future event.","In some embodiments, prediction application  may determine whether the internet activity metrics  and corresponding event outcome data  are sufficiently related for predicting future event outcomes based on the determined mathematical relationship between the internet activity metrics  and their corresponding event outcome data . Prediction application  may calculate a correlation metric between the internet activity metrics  and corresponding event outcome data , and compare such correlation metric to a predetermined threshold to determine whether the correlation is sufficient for predicting future event outcomes. For example, prediction application  may calculate a Pearson correlation coefficient (i.e., between 0 and 1) between the internet activity metrics  and corresponding event outcome data , and compare the calculated Pearson correlation coefficient to a predetermined threshold (e.g., 0.9) to determine whether the correlation is sufficient for predicting future event outcomes.","In addition, in some embodiments, prediction application  may remove one or more internet activity metrics  and corresponding event outcome data  from the set of data used to determine an overall mathematical relationship between internet activity metrics  and corresponding event outcome data . For example, prediction application  may calculate a correlation metric between a subset of the internet activity metrics  and their corresponding event outcome data , and determine whether to include or exclude that subset of data in the analysis for determining an overall mathematical relationship between internet activity metrics  and corresponding event outcome data . For example, suppose a group of internet activity metrics  and corresponding event outcome data  for a group of events occurring on various dates, with one subset of the events occurring on the same particular date. Prediction application  may calculate a correlation metric between the internet activity metrics  and corresponding event outcome data  for the subset of events (as opposed to a correlation metric for the full group of events), and determine whether to include or exclude that subset of events in the analysis for determining a relationship between internet activity metrics  and corresponding event outcome data  for the full group of events. In this manner, outlier data may be excluded from the analysis, which may provide a more accurate overall relationship between internet activity metrics  and corresponding event outcome data . Events may be divided into subsets for such analysis according to any logical grouping, e.g., by event date, type of event, magnitude of metrics  and\/or event outcome data , reliability of metrics  and\/or event outcome data , etc.","As an example of the general methodology discussed above, prediction application  may receive from one or more search engines  internet activity metrics  regarding the popularity of particular search terms related to a group of movies for the week prior to the opening weekend for each movie. The opening weekend for each movie may be the same or different than the opening weekend for each other movie. Prediction application  may then receive data  indicating the opening weekend sales revenues for each of the group of movies. Such revenue data may be electronically communicated to prediction application  from one or more movie studios, or otherwise received and manually entered by a user. Prediction application  may then analyze the search term popularity metrics  and revenue data  (e.g., by applying one or more algorithms) to determine a relationship between the search term popularity metrics  and corresponding opening weekend revenue data . For example, prediction application  may determine a linear relationship, a non-linear (e.g., exponential) relationship, or any other type of mathematical relationship between the search term popularity metrics  and corresponding opening weekend revenue data . Prediction application  may then generate a prediction algorithm  for using the determined mathematical relationship to predict revenue data for a future movie (as a predicted event outcome ).","In some embodiments, prediction application  may determine whether the search term popularity metrics  and corresponding opening weekend revenue data  are sufficiently related for predicting future movie revenues based on the determined mathematical relationship between the search term popularity metrics  and corresponding opening weekend revenue data , e.g., as discussed above. Also, in some embodiments, prediction application  may exclude from the mathematical relationship analysis search term popularity metrics  and corresponding opening weekend revenue data  for one or more movies determined to be outlier data, e.g., as discussed above.","After determining a relationship between the search term popularity metrics  and corresponding opening weekend revenue data , prediction application  may then use the determined mathematical relationship to predict opening weekend revenues  for one or more future movies. For example, prediction application  may obtain from one or more search engines  internet activity metrics  regarding the popularity of particular search term(s) related to a particular soon-to-open movie for the week prior to the movie's opening weekend. Prediction application  may then apply the prediction algorithm  to the internet activity metrics  associated with the soon-to-open movie to predict the opening weekend revenue  for the movie.","Any one or more steps in the processes discussed above may be performed automatically by prediction application  or in response to a user command, e.g., user commands received via user interface .","A more specific example is now discussed. Table 1 below shows data for movies and the box office collections (event outcome data ) they made during their respective opening weekends, along with a Yahoo Buzz score (an example internet activity metric ) for related search terms, for dates between Apr. 11, 2008 and Jul. 18, 2008.

More information regarding correlation calculations can be obtained at http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Correlation.","The \u201cLocal Pearson Correlations\u201d in right-hand column of Table represent the correlations between Buzz score and box office collections for movies released on the same weekend. The weekends for which only a single movie was released were not considered (and thus indicated as \u201cN\/A\u201d). In some embodiments, movies for which the local Pearson Correlations fall below a predetermined threshold (e.g., 0.9) may be excluded from the calculation for determining the mathematical relationship between the Buzz scores and the weekend box office collections for the group of movies.","The \u201cGlobal Pearson Correlation\u201d is computed across all weekends for a specific period of time (in the example above, weekends from 8th March to 18th July). The movies in the above set are a mix of large, average, and small box office earners. As can be seen in Table 1, The global Pearson correlation is 0.997381831, indicating a very strong correlation between the Buzz scores and the weekend box office numbers.","Using the data in Table 1, prediction application  may calculate the relationship between Buzz score and weekend box office numbers. In this example, prediction application  determines a strong linear relationship (as indicated by the global Pearson correlation of 0.997381831) and calculates a mathematical relationship by dividing the total box office collections, in $Millions (384) by the total Buzz score (284.82), resulting in a mathematical relationship of 1.3482 $Million per 1.0 Buzz score.","Prediction application  may then generate the following prediction algorithm  for predicting opening weekend box office revenues for a future movie based on Buzz score for the 7 days including the opening weekend:\n\nOpening weekend box office revenues (in $Millions)=Buzz score*1.3482\n","For example, consider the movie Wall-e\u2122 which was released the weekend of Jun. 27, 2008.

If prediction application  determines that the internet activity metrics  and corresponding event outcome data  for the related events are sufficiently related, the method may continue to step .

For instance, prediction application  may calculate one or more correlations between internet activity metrics  and corresponding event outcome data  for particular subsets of the related events, and compare such correlation(s) to one or more predetermined thresholds. (A subset of related events may include one or more of the events.) If the calculated correlation for a particular subset of related events falls below the corresponding threshold value, that subset of related events may be deemed an outlier data point and excluded from the calculation of the mathematical relationship between internet activity metrics  and corresponding event outcome data  for the related events.","In some implementations, steps  and  may be performed in reverse order.

Prediction application  may apply one or more algorithms to determine a mathematical relationship between the internet activity metrics  and corresponding event outcome data  for the related events. For example, prediction application  may determine a linear relationship, a non-linear (e.g., exponential) relationship, or any other type of mathematical relationship between the internet activity metrics  and corresponding event outcome data . As an example only (e.g., as implemented in the embodiment discussed above regarding ), prediction application  may determine a linear relationship between the internet activity metrics  and event outcome data  by dividing a sum total of event outcome data values by a sum total of internet activity metric values, resulting in a relationship constant C.","At step , prediction application  may generate a prediction algorithm  for using the determined mathematical relationship to predict the outcome  of the future event.
