title: Method and apparatus for providing recent categories on a hand-held device
abstract: The present invention adds a new category of contacts and tasks to hand-held devices. This new category provides a list of the most recent contacts or tasks that the user has accessed. Under most embodiments, the contacts and tasks shown in the RECENT list may be manipulated by the user in the same manner in which contacts and tasks are manipulated in other lists on the hand-held device. Thus, the user is shown the actual contacts or tasks entries and not just a link to those entries. Under most embodiments, the user is able to display a list of recent contacts and tasks by accessing a “RECENT” entry in a categories list provided on many hand-held devices.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present application claims priority from a U.S. Provisional application having Ser. No. 60\/175,108, filed on Jan. 6, 2000 and entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROVIDING RECENT CATEGORIES ON A HAND-HELD DEVICE.\u201d","Reference is hereby made to the following co-pending U.S. patent applications, which are all assigned to the same assignee as the present application: \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR FAST SEARCHING OF HAND-HELD CONTACTS LISTS\u201d, having Ser. No. 07\/562,689; \u201cSMART COLUMN FOR CONTACT INFORMATION ON PALM-SIZED COMPUTING DEVICES AND METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DISPLAYING THE SAME\u201d, having Ser. No. 09\/564,515; \u201cUSER INTERFACE FOR PALM-SIZED COMPUTING DEVICES AND METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DISPLAYING THE SAME\u201d, having Ser. No. 09\/564,928; and \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROVIDING CONTEXT MENUS ON A PEN-BASED DEVICE\u201d, having Ser. No. 09\/559,694.","The present invention relates to hand-held computing devices. In particular, the present invention relates to user interfaces on hand-held devices.","Hand-held computing devices have gained a niche as personal organizers. These devices allow users to view lists of contacts, tasks or calendar events.","One problem with such devices is that they have a limited sized screen. As such, they are only able to show a portion of the information stored on them. For example, a typical Contacts database has several hundred entries in it. However, on a hand-held device, a user can typically only view  contact entries at a time. Without a keyboard, this can make finding a contact or task entry cumbersome. Thus, an improved user interface is needed that improves the user's ability to view the entries that are most important to them.","In some current desktop systems, a special folder is created by the computer's operating system to help users locate files that they have recently accessed. For example, in the Windows 98 operating system from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., a folder named \u201cRECENT\u201d is automatically created. This RECENT folder does not contain the actual files, but instead contains a short-cut or link to the files. Thus, the links describe where the files are located on the system. Because the links in the RECENT file are not the actual files, deleting or moving the link does not delete or move the actual file. Instead, it simply deletes or moves the link. As such, to perform operations on the actual file, or filename, the user must first locate the file in the system.","The present invention adds a new category of contacts and tasks to hand-held devices. This new category provides a list of the most recent contacts or tasks that the user has accessed. Under most embodiments, the contacts and tasks shown in the RECENT list may be manipulated by the user in the same manner in which contacts and tasks are manipulated in other lists on the hand-held device. Thus, the user is shown the actual contacts or tasks entries and not just a link to those entries.","Under most embodiments, the user is able to display a list of recent contacts and tasks by accessing a \u201cRECENT\u201d entry in a categories list provided on many hand-held devices. In some embodiments, this categories list includes other user-defined categories such as \u201cPERSONAL\u201d and \u201cBUSINESS\u201d. The user does not have to perform any functions to generate the RECENT category because the system of the present invention automatically updates the RECENT list whenever the user opens, edits or receives a contact or task.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["68","68","70","72","74","76","78"]},"Memory  is implemented as non-volatile electronic memory such as random access memory (RAM) with a battery back-up module (not shown) such that information stored in memory  is not lost when the general power to mobile device  is shut down. A portion of memory  is preferably allocated as addressable memory for program execution, while another portion of memory  is preferably used for storage, such as to simulate storage on a disk drive.","Memory  includes an operating system , application programs  as well as an object store . During operation, operating system  is preferably executed by processor  from memory . Operating system , in one preferred embodiment, is a \u201cWINDOWS CE\u201d brand operating system commercially available from Microsoft Corporation. Operating system  is preferably designed for mobile devices, and implements database features that can be utilized by applications  through a set of exposed application programming interfaces and methods. The objects in object store  are maintained by applications  and operating system , at least partially in response to calls to the exposed application programming interfaces and methods.","Communication interface  represents numerous devices and technologies that allow mobile device  to send and receive information. The devices include wired and wireless modems, satellite receivers and broadcast tuners to name a few. Mobile device  can also be directly connected to a computer to exchange data therewith. In such cases, communication interface  can be an infrared transceiver or a serial or parallel communication connection, all of which are capable of transmitting streaming information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["68","68","68","83","85","86","85","86","86","85","86"]},"Several applications for mobile device  display lists of entries to the user. These entries typically show one or more fields from a set of records stored in a database. For example, some contacts applications display the name and phone number fields of a contacts database. Similarly, some task applications display lists of tasks to the user.  provides an example of a display generated by a contacts application. The display includes a contacts list  that shows eleven contacts.","In most mobile devices, users can perform functions on the displayed entries. These functions affect both the displayed entry and the entry's record in the database. For example, by invoking the delete command on an entry, a user can remove the entry from the display and at the same time remove the entry's record from the database. Similarly, by selecting an entry, the user can view the full record for the entry. From this full record view, the user can edit the fields of the record.","To help users manage large database lists, some mobile devices of the prior art allow users to group their list entries into categories. Using categories, the user can denote that a specific contact is a \u201cWork\u201d contact or a \u201cSchool\u201d contact, etc. When the user selects a category, only the entries within the category are displayed. This makes it easier for the user to find a particular entry.","When an entry is displayed based on its inclusion in a category, the user is able to manipulate the entry in the same manner as when the entry is viewed in the full list. Thus, the user may delete or edit an entry in the same manner whether they are viewing a small category list or the full list of entries. This makes it easier for users to interact with the hand-held device since the operation of the device is consistent regardless of how the user chooses to view their entries.","Although the categories of the prior art allowed users to group contacts based on common elements between entries, the categories did not provide the user with an automatic means for grouping entries in a category. Instead, under the prior art, the user had to take several steps to create and populate the categories.","The present inventors have recognized that when a user accesses an entry, that entry is likely to be relevant to the user over some period of time. During that period, the user will access the entry several times. For example, if the user is having remodeling work done on their home, repair work done on their car, and are trying to arrange a vacation, they may be calling their contractor, mechanic and travel agent several times in the same week.","Based on these observations, the present inventors have developed a user interface to make it easier for users to find the entries that are most relevant to them. Under the present invention, this is accomplished by automatically generating a new category that lists the most recently accessed entries. Under some embodiments, this category appears along with all other user-defined categories in a drop-down category list that can be accessed by tapping a menu label such as \u201cAll Categories\u201d label  of FIG. .","An example of a display showing a list of categories  is shown in  with the \u201cRecent\u201d category label at the top of the list.","If the user selects the \u201cRecent\u201d entry in list , the drop down list disappears and the recently accessed entries are displayed as a new contact list  as shown in FIG. . When viewing the recent category of contacts, Recent label  appears on the display.","As with other categories, entries in the \u201cRecent\u201d category are displayed in the same format as entries in the full list and can be manipulated in the same manner as entries in the full list. In particular, changes to the entry in the \u201cRecent\u201d category result in changes to the database record for that entry. Thus, if the user selects an entry in the \u201cRecent\u201d category and then invokes the DELETE command, the entry is removed from the display and the entry's record is removed from the database. After the entry's record is removed from the database, the entry will no longer appear in any displayed category list nor in the full list of entries.","In other words, the entries displayed in the \u201cRecent\u201d category are not just links to an entry but are the actual entry. Thus, the same operations that can be performed on an entry in the full list of entries can be performed on an entry in the \u201cRecent\u201d category list. For example, under some embodiments, multiple entries in the recent category list may be selected at the same time and then may be moved to a different category using a menu command. Other commands include things such as sending the entry over an Infra-Red (IR) link to another computing device or moving the entry to a storage card.","The present invention is not limited to Contacts applications. It is generally useful for any system where there is a persistent large list of data. For example, in one embodiment, the recent category is added to the list of categories for a Tasks manager application.  provides an example of an image displayed by the task manager showing a task list  and an \u201cAll Categories\u201d label . If the user selects label , a list of categories , including the recent category, is displayed as shown in FIG. . If the user selects the recent category, a new task list  is displayed in , which contains only the most recent tasks that have been accessed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","902","900","904","906"]},"Under most embodiments, Recent array  is updated each time a record is accessed, received or created. In , records are accessed by a ViewRecord component , are received by a ReceiveRecord Component , and are created by a CreateRecord component . As part of their operation, each of these components calls an UpdateRecent component , which updates recent array  to reflect the latest event. In one embodiment, a record is considered to have been accessed when a substantial portion of the record is viewed by the user or when the user edits some portion of the record.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["908","902","1000","908","1002","908","902","1004"]},"If the ID is not in array , all of the ID's in the array are shifted up by one location at step . The newest ID is then inserted at the bottom of the array at step . If the addition of this ID caused the number of ID's in array  to exceed the maximum number that can be stored in the recent category, the oldest ID is removed from array  at step . In the embodiment of  this occurs automatically during the shifting process of step  because the array index of the oldest ID will become less than zero during the shift.","In other embodiments, the recent category list is not limited to a set number of contacts. Instead, the contacts in the recent category list are simply sorted based on when they are last used. In one such embodiment, all of the contacts in the contacts database are available in the recent category list but are sorted based on their last usage so that the most recently used contacts are at the top of the list.","One aspect of the present invention is that it provides a recent category without introducing a new user interface. This makes it easy for users to understand the category and allows a user to manipulate the entries in the category in the same manner that they manipulate entries in other categories.","Under some embodiments, the recent category is not displayed in the category list until after at least one record has been opened, created or received. This prevents the user from seeing the Recent label until there is a recent entry to display.","Although the recent category list was described above as being produced automatically by the system, in some embodiments the user has the ability to manually add contacts to the recent category list. These contacts can either be locked into the recent category list so that they are always present or may be shifted out of the recent category list over time in the same manner as the contacts that are automatically added to the list. In further embodiments, the user may produce a separate \u201cRECENT\u201d category that the user manually populates and controls. In most such embodiments, this manual \u201cRECENT\u201d category would appear below the automatic \u201cRECENT\u201d category. This occurs because the automatic \u201cRECENT\u201d category in most embodiments is always at the top of the category list, while all other categories are organized alphabetically below it. Such ordering helps users to easily distinguish between the two \u201cRECENT\u201d categories.","Although the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
