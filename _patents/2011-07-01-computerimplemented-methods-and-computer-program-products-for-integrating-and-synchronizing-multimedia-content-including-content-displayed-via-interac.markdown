title: Computer-implemented methods and computer program products for integrating and synchronizing multimedia content, including content displayed via interactive televisions, smartphones, electronic book readers, holographic imagery projectors, and other computerized devices
abstract: Computer-implemented methods and computer program products wherein a user's reviewing of select text in a synchronized news story, article, or electronic book generates a changed presentation of associated multimedia content, including photographs, videos, and computerized graphics. User's reviewing of select text is detected automatically or managed manually, with select embodiments integrating touch-screen controls. This process of changing multimedia continues with the user's reviewing of additional select text segments. Select multimedia is modified instead of completely replaced as the user advances to an additional select text segment, leading to uniquely flowing presentations. Multimedia is visually modified through zooming, panning, resizing, highlighting, and/or other approaches. Select embodiments include similarly modified holographic imagery, advertisements, securities charts, and shifted text. In select embodiments, the user's reading speed adjusts visual modifications.

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyrights whatsoever.","This patent application relates to provisional patent application U.S. 61\/400\/152 (\u201cMethod and System for Integrating and Synchronizing Multimedia Content\u201d), filed on Jul. 24, 2010, and to provisional patent application U.S. 61\/458,819 (\u201cMethods and Systems for Randomly Generating Presentations, and [Supplemental] Method and System for Presenting Interactive Content\u201d), filed on Dec. 2, 2010.","Not applicable.","Not applicable.","1. Field","This application relates to the electronic presentation of news, advertising, and informational content, where the written content is integrated and synchronized in a distinct manner with other forms of multimedia content.","2. Prior Art","Readers of news stories and other informational content have benefited from technological advancements in the presentation of articles in print and especially in the presentation of articles via computer-implemented methods and computer program products.","In print, and for news content in particular, the inverted pyramid structure of journalism has remained the mainstay since the 19century. In fact, one of the first inverted pyramid stories was purportedly an Associated Press story drafted in 1865 to report the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Although often considered outdated, the inverted pyramid remains the principal format for stories published by such dominant news organizations as The Associated Press and Reuters. In simple terms, the inverted pyramid structure requires expressing first the key issue of a news story or other informational article, followed by supplementary information of lesser significance and lesser interest so that inverted pyramid stories often conclude anticlimactically by describing detailed minutiae or background information. Most often, the inverted pyramid story is published alone or with an accompanying static photograph.","At the same time, the intermittent use of \u201calternative story formats\u201d in print journalism in recent decades has served to enhance the appeal of news content in newspapers and magazines by incorporating visuals that aide a user's comprehension and enjoyment of a given story. News content based on the \u201calternative story format\u201d innovation often incorporates charts, graphs, colorful designs, bulleted points, and other similar features.","Electronically, the presentation of news and other informational content has changed far more dramatically and quickly. Internet aggregators such as Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft's Bing, as well as online publishers such as WashingtonPost.com and TheWallStreetJournal.com, are now able to present hyperlinked titles of news stories and informational articles that users can click-on or otherwise select to review an entire news story or other piece of content in an electronic display. Some aggregators, such as Yahoo, have leads that pop-up when the user's cursor hovers over a particular story's headline, helping the user to determine whether to skip that story or click on the hyperlink to review the content in depth. Similarly, publishers and aggregators have integrated multimedia content into their electronic presentations of news and other content, whereby digital photographs, video, and audio are mixed with the written content and whereby users can click to review a slideshow of digitized photos related to any given piece of content, whether it's news related or a \u201chow to\u201d informational article.","The current leading online newspaper for interactive innovations is likely The New York Times. Their online newspaper offers several cutting-edge, interactive news presentations and The Times has won multiple awards for their interactive efforts. Their interactive news presentations, however, are heavily focused on graphics, rather than on written articles that incorporate multimedia in the manners described in this patent application featuring \u201csynchronized news stories\u201d and \u201csynchronized informational articles.\u201d","Furthermore, the digital age has led to a blurring of the boundaries between newspapers, television, and other media. In recent decades, broadcast, cable, and satellite television had merely allowed the user to watch broadcasts with simple text overlays that serve to clarify the images portrayed in the video presentations. More recently, however, the Internet has led to a commingling of content in new ways. Video, graphics, and text are able to be integrated so that, for example, a user can read a CNN article on the Internet, then click on a nearby, related video clip, and then click again to review an audio segment that further expands that same written article.","Yet, no other news articles or informational articles have been found that combine written content with other forms of media in the manner described in the embodiments contained within this patent application. The closest electronic news concept uncovered in published media pertains to displays of photographic slide shows on CNN and other news websites; in those examples, the reader clicks the next arrow to see a new photo and to read the accompanying captions. But the \u201csynchronized articles\u201d embodiments taught herein are not primarily about displaying small, isolated captions of text\u2014most of the embodiments contained herein focus on uniquely matching visual and other media to the main text of a given news story or similar news content.","On a different note, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reveals other prior art innovations that have been created to further innovate the electronic creation and display of content.","In U.S. Pat. No. 7,610,358 (2009), Benschoter teaches how to present electronic media content, primarily video content, that is retrieved from a database. Benschoter's method, assigned to Time-Warner Cable, seeks to separate news content into headlines, summaries, and full text or video, allowing the user to incrementally determine whether to move forward with reviewing a particular news story or other content. It is not intended to focus on synchronizing written content with other forms of multimedia in the manner taught herein.","A patent application by Stuckman (2007\/0198655) helps users to navigate in a linear manner from one website to another website. Stuckman's approach differs in that it's not focused on news stories, news commentaries, or other articles, but rather on creating a way for users to move quickly from one website to another.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,524,193 issued to Covington is titled \u201cInteractive Multimedia Annotation Method and Apparatus.\u201d Covington allows a reader of a text story to view or bypass multimedia by manually selecting a highlighted link. In Covington's patent, the reader has to decide to select each text link separately in order to show the next photo, video, etc., rather than having these multimedia elements, or a majority of these elements, stream automatically as the user reviews a particular article. Covington's purpose is to allow the \u201cannotating [of] a text document\u201d by authors in a quick manner and to then give readers the ability to choose or bypass accessing various presentations of multimedia. The multimedia selected then appears in pop-up windows overlaying the text. In addition, this Covington patent has extra steps along with other elements that make it different from the embodiments taught herein.","A patent application by Freeman (2004\/0175095) synchronizes images and audio narratives to a written text. This audio-oriented concept is meant for full-length books on-tape, which differs from the embodiments described herein.","A patent application by Allen (2004\/0078814) intends to provide a customized ticker for televisions. This intriguing multimedia application by Paul G. Allen, a founder of Microsoft, allows the user to customize ticker data within a television broadcast, utilizing multiple displays to present tickers while continuing to watch a sports broadcast, for example.","A patent application by Jewsbury of Microsoft Corporation (2007\/0006079) focuses on identifying a \u201cstate change in a structured representation of a declarative markup language document\u201d to trigger the playing of a component of an interactive multimedia presentation.","A patent application by Saiga (2004\/0080541) seems to enable electronic books to incorporate a timed presentation of information.","A patent application by Saccocci (2009\/0191531) seems confusing, but appears to want to combine a printed book or periodical with stimulation coming from an audio-visual product (such as a stereo or a TV or a computer). Saccocci's key approach is to have the reader hold the physical book in hand and then present sound effects or visual effects as the reader reads a page from that traditional book.","In U.S. Pat. No. 6,269,248, Iggulden seeks to augment a printed book with computerized multimedia content. The physical book contains printed visual cues, and the reader may manually access \u201cindicia\u201d on a computer corresponding with those visual cues to play supplementary audio or other multimedia content.","A patent application by Cohen (2003\/0059758) similarly seeks to integrate a printed book with \u201cassociated interactive electronic data,\u201d with the book likewise containing \u201cindicia\u201d to help the user access corresponding electronic data.","A patent application by Harshman (2006\/0286528) focuses on an \u201cinteractive multimedia reading method.\u201d As with Iggulden and Cohen, Harshman seeks to have the user read a printed book, text, or manual. Coding buried within the printed text then allows the user the option to access related movie or other video segments \u201con demand.\u201d Harshman's patent application's legal claims section seem to focus almost entirely on readers of conventional, printed books; in this regard, electronically reproduced documents are mentioned once in the entire application, and is excluded from the claims. Most importantly, as with Covington, Harshman requires the reader to decide to select each particular text link to show the next video segment, rather than having these multimedia elements, or a majority of these elements, stream automatically as the user reviews the book. With Harshman, the reader has to choose each time to \u201cactuate a code or icon and the like\u201d to access each particular video \u201con demand\u201d segment. In another part of his application, Harshman discusses \u201cpointing and clicking\u201d to access each video on demand. The reason for this approach is that Harshman is offering the user of a book the opportunity to further augment their reading of a book with video segments whenever the reader feels a need. Additionally, although Harshman claims a broad variety of printed and written material, his patent application does not refer to \u201cnews\u201d or \u201cnews stories.\u201d Next, while Harshman indicates that the printed materials can be \u201cfinancial reports . . . charts, and graphs,\u201d he never suggests that the multimedia materials can be charts or photographs or graphics; his teaching focuses solely on movies or videos. In contrast, multimedia depictions of stock charts, financial pie charts, and similar graphics are essential to the original embodiments described herein that pertain to financial news content. In turn, the incorporation of photographs and graphics is a key feature of other embodiments depicted herein.","In U.S. Pat. No. 7,114,170, Harris teaches a \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Providing Interactive Media Presentation.\u201d Harris combines presenting interactive and non-interactive photos, videos, and other media to a user over a computer in combination with a stored \u201cuser profile.\u201d Harris's patent claims seem unclear, but it appears that this patent is intended to prompt the user to watch a non-interactive video and to then make interactive selections based on the information presented in that non-interactive video. The user's choices are then coupled with information stored in their \u201cuser profile,\u201d which then jointly leads to the presentation of follow-up information. It should be noted that Harris's visually-oriented media patent is not focused on news content; instead, it's mostly related to shopping. Nor is Harris's patent related to articles that have a text orientation; as such, Harris does not intend to change the graphics in his presentation as the user reads or scrolls down a block of text, as is taught in the \u201csynchronized news stories\u201d and \u201csynchronized informational articles\u201d patent application herein. Moreover, whereas Harris's patent is completely dependent upon user profiles, implementing user profiles is an element of only certain embodiments described herein.","Relating to scrolled content, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,067,069, Krause teaches a helpful method of scrolling text at variable speeds by attending to the user's eye or head movements.","In turn, a patent application by Lin-Hendel (2008\/0109750) teaches an automatic scrolling method via the use of a highly-flexible electronic scrolling tool.","3. Additional Prior Art Uncovered in Academia","Additional research has been uncovered pertaining to unique news presentations and hypermedia theories propounded by advanced academic researchers in the U.S., Latin America, and Europe.","In the September 1997 edition of , Professor Eric Fredin published a monograph entitled, \u201cRethinking the News Story for the Internet: Hyperstory Prototypes and a Model of the User.\u201d At the time of authorship, Fredin was an associate professor in the school of journalism at Ohio State University. In his monograph, Fredin proposed several concepts for creating non-linear news stories. Yet Fredin's focus was to have a \u201cmain story\u201d presented sequentially, while displaying \u201crelated files\u201d in a separate window. A different set of related files corresponds to individual portions of the displayed main news story. Differing from the embodiments described herein, Fredin's goal was to allow a reader to see headlines of other news stories that relate to specific portions of a given \u201cmain story,\u201d and to also allow each of those related stories to become the new \u201cmain story\u201d with its own set of related headlines. Fredin's goal was to allow readers to shift from one news story to another news story in a fluid manner, rather than to completely transform the inner workings of a news story or other informational articles.","In 1999 Assistant Professor Robert Huesca of Trinity University and Professor Brenda Dervin of Ohio State University presented an intriguing and helpful paper at the \u201cMedia in Transition Conference\u201d at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The paper was entitled, \u201cHypertext and Journalism: Audiences Respond to Competing News Narratives.\u201d The paper was based on a previous experiment in which these researchers had \u201cselected existing news stories and redesigned them ourselves using basic principles of hypertext.\u201d Huesca and Dervin took traditional news stories from the Los Angeles Times and configured them for presentation so that the \u201credesigned versions contained no new material; rather, they were simply broken into thematic parts that had to be activated by clicking on links running along the left side of the computer screen . . . Aside from slight changes in transitional phrases, the hypertext content was identical to the original article; only the form was altered\u2014from a unified, linear story versus a non-sequential narrative with reader controlled links.\u201d Huesca and Dervin's experiment focused on non-linear presentations of news content. Their method differed widely from the embodiments described in this patent application, in large part because the professors' methods do not offer stories which progress linearly through the precise synchronizing of written content with other forms of media.","Similar to the research presented by Huesca and Dervin at MIT, Wilson Lowrey published an interesting research paper in the Spring 2004 edition of the . The research paper was entitled, \u201cMore Control, but not Clarity in Non-Linear Web Stories.\u201d Lowrey also discussed and compared a similar approach in another paper, \u201cThe Applicability of Cognitive Flexibility Theory to the Production of Hypermedia News Stories.\u201d This latter research paper was presented by Lowrey in New Orleans on May 27, 2004 at an annual conference hosted by the International Communication Association. Lowrey is an associate professor of journalism in the College of Communication and Information Sciences at The University of Alabama. In \u201cMore Control, but not Clarity in Non-Linear Web Stories,\u201d Lowrey describes the creation of a non-linear news story where \u201cthe non-linear story was segmented into four different topics and was overlaid with a navigational scheme. Links to each of the four topics were available in a vertical frame on the left side of each page.\u201d Like Huesca and Dervin, Lowrey appears to permit the user to skip from one news story portion to another portion in any sequence desired. Also like Huesca and Dervin, Lowrey's methods do not offer stories which progress linearly based on the \u201csynchronized news stories\u201d computer-implemented methods and computer program products taught herein.","In a 2008 edition of , Mark Tremayne, Assistant Professor of Journalism at the University of Texas at Austin, published an article about an unusual hypertext prototype he developed. The article was entitled: \u201cManipulating Interactivity with Thematically Hyperlinked News Texts: a media learning experiment.\u201d Tremayne stated his prototype is not \u201ca purely non-linear one\u201d as is taught herein; instead he focused on a \u201chierarchical hypertext\u201d that contained multiple layers of portions which could only be accessed via a specific manner. Tremayne's prototype is also distinct from that described herein.","Finally, Jo\u00e3o Canavilhas of Universidade da Beira Interior in Portugal presented a helpful research piece at the International Symposium of Online Journalism in 2008 at the University of Texas at Austin. The symposium is sponsored in part by the Knight Center for Journalism and UNESCO. Canavilhas's article is entitled \u201cHypertext Newswriting Effects on Satisfaction, Comprehension and Attitudes.\u201d Canavilhas's prototype for a non-linear news story includes the initial presentation of a news story title coupled with its lead. Contained within this lead are links the user may select to navigate to other portions of the news story. Canavilhas's method of navigation and presentation differs from the embodiments described herein. As just one example, Canavilhas embeds his hyperlinks in various places of the lead itself (to encourage non-linear reading) rather than in the main text or in another manner that lends itself to a linear presentation of the news story. Also, and as with the other prior art examples, Canavilhas's approach doesn't allow the reader to synchronize written content with other forms of media in the streaming method and product taught herein.","A surprisingly large volume of additional research has been undertaken on this subject, and the Association for Computerized Machinery has even formed a special interest group dedicated to the research of \u201chypertext, hypermedia, and the web.\u201d This special interest group sponsors annual conferences where university professors from across the globe publish and discuss academic research on advanced methods of presenting news content. Yet, despite the sizable volume of research and experiments undertaken, the inventor has not encountered models that specify the embodiments detailed in this application's appended claims.","In accordance with one embodiment described, a computer-implemented method and computer program product are provided for the electronic presentation of a multimedia news story or informational article (both collectively termed \u201csynchronized article\u201d), wherein the written content is integrated and synchronized in a distinct manner with related media content, including any desired combination of photographs, videos, audios, or financial or other graphics.","As the user advances to select phrases, lines, paragraphs, or other predetermined segments of written text in the synchronized article the related media content changes, allowing for new, associated presentations of videos, photos, or other media. Moreover, the user's reading speed helps to control the speed of changes in the related media content, putting the user in charge, creating a distinctively entertaining presentation, and allowing the user the option to review content at a higher rate of speed than is the case with traditional news broadcasts.","A current presentation of the synchronized article contains at least one \u201cmultimedia control\u201d that serves to present additional or changed media content that corresponds to a select segment of text the user seeks to review. The multimedia control can, for example, be comprised of, or work in conjunction with, at least one interactive button, electronic scroll-bar, or electronic touch screen control, or a combination thereof. Alternatively, the multimedia control can be associated with an automatic eye-tracking or body-movement tracking device (an \u201cautomatic tracking component\u201d) to cause the automatic changing of related media content. If the multimedia control is expressly scrolling-oriented, it can be more specifically termed a \u201cscrolling-oriented multimedia control.\u201d If it is scrolling-oriented while also incorporating more traditional hyperlink controls that can similarly cause the presentation of related media content, it can be more specifically termed a \u201chybrid scrolling-oriented multimedia control.\u201d","By maneuvering the multimedia control in the current presentation while reviewing the text, or by maneuvering elements associated with the multimedia control, the user causes the related media content to change in synchronization with the user's review of select phrases, lines, entire paragraphs, or other predetermined segments of written text. Additional presentations can similarly synchronize the related media content with text content.","The main text can be presented either within, or adjacent to, one or more displays of synchronized media content. The currently synchronized text can be highlighted or otherwise differentiated. In select instances, audio-visual presentations can be muted or at low volume while the text is read, with the user provided the option to change the sound volume. In select cases, related media content can consistently be presented in the same place on a given display or the media can shift down or across an electronic page in conjunction with the user's reviewing of associated text. More than one component of related media can be presented simultaneously or can appear and disappear at various intervals as the reader reviews the corresponding text. The main news story can be accompanied by the presentation of one or more sidebar news stories which appear and optionally disappear as the reader reviews select segments of the main article's text; in addition, the sidebar articles can have their own select segments of text synchronized with the display of related media content. Conversely, the user's review of select components of related media can lead to a changing in the presentation of the article's text. Stock charts and other financial graphics can be modified in a highly-advantageous manner as the user advances through the accompanying text of a financial news story. The text itself can shift across the page, or have its appearance changed, as the user scrolls down the page.","Related media content can be zoomed in or out, or certain parts can be highlighted, augmented, or otherwise modified as the user advances to a select new segment of text. For instance, the reviewing of a select new segment of text could lead to a change in perspective of a video or other visual image already displayed. This leads to an unusually fluid manner in which to present visual and other supportive media in association with the text content.","Time delay devices for presenting related media content can likewise be incorporated. Article presentations can change from displaying one type of media to another type of media. Select photographs, graphics, videos, or segments of videos can be skipped or replaced by alternative versions to accommodate the needs of faster readers. Select media content can optionally be bypassed unless specifically chosen by the user.","Users can be informed in advance as to when visual, audio, or other media changes will take place. Users can also be allowed to bypass using the multimedia control yet still be permitted to progress forward to review the written text and accompanying visual or audio images.","Users can be guided in select instances to embed their own comments within the synchronized articles, and the articles accompanied by the embedded user comments can be shared on social platforms, including Facebook and MySpace. Additional users can likewise add comments, including comments that critique previous comments.","Advertising content can likewise be integrated and synchronized with the articles, with the advertising presentation able to change as the user advances to select segments of the articles.","Moreover, advertising content can itself be designed to work in a similar synchronized format, where the user's reviewing of synchronized advertising text changes the presentation of the corresponding visual, audio, or other media content presented.","Synchronized multimedia can be presented as interactive games so that, for instance, the user's reaching a predetermined point in the associated text leads to an invitation to play an interactive game presented.","Synchronized articles can be presented in a traditional linear story format, or the content can be presented in a non-linear format. If presenting the article linearly, as an alternate approach the initial presentation can commence by showing, for example, just one text segment of the story. Selecting the multimedia control then causes a second presentation containing a second text segment to be displayed within or adjacent to the first segment (or in lieu of the first segment). In turn, the related media content can change as the user selects each additional presentation comprised of each additional text segment.","Multiple article summaries or whole articles can be integrated together into a single, cohesive display using this \u201csynchronized article\u201d approach. As such, in one variation the user can scroll down the text of one article, thereby causing its graphics to shift as described previously, while the graphics for other displayed articles remain unaffected.","Pauses in reading, or pauses in maneuvering the multimedia control, can lead to additional changes in the article's presentation, to changes in advertising, or both. The type and amount of synchronized presentations can be matched with individual preferences by incorporating user profiles. Text captions can be placed within synchronized articles, with the user's review of said captions causing the continued, modified presentation of related media.","The processes described in this summary can likewise be implemented to change the synchronized presentation of multimedia in electronic books, leading to a new way for users to interact with ebooks.","Other embodiments and details are described and shown.","Computer-implemented methods and computer program products are described for presenting synchronized multimedia news stories and informational articles in an electronic format. A computer-implemented system may alternatively be referred to herein as a computerized system or, as just mentioned, a computer program product.","The general term \u201cnews story\u201d includes a top news story, breaking news story, feature story, commentary, and news release; it further includes a news story relating to politics, crises, business, finance, sports, entertainment, technology, or any other story typically considered newsworthy.","The term \u201cinformational article\u201d refers to informational articles on a wide variety of subjects that would not normally be considered news. \u201cHow to\u201d articles, advertorials, and Wikipedia encyclopedia entries are three examples of informational articles.","The \u201cnews story\u201d and \u201cinformational article\u201d described above are further referred to in this patent application as being comprised of written (text-based) content united in a unique manner with any combination of photographs, video, audio, computerized graphics, holographic images, or other forms of media content. This integrating and synchronizing is what transforms the content into \u201csynchronized news stories\u201d and \u201csynchronized informational articles.\u201d The collective term used in this patent application for both (synchronized news stories and synchronized informational articles) is \u201csynchronized articles.\u201d In turn, the collective term used in this patent application for both \u201celectronic informational articles\u201d and \u201celectronic books\u201d is \u201cinformational electronic documents.\u201d Also related to definitions, videos, photographs, and financial charts are collectively referred to in this patent application as \u201cvisual images.\u201d","The term \u201crelated media content\u201d refers to supportive media displayed alongside text in a news story, informational article, or electronic book, leading to the collective display of \u201cmultimedia content.\u201d Related media content includes photographs, videos, audios, graphics, and other forms of media that help illustrate the text. When referring to two or more forms of related media content, they may collectively be called multimedia content. Similarly, when referring to text and any one or more forms of related media content (such as text and a visual image), they may also collectively be called multimedia content.","The term \u201cmultimedia control\u201d is defined as being comprised of at least one electronic control that helps the user to choose, or otherwise activate, at least one select segment of text within a particular news story or informational article. Once that select segment is chosen or otherwise activated via the multimedia control, or via a component of the multimedia control, then new or changed visual, audio, and\/or other related media content is presented that relates to that select segment of text. The multimedia control can be chosen manually through, for example, electronic scrolling or an electronic \u201cbutton\u201d or another computerized control, in which case it could be referred to as a \u201cmanually manipulated electronic control.\u201d Or it can be activated automatically by the computerized system through eye-tracking or other body-tracking software, and can therefore be referred to as an \u201cautomatic tracking multimedia control.\u201d In the case of an automatic control, when the user reviews a news story, for instance, eye-tracking software can evaluate and report back to the computer-implemented system which new select segment of text the user is presently reviewing. That reporting back then serves to activate the multimedia control which, in turn, advances the related media content so that it is associated with the new select segment of text presently viewed by the user.","The term \u201cscrolling-oriented multimedia control\u201d is defined as at least one electronic control that specifically uses one or more scrolling processes to help the user to manually choose a select segment of text within a particular news story or informational article. Once that select segment is chosen or is otherwise activated via the scrolling-oriented multimedia control, or via a component of the scrolling-oriented multimedia control, then new or changed illustrative media content is presented that relates to that select segment of text.","In turn, the term \u201chybrid scrolling-oriented multimedia control\u201d is defined as combining the features offered by the scrolling-oriented multimedia control described above with the ability to select hyperlinks to advance related media content in a particular synchronized article.","The term \u201celectronic touch screen control,\u201d or simply \u201ctouch screen,\u201d refers to an electronic control that presents text manually through the user's conscious manipulating of at least one finger, hand, stylus, or a similar instrument on or very near a computerized display screen. Additional text may, for example, be \u201cpushed up\u201d or \u201cpulled down\u201d into view on the display by the tip of the user's finger with this electronic touch control. Once selected text is presented via the electronic touch screen control, then new or changed visual or other illustrative media content is likewise presented that relates to that selected text. Although the user may activate a touch-screen control in an iPhone, for example, by pressing on a small button on the computerized display screen, the specific phrase \u201cmaneuvering of said electronic touch screen control\u201d in this patent application specifically refers to the user's moving of their finger, hand, stylus, or similar instrument across a predetermined part of the display screen to cause a change in presentation, rather than simply pressing on a single area such as a button.

Communications interface  includes a modem and broadband device, a transmitter and receiver coupled to Bluetooth or wireless local area networks (WLAN) or other such networks for wireless devices, or any combination thereof. This communications interface  allows the user to communicate with servers such as server  through a network  such as the Internet or through another such network , including proprietary networks operated through, for example, interactive television systems or cellular telecommunications systems.","Computer memory , also referred to in this patent application as a computer-useable storage medium, may include non-volatile memory (e.g., ROM), volatile memory (e.g., RAM), and hard drive and flash drive memory. In this instance, the memory may store, among other features, a web browser , several examples of which are Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla FireFox, and Google Chrome.

In turn, the first select segment of text  is no longer differentiated via bolding.","In addition, the new presentation of the first article shown in  allows the reader to select an audio control  button. In this case, the audio of President Obama delivering a speech at West Point is muted until the user selects that audio control ; alternatively, the speech could be set at a low decibel level, and then increased to a higher level upon the user's selection of that audio control . While audio levels can be kept at normal volumes in many cases, in other situations it is advantageous to keep the audio at a low level or even to mute it so that it doesn't disturb the user's reading of the text that accompanies the multimedia. Also, instead of the simple illustration for patent purposes of an \u201con\/off\u201d audio control , the actual audio control  implemented could instead be comprised of an adjustable volume control, giving the user more control over the sound volume.","Furthermore, as is demonstrated with the above audio example in , additional supportive media content can be withheld from presentation unless specifically chosen to be reviewed by the user through additional activating of a component of the multimedia control. Moreover, one or more supplementary media components can optionally be presented to the user via a time-delay component; for example, in the first five seconds following the user's choosing of the fourth select segment of text , a still photograph (instead of a video) can be displayed in the related media presentation . Unless the user has moved on to a different segment of text once five seconds passes, the still photograph corresponding to the fourth select segment of text  can then automatically convert to a video of President Obama delivering his speech.","Each article in this first preferred embodiment should be created in at least a first presentation and a second presentation, with there being flexibility in how one constructs each presentation. In addition, each synchronized article can continue forward with as many additional presentations as is needed to entertain or to complete the article in a satisfactory manner. Moreover, most articles will be comprised of more than two presentations, with some articles being comprised of at least five to ten presentations. Furthermore, some new presentations may lead to little or no change in the related media content, while other presentations may lead to a complete altering of the related media. Likewise, each of the presentations can contain one or even multiple components of multimedia.","If a given presentation does contain multiple components of multimedia (e.g., a presentation consisting of two photographs embedded in a silent video coupled with computerized graphic), the next presentation displayed could optionally result in some, but not all, of the multiple components being changed.","Related media content can optionally be altered for faster or slower readers, or even for users who have paused reading. For example, if the user is reviewing quickly the first three segments of text in , then the presentation  of the video in  can be sped-up to accommodate the user's fast reading speed, or the video can be kept at the same speed and then halted and replaced once the reader reaches the fourth select segment of text  shown in , where a video or photo of President Obama replaces the previous media. In contrast, for slower readers\u2014or for readers who have paused their reading or scrolling of an article\u2014the video could be slowed-down, repeated, replaced by a \u201cfiller\u201d piece of media, or even be replaced by an advertisement until the user finally reaches the fourth select segment of text .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0118"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["240","230","420"]},"As a variation on , instead of using traditional underlined hyperlinks to create the hybrid alternative outlined above, the hyperlinks in the \u201chybrid scrolling-oriented multimedia control\u201d can be structured to allow the entire first bullet point (or a first select paragraph in a more traditionally structured news story) to be clicked-on or otherwise selected to cause the presentation of at least one changed component of related media content. Therefore, for example, the user may place their cursor, finger, stylus, or other control device anywhere on the whole \u201cbullet point\u201d of text to cause the presenting of relevant synchronized visual images and to cause that bullet point of text to be differentiated via bolding. In this case, differing from traditional hyperlinks, there isn't necessarily a need for underlining the hyperlinks or highlighting key words of text.","In addition,  helps to demonstrate some interesting advantages of the embodiments contained herein.

In turn, note that the cursor  in  is further down the paragraph than the equivalent cursor shown in . This is to indicate that the user has already reviewed the first two sentences in that first segment of text and has already scrolled down the text to the third sentence. This, in turn, hasn't led to a complete changing of the related media content since the subject matter remains nearly the same. It has, however, allowed the visual presentation in this example to zoom in on the two key figures being discussed. This is a key point for the various embodiments detailed herein. The reason is, the embodiments described in this patent application allow for a continuous flow of changing images to accompany the user's reviewing of text, which is a unique feature not seen in prior art. Therefore, as the reader scrolls through the associated text or otherwise reviews the text (manually, or automatically via an automatic tracking component of a multimedia control) in some instances the related media changes completely; in other instances, however, it doesn't change at all (or only certain components change completely); while, in still other instances elements of the related media content change in a flowing manner by zooming in or out or by changing camera perspectives on the subjects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0121"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["430","240"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0123","num":"0122"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["220","260","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0124","num":"0123"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"This second preferred embodiment, along with each of the alternative embodiments that follow, can utilize the same computerized processes that were detailed in the first preferred embodiment.","As the user maneuvers the cursor  in the scroll bar  manually or automatically in , instead of presenting a large primary body of text  adjacent to the cursor as is shown in , each segment of storybook text  in this second preferred embodiment is presented separately within or adjacent to the multimedia display, while the scroll bar  and cursor  point to the equivalent of a table of contents  that outlines the subject matter contained in each upcoming presentation. This computer-implemented method and computer program product not only gives the reader advanced notice of the nature of each topic to be discussed in a particular article, it also illustrates one way in which the user can be informed in advance as to when various multimedia components will be displayed, along with the nature of those same multimedia components. For example, the user scrolls down to \u201cmap\u201d , which immediately follows a brief written discussion on Afghanistan. As a result, a map of Afghanistan is presented alongside the matching storybook text. In turn, when the user scrolls further down the page to \u201cWho Will Attend,\u201d the corresponding storybook text appears; once the user scrolls slightly further, then an associated \u201cphoto\u201d  of the respective NATO participants is presented alongside the corresponding storybook text. Each new element of illustrative media may be presented simultaneous to the presentation of each new segment of storybook text, or the illustrative media can be presented in-between the presentation of text, or both.","In turn, the  screenshot takes the second preferred embodiment depicted in  and simply places the scroll bar , the cursor , and the related \u201ctable of contents\u201d  or equivalent within the display of the main visual media presentation.","It should be noted that the first preferred embodiment can likewise provide the user with advanced notice of upcoming media presentations.

This is similar to how photographs are often presented in print newspaper stories. Only, in this computerized variation, and similar to the various embodiments detailed herein, the visual media presentation  surrounded by text on all sides changes as the user reviews the related text. As with the prior examples, this can be accomplished manually through the various computer-implemented methods and computer program products described in this patent application, or it can be accomplished automatically via eye-tracking or other body-tracking components. As well, in this combined presentation of multiple articles, scrolling down one article can change graphics associated with the chosen article while unaffecting graphics associated with unrelated articles; in this instance, using an electronic touch screen control (among other choices) would allow the user to affect the text and graphics for one article while unrelated text and graphics remain static on the electronic display page.  jointly demonstrate how related media content changes for an article currently being read about President Obama (causing the Obama video to zoom-in), while related media content for a second article presented in the same electronic newspaper remains unaffected.

The corresponding visual or audio media can subsequently change when the user selects the next select segment of text within the \u201cElectronic Book Sales\u201d article , in the same manner as the previously described examples.","The  illustrations of six screenshots help to provide a visual overview of the synchronized article process. The article depicted in  has been abbreviated to conserve space in this patent application, yet longer articles can easily follow the same process.  shows how multimedia components can change in a pleasing and coherent manner in association with the presentation of related text for a single article. This particular overview also shows how the embodiments detailed herein can work especially well with smartphones and tablet computers. The first display  in  represents a video of Defense Secretary Gates walking toward a Turkish General. The second display  brought on by a changing of presented text shows the same video, but with Gates now shaking hands with the Turkish General. The third display  switches to a completely new presentation, a photograph of President Obama. The fourth display , likewise brought on by a changing of text, zooms in on that same photograph of Obama. The fifth display  then switches to a photo of U.S. Marines on patrol in Afghanistan, while the sixth and final display  shows a video of Gates waving goodbye, symbolizing his upcoming departure from Turkey in order to travel to Europe.","Note that the text scrolling functions detailed above can be incorporated into current smartphone and tablet computer \u201ctouch screen\u201d technology.

Alternatively, the presenting of text can be accomplished in one of the other manners described in this patent application. Relating to this presentation, a text cursor  is depicted in the third display  in  to help show the user which line of text matches the current related media content presentation.","In addition, the visual media displayed in , as well as the media content displayed in the other preferred and alternative embodiments can change in a slow, flowing manner, or it can change in a more abrupt way, or both. For instance, in  the transition from the first display  to the second display  can be controlled in a slow, flowing manner no matter how fast the user scrolls down from the beginning of the first segment of text in the first display  to the end of the second segment of text in the second display ; conversely, the display can be designed to match the speed of the video with the scrolling speed implemented by the user. So, if the user scrolls (or reads) quickly, then the video images can accelerate to match. Or, in that same situation, the video can instead be designed to skip to a next predetermined scene. Or the video can be converted to a still photograph or other presentation until the user scrolls to the third display . The publisher or aggregator has the benefit of being able to choose from many presentation options using visual images and other media while still adhering to the core of the unique embodiments detailed herein.","The  illustration of a screenshot shows how the preferred and alternative embodiments described previously can be used in a beneficial manner to present financial news stories and financial informational articles.

The changed advertisement could even, for instance, be a presentation of a coupon for a dry skin product. Alternatively, the publisher might have excluded advertisements altogether in the prior presentation, and only displayed a first advertisement about treating dry skin after the user chose the related segment of text.","Advertising can be presented in a synchronized manner in other ways as well. For example, advertising can be included inside the visual or audio media presentations of articles shown in the previous illustrations, with changed presentations of advertising presented in synchronization with the user's selection of a next select segment of text in a given news story or informational article.","As well, electronic advertisements can be presented independently of articles, utilizing this same synchronized article format.  depicts two screenshots of an advertisement for a bakery.

Once the user scrolls or otherwise selects the next select segment of advertising text  (focusing on homemade apple pies), as is shown in the second text display , then the second display's changed related media content  zooms in on that apple pie that was shown at a distance in the prior visual presentation. The user's selection of additional select segments of text can lead to additional changes in the presentation of associated media.","Synchronized advertisements such as that depicted in  can be designed using any of the preferred or alternative embodiments described in this patent application. Or those advertisements can also be designed as advertorials, allowing lengthier presentations of text to accompany the advertising.","Addressing another issue, in some cases these synchronized articles can incorporate a specialized computer memory (or \u201cuser profile\u201d) that remembers the user's record in reviewing previous presentations of synchronized articles. For instance, a user profile can remember whether a particular user enjoyed audio-visual presentations as they reviewed the associated text for news stories, or whether they instead choose to have the audio muted. As well, the user profile can record if the user preferred to see still photographs to accompany the related text or whether they preferred videos. The specialized memory can then lead to a computerized altering of the presentation of the article currently being reviewed to better match that particular user's past preferences. In addition, if so desired, the user can be asked their preferences directly, and those preferences are subsequently stored in the memory; future presentations of synchronized articles can then match those directly-stated preferences.","This computer-implemented method and computer program product relating to synchronized articles could additionally incorporate a variety of electronic games into the multimedia presentations of articles, including: anagrams, puzzles, clues, Mad Libs, Hangman, Tic-tac-toe, video game poker, Pac-Man\u00ae, Asteroids\u00ae, electronic pinball, etc. As a result, when the user scrolls or otherwise selects any particular next segment of text, an electronic game can be presented as part of the synchronized presentation. The user can play the respective game or simply move on to the next select segment of text. Moreover, success at select games can lead to the awarding of prizes, or to the display of bonus presentations, or both.","As well, select additional media components can be incorporated as \u201csurprise graphics\u201d that are able to be presented at any time during which the user is reviewing the news story or informational electronic document. This can help to create additional surprise and excitement for the user.","Next, users can be allowed to comment on select synchronized news stories and informational electronic documents. This can be done in a traditional manner, where the user comments in an area designated outside the space of the electronic news story or informational article. Alternatively, select comments can be permitted to be displayed within the actual presentation of the synchronized news story or informational article, such as within the primary body of text  or within the related media content presentation . This can especially be useful if users are permitted to share synchronized news stories or informational articles on social platforms such as Facebook or MySpace. As such, if a first user flags, posts, or otherwise shares a synchronized news story embedded with their comments, then friends can see the first user's embedded comments and, if so desired, embed their own comments into the news story.","The embodiments described in this patent application can be utilized to enhance the presentation of several types of informational electronic documents, including electronic books. This includes fiction, educational textbooks, self-help books, and other informational and educational content. As an example, a user reading an e-book biography about Abraham Lincoln might see displayed, adjacent to an associated segment of text, an image of the president as a child. Then, as the user reads the next select segment of text, the image of young Abe Lincoln can slowly move across the page of text or zoom-in, or otherwise be modified. In other instances, as the user reads additional text the photograph might change completely; this flexibility in approach is reflected in the news story examples previously described. In fact, the  computerized displays, along with others, can apply specifically to e-book presentations.","Further exploring the e-book concept, a person reading a different chapter of the same hypothetical e-book on President Lincoln might see a recently-shot color video of the outside of Lincoln's log cabin as they read related text about his childhood. The angle and location of the video can then be modified so that, as the user encounters additional text discussing how young Abe spent his nights sleeping in the cramped quarters, the camera taking the video gradually \u201cwalks\u201d the reader into the cabin; as a result, the user sees in the associated video exactly what the text is discussing, synchronizing the visual media with the text in a unique manner. As well, when the user comes to a section of text that refers to a different home Lincoln had lived-in, the video can change completely to a new graphic.","Using another example, in a self-help e-book or a digital work of fiction, the multimedia presentation  can be used to guide the reader on a visual journey. As the user scrolls down descriptive text, associated visual media can change both abruptly and in a slow, flowing manner to simulate the reader's walking down steps or opening a series of doors or encountering other characters on the visual journey in synchronization with the user's review of related text.","As was explained in depth previously in this patent application, the user may scroll manually through a manually manipulated electronic device as he or she reads the e-book or other informational electronic document, or automatic eye or other body-tracking software can be implemented to detect the reader's place in the given story to activate an associated automatic tracking multimedia control.","Another helpful feature supporting the previously-described embodiments includes incorporating text into the multimedia presentation  so that the text can be visually altered both abruptly and in a slow, flowing manner as the user reviews the text, the multimedia content, or both. This will allow, for instance, written text to shift to make way for emerging or changing graphics. For a sports story created in the embodiments previously described, the initial presentation could include a headline, two columns of text, and a still graphic of a professional football team's logo that is placed in the middle of the two columns of text. Then, as the user begins to read the story, scrolling manually or allowing automatic eye or other body-tracking software to detect the reader's place in a given story, a video could be shown of a football player crashing through both the team's logo and the article's text, with the article's text actually moving to make way for the graphical presentation of the moving football player. Because the text is integrated directly into the graphical presentation, it can easily interact with the accompanying graphics in a variety of unique and advantageous ways.","Further illustrating how text can be moved in conjunction with the presentation of related graphics,  jointly depict the Robert Gates news story previously represented in  and other diagrams; however, in this example, a video of Robert Gates walking toward his Turkish counterpart causes the text to be shifted in a flowing manner. Although these two diagrams () show a \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter,\u201d it can be extrapolated how the text can be shifted gradually (or, conversely, instantly) so as to minimize disrupting the user's reviewing of the text.","Note that the graphics in the various embodiments can be presented once based on scrolling, based on time, or a combination thereof; or they can loop so the graphic activity repeats.","Text articles, alone or in conjunction with related media content, can be modified in another associated manner to benefit readers. This example is based in part on prior art depicted in \u201cYahoo!\u201d news pages, whereby hovering over a Yahoo! news headline permits a pop-up display that reveals a brief introduction to the news story. In this inventor's embodiment, additional useful and innovative functionality is provided while the user hovers over, or otherwise selects, the headline or its associated headline electronic control for a given news story or other informational content. This additional functioning allows the user to, for example, hover over select individual words within the headline, which then allows the pop-up display showing the lede to change to represent subsequent portions of the news story including, if desired, related media content components that change in the manner previously described in this patent application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0168","num":"0167"},"figref":["FIGS. 26 and 27","FIG. 26","FIG. 27"],"b":["2610","2620","2730","2730","2720"]},"Optionally, the publisher or user could elect to allow an initial hovering over (or otherwise selecting) of any portion of the headline to cause only the introduction to appear. Then, once a predetermined period of time passes, or the user takes a specific action, all or select individual words can be activated to represent different portions of the news story or other informational article.","Alternatively, instead of causing pop-up portions to change when the user hovers over each select individual word, the pop-ups could change when the user hovers over selected letters or groups of words. Or the user could instead hover over other content, such as symbols or other indicators adjacent to the headline; the user's selection of at least one such symbol near the headline, for example, could then cause the presentation of the pop-up box with the desired news story content.","Moreover, the user could also be provided with sub-headlines that appear, for example, in the same pop-box as the news lede or in one or more additional pop-up boxes\u2014or even on the same display as the headline. The advantage to this unique approach is striking: when the user selects, for example, a particular word in the headline, not only does a pop-up box appear with a chosen portion of the news story, but the corresponding sub-headline can also be highlighted or otherwise differentiated from the unselected sub-headlines displayed. This allows the user to visually see, choose, and confirm the selection of sub-headline topics of interest while ignoring others. In this manner, the user is then allowed to review the article either linearly or non-linearly, providing additional flexibility and usability.","One reason publishers have not explored this approach may relate to the possible fear users would not see advertisements on a new electronic page that would be watched had the reader instead traditionally clicked-on a headline. However, this inventor proposes advertising can be presented within the one or more pop-up boxes presenting the news story, and even in the optional list of sub-headlines. For instance, if the user hovers over the second word in a given news headline, and that causes the second portion of that news story to appear in a pop-up box, that pop-up box (or a supplementary pop-up box) could show a new advertisement, such as for an automobile. If the user then selects the third word in that same headline, that same pop-up box could then change to show different information about the advertised automobile, or the pop-up box could instead present an entirely new set of advertisements. Although changing ads can be presented in separate pop-up boxes, it may be preferable to include the ads within the pop-up boxes that present the news or other desired informational content, so that users do not find the pop-ups bothersome. Alternatively, the changing ads could be presented on the main page containing the headlines.","This extended use of pop-up boxes to show additional portions of an article coupled with advertising creates a win-win situation, in that users obtain far easier access to articles than is currently permitted in the prior art\u2014and without having to change an entire web page or app, for example. In turn, the news publisher or aggregator is allowed to present advertising in an advantageous manner that is also comparatively agreeable to the user.","For further functionality, the user could be allowed to alter the size of the one or more pop-up boxes presented. Similarly, the publisher might decide to give the user a choice as to whether the pop-up boxes should exclude or include related media content (such as photos or videos), and\/or whether the article's sub-headlines should be presented or hidden from display.","As mentioned above, associated visual media can be displayed in a comparatively flowing manner as the user scrolls across the presented electronic headline control of the news story or other content. In this case, the \u201cscroll\u201d control is the actual headline itself or a control near the headline, and so scrolling across the headline (or, for example, implementing an electronic control just to the side of the headline) could cause a flowing change in the presentation of video or other pictorial content (including advertising) to accompany the change in text-based content. Alternatively, the full article's own text can also be scrolled in a gradual, flowing manner in the pop-up box while the user also \u201cscrolls\u201d the headline or related control; this allows the reader to gradually and effortlessly review all or part of the text of the article in a single pop-up box.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0176","num":"0175"},"figref":["FIGS. 28 and 29","FIGS. 28 and 29"],"b":["2830","2820","2910"]},"In lieu of using pop-up boxes, the headlines could cause the news stories to be presented on the main display or another, non \u201cpop-up\u201d type of display.","Text can be shifted in additional ways to incorporate the embodiments detailed herein. For example, a news or informational article can commence with the lede text in a much larger font size than the rest of the article. Then, once the user scrolls or otherwise reads the article, the font for the lede text can, automatically shrink to match the font size for the rest of the text in the article in that same display.","Lastly, the synchronized articles described herein could readily be distributed by news services and news agencies such as Reuters and the Associated Press. Furthermore, an aggregator or publisher retrieving such synchronized articles from the news service or news agency can be enabled to modify the synchronized articles not only by editing the text and graphics, but also by, for example, increasing or decreasing the level of multimedia interactivity afforded to their particular users. As a result, one publisher or aggregator could choose to present an article's complete array of visual multimedia to their users as photos, videos, and graphics, while another publisher or aggregator might choose to retrieve, or present, a version in which video presentations have been converted into photographic presentations to reduce bandwidth usage or to better mesh with the publisher or aggregator's other news offerings.","Flow Charts to Illustrate Computer Processes",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0180","num":"0179"},"figref":"FIGS. 30 to 38"},"Moreover, although terms related to a \u201ccomputer-implemented method\u201d are utilized in these flow charts, they also exemplify the computerized processes that would be implemented for a \u201ccomputer program product.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0182","num":"0181"},"figref":["FIG. 30","FIGS. 2","FIG. 30","FIG. 30"],"b":["3","4","5","130","160","180","240","240","240","240","240"]},"In relation to flow chart variations, advertisements can easily be incorporated into the  and subsequent flow charts, wherein each computerized operation that causes a new presentation of an article's related media content can additionally cause a change in the presentation of at least one component of advertising content. Second, electronic touch screen controls can substitute in each of the flow charts for a computer mouse, a track ball, or other commonly-used electronic controls. Third, in financial news stories, the computerized operations that cause a change of related media content can mainly lead to the changing in presentation of stock charts and other financial graphics. Fourth, the user's choosing to review each new segment of text within an article can cause the computerized operation to present a change of related media content or, alternatively, the user's choosing to review select segments of text within each flow chart can lead to the presenting of changed related media content within a news story, wherein \u201cselect segments\u201d refers to either particular segments or every segment.","The flow chart depicted in  follows similar steps as described above, except that  emphasizes how the embodiments detailed in this patent application can lead to a fluid interactive presentation of multimedia very different from the prior art. This flow chart of the computerized steps involved shows the multimedia control detecting the user's choosing of a next or later selected segment of text within a multimedia article, activating a computerized operation that leads to a replacing of the first multimedia presentation. The result is a computerized display showing a changed component of related media content, whereby at least one of the changed components includes the continued, modified presentation of the same visual image that had been displayed in the first multimedia presentation. In other words, the video or photograph or stock chart isn't replaced; instead, it is zoomed-in or out, or its perspective is otherwise altered. The user's subsequent choosing of an additional segment of text could cause the related media content to follow an identical path\u2014further modifying the same visual image\u2014or it could lead to a complete replacement of that video, photograph, or stock chart.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0185","num":"0184"},"figref":"FIG. 32"},"Like ,  shows how an automatic tracking multimedia control can be incorporated into the embodiments described. This case, however, illustrates the computerized steps involved in moving from a first multimedia presentation to a later multimedia presentation and back to a presentation that is in-between the two. As well, this flow chart indicates that the \u201cin-between\u201d presentation can optionally be additionally modified to account for the fact that the user has already viewed the later presentation before viewing the earlier one. As a result, a given publisher could, for example, decide to have the earlier presentation skip an explanation that would've otherwise been included, or the situation could cause the earlier presentation to leave displayed an audio media component that would normally only be presented to the user in the later presentation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0187","num":"0186"},"figref":["FIG. 34","FIGS. 6 and 7","FIG. 34","FIG. 31","FIG. 34"]},"The computerized processes depicted in  can be blended with the processes described for any of the other flow charts. This  flow chart is intended to depict the computerized steps that cause at least one element of text within the primary body of the article to shift across the electronic display as the associated multimedia control is re-positioned manually or automatically while the user reviews the article. This flow chart helps to explain the computerized processes behind the screenshot displays shown in .","The flow chart in  depicts the computerized steps involved in displaying segments of an article by positioning an electronic headline control that is associated with that same article's headline. For example, multiple news story headlines are retrieved from memory  (also called a computer-useable storage medium) by the processor C utilizing a computer program code. These headlines are then presented on the computer output device  (such as a computer screen). Displayed within or adjacent to each news story headline is an electronic headline control that is able to be positioned by the user to cause the presentation of individual article segments in a separate display, such as a pop-up display. When the computer detects that the user has moved or otherwise activated the electronic headline control for an individual news story headline, a computerized operation is performed that then leads to the separate display of a first new article segment for that particular news story headline. When the computer detects that the user has again moved or otherwise activated that electronic headline control for that same one news story headline, a second computerized operation is performed that then leads to the display of a second new article segment for that particular news story headline. A parallel process will lead to the presentation of additional article segments\u2014or, alternatively, to the presentation of article segments related to the other displayed news story headlines. As well, the computerized operations described above can likewise cause visual images or other supportive media presentations to be displayed and changed alongside the text as the user activates the associated electronic headline control. Lastly, as a variation to the above, the segments of the article can be displayed within the same display as the news story headlines, rather than as a pop-up box or other separate display.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0190","num":"0189"},"figref":["FIG. 37","FIG. 19","FIG. 37","FIG. 37"]},"Finally, the flow chart in  depicts the computerized steps involved in synchronizing the user's review of an advertisement's text with related media content.

To begin, in  an advertisement's current multimedia presentation is retrieved from the computerized memory  by the processor , and then displayed on the computer display device . Presented within or adjacent to the advertisement is a multimedia control that is able to be positioned or otherwise activated by the user to select different segments in the advertisement. When the computer detects that the user has moved or otherwise activated the multimedia control, a computerized operation is performed that then leads to the display of at least one changed component of related media content, where at least one of the changed components includes the continued, modified presentation of the same visual image previously displayed before the user had moved or otherwise activated the multimedia control. Selecting additional elements within the advertisement can alternate as desired between causing complete changes in presenting at least one component of related media content and causing partial changes that lead to the continued, modified presentation of the same related media content. The user's reviewing of different segments of the advertisement can be tracked through a manually manipulated electronic multimedia control or through an automatic tracking multimedia control.","Although the above nine flow charts illustrate several variations, many other combinations are possible, as described in greater depth earlier in this patent application and particularly as clarified in the appended claims.","Several Advantages of the Synchronized Article Computer-Implemented Methods and Computer Program Products","Some advantages of the embodiments and corresponding features shown include creating increased interest in news stories, informational articles, and electronic books by allowing the user to actively interact with the content.","As well, for the first time the user has the opportunity to review a continuous flow of changing images or other related media content corresponding to various segments of text being read by the user on a given subject.","Next, whereas prior news and informational broadcasts of visual images such as videos and photos mainly allow the broadcaster to control the presentation of the content, with the user primarily a passive observer, these synchronized articles put the user completely in control.
