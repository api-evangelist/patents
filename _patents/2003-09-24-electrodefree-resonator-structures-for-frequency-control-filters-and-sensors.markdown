title: Electrode-free resonator structures for frequency control, filters and sensors
abstract: Double-sided, single-sided and ring electrode mesa resonators are provided that operate in the difficult 3 GHZ frequency with an electrode-free resonator area that serves as an energy-trapping area. The double-sided electrode-free resonator device is a double-sided mesa resonator plate, top and bottom wells, a mesa, and top and bottom electrodes deposited in such a way that the electrodes cover the plate surface and surround the mesa, which allows the mesa to protrude above the electrodes and provide an electrode-free resonator area. The top and bottom electrodes, which are acoustically coupled and controlled by acoustic gaps, create an electro-magnetic field and an excitation voltage within a vibrating area of the resonator plate generates an acoustic energy which is trapped within the resonator area and confined to the resonator area to minimize a leakage of the acoustic energy and provide a high Q factor at 3 GHz. The resonator has a resonator frequency determined by a resonator thickness dimension, t, influences the resonator area's ability to function as an active element trapping the acoustic energy. The inventors herein have observed a strong relationship between decreased resonator thickness and motional impedance. Double-sided and single-sided filter devices based on the same principles are also provided.

More particularly, this invention relates to electrode-free mesa resonators.","The quartz crystal is one of the best studied and most behaved of crystals. Its elastic, piezoelectric and temperature properties are well known, and the sets of material constants are very accurate. Hence, numerical analyses of the frequency and frequency-temperature characteristics of quartz resonators have been remarkably accurate. Engineers with years of experience and experimentation usually design stable quartz crystal resonators. However, there is little experience in designing a stable quartz MEMS thickness shear resonator in the frequency range of 3 GHz because the existing conventional resonators will not operate in that frequency range. A 3 GHz resonator will have an electrode to plate thickness ratio of more than 27% and such a high electrode to plate thickness ratio will degrade the temperature behavior, quality, or A, aging and noise of the resonator.","Thus, there has been a long-felt need for a stable quartz resonator in the frequency range of 3 GHz with an electrode to plate thickness ratio of less than 27% that does not degrade the temperature behavior, Q, aging and noise of the resonator. To satisfy the long-felt need for a 3 GHz stable quartz resonator without suffering from the disadvantages, shortcomings and limitations of prior art techniques and devices, it is necessary to provide new electrode and plate structures. The present invention provides double-sided, single-sided and ring electrode mesa resonators that operate in the difficult 3 GHZ frequency with an advantageous and innovative electrode-free resonator area that separates the electrodes from the resonator structure so that the resonator structure serves as an energy-trapping area, without suffering from the disadvantages, shortcomings and limitations of prior art techniques and devices.","It is an object of the present invention to provide an electrode-free 3 GHz resonator by positioning the electrode away from the resonator area.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an electrode-free resonator structure by separating the electrodes from the resonator area by positioning the electrodes away from the resonator so that energy coupling in a vibrating area between the electrodes causes an energy trap for acoustic energy that minimizes energy leakage at the 3 GHz frequency.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide electrode-free mesa resonator structures by separating the electrodes from the resonator area by positioning the electrodes away from the resonator area so that energy coupling in a vibrating area between the electrodes causes an energy trap for acoustic energy that minimizes energy leakage of acoustic energy for a high Q device at the 3 GHz frequency.","These and other objects and advantages are provided by double-sided, single-sided and ring electrode mesa resonators of the present invention, which operate in the difficult 3 GHZ frequency with an advantageous and innovative electrode-free resonator area that serves as an energy-trapping area, without suffering from the disadvantages, shortcomings and limitations of prior art techniques and devices. The double-sided electrode-free resonator device, comprise a double-sided mesa resonator plate, top and bottom wells, a mesa, and top and bottom electrodes deposited in such a way that the electrodes cover the plate surface and surround the mesa, which allows the mesa to protrude above the electrodes and provide an electrode-free resonator area. The top and bottom electrodes, which are acoustically coupled and controlled by acoustic gaps, create an electro-magnetic field and an excitation voltage within a vibrating area of the resonator plate, which generates an acoustic energy which is trapped within the resonator area and confined to the resonator area minimizing acoustic energy leakage and provide a high Q factor at 3 GHz.","In the devices of the present invention, the resonator has a resonator frequency determined by a resonator thickness dimension, t, which influences the resonator area's ability to function as an active element trapping the acoustic energy. The inventors herein have observed a strong relationship between decreased resonator thickness and motional impedance. A stable thickness shear resonator has good energy trapping. The root mean squares (rms) of vibration displacements are employed to characterize the modes of vibration, and the thickness shear mode has a large rms udisplacement in the xdirection, or diagonal axis. Rms displacement may be used to compare the energy trapping of the thickness shear mode as a function of the electrode and plate geometry. A high ratio of the rms displacement in the resonator cavity, including the electrodes, to the rms displacement in the outer structure indicates energy trapping.  are charts illustrating significant aspects of the relationship between decreased resonator thickness and motional impedance in a resonator with a thickness, t, of 1.65 \u03bcm. The ratio of rms displacements is shown in the  graph. The graph is useful for showing resonator dimensions which yield good energy trapping and high Q, such as the length to thickness ratio of 6.25.","For each mode of vibration, the electric flux density Dat the quartz to electrode interface is integrated over the electrode area to yield the electric current according to the formula:\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c9 is resonant frequency in radians per second. For a constant driving voltage, the magnitude of the current is inversely proportional to the motional impedance of the mode. Hence the current as a function of the plate geometry has been employed as a further means for selecting different resonator designs. Modes with zero or small current are not active and may be removed from the frequency spectrum, as is depicted in  graph. Modes having small currents due to charge cancellation or negligible piezoelectric coupling are removed. The FIG. B graph shows the current of the modes as a function of the resonator length to thickness ratio. It should be noted that this graph shows the third anharmonic overtone of thickness shear interacting with the main mode for certain length to thickness ratios (example: 5.9 an 6.5). This unwanted interaction is caused not by spurious modes with the main mode but rather by the coupling of the anharmonic mode with other modes. The coupling changes its motional impedance of that of the main mode. The  graph also shows that since the third anharmonic mode has a lower motional impedance it will tend to vibrate unless prevented from doing so by the external circuitry.  show similar frequency spectra as , however, thickness, t, is now decreased to 1.53 \u03bcm. The  graph shows that reducing the resonator length to thickness ratio can decrease the motional impedance of the main mode. This graph also shows that decreasing the thickness, t, when compared to the  graph can reduce the motional impedance. Thus, a decreased thickness leads to increased coupling with the region under the electrodes, which is disclosed herein as the vibrating area.\n","The double-sided, single-sided and ring electrode electrode-free mesa resonators of the present invention, which operate in the difficult 3 GHZ, may be used in numerous electronics and communications devices, including frequency control devices, filters and sensors.","Referring now to the drawings,  are top, cross sectional and bottom views of the double-sided electrode-free resonator device  in accordance with the present invention.  depicts the top view of the double-sided electrode-free resonator device , comprising a double-sided mesa resonator plate  with a top surface , a top well , a mesa  and a top electrode .
