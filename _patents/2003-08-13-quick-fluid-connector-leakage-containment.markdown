title: Quick fluid connector leakage containment
abstract: A quick fluid connector includes two mating portions. Leakage may occur during mating and demating. In order to contain such leakage, the mating portions of the connector are mounted on the distal end of a projecting boss and at the fundus of a matching well, respectively, so that the boss and well together define a chamber which surrounds the two mating portions of the quick connector. One or more drainage channels are coupled to the chamber to carry away leakage.

The United States Government has a non-exclusive, non-transferable, paid-up license in this invention.","This invention relates to cooling systems, and more particularly to fluid, particularly liquid, cooling systems for electronic equipment, which equipment includes plural replaceable units.","Active antenna arrays have the potential to improve and expand the capability and reliability of commercial and military ground, shipboard, airborne, missile, and space-based radar and communications systems. The primary components and cost drivers of such active array antennas tend to be microwave multi-chip modules incorporating monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) and the power supplies which must be associated with the modules. Such modules are often know as transmit-receive (TR) modules. These primary components or modules are often packaged in assemblies known as line replaceable units (LRUs), which typically incorporate a common mounting plate, control and power conditioning circuitry, and component-to-component interconnects.","The performance and reliability of the TR module and power supply components are directly dependent upon the temperature at which they operate. More specifically, performance is enhanced and reliability is improved when the component temperatures are minimized. It has been found that provision of convection air cooling may not be practical due to the large heat loads and space constraints, which limit the cross-sectional areas of air movement paths. As a result, a common cooling scheme is to connect the structure of the TR module to a liquid-cooled \u201ccold plate,\u201d with component locations and structures designed to reduce the thermal resistance to the cold plate. When the cold plate is itself fluid or liquid cooled, the component locations and structures are designed to reduce the thermal resistance to the coolant.","While the liquid-cooled cold plate provides great advantages insofar as maintaining low component temperatures is concerned, the need for the heat generated by the components to pass through a physical juncture between the LRU and the cold plate still tends to keep the component temperatures higher than may be desired for maximum-performance equipment. The need for maximum performance in conjunction with low operating temperatures has led to the mounting of the heat-generating components directly to the liquid-cooled cold plate, without an intermediary structure. In such an arrangement, the line replaceable unit itself is liquid-cooled. This is a very advantageous system from the point of view of performance and reliability maximization, but may lead to other problems. In particular, the liquid fittings and interconnects which are required to transfer the liquid coolant into and from the LRU imposes limits on the accessibility and therefore maintainability. In particular, when an LRU exhibits degraded performance, it may be desirable to change it out with a properly operating replacement LRU, and the liquid connection fittings and interconnects contribute to the time and effort required to make such a changeover.","The problem associated with the need to disconnect and reconnect liquid coolant paths when working on LRUs or changing over between LRUs has been addressed in the past by the use of liquid quick-connect or quick-disconnect (QD) fittings, which allow rapid connection andor disconnection of the liquid lines. In the context of densely packed equipment, such as is found, for example, in active antenna arrays, packaging requirements may dictate that the liquid quick-disconnect fittings be of the \u201cblind-mate\u201d type, which in principle do not require that the fittings be visible during the disconnection or connection process.","Improved fluid connection arrangements are desired.","An arrangement according to an aspect of the invention is for making fluid connection between a fluid source and a fluid sink. The arrangement comprises a first portion of a mating quick fluid connector coupled to the fluid source, and a second portion of the mating quick fluid connector coupled to the fluid sink, whereby leakage between the first and second portions of the quick fluid connector may occur. This leakage may result from failure of the mated quick connection or from inherent limitations of the quick connector during mating and demating. First and second portions of a mating fluid chamber are provided, each of the first and second portions of the mating fluid chamber being associated with one of the first and second portions of the quick fluid connector. The first and second portions of the mating fluid chamber define the chamber when the first and second portions of the quick fluid connector are mated. The chamber, when the first and second portions of the quick fluid connector are mated, surrounds those portions of the quick fluid connector which are subject to leakage. A fluid channel is coupled to the fluid chamber for providing a path for drainage of the leakage entering the chamber.","In a particular embodiment of the arrangement, the first portion of the quick fluid connector is coaxially mounted at the end of a projecting, circularly cylindrical boss defining an exterior first diameter. The second portion of the quick fluid connector is coaxially mounted at the fundus of a cylindrical aperture having an interior second diameter greater than the first diameter. In one version of this embodiment, the arrangement further comprises at least a first O-ring extending, at a first location, about an exterior surface of the projecting circularly cylindrical boss, and a second O-ring extending, at a second location different from the first location, about the exterior surface of the projecting cylindrical boss.","In a most preferred embodiment, the circularly cylindrical boss projects from a surface of a first structure which is orthogonal to the axis of the boss, and the aperture is defined below a surface of a second structure, which surface is orthogonal to the axis of the aperture.","In one manifestation of this version, a first O-ring is located along the length of the projecting boss, and a second O-ring is located at the juncture of the cylindrical boss and the surface from which it projects.","In any embodiment, the first structure may be a line replaceable electronics module and the second structure a cold plate manifold.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIGS. 1","FIG. 1"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","b","a","a ","b"],"b":["10","1","10","12","14","16","16","16","18","20","18","22"]},"When many of the LRUs  of and are mounted in close proximity, the number of thermal flow paths available for removal of heat from the LRUs is reduced by the presence of other LRUs. Consequently, greater heat must be removed by the remaining paths than would be required if many LRUs were not juxtaposed. Conventionally, fluid cooling is provided, by passing through channels in the cold plate a flow of coolant fluid. Since gases tend to have lower specific heat than liquids, the coolant fluid is most often a liquid, such as water, with or without inhibitors, oil, or the like.

For this purpose, the outer diameter of cylindrical boss  is at least nominally smaller than the inner diameter of well . It will be appreciated that as soon as the distal end of boss  begins to enter well , a closed chamber is defined by the fundus and cylindrical walls of well  in conjunction with the distal end or wall of projecting boss . When this closed chamber is formed by juxtaposition of the boss  and well , the mating halves ,  of the fluid quick connector lie within the closed chamber.","Fluid quick connectors are subject to leakage during connection, disconnection, and possibly due to failure. It is generally undesirable to allow the leaked fluid to flow through the closely packed LRUs, as the fluid may enter an LRU or connections thereto. The presence of a coolant fluid may have undesirable radio-frequency or resistance effects which can adversely and directly affect the performance of the unit. Even after the fluid dries, it may leave a residue which adversely affects the electrical performance. Such leaked coolant may even cause corrosion of critical parts of the LRUs and result in failure.","According to an aspect of the invention, the closed chamber defined by the engagement of the projecting boss  and well  is sealed against leakage. In the embodiment of , this is accomplished by the use of two resilient O-rings. A first O-ring  is placed around the cylindrical portion of projecting boss  near its distal end . This O-ring  is radially loaded when the boss engages the well, and provides a seal between the walls of the well and the boss. An additional O-ring  is placed around the base of projecting boss , and lies against the supporting structure of the boss. In effect, O-ring  lies against orthogonal surface , and, when the two portions ,  are fully engaged, is axially loaded between surface and a corresponding surface annularly disposed around the opening of well  and orthogonal to well axis \u2032.
