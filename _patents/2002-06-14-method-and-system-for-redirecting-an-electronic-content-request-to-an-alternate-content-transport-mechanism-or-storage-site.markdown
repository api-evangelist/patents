title: Method and system for redirecting an electronic content request to an alternate content transport mechanism or storage site
abstract: A method and system are provided for redirecting an electronic content request to an alternate content transport mechanism. Electronic content received from a first transport mechanism, such as a satellite broadcast system, is transmitted to and stored at an end-user content cache. If the user subsequently requests content from an alternate transport mechanism, such as the Internet, a transport proxy server intercepts the request. The transport proxy server compares the URL entered by the user with a database of URLs associated with web site content that has been transmitted to and stored at the user's local content cache via the first transport mechanism. If the content requested by the user is presently stored on the user's local content cache, the user's request is redirected to the device or access application for the first transport mechanism which then retrieves and delivers the requested content from the local storage cache. Needless connection to the Internet web site to obtain the content via the second transport mechanism is avoided.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention is directed to a method and system for redirecting an electronic content request to an alternate content transport mechanism or alternate content storage site.","With the advent of the Internet, individual users, businesses, educational institutions, recreational institutions, and the like request and receive vast amounts of useful and entertaining content from a variety of sources. For example, requests are made over the Internet to web sites provided by news agencies, informational systems, and entertainment systems. Such requests typically include the user entering a uniform resource locator (URL) for the desired web site into an Internet browser application on the user's local computer. The content request travels across the Internet to the specified web site, and the user may then view or download information by pulling that information back across the Internet to the user's local computer.","In recent years, it has become popular for a variety of information content providers, particularly broadcast media providers such as news broadcast organizations, to package content according to the desires of their subscribers and transmit that content via satellite or via cable directly to the user's home, office, school, and the like. Once the information is received at the user's site, the information is stored in a local cache for later review by the user. For example, a user may subscribe to a popular sports news network to have the sports news network broadcast on an hourly basis all news clips pertaining to a given sport, for example basketball, or pertaining to a given sports team. Accordingly, each hour the content subscribed to by the user is packaged by the sports news network and broadcast via satellite or via cable to the user's local computer where it is stored for later review by the user.","Typically, the broadcast organizations that package information for delivery as described above also simultaneously publish that information on an Internet web site operated by each of those organizations. Often, a user logs onto the user's local personal computer and using their Internet browser application enters the URL of an Internet web site to obtain content to which the user has subscribed under the broadcast content mechanism, described above. For example, even if the user has subscribed to a sports news organization to have the sports information for a given sport sent to the user's home on a periodic basis, the user may still enter the URL of the Internet web site of the same sports news organization to receive the identical content that already has been broadcast to the user's home and has been stored for review by the user. Unfortunately, the user may have forgotten that the content the user is now requesting is available on the local cache, or the user may believe that the content the user is requesting is of a newer version or is otherwise different from the content stored on the local cache.","If the user's second content request is provided from the requested web site, the user will receive the identical content already stored on the local cache. Unfortunately, the user will have needlessly tied up the resources, including data link bandwidth and processing time, required to pull the content across the Internet to the user's local computer even though the requested content is already stored locally for access by the user.","It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present invention has been made.","The present invention is directed to a method and system for redirecting an electronic content request to an alternate content transport mechanism. Generally described, according to embodiments of the present invention, electronic content received from a first transport mechanism, such as a satellite broadcast system, is transmitted to and stored at an end-user content cache. If the user subsequently requests content from an alternate transport mechanism, such as the Internet, a transport proxy server intercepts the request. The transport proxy server compares the URL entered by the user with a database of URLs associated with web site content that has been transmitted to and stored at the user's local content cache via the first transport mechanism. If the content requested by the user is presently stored on the user's local content cache, the user's request is redirected to the device or access application for the first transport mechanism which then retrieves and delivers the requested content from the local storage cache. Needless connection to the Internet web site to obtain the content via the second transport mechanism is avoided.","More particularly described, the method and system of the present invention include requesting and receiving content from a first transport mechanism and storing that content in an end user's site. If a user requests content from a second transport mechanism, a determination is made as to whether the requested content is stored at the end user's site. If the requested content is stored at the end user's site, the requested content is accessed from the end user's site in response to the request for the content. The content received from the first transport mechanism may be stored at a local content cache at the end user's site, or the content may be stored at a content cache at a telecommunications system central office site.","When the content is delivered to the end user's site via the first transport mechanism, the content is also stored for delivery to the end user's site via the second transport mechanism. Storage for delivery via the second transport mechanism includes publishing the content on an Internet web site of the provider of the content stored at the end user's site via the first transport mechanism. In addition to storing the information for delivery to the end user's site via the Internet web site of the provider of the content, the provider of the content prepares location information for associating the content sent to the end user's site via the first transport mechanism with content stored for delivery via the second transport mechanism. Location information so prepared is saved to a content management system and includes a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) designating the location of the content via the Internet web site.","Location information provided to the content management system is forwarded to a transport proxy server located at a telecommunications system central office site. When a request is made for content via the second transport mechanism, the request is intercepted by the transport proxy server, and a determination is made as to whether the requested content is stored at the end user's site. The determination includes parsing a database of location information to determine whether the requested content has location information associated with content stored at the end user's site. That is, a determination is made as to whether a URL entered as part of the request for content via the second transport mechanism is associated with a web site containing the same content that has been stored at the end user's site and that is accessible at the end user's site via the first transport mechanism.","If the content requested via the second transport mechanism is already stored at the end user's site via the first transport mechanism, the request for content is redirected back to the end user's site, and the requested content is downloaded from the local content cache at the end user's site. Likewise, if the requested content is already stored at a local content cache at the telecommunications system central office site, the request for information via the second transport mechanism is redirected to the local content cache at the telecommunications system central office site and the content is downloaded to the end user's site for presentation to an end user.","These and other features, advantages, and aspects of the present invention may be more clearly understood and appreciated from a review of the following detailed description of the disclosed embodiments and by reference to the appended drawings and claims.","In the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration of specific embodiments or examples. These embodiments may be combined, other embodiments may be utilized, and structural changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals represent like elements through the several figures, aspects of the present invention and the exemplary operating environment will be described.  is a simplified block diagram showing components of a telecommunications system for providing broadcast media data and Internet-based data to an end-user site. Broadcast media  is representative of any broadcast media organization, such as a news organization or information-content provider, that packages electronic content and transmits that content via satellite  or via cable (not shown) or other suitable transmission protocol to an end-user site  for subsequent review at the end-user site . As illustrated in , the broadcast media is received by a receiver  at the end-user site  for playback via a personal computer  or a television . As should be understood by those skilled in the art, the broadcast media may be played back at the end-user site  using other devices, such as stereo equipment and personal digital assistants. As described in the Background section above, in a typical setting, a broadcast media content provider, such as a news organization, packages clips of requested information, such as news relating to a particular topic and broadcasts that information to the end-user site  on a periodic basis such as hourly, daily or weekly.","Internet media  is representative of Internet-based web sites where electronic content is published by a variety of news organizations, entertainment providers, and general information content providers. Upon the request of an end user at the end-user site , information content is pulled from the Internet media site  across the Internet  and across a data link  to the end-user site . As described above, typically broadcast media organizations and institutions providing information content via the broadcast media  also publish that information on Internet-based web sites operated by those organizations to make the same content available to end users via the Internet media  and Internet . Accordingly, identical information content may be received at the end-user site  via two separate content transports mechanisms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["210","150","200"]},"The information from a number of content providers  is combined or aggregated at the content aggregator  for subsequent transmission via the satellite  or a similarly effective cable system or other transmission system to the end user site . As should be understood by those skilled in the art, the content aggregator  may be in the form of a server system, including a collection of computers, databases, and memory storage units, capable of receiving and aggregating electronic content from a variety of content providers  for subsequent transmission to end users. In a typical environment, content aggregators are particularly useful for distributing audio, video, and multimedia content via satellite , as illustrated in . Once the content is transmitted from the content aggregator  to the end-user site , that information may be stored at the end-user site  for subsequent review by the subscriber to that information.","As illustrated in , the content deposited with the content aggregator  by the content providers  typically is also published on an Internet web site  of the content provider for access by end users at an end-user site  via the Internet . For example, a given sports news network, operating as a content provider , may send to the content aggregator  all sports information related to a given sport, such as basketball, for provision to a subscriber at an end-user site . Likewise, that same sports news network simultaneously may publish the same electronic content to the web site  for access by end users via the Internet .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["250","240","200","210","130","120","220","240","150","150","220","120","150","220","120"]},"The transport proxy server redirects content requests to an alternate transport mechanism by matching a content request intercepted from the end-user site  against a database of content identifiers known to have been stored in the local cache at the end-user site  from an alternate transport mechanism. In order to provide the transport proxy server  with this information, content providers  via the content aggregator  may download to a proxy management system (PMS) the Uniform Resource Locators (URL) associated with Internet web sites  where content already transmitted to the end user site  via a first transport mechanism has been published for retrieval via the Internet . When content is transmitted to end user sites , according to the first transport mechanism and is published on Internet web site  for retrieval via a second transport mechanism, the PMS forwards to the transport proxy server  the URLs associated with the web site locations of that content. Accordingly, when an end user from the end-user site  requests content from a particular web site by typing into the user's Internet browser application a given URL, the transport proxy server  may compare that URL with an index or URLs received from the PMS to determine whether the content associated with the URL entered by the end user has already been received and stored at the end-user site via a different transport mechanism.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["150","160","165","170","160","170"]},"A content cache  is provided for receiving and storing electronic content, including audio, video, and multimedia content, from a broadcast media content provider  via the satellite  and satellite receiver . Likewise, the broadcast content may be received via a cable system or other suitable transport device. A set-top box  is provided for directing content stored on the content cache  to the personal computer  or to a variety of other media devices, such as the television , a stereo system (not shown), a personal digital assistant (not shown), or any other suitable electronic device for receiving and displaying or playing electronic content such as audio, video, or multimedia content. According to a typical embodiment, the set-top box  and content cache  may be integrated as a single device and may be supplied by the content providers  to allow the end users at end-user site  to receive and enjoy the requested content.","Referring still to , the transport proxy server  is located at a telecommunications central office site . As is known to those skilled in the art, telecommunications service providers provide services to a variety of end users via central office sites located among collections of end users for distributing voice and data content from a broader telecommunications network to end users connected to a given central office . According to the present invention, the transport proxy server  is located at the central office  for providing services in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention to the end-user site . The end-user site  is illustrative of a number of end-user sites  that may be connected via voice trunk circuits and data links, such as the data link , to the central office  for providing telecommunication services.","Referring to the central office , the transport proxy server  is a general purpose computing system that provides services to other computers, such as the personal computer  that act as client computers to the transport proxy server . The transport proxy server  includes general purpose computing capabilities, including data processing, data retrieval, data storage, and data transmission. The transport proxy server  includes memory capacity for containing application programs and associated data required for processing content requests received from the personal computer  according to an embodiment of the presents invention. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the transport proxy server  may also save information acquired from elsewhere on the Internet  and make that information available to other computers in the immediate area, such as the personal computer . For example, if several users connect to the same Internet web site  through the transport proxy server , each page of information from the Internet web site  is downloaded from the Internet web site  only once to the transport proxy server and then is provided to all users.","The URL cache database  includes a memory storage system for storing content request information received by the transport proxy server  from the proxy management system . According to an embodiment of the present invention, an index including the uniform resource locators (URL) associated with Internet-based web sites containing electronic content that has been transmitted according to the broadcast media transport mechanism, described above, to the end-user site and stored on the content cache  may be maintained on the database . Paths to content stored in the content cache  may also be maintained on the database .","As illustrated in , the personal computer  at the end-user site  is functionally connected to the transport proxy server  via a data link . The data link  is illustrative of any telecommunications service line capable of carrying data from an Internet web site  across the Internet  to the personal computer  via the transport proxy server . According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the data link  includes a digital subscriber line (DSL) capable of high-speed and high-volume electronic data transmission. Electronic content transmitted from a web site  across the Internet  to the personal computer  is transmitted according to well-known transmission protocols including hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and file transfer protocol (FTP).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3"],"b":["200","210","130","145","240","150","240","240","150"]},"Referring now to , according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the central office  includes a content server  for receiving electronic content via the receiver  from the content providers  via the content aggregator . Once the content server  receives content from the content providers , that content is stored at a content cache  at the central office  for subsequent distribution to end users at end-user sites . The content server  is a general purpose computing system similar to the transport proxy server  for communicating with and providing data to client computers such as the computer  located at the end-user site . A separate data link  such as a DSL line, described above, connects the content server  with the personal computer  of the end user. When the end user desires to review content received from the broadcast media transport mechanism, the client application  directs the personal computer  via the data link  to the content server  which in turn downloads information from the content cache  and transmits the information to the personal computer  for review by the end user.","According to an alternate embodiment of the present invention, when the user of the personal computer  requests information from an Internet web site URL, the transport proxy server  searches the URL cache database  to determine whether the content associated with that URL is already stored on the local central office content cache . If that content is stored locally on the content cache , the transport proxy server  redirects the user's request to the content server , and the content already stored on the content cache  is transmitted to the user via the data link .","Operation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["200","210","150","500","505","510","200","200","210","150"]},"At step , the content subscribed to by the user is transmitted via the transmitter  to the satellite  and to the satellite receiver  at the end-user site . The transmitted content is then directed to the content cache  and is stored for subsequent review by the user.
