title: Kinetic energy training projectile
abstract: A kinetic energy training cartridge simulates the performance, weight, length, and external geometry of a tactical cartridge. The training cartridge includes a cartridge case and a projectile that is secured to cartridge case by means of a sabot. The sabot includes a rearward extension that encapsulates part of the projectile, to add weight and to increase a length to diameter ratio of the projectile, so as to decrease an intrusion volume of the projectile within the cartridge case. In a preferred embodiment, the length to diameter ratio of the projectile is at least 15.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by, or for the Government of the United States for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.","The present invention relates in general to the field of munitions. More specifically, this invention relates to projectiles, and it particularly relates to a low cost, long rod training projectile, having the look and feel of a service projectile.","The Army has a need for realistic, restricted maximum range, low cost training ammunition, also referred to herein as projectile. Training projectiles are procured in quantities that greatly exceed the service projectiles, and they are expended during training at a high rate. Typically, most of the tank training ammunition that is produced in a year is used in training exercises. Although costs vary due to materials used and production rates, the typical cost of a service projectile might range between 1.5 and 14 times that of a training projectile. For this reason, it is necessary that the training projectiles have a very low acquisition cost.","Existing training ammunitions for tanks and other direct fire systems suffer from shortcomings in many areas of physical realism, flight performance, and cost. More specifically, in the case of a 105 mm tank training ammunition, the conventional training projectiles that are used to simulate kinetic energy service rounds have a much different physical profile than the service rounds. This training round cartridge, the M724A1 is much shorter than the corresponding M900 service round. Such difference can cause the soldiers to have a significantly reduced training effectiveness. In addition, since the M724A1 projectile is gyroscopically (spin) stabilized and the service projectile is statically (fin) stabilized, they have significantly different flight characteristics.","In the case of the 120 mm tank training ammunition, the conventional M865PIP training round is significantly shorter than the corresponding M829A2 service round. As a result, such a difference could provide the soldiers with an adverse training environment, both from length and cartridge center of gravity concerns.","What is therefore needed is a realistic, restricted maximum range, low cost training projectile. Prior to the advent of the present invention, the need for such a training projectile has heretofore remained unsatisfied.","The present invention satisfies this need, and describes a realistic, restricted maximum range, low cost training projectile. This training projectile meets several basic requirements, some of which are described herein.","The projectile has a generally similar look and feel as the service projectile, also referred to as a tactical or war projectile. The projectile allows the soldiers to experience the realistic handling of the service projectile during training exercises. The overall projectile weight and its center of gravity, and importantly its length, are as close to the service projectile as possible. Failure to meet this requirement could result in negative training. For example, with a training round cartridge that is shorter than a service round cartridge, the soldier might become used to swinging around the shorter cartridge inside the tank turret during the loading operation. Then, when in time of war, the soldier attempts to swing around and load the service ammunition, he is at risk of damaging the nose tip and rendering the ammunition inoperable.","The present projectile must also perform in flight as closely as possible to the service ammunition, while concurrently having a limited maximum range. The flight performance must match the service projectile so that the soldiers become used to the time of flight to the target, the arc of the trajectory and the crosswind performance of a projectile that is as close as possible to what they will experience with the service round, so that the aiming techniques that they learn will transfer effectively to the use of the service round. The maximum range of the training projectile must be limited so that training may be conducted on training ranges without fear of the projectile exceeding and leaving the training range.","The foregoing and additional features and advantages of the present invention are realized by a flight projectile that generally includes a long rod body and a conical nose. The projectile is stabilized in flight by a conical flare affixed to its aft end, which provides lift for static stability, drag for reduced maximum range, and which, in some embodiments has angled slots in order to induce spin for improved target impact dispersion (TID) performance.","The body of the projectile may, for purposes of center of gravity management or ballasting, be made of differing materials, and may optionally be solid, hollow, or a combination of a solid section(s) and a hollow section(s). Upon assembly into a sabot and a cartridge, the present projectile is designed to have an overall length that approximately equals that of the service cartridge, and a center of gravity that is quite close to that of the service cartridge.","Due to the balanced aerodynamic design of the length to diameter (lid) ratio, the stability margin, spin rate, and drag, the ballistic flight of the projectile, including its arc of trajectory, crosswind performance, target impact dispersion (TID) performance, and limited maximum range, will allow for training that is as close as possible to the service ammunition. This will provide realistic training for the soldiers as they prepare to use the service ammunition in the time of war.","Similar numerals refer to similar elements in the drawings.

Some of these features are presented below.","The weight and length of the overall training projectile  simulate those of the actual tactical projectile  of .","The external geometry of the overall training projectile  simulates or is almost identical to that of the tactical projectile  of .","The design results in accuracy and precision of the training cartridge , which incorporates the projectile , meet the Army's current target impact dispersion requirements.","The conical section  allows for a shorter projectile  to use the same or similar cone design as the M865 cartridge  of , in order to achieve the 8000-meter range should a higher velocity be required on the training cartridge  with high velocity rounds.","Utilizing a kinetic energy aft conical section  allows for cost savings and improved flight stability over, for example, conventional 120 mm tank training rounds.","The training projectile ,  of , , respectively, features a flight projectile with a long rod body , generally but not exclusively with a length to diameter (lid) ratio of 15 or greater, a conical nose  which is typically 14 degrees of half angle, but in practice can range from 1 degree to 45 degrees (blunt face). Alternatively, the nose  may be ogive shaped and may end in a point, a flat, or a nearly flat tip (meplat). The nose-body (, ) assembly is stabilized in flight by a conical flare  that forms part of the aft conical section , which provides lift for static stability, drag for reduced maximum range, and which, in another embodiment, has angled slots , , e.g., that may vary in cant angle typically from 2 degrees to 20 degrees. The cant angle may be set to any angle that is suitable for proper flight performance, in order to induce spin for improved target impact dispersion (TID) performance.","In comparison, the aft section  of the tactical projectile  () has generally a similar length, A, as the length, A\u2032, of the aft section  of the training projectile  (). More specifically, the present embodiment illustrates the length of the aft section  to be approximately 4.26 inches, with the length of the aft section  being approximately 4 inches.","The projectile  has a center of gravity, CG, that is located at a distance B from the tip of the nose . In comparison, the projectile  has a center of gravity, CG\u2032, that is located at a distance B\u2032 from the tip of the nose . More specifically, the present embodiment illustrates the distance B of the center of gravity of the projectile  as being approximately 13.74 inches, while the distance B\u2032 of the center of gravity of the projectile  as being approximately 13.27 inches.","The body or projectile rod  of the training projectile  may, for purposes of center of gravity management or ballasting, be made of differing materials. Alternatively, the internal volume of the projectile rod  may be solid, hollow, or partly solid. In certain embodiments, depending on the performance requirements and other requirements, the conical flare , may be a fin assembly of two or more blades. The conical flare  will typically have a half angle from approximately 10 degrees to 30 degrees; however, in practice, it may be designed with half angles ranging from approximately 1 degree to 45 degrees (a blunt flare).","While the overall length, C, of the illustrated tactical projectile  is approximately 27.98 inches, the corresponding training projectile  has an overall length, C\u2032, is approximately 22.94 inches.","With further reference to , it illustrates a training cartridge  that incorporates the training projectile  of , according to the teaching of the present invention. Preferably, the training cartridge  includes the following components: a cartridge case , a case adapter  that encapsulates propellant , a case base and seal , and a primer , that are similar to corresponding components of the conventional training cartridge  (M865) of . This similarity minimizes the impact on production cost and time. In addition, the conical flare  may be used in place of the fins , should a high drag projectile be needed.","When the projectile  is assembled into its sabot  and case adapter , it is designed to have an overall length approximately equal to the corresponding service cartridge, and a center of gravity very close to that of the service cartridge. Due to its carefully balanced aerodynamic design including the 11d ratio, stability margin, spin rate and drag, its ballistic flight, including the arc of trajectory, crosswind performance, TID, and limited maximum range will allow for training that is as close as possible to the use of the service ammunition. This will provide realistic training for the soldiers as they prepare to use the service ammunition.","The overall training cartridge  may make use of one or more features pertinent to the present invention. These may include the use of various propellants, such as LOVA, M14, M1, or other suitable propellants. The cartridge case  may be made of brass, steel, aluminum, any combustible, or any other suitable material, such that the performance and safety requirements are achieved. A tracer, which is typically embedded in the conical flare , may be made of various chemical mixtures or may use electronic devices such as LCDs (liquid crystal display devices) or other means to provide visibility of the flight path to the tank crew, though not all embodiments may employ this feature.","A variety of available or suitable clip designs that hold the cartridge case base  to the cartridge adapter , may be used. The nose , body projectile rod , and conical flare  of the projectile  may be made of steel, aluminum, or any other suitable metal or material such as plastic, or combination thereof, which will provide for the correct mechanical and flight performance. Various fabrication techniques such as, but not limited to extrusion, machining from bar stock, casting, and molding may be used for any of the components of the training cartridge . These components may also be of new manufacture, or to keep cost low, may be of recycled components used \u201cas-is\u201d or with modification from demilitarized ammunition items. The design of the training projectile  is not limited by size, it may be adapted for use in weapons typically from 25 mm to 140 mm, but may be used in weapons of any caliber.","The weight of the training cartridge  has been increased from the conventional training cartridge . This is achieved by a longer and heavier sabot , a heavier case base , or a case base and seal assembly . Known or available sabots can be used provided they satisfy the weight and length requirements. An exemplary known sabot  comprises three petals that have standard kinetic energy threads and\/or buttress grooves that support the projectile rod  upon gun launch. The sabot petals are discarded after gun launch, and come apart in the air stream, allowing the in-flight projectile (i.e., projectile rod  and the aft section ) to continue down-range toward the target. The sabot  is rendered heavier by adding a rear extension  that extends rearwardly, to a closer proximity to the conical flare , thus providing added stability and decreasing the intrusion distance or volume.","Due to the fact that the projectile  is partially encapsulated in the sabot , the projectile rod  can now be shorter than, and have a smaller outer diameter than the training projectile  of the training cartridge  of . This provides a low mass in-flight projectile, i.e., less than 3 lbs, that has enough momentum to fly accurately to the 3000- to 4000-meter targets, but will not fly past the 8000-meter limit at a 10 degree gun elevation due to lack of momentum.","The shorter projectile rod  will have a significantly greater velocity than the projectile  of the training cartridge  of , for the same type of propellant (i.e., M14) and charge weight of propellant if an aluminum sabot  were used. This allows less M14 propellant to be used in the training cartridge , reducing the overall cost of production. If a steel sabot  were used, then the training cartridge  will have a similar amount of propellant to the training cartridge  of , but cost saving is achieved by using a steel sabot instead of an aluminum sabot .","Additionally, because the in-flight projectile rod  is partially encapsulated in the sabot , it will not be subject to differential pressures (-dp), and thus will not have bending problems that most kinetic energy projectile rods have which cause accuracy problems in-flight.","The present training cartridge  of  achieves a decreased intrusion distance or volume as compared to the cartridges  and  of , respectively. As the fins  or flare  extend rearward toward the primer  or , it displaces the propellant inside the cartridge. Such displacement constitutes an undesirable feature because it minimizes the space available for the propellant and thus a higher energetic propellant needs to be used in order to compensate for the displaced volume and to obtain the same or similar performance. The higher energetic propellants are generally costlier than the corresponding lower energetic propellants.","With reference to , the conical flare  is remotely located relative to the primer , as compared with the fins  or flare  relative to the primer  or . As a result, the intrusion distance\/volume of the cartridge  is more economical than the cartridges  and  because it requires a less energetic propellant to achieve the same or similar performance as the tactical projectile. Decreased intrusion distance or volume is achieved because the flared stabilizer or conical flare  provides static stability without the need to extend rearward toward the primer .","It should be understood that other modifications may be made to the present design without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above and other features of the present invention and the manner of attaining them, will become apparent, and the invention itself will be best understood, by reference to the following description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
