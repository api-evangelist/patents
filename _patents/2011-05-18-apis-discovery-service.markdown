Field","This field is generally related to managing access to metadata related to application programming interfaces (APIs).","2. Related Art","Application programming interfaces (APIs) are used in software engineering to help define ways to access and communicate with software programs. For example, an application programming interface (API) may define a particular set of rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other. APIs may allow an interface between different software programs and facilitate their interaction, similar to the way the user interface facilitates interaction between humans and computers.","An API may be created for applications, libraries, operating systems, etc., as a way of defining their \u201cvocabularies\u201d and resources request conventions (e.g. function calling conventions). An API may include specifications for routines, data structures, object classes and protocols used to communicate between the consumer program and the implementer program of the API.","APIs may act as abstractions that describe an interface for the interaction with a set of functions used by components of a software system. The software providing the functions described by an API is said to be an implementation of the API.","The term \u201cAPI\u201d may be used to refer to a complete interface, a single function, or even a set of APIs provided by an organization. Thus, the scope of meaning is usually determined by the context of usage.","Past approaches such as Web Services Description Language (WSDL) have used technology such as XML (eXtended Markup Language) to represent interfaces between various web services and APIs. However, alternative technologies such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) offer efficient and effective ways to represent and transmit metadata about APIs in machine-readable formats that can facilitate development of client libraries, IDE plugins, and other tools for interacting with APIs. Moreover, other formats and protocols may facilitate uses of APIs in new and flexible ways.","Embodiments relate to managing metadata related to APIs. For example, embodiments provide an APIs Discovery Service that exposes machine readable metadata about APIs, enabling users to build client libraries, IDE plugins, and other tools that interact with these APIs.","Present approaches have not yet taken full advantage of the potential ability to facilitate and automate interactions with APIs by representing metadata related to the APIs in a standardized machine-readable format and accessing the metadata by using a network protocol.","In a first embodiment, a computer-implemented method is provided for managing access to metadata related to application programming interfaces (APIs). A request is received for metadata, at a server, related to a supported API from an API client. Next, an API directory data repository is searched, at the server, to find the directory entry corresponding with the supported. API. Finally, a discovery document is retrieved from the directory data repository at the server, based on information from the directory entry, that contains machine-readable metadata related to the supported API.","In a second embodiment, a system manages access to metadata related to APIs. The system includes one or more processors, configured to receive a request for metadata at a server related to a supported API from an API client. The system further includes a directory data repository, configured to store directory entries and discovery documents at the server. The system also includes a directory data searching unit, configured to search the directory data repository at the server to find the directory entry corresponding with the supported API. The system finally includes a discovery document retrieval unit, configured to retrieve a discovery document from the directory data repository at the server, based on information from the directory entry, that contains machine-readable metadata related to the supported API.","In a third embodiment, a computer readable storage medium has instructions stored thereon that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the processors to execute the method for managing metadata related to APIs as described above.","Further embodiments, features, and advantages of the invention, as well as the structure and operation of the various embodiments of the invention are described in detail below with reference to accompanying drawings.","The drawing in which an element first appears is typically indicated by the leftmost digit or digits in the corresponding reference number. In the drawings, like reference numbers may indicate identical or functionally similar elements.","In the detailed description of embodiments that follows, references to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201can embodiment\u201d, \u201can example embodiment\u201d, etc., indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it is submitted that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to effect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"The diagram of  illustrates a computer system  that contains a combination of hardware, software, and firmware constituent parts that allow it to execute Web browser  in an application layer  with access to the Web over a network  via a network connection .

In an exemplary embodiment, directory entries  and discovery documents  are transmitted in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format and are accessed by network requests. However, other data representation formats that provide access to structured information may be used in various embodiments.","In order to make the network requests, in one embodiment API client  may employ, in applications layer , a discovery document retrieval unit , which operates in conjunction with directory data searching unit  to search directory data repository  to retrieve information including directory entries  and discovery documents  from server . The network requests may be made by directory document retrieval unit , directory data searching unit , and directory data repository via network connection  and network . The format and contents of directory entries  and discovery documents  are discussed in greater detail in conjunction in , below.","Discovery document retrieval unit  may further operate in tandem with a client library building unit  at applications layer  to produce custom client libraries based on the discovery document. This process is discussed in greater detail, below.","Each of the constituent parts of a system embodiment may be implemented on any computer system .

Likewise, modules or instructions that constitute operative parts of embodiments may utilize any type of structured memory, including a persistent memory. In examples, each data storage infrastructure may be implemented as a relational database.","It should be noted that computer-readable medium embodiments may include any physical medium which is capable of encoding instructions that may subsequently by used by a processor to implement methods described herein. Example physical media may include floppy discs, optical discs (e.g. CDs, mini-CDs, DVDs, HD-DVD, Blu-ray), hard drives, punch cards, tape drives, flash memory, and memory chips. However, any other type of tangible, persistent storage that can serve in the role of providing instructions to a processor may be used to store the instructions in these embodiments.","Each of the information storage parts of the computer system  may be stored in any type of structured memory, including a persistent memory. In examples, such a persistent memory may be implemented as a database, including a relational database.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","250","200"]},"Stage  includes receiving, by a server, a request for metadata related to a supported API from an API client. For example, a request for metadata may be received at server  from computer system .","Stage  includes searching an API directory data repository, by the server, to find the directory entry corresponding with the supported API. Stage  may be performed, in an exemplary embodiment, by directory data searching unit , accessing directory entries  within directory data repository  on server  via network connection  over network .","Stage  includes retrieving a discovery document from the directory data repository by the server, based on information from the directory entry, that contains machine-readable metadata related to the supported API.

It facilitates automatic, easy approaches to accessing metadata by clients of the APIs. This accessing of metadata is discussed further in , below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","310","310","312","312","312","312","312"]},"APIs A-E are accessed by an API discovery service . As discussed below, API discovery service  may access metadata from API infrastructure  to provide information about API configuration . The information about API configuration  is processed to allow service access . Clients are allowed service access. Example clients, which may utilize API metadata management tool  in a variety of embodiments, include an APIs explorer A, APIs client libraries B, a plug-in for IDE (Integrated Development Environment)  C, and a plug-in for IDE  D. These clients process metadata related to APIs to be used in various software engineering applications.","In general, information about API infrastructure  is stored in directory data repository  at server . Directory data repository includes directory entries  and discovery documents  that pertain to specific APIs, such as, for example, sharing API A or Location API B. APIs discovery service  operates by the operation of discovery document retrieval unit , and provides information to API client . API client  may correspond with example clients A-D as discussed above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"As can be seen in , a directory entry  may include a name , a version , a title , a description , a link to a discovery document , links to icons , a link to documentation , labels , and preferred status .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"As can be seen in , discovery document  may include directory information  (as provided in ), the path to the API root , a discovery document protocol , authentication details , a listing of schemas for all API requests and responses , a list of top-level methods in the API , a list of all API resources and methods available on those resources , additional information about each method , and a listing of specialized API features .","Various embodiments provide for various additional features that help define and extend the capabilities of certain embodiments. For example, in exemplary embodiments the directory entries  and discovery documents  may be transmitted in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). While other machine-readable metadata storage formats exist, such as XML, JSON can be easily and efficiently parsed, and is thus a good choice to store the metadata. Also, the APIs themselves use JSON. However, it should be noted that embodiments are not limited to JSON, and other formats and protocols may be used.","Additionally, directory entries  may store a link to the discovery document . Such a link may be used to access the discovery document  that corresponds with a discovery entry  in directory data repository .","When accessing the directory and the discovery document, the requests may be made using HTTPS. HTTPS characterizes the interaction between API client  and directory data repository , discovery document retrieval unit , and directory data searching unit  that provide it with information. As noted above, this interaction via network connection  over network  may transmit information in JSON format. Moreover, because the connection is made with HTTPS, the connection is secure, helping to protect the security and session integrity for API client . However, other network protocols may be used in various embodiments, depending on the configuration of network connection  and network .","As discussed in , the discovery document  may include a variety of information. It should be noted that specific embodiments specifically include specific information in discovery document . For example, discovery document  may include a list of API-specific properties , authentication information for the API , information about the resources provided by the API , or information about the methods provided the API . As discussed below, in certain exemplary embodiments information may be stored in key-value format, such as the key-value format provided by JSON.","Another feature of certain embodiments is that embodiments may provide for building a custom client library based on the discovery document. Such building may be carried out by a custom client library building unit , which may be integrated into discovery document retrieval unit  and base the custom client library on discovery document  within directory data repository .","Embodiments are intended for developers who want to write client libraries, IDE plugins, and other tools for interacting with APIs. The APIs Discovery Service allows a user to accomplish all of these tasks by exposing machine readable metadata about other APIs through a simple API.","In certain exemplary embodiments, calls to the API are unauthenticated, JSON-based, network requests that use SSL, i.e. URLs begin with https. However, embodiments may use other protocols for information transmission, storage, and retrieval based upon the configuration of the embodiments, as long as the protocols provide sufficient functionality for API clients .","Example Data Format","JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a common Internet format that provides a simple method of representing arbitrary data structures. JSON is a text format that is completely language-independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C# Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. However, various embodiments may use other data formats for representing the metadata for the APIs, as long as they provide functionality that is comparable to that described for JSON, below.","APIs Discovery Service Concepts","The APIs Discovery Service is built upon two basic concepts:","Directory of Supported APIs is a list of all APIs that are supported by the APIs Discovery Service. Directory entries  are stored on server .","Discovery Document is a machine readable description of a particular API. Discovery documents  are stored on server .","Directory of Supported APIs","The APIs Directory can be accessed by discovery document retrieval unit  by executing an unauthenticated HTTP GET request. An example of the HTTP request, in an exemplary JSON-based embodiment, is","GET https:\/\/www.googleapis.com\/discovery\/v1\/apis","However, other protocols may be used as discussed above, and other web addresses may be used for other API Directories as applicable.","The response includes information related to an API Directory.

The Discovery document  is built around the concept of resources. Each Discovery document  has a top-level resources section that groups all the resources associated with the API. For example, the URL Shortener API has a url resource.","Depending on the setup of specific embodiments, the format and contents of the resources section may differ appropriately, so long as there is similar functionality. Inside each resource section are the methods associated with that resource. For example, in a JSON embodiment, URL Shortener API C has three methods associated with the url resource: get, list and insert.","Schemas describe what the resources in an API look like. Each Discovery document  has a top-level schemas section, which contains a name-value pair of schema ID to object. Schema IDs are unique per API, and are used to uniquely identify the schema in the methods section of the Discovery document .","In an exemplary embodiment, APIs Discovery Service uses JSON Schema draft  to represent schemas. Fois a snippet of the JSON Schema for the Url resource, along with an actual response resource. The following is provided as being illustrative only.

APIs Discovery Service may be used for building a variety of different tools to use with APIs. However, one purpose of the Discovery document  is to power the creation of client libraries in various programming languages. This section discusses how one could go about building a custom client library for APIs.","A stable and feature-complete client library is a complicated tool that can take months to develop. However, the general instructions for building a simple client library for APIs can be broken down to three simple steps:","1. Fetching the Discovery document  and constructing API surface","2. Composing a request","3. Making a call and fetching the response","These steps are reviewed in more detail in the following sections.","Step 1: Fetching the Discovery Document  and Constructing API Surface","When beginning to implement a client library there are some decisions up front that can guide a developer down a path. A programming language of choice may be either typed or untyped, and if is typed it could be either statically or dynamically typed. The programming language may be compiled or interpreted. Those decisions will guide a developer on how the developer consumes and uses the Discovery document .","At this point a developer has to fetch the Discovery document , and based on the developer's answers to the above questions the developer will have a strategy for when the document is to be fetched. In a strongly statically compiled language the developer will want to fetch the Discovery document  early in the process and from there generate code to specifically handle the API that is described by the Discovery document . For a strongly-typed language that could mean doing code generation and building a compiled library. For a dynamically typed language the creation of the programming structures to interface to the API can be lazily constructed on the fly as the programming surface is used.","Step 2: Composing a Request","Composing a requests involves two separate steps:","1. Composing the request body","2. Constructing the request URL","The request body, if any, should be converted from a language appropriate representation into the correct wire format. For example, in a Java client library there may be a class for each request type that allows type-safe manipulation of the request data and is serializable into JSON.","The construction of the request URL is a slightly more complicated process.","The path property of each method in the API uses URI Template v04 syntax. This property may contain variables, which are surrounded by curly braces. By way of illustration, here is an example of a path property with variables:","\/example\/path\/{var}","The var is a variable. The value for this variable comes from the Discovery document's parameters section. Each variable name has a corresponding value in the parameters object. In the example above, there will be a parameter named var in the parameters section (and its location property will be path, to indicate that it is a path variable).","When making a request, the value for var should be substituted into the url. For instance, continuing the example above, if the user of the library sets var to the value foo, the new url will be \/example\/path\/foo.","Also note that the path property is a relative URI. In order to calculate the absolute URI, a developer should follow these steps:","1. Start with the absolute URI of the Discovery document . In the URL Shortener C example, the Discovery document  is retrieved from (as a sample network request):","https:\/\/www.googleapis.com\/discovery\/v1\/apis\/urlshortener\/v1\/rest","2. Grab the basePath property from the top-level of the Discovery document . The basePath property may be either an absolute or relative URI. If it is a relative URI, combine it with the URI from step #1. In the URL Shortener C example, the basePath property is:\n\n\/urlshortener\/v1\/\n\nWhen combined with step #1, the URI would be (continuing the example):\n\nhttps:\/\/www.googleapis.com\/urlshortener\/v1\/v1\/\n\n3. Grab the path property, expand it as a URI Template, and combine the results of that expansion with the URI from step #2. In the URL Shortener C example for the get method, the path is url, so the full URI for the method would be (continuing the example):\n\nhttps:\/\/www.googleapis.com\/urlshortener\/v1\/url\n\nStep 3: Making a Call and Fetching the Response\n","Once the request is sent the response should be deserialized into the appropriate language representation, taking care to handle error conditions that could occur, both in the underlying HTTP transport and error messages generated from the API service. The errors follow a standardized format.","The best way to learn how to use the APIs Discovery Service is by looking at some examples.","Simple APIs Client","Below is an example of a very simple client library written in Python. The client builds an interface for interacting with the URL Shortener API C, then shortens a URL using that interface.","The code below is a significantly simplified version of a typical client library. It is an incomplete implementation that is provided to demonstrate some aspects of building a client library. It is not production ready code.","It should be noted that the Python code is simply designed to illustrate a sample use case for building a client library. Actual use cases may vary from language to language and from API. The following code is merely included so as to illustrate how embodiments may process metadata to build a client library. Following the code, commentary discussing the steps followed in the code is provided to clarify the approach taken to build a client

Finally a request is sent to the composed URL using the HTTP method specified in the Discovery document .\n\nStep 3.a: Build client surface\n\nThe client surface is built by recursively descending over the parsed Discovery document . For each method in the methods section a new method is attached to the Collection object. Because collections can be nested we look for resources and recursively build a Collection object for all of its members if one is found. Each nested collection is also attached as an attribute to the collection object.\n\nStep 3.b: Using the Client\n\nThis demonstrates how the built API surface is used. First a service object is built from the Discovery document , then a new URL is shortened via URL Shortener API C by inserting a long URL into the url collection.\n","Thus, embodiments incorporate a variety of features in new and advantageous ways. Embodiments provide for easily and conveniently managing API metadata by using standardized technologies such as JSON and HTTPS. Thus, it becomes easy for clients to access features related to APIs. For example, it is easy to build client libraries based on APIs because the information is stored in a standardized manner. APIs can be explored as well, or used as plug-ins in IDEs. Because APIs have metadata stored in similar ways, different APIs can provide for similar applications and usage techniques.","The Summary and Abstract sections may set forth one or more but not all exemplary embodiments of the present invention as contemplated by the inventor(s), and thus, are not intended to limit the present invention and the appended claims in any way.","The present invention has been described above with the aid of functional building blocks illustrating the implementation of specified functions and relationships thereof.
