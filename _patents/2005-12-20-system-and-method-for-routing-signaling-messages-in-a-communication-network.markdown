{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION","BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention relates generally to communication networks and, more particularly, to a system and method for routing signaling messages in a communication network.","Referring to , there is shown a schematic diagram of a packet-telephony network, also called an Internet Protocol (IP) network . Network  may comprise, for example, a fiber layer  such as that currently provided by Level 3 Communications, Inc. to drive voice and IP-VPN services on. More particularly, fiber layer  is used generally to transport IP packets, and more specifically, to transport voice on top of an IP layer.","Communication network  includes one or more computing devices which may be used by a calling party to initiate a voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) call. Such devices, when used alone, or in combination with other devices as discussed below, function to convert analog audio signals into digital data packets that can be transmitted efficiently over the Internet. Commonly used computing devices include, for example, IP SoftPhones , analog telephone adapters , and IP phones . As those skilled in the art are aware, IP SoftPhones  (also called PC SoftPhones) generally comprise one or more application programs resident on a computer. Such applications and services are currently commercially available, for example, from Skype\u00ae, Net2Phone\u00ae, AOL\u00ae, Yahoo\u00ae and many other service providers. When used in conjunction with a microphone, speakers and a sound card, the above applications permit a general purpose computer to initiate and receive VoIP calls. Analog telephone adapters (ATA's)  (also called terminal adapters) provide the simplest and most common entry point for VoIP service. ATA's  allow users to connect a standard analog telephone to a computer or Internet connection such as a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) modem, cable modem, etc. ATA's function as analog to digital converters which take analog signals from traditional telephones and convert the same into digital packets for transmission over the Internet. Many VoIP providers bundle ATA's free with their service. Finally, IP phones  are specialized telephones that look and function to the user as normal telephones with a handset, cradle and buttons. But instead of having standard RJ-11 phone connectors, RJ-45 Ethernet connectors are provided. IP phones  include all the necessary hardware and software to generate the required digital data packets. IP phones  may connect directly to a router through a wired connection or, in the case of Wi-Fi, through a wireless connection. Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phones are exemplary IP phones in common use today.","As those skilled in the art will recognize, SIP is a general purpose application-layer control protocol (signaling protocol) which was developed and designed within the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). The specification for SIP is available in the form of several requests for comments (RFC's), the most important of which is RFC 3261. RFC 3261 contains the core protocol specification for creating, modifying and terminating sessions with one or more participants. In the case of VoIP, the protocol initiates call set-up, call authentication, call termination and other communication features to endpoints i.e. user agents within an IP domain. SIP is meant to make communication possible. The communication itself (the sounds that are digitized), however, must be achieved by other means (and possibly another protocol). Two protocols that may be used along with SIP are Real Time Transport Protocol (RTP) and Session Description Protocol (SDP). RTP is used to carry real-time multi-media (including audio, video and text) and makes it possible to encode and split the data into packets and transport such packets over the Internet. SDP is similarly used to describe capabilities of session participants. The description is then used to negotiate the characteristics of the session so that all the end devices can participate.","Significantly, SIP is an end-to-end oriented signaling protocol in that all the logic is stored in end devices (with the exception of routing SIP messages as discussed below). State is also stored in end-devices such that there is no single point of failure. This end-to-end design is a significant divergence from the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) where all the state and logic is stored in the network and the end devices\u2014plain old telephone service (POTS) telephones\u2014are primitive. Although SIP is the most commonly used protocol for VoIP applications, it is not the only available or applicable signaling protocol for these applications. Other suitable protocols include, for example, H.323 created by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) specifically for video conferencing, as well as Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP).","Network  further includes a plurality of entry or edge devices  which function, in accordance with the signaling protocol used, to recognize voice calls (as opposed to data calls) and provide the required interface to and from network . In the SIP protocol, for example, such edge devices are referred to generally as edge proxy servers (EPS's). Edge proxy servers are further provided in communication with the SIP core network  and, more particularly, with a core proxy server (CPS) . As shown, CPS  provides an entry point to the core network  and includes the intelligence for determining how and where to route voice calls.","Referring still to , IP network  may be provided in communication with a PSTN network  via a gateway device  and media gateway controller (MGC)  which together function to convert the Signaling System No. 7 (SS7) and time division multiplexed (TDM) analog signals of the PSTN to SIP and digital data packets and vice versa. PSTN network  is, of course, provided in communication with one or more POTS telephones  via a network of central offices and serving circuit based switches such as Class 5 switches  which are well known to those skilled in the art. Although not shown, network  may similarly be provided in communication with other suitable wired or wireless networks either directly via a suitable gateway device or indirectly via the PSTN.","The aforementioned devices that are internal to network , i.e. edge proxy servers, core proxy server, media gateway controllers, etc. are referred to generally in the art as \u201cSoftswitches\u201d in that they are often logical entities comprising software running on general purpose computing platforms and may be co-located. Regardless of the physical location, these entities together function to independently process and route signaling messages through the network.","Signaling messages in an IP network are generally managed by the core network  and, more particularly, by a routing module  provided in communication with CPS . Although the determination of \u201chow\u201d to process such messages is generally defined and effected by the applicable signaling protocol, e.g. SIP, the initial determination of \u201cwhere\u201d to route such messages (which edge device) has been left to design choice. Heretofore, conventional systems have utilized hard coded and proprietary routing logic (static sets of process instructions) in conjunction with routing tables stored in relational databases to accomplish this task. Such systems may be understood from a logic flow perspective as comprising multiple layers of \u201cif else\u201d statements which function to handle every call in a prescribed manner based on defined logic. As readily seen, however, such systems may often be wasteful of network resources and time consuming and expensive to update as any changes in the logic require corresponding changes, tests and redeployment of the involved software.","Consequently, a need has developed for an improved system and method for receiving and intelligently routing signaling messages in a communication network such as an IP network. Such a system should utilize standardized data structures and be dynamically loadable and highly scalable so as to minimize network resources and be quickly and easily updated as new products and services become available.","It is a principal object of the present invention to provide an improved system and method for routing signaling messages in a communication network.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an improved proxy server for receiving and forwarding such messages in an IP network.","Still further, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved route engine module for receiving and routing SIP signaling messages in an IP network.","Yet still further, it is an object of the present invention to provide such a route engine module which utilizes independent and dynamically loadable and linkable route nodes wherein the routing logic is encoded as standardized data structures.","In carrying out these and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention, there is provided an improved proxy server for receiving and forwarding signaling messages in a communication network such as, for example, an IP network. The proxy server comprises a route engine having a plurality of dynamically loadable route trees each configured in advance or \u201con the fly\u201d and provisioned for use in accordance with a corresponding network service. Each route tree further comprises one or more route nodes each encoded with logic in accordance with a standardized set of rules for designing data files, such as, for example, a text format, to independently carry out processing. Each such node is directed to a specific small task and, accordingly, may be separately and independently queried by the route engine to provide a separate response.","In further carrying out the above objects, features and advantages of the present invention, there is provided an improved method for determining where to route signaling messages in a communication network. The method is directed for use with a network host such as, for example, a core proxy server in an IP network which functions to receive and forward SIP signaling messages to and from edge proxy servers, gateway devices, and\/or gateway controllers. The method comprises providing a route engine in communication with the network host. As indicated above, the route engine comprises a plurality of route trees each pre-built or dynamically configurable and provisioned for use in accordance with a corresponding network service. Each route tree further comprises one or more route nodes each encoded with logic represented in a standardized data file format such as, for example, Extensible Markup Language (XML), to independently carry out required processing for the service. In keeping with the invention, each route node is directed to a specific small task and may be separately and independently queried by the route engine to provide a separate response. Because the logic in any given node will not affect the logic in another, route trees may be easily configured, reconfigured, deleted, etc. and dynamically loaded in the route engine as new services and enhancements become available. The method further comprises receiving a route request message at the network host, abstracting from the message the applicable network service, and determining or configuring the corresponding route tree. Still further, the method comprises traversing the route tree (and its corresponding route nodes) to carry out the required processing for the network service. Finally, the method comprises returning a route response message to the network host in accordance with the results of the processing.","The above objects, features, and advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals correspond to like components.","At the threshold, it is to be understood that the system and method of the present invention is directed for use in any suitable communication network wherein a routing determination is required for signaling messages among network host devices. In a preferred embodiment, as disclosed herein, such a network comprises a packet-telephony network (IP network) and the network host devices are proxy servers which communicate utilizing the SIP signaling protocol. The following detailed description is accordingly provided for exemplary purposes and not intended to limit the scope of the invention to any specific network architecture, host device, signaling protocol or data structure.","Referring again to  of the drawings, an IP network is shown and designated generally by reference numeral . As indicated above, a plurality of computing devices  are provided in communication with network  and, more particularly, the \u201csoftswitch\u201d architecture which comprises one or more edge proxy servers which communicate with and terminate in the core network . The core network, also called a core proxy server system, includes a core proxy server  which functions to receive, process and forward SIP messages to and from edge devices such as edge proxy servers  and media gateway controllers  as shown generally in .","The Core Network (Core Proxy Server System)","A CPS system is a logical concept, which is comprised of either one type or two types of physically and functionally different SIP proxy servers. These two types of SIP proxy servers are (a) stateful; and (b) stateless. The state within the SIP context refers to a SIP transaction state. A SIP transaction occurs between a client and a server and comprises all messages from the first request sent from the client to the server up to a final response sent from the server to the client. If the request is INVITE and the final response is a non-2xx, the transaction also includes an ACK to the response.","Internet endpoints (edge devices) that use the SIP signaling protocol to find one another and to negotiate a \u201csession\u201d are called user agents. User agents may further be referred to as user agent \u201cservers\u201d and user agent \u201cclients\u201d. These are logical entities and each endpoint contains a client and a server. The client is the part of the user agent that sends requests and receives responses. The server is the part of the user agent that receives requests and sends responses. For example, a calling party's user agent functions as a client when it sends an INVITE request and receives responses. Similarly, a called party's user agent functions as a server when it receives the INVITE request and sends responses. However, if the called party elects to send a BYE and terminate the session, the situation changes. Now, the called party's user agent (which sent the BYE) functions as a client and the calling party's user agent functions as a server. As seen, a stateful proxy server maintains a transaction state during the initial call setup, and has the capability to do intelligent routing based on service logic and routing data provisioned by customer tools.","A stateful proxy server comprises two major subsystems: (a) a SIP proxy server subsystem which processes SIP messages according to the standard SIP protocol; and (b) a routing engine subsystem which performs an intelligent routing service. The intelligent routing in the present invention is provided by routing engine subsystem  as discussed in detail below.","Stateless proxy servers are generally simple message forwarders which forward messages independent of one another. They can be used as load balancers, message translators and routers. In operation, a stateless SIP proxy server hashes the call ID of each incoming SIP message and uses the hash value to index the outbound proxy servers. Using this hashing mechanism, a stateless proxy server will send all messages with the same call ID to the same outbound proxy server, which is required by a stateful proxy server in order to function correctly when the outbound proxy server is a stateful proxy server. Although messages are usually arranged into transactions as indicated above, stateless proxies do not take care of transactions. Accordingly, stateless proxy servers are high performance systems because they only perform minimal processing tasks.","Stateful proxy servers, in contrast, are far more complex. Upon reception of a request, stateful proxies create a state and keep the state until the transaction finishes. Because stateful proxies have the ability to associate SIP messages into transactions they can perform complex actions including accounting and forking (the ability to send a SIP request to multiple SIP addresses and return the responses to the sender).","The general architecture of a CPS system which may be implemented in accordance with the present invention is shown and described in . Two stateless proxy servers  working in hot standby mode are provided in communication with 3 stateful proxy servers . At any time, only one stateless proxy server  handles all the traffic and load balances across all the three stateful proxy servers . The other stateless proxy server sits idle and will take all the traffic when the first stateless proxy server is down. Such hot standby capability can be provided by any suitable software such as, for example, GateD. In operation, the stateful proxy server  will dynamically register with its stateless proxy server. A timing or heartbeating mechanism within the stateless proxy server will further dynamically keep track of the availability of each registered stateful proxy server . The stateful proxy server will be removed from an available list by its stateless proxy server when it is down and added to an available list when it is up.","Stateful SIP Proxy Server",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["38","40","42","44","46","46","34","46","50","46","52","34","52","44","54"]},"Stateless SIP Proxy Server",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["36","38","36","36","40","42","56","58","54"]},"Route Engine","A route engine is a subsystem to find out all possible route choices and the associated costs within the network (here the SIP voice network) based on information in a route request. A route request comprises information extracted from a SIP request message, normally an initial SIP INVITE request message of a new call as discussed above. A routing decision is made according to two types of information: (a) services offered by the network provider (here the voice network); and (b) network and customer data provisioned\/updated through external tools. As discussed below, routing service is implemented in a route tree structure consisting of independent route nodes and trunks connecting the route nodes. A routing service is created through a service creation graphical user interface (GUI) tool. The routing data is implemented in route tables consisting of keys and values. The routing data is provisioned via a suitable interface through a distribution center.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["60","62","64","62","65","64"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 8"],"b":["34","38","66","46","34","34","65","62","65","65","64","74","74","46"]},"In keeping with the invention, the process is directed for use in any suitable communication system comprising a host device such as a proxy server which is operative to receive and forward signaling messages. The method includes providing  a route engine in communication with the host device comprising a plurality of route trees. Each route tree is provisioned for a selected network service and further comprises one or more route nodes each encoded with logic represented in a standardized data file format, such as a text format, to independently carry out required processing for the service. Each route node is directed to a specific task and may be separately and independently queried by the route engine to provide a separate response. Because the logic in any given node will not affect the logic in another, route trees may be easily configured, reconfigured, deleted, etc. and dynamically loaded in the route engine as new services and enhancements become available.","Still referring to , the method further includes receiving  a route request message at the host device, abstracting  the network service from the route request message, and determining\/dynamically configuring  the corresponding route tree. Still further, the method comprises traversing  the route tree, and more particularly, the route nodes of the route tree, to carry out the processing for the service and returning  a route response message to the network host device in accordance with the results of the processing. The details of the provisioning, selection, and traversal of route trees  are discussed in further detail below.","Routing Logic Creation","As indicated above, a route request is generated based on the information extracted from a SIP request message whenever a stateful proxy server  needs to route the request message. In keeping with the invention, a route request comprises a list of routable elements and is sent to the route engine which, in turn, traverses a route tree using the route request as input. In a first preferred embodiment, a plurality of route trees  are pre-built using one or more interconnected route nodes  which may be selected from a plurality of available nodes. Each of the nodes is encoded with logic to independently carry out corresponding processing. Again, each route node  is directed to a specific task and may be separately and independently queried by the route engine  to provide a separate response. Each route tree  is assembled and provisioned for use according to a corresponding network service and implemented when such service is identified by route engine  from a route request . More specifically, the route engine abstracts the required service information from the route request message  and identifies and selects for use a corresponding route tree . In a second preferred embodiment, an applicable route tree is dynamically configured with the required route nodes  selected, linked and provisioned for traversal only upon receipt of the route request message  or other suitable time depending on the application and the network design. In either case, the output of the tree traversal is a route response , which contains a list of destinations (local edge devices) expressed as IP addresses in SIP-URL. Each destination may further be assigned a priority.","An exemplary class diagram of a route node may be shown and described with reference to  of the drawings. The ReRoute Engine class  contains a pointer to a root node of a route tree. As discussed in further detail below, there are two types of route nodes: (a) branch route nodes; and (b) end route nodes. A branch node has at least one child branch connected to another route node as shown generally in  by the designation ReBranchNode . An end route node has no child branch connected to other route nodes as shown generally by the designation ReEndNode .","An exemplary class diagram of branch nodes is similarly shown and described with reference to  of the drawings. The classes ReTrunkGroupRouteNode  and ReHostRouteNode  serve as the base classes for further clarification. The trunk group route node  represents the routing logic related to trunk groups. The user route node  represents the routing logic related to a user. The host route node  represents the logic related to a host. The Carrier Identification Code (CIC) route node  represents routing logic related to CIC.","In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, the routing logic in the stateful proxy server is encoded in a standardized data format such as, for example, a text format. In a preferred embodiment, the routing logic is represented by Extensible Markup Language (XML) files. However, it is understood that any suitable data file format may be utilized.","As those skilled in the art will recognize, XML is not a programming language. Rather, it is a framework for defining markup languages and is used principally for structuring data. Accordingly, XML comprises a standardized set of rules or conventions. As its name implies, XML is extensible. It is also fully Unicode-compliant, platform-independent and supports internationalization and localization. Like Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), XML makes use of tags (words bracketed by \u2018<\u2019 and \u2018>\u2019) and attributes (of the form name=\u201cvalue\u201d). However, there is no fixed collection of markup tags. Thus, a user may define his or her own tags, tailored for specific information. Accordingly, while HTML specifies what each tag and attribute means, and generally further specifies how the text between them will look in a browser, XML uses tags only to delimit pieces of data, and leaves the interpretation of the data completely to the application that reads it. Thus, open source or proprietary software may be used in the route engine  of the present invention to interpret the XML data. XML is, of course, a text format and, accordingly, comprises text files that shouldn't have to be read, but which may be read as the need arises.","The routing logic in the stateful proxy server may be represented by three XML files: (a) RouteTree.xml file; (b) TableData.xml file and (c) ReferenceTables.xml file. In operation, a routing decision is made based on two provisioned parts: (1) a routing service, which is expressed in a tree structure identified by a tree name that is an ASCII string; and (2) various route tables, which contain provisioned data and are represented in a table structure. As indicated above, a route tree comprises predefined route nodes  and branches . A route node is a logic decision element. A branch connects a parent route node to a child route node.","In keeping with the invention, three factors determine the outcome of a route tree traversal using a route request as an input: (1) the information contained in the route request; (2) the types of route nodes in a route tree, which also dictate what route tables will be searched; and (3) the order of the route nodes in a route tree. In a preferred embodiment, the route tree traversal will start from the top route node and end at the bottom route node. There are two types of route nodes: (a) a branch route node that always points to at least one child route node; and (b) an end route node that does not point to any other route nodes. One special branch is referred to as the default branch. Each route node is independent of other route nodes in determining a route response. Accordingly, each route node completes the routing task within the node itself.","There are generally two scenarios for completing a route task: (a) finding a final response, e.g. a destination SIP-URL or a treatment, in an end route node; and (b) adding more information to the route request and delegating the task to its child route node, e.g. in branch route nodes.","Route Trees","A route tree  represents the routing logic used in the route engine and, accordingly, comprises various route node objects connected together based on routing precedence rules. Route trees  are created via a suitable service creation tool and preferably in conjunction with an applicable graphical user interface. In operation, a route request  traverses the route tree  from the root route node to an end route node  with the specific order of node traversing determined by the service logic. An object diagram of an exemplary route tree is shown in .","In keeping with the invention, the routing logic of each route tree  may be expressed in the file of standard XML format called a RouteTree.xml. In a preferred embodiment, each file has the following elements:","(a) A standard XML version line, <?xml version=\u201c1.0\u201d standalone=\u201cyes\u201d ?>","(b) Standard XML comments, <!--comment string-->","(c) A new tag called RoutePlanName to represent a route plan. This tab has three attributes: (1) the attribute RoutePlan identifies a route plan name, (2) the optional attribute NodeCount captures the total number of route node objects, and (3) the attribute ChildNode identifies the root route node of the route tree.
