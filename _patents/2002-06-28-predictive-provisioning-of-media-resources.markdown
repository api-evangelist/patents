The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction of the patent disclosure by any person as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all rights to the copyright whatsoever.","The invention relates generally to the provisioning of media resources. More particularly, the invention relates to predictive provisioning of media resources.","Next-generation networks or Voice over IP (VoIP) have a variety of applications, from allowing telephone calls and facsimiles to be made over IP networks to being used as a framework for a Voice XML system. One next-generation network architecture is based on a gateway architecture utilizing media gateways, media gateway controllers, and signaling gateways. Media gateways have been used to implement media resources, such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) resources, needed by applications such as a Voice XML system.","Media resources such as ASR, Text-to-Speech, Conference Bridge, and echo canceller resources are very large and complex and consume significant computing and storage resources. Provisioning a media gateway with an ASR resource requires not only loading the executable code into the gateway, but also grammars, special-purpose vocabularies, and acoustic models. In the past, a decision had to be made to either over-provision the media gateway with the functional packages, thus contributing greatly to the expense of the media gateway, or to risk having the ASR component not be available when needed.","A method and apparatus are described for performing predictive provisioning of functional packages based on offered traffic and a predictive model of the offered traffic. According to one embodiment of the present invention, a managed agent provides predictions regarding an anticipated need for functional package provisioning based on traffic offered to the managed agent and a predictive model of offered traffic. A provisioning agent receives the predictions and in response to the predictions instructs the managed agent to provision a new functional package. This allows predictive provisioning of the functional packages, thus maximizing functional package availability while minimizing over-provisioning of the managed agent.","In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form.","The present invention includes various steps, which will be described below. The steps of the present invention may be performed by hardware components or may be embodied in machine-executable instructions, which may be used to cause a general-purpose or special-purpose processor or logic circuits programmed with the instructions to perform the steps. Alternatively, the steps may be performed by a combination of hardware and software.","The present invention may be provided as a computer program product which may include a machine-readable medium having stored thereon instructions which may be used to program a computer (or other electronic devices) to perform a process according to the present invention. The machine-readable medium may include, but is not limited to, floppy diskettes, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magneto-optical disks, ROMs, RAMs, EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, flash memory, or other type of media\/machine-readable medium suitable for storing electronic instructions. Moreover, the present invention may also be downloaded as a computer program product, wherein the program may be transferred from a remote computer to a requesting computer by way of data signals embodied in a carrier wave or other propagation medium via a communication link (e.g., a modem or network connection).","Importantly, while embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to a next-generation network utilizing media gateways and media gateway controllers, the method and apparatus described herein are equally applicable to other network technologies or future enhancements to the described next-generation network.","Terminology","Before describing an exemplary environment in which various embodiments of the present invention may be implemented, some terms that will be used throughout this application will briefly be defined.","The term next-generation network generally refers to an architecture that utilizes packet switching for Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic. The next-generation network has many possible applications, from allowing telephone calls and facsimiles to be made over IP networks to being used as a framework for Voice XML systems. The architecture can be based on the following components: media gateway controllers, media gateways, and signaling gateways. Media gateways and media gateway controllers can communicate with each other utilizing the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) H.248 standard.","A media gateway controller (MGC) typically communicates with other switching components and controls the operation of media gateways. A MGC is one example of a provisioning agent. The MGC can request that media streams be connected to terminations (an object that can either interconnect a media stream to another termination, or itself perform media operations on a media stream), that terminations be interconnected within a context, and that terminations perform media operations. It can behave as the \u201cmedia application\u201d with respect to a user on a call. The media gateway controller and signaling gateway may be implemented as a softswitch. A softswitch generally refers to software that provides the call control and signaling for the next-generation network.","A media gateway (MG) typically either interconnects media streams in different network or media formats (e.g., Real Time Protocol (RTP, T1\/E1 TDM trunks) or monitors and controls the media endpoints, the media connections, and the media resources. A MG is one example of a managed agent. It can implement a set of terminations, which are endpoints into which physical or logical devices, such as station sets, trunks, lines, or RTP channels, are connected. A termination may implement media functions such as playing or detecting DTMF, playing messages, or recording messages. The media gateway may provide Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) services. The H.248 protocol defines a base set of functionality supported by a termination required for basic voice response interaction. It also defines an extension mechanism called \u201cpackages\u201d through which functionality can be requested. Vendors and other standards organizations are free to define proprietary packages, and media gateway vendors may choose to implement them. H.248 terminations and packages do not imply any implementation; they simply provide a syntax by which requests may be sent from a media gateway controller to a media gateway.","A media resource generally refers to an arrangement of hardware and software that implements a media processing algorithm. Media gateways can use media resources to perform their functions. In particular, H.248 terminations and contexts are implemented by allocation and interconnection of media resources, and by requesting operations on media resources that correspond to H.248 signals.","Many types of media processing algorithms exist, but in particular it is common to consider the following media resources:\n\n","A media server generally refers to an ensemble of hardware and software that allows multiple user sessions, each under the control of a separate application program, to share the media resources under the management of the media server. A media server can allow an individual application program to handle an individual call without needing to take notice of other calls that may be in progress at the media server. Media servers may be proprietary in architecture, or they may conform to a standard, such as that of the Enterprise Computer Telephony Forum (ECTF), which defines service-level application programming interfaces (APIs), a control plane interface for controlling and monitoring media resources, and management APIs and management information bases (MIBs) for administration.","An automatic speech recognition (ASR) resource generally refers to a media resource that accepts as input a media stream, and, in response to control requests, recognizes spoken language utterances, returning text strings and probability scores. The functions of an ASR resource may be divided into \u201cfront-end\u201d and \u201cback-end\u201d resources. ASR front-end receives a media stream corresponding to the speech of a user and processes the media stream with respect to a speech model to transform it into an encoding suitable for use in a speech parser, keyword spotter, or other ASR back-end component. An ASR back-end receives the output of the ASR front-end. It then applies ASR components to make a hypothesis recognizing the speech of the user. ASR components comprise grammars, vocabularies, and acoustic models.","An echo canceller (EC) resource generally refers to a resource that accepts as input an input media stream and a reference media stream, and generates as output an \u201cecho-cancelled\u201d media stream in which any time-shifted occurrences of the reference media stream have been acoustically subtracted from the input media stream.","A conference bridge (CB) resource generally refers to a media resource that accepts as input multiple input media streams, and generates as output a collection of media streams consisting of the acoustic sum of the input streams.","A queuing model generally refers to a mathematical object consisting of a queue into which objects arrive, a server which dequeues an object from the front of the queue and performs a service on it, an arrival probability distribution that characterizes the rates at which objects arrive at the queue, and a service time distribution that characterizes the time required to perform a service on an object. A common use of a queuing model is to model a communications system; the objects arriving at the queue are calls, which have typically a Poisson arrival probability distribution; the service time distribution represents the length of a call, which is typically also modeled as an exponential probability distribution. The queuing model may be used to predict the number of calls active and\/or queued at a telecommunications system.","A Markov Model (or Markov Chain) generally refers to a mathematical object consisting of a collection of states, a collection of allowed transitions between states, an assignment of probabilities to the transition, and an output (or set of possible outputs) corresponding to each state. Markov Models are used to model a very wide variety of physical processes. The Markov Model can be represented graphically or as an N\u00d7N matrix A={a} in which the ij-th entry represents the probability of transitioning from state i to state j.","A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) generally refers to a Markov Model with two additional characteristics: the observable outputs of a state are not deterministic, but are themselves a probabilistic function of the state (represented as an N\u00d7M matrix B={b} in which each entry represents the probability of output j in state i), and the output probabilities and transition probabilities are not known a priori, but can be inferred only from observing output sequences generated by the real-world process of which the HMM is a model. There are well-known algorithms for estimating the transition and output probabilities (e.g., Baum-Welch re-estimation), for computing the probability that an observed output sequence was generated by a given HMM (e.g., forward\/backward evaluation), and for identifying the most likely state sequence for an observed output sequence (e.g., Viterbi search).","A probability distribution corresponding to a Markov Model generally refers to the set of probabilities pof the model being in a particular state i. The set of probabilities is usually written as a vector \u03c0=(p,p, . . . ,pAn initial probability distribution \u03c0is the set of probabilities before a Markov model begins its operation, and with each step of the model, successive probability distributions \u03c0,\u03c0, . . . , are generated. These probability distributions can be computed by the matrix multiplication\n\n\u03c0=\u03c0\n\nwhere A is the transition matrix.\n","A stationary distribution (SD) corresponding to a Markov Model generally refers to the long-run (or the limit) probability distribution \u03c0 of a given Markov Model. If a model runs for a long enough time for its transient behavior to vanish, the individual pvalues correspond to the proportion of time that the model spends in state i. Not all Markov Models have a stationary distribution, but the ones of interest for this invention do. There are various numerical procedures for computing the SD of a Markov model.","Provisioning System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","110","100","120","100","130","110","120"]},"Managed agent  is provisioned with functional packages , , and .

Resources that are particularly suitable for predictive provisioning in a next-generation network are ASR, TTS, echo cancellation, and conference bridge resources, because of their cost and computational complexity. Predictive provisioning of such components in a next-generation network will now be illustrated with reference to . The illustration will restrict itself to the provisioning of ASR resources, but it will be appreciated that the same process applies to TTS, echo cancellation, conference bridge, and other costly and\/or computationally expensive resources.","A media gateway controller  is communicatively coupled to media gateways ,  using the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) H.248 standard.

Each such request is called a transaction. Some of the transactions are media resource allocation or deallocation requests, which include the type of a media resource (e.g., ASR) and other attributes (e.g., English Vocabulary, Banking Grammar). The resource allocation model may be a HMM where:\n\n","The HMM may be parameterized in terms of at one or more of resource type, attributes, grammars, and vocabularies. It may be trained by collecting observation sequences of media operations and allocation\/deallocation requests for each call arriving at the media gateways , .

The IVR system could reside in a media application program that resides on a media gateway controller. In the course of execution of this program, the media gateway will request the use of one or more packages in the media gateway. The media gateway, in turn, will require the use of media resources in order to accomplish the requested operations, and will issue requests to allocate these resources.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4B"],"b":["0","1","2","0","1","1","2","0","2","0"]},"Each state has a set of observed symbols , , . The observed symbols  are associated with state  and consist of allocating a player, which has a probability of 0.5; allocating a recorder, which has a probability of 0.3; and allocating a signal detector, which has a probability of 0.2. The observed symbols  are associated with state  and consist of allocating an ASR package with an English vocabulary and a \u201cQuery.E\u201d grammar, which has a probability of 0.1; allocating an ASR package with a French vocabulary and a \u201cQuery.F\u201d grammar, which has a probability of 0.05; allocating an ASR package with a Spanish vocabulary and a \u201cQuery.S\u201d grammar, which has a probability of 0.05; allocating an ASR package with a Finish vocabulary and a \u201cQuery.Fi\u201d grammar, which has a probability of 0.05; and performing a Media Operation, which has a probability of 0.75.

It should be appreciated that the number of output symbols may be determined by the number of distinct media resources provisioned in the media gateway. Other HMM models may have different types and numbers of symbols associated with each state. It should also be appreciated that the symbol output probabilities are only exemplary in nature. They may be trained by the model and updated periodically during the training period.","As the program flow of  proceeds, the media gateway may first configure a default package consisting of a player and signal detector\u2014sufficient resources to play a prompt and receive a reply. The media gateway may then allocate the Player and SD resources, which correspond to a transition from state  to state  in the HMM. The IVR program then issues a prompt  to determine the language in which the conversation is to ensue, giving the user a choice of English, French, and Spanish. The program may then receive a DTMF response for English, and identifies English as the language to be used.","Next, the program may need to configure a package with ASR for the language chosen by the user and a grammar needed for the next phase of the conversation. In this case, the next phases of the conversation ask the user what he or she would like to do  and how he or she would like to pay . Therefore, there may be another state transition in  from state  to state , and another observed output consisting of the allocation of an ASR package with an English vocabulary and a \u201cQuery.E\u201d grammar. This package allows the program to get the credit card and reservation information from the user in block . Because the program flow of the media application may be modeled by the corresponding HMM, over time the transition and output probabilities of the HMM may reflect the global behavior of the application program when used by many users. This may then give a more accurate prediction of the expected number of resources and resource types needed by the media gateway.","Media Gateway Provisioning","Media Gateway provisioning process according to one embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to .

This prediction may be based on the offered traffic and the predictive model.","At block , the media gateway updates the predictive model based on the offered traffic. It should be appreciated that this block is optional. In alternate embodiments, the predictive model may be a static model or it may be a model that initially underwent a training period where modifications were made, but now it is static. It should also be appreciated that block  may be performed before block . At block , the media gateway receives instructions from the media gateway controller to provision the media resource.","Provisioning Alternate Media Gateway","According to one embodiment of the present invention, there may be occasions when an alternate media gateway may be selected to provision a media resource needed by another media gateway. For instance, this may happen when the expected resource utilization of a media gateway exceeds the number of actual resources available for use in a media gateway. In this case, an additional media gateway, with its own set of media resources, may be used to service calls. Provisioning of alternate media gateways may be done by the predicting media gateway or may be done by the media gateway controller.  illustrates provisioning of an alternate media gateway by the predicting media gateway.  illustrates provisioning of an alternate media gateway by the media gateway controller.","At blocks ,  offered traffic is received at a media gateway.

At blocks , , the media gateway provides a prediction to the media gateway controller regarding an anticipated need for a media resource. This prediction may be based on the offered traffic and the predictive model.","At block , the media gateway controller issues instructions to a second media gateway to provision the package needed by the predicting media gateway. The media gateway controller may make the determination to provision an alternate media gateway based on records it keeps or it may be informed by the predicting media gateway that the predicting media gateway is not able to provision the new media resource. At block , the media gateway controller routes traffic from the predicting media gateway to the alternate media gateway. It should be appreciated that the means used to route the traffic is not important. For instance, traffic may be routed directly to the alternate media gateway, routed through a pipe from the predicting media gateway to the alternate media gateway, or some other mechanism may be used.","Alternately, the media gateway may itself issue instructions to an alternate media gateway to provision the required media resource. At block , the predicting media gateway receives instructions to provision the media resource.
