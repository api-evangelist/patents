The interest in this field can be traced back to early 1900s when the photoconduction of solid anthracene was discovered. A considerable amount of research was devoted to understand the charge transport properties of organic semiconductors starting 1950s and to potential use of organic semiconductors in electronic devices began in late 1980s.","The interest in the study of organic semiconductors in particular sparks from the fact that these organic electronic devices are easier to fabricate than traditional silicon based semiconductors that require rigorous processing techniques and high temperatures. Also organic semiconductors can be designed by computer assist modeling to improve their charge transport properties in electronic field to fit a variety of application requirements or by incorporation of functional groups in the molecules and improving their physical properties to make low temperature vapor deposition process possible, or by improving solubility in solvents that led to form semiconductor thin film by cost-effective solution deposition process.","Many organic materials have been studied as organic semiconductors. Among them arylamines were widely studied as organic photoconductors (OP) in early 1970s and later as an efficient hole transport materials for OLED devices. Fused aryl hydrocarbon molecule, more typically pentancene and its derivatives have shown the high charge mobility both processed by vapor deposition and solution coating deposition process.","The most known regular poly(3-hexylthiophene) has been studied and reported with low charge mobility and low current on\/off ratio. Most recently polythionphene were studied as organic thin film transistors (OTFT) with a research focus on improving the charge mobility, easy to synthesize, good processibility and oxidative stability. These improvements can be achieved by designing the new monomers, oligomers, and polythiophene molecules with good planarity and conjugation [Applied Physics Letter, 90, 012112, 2007 and references therein]. A few of thiophene containing examples have been disclosed in U.S. Pat.
