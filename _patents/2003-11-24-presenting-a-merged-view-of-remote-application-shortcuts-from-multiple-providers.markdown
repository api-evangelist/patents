title: Presenting a merged view of remote application shortcuts from multiple providers
abstract: Systems and methods for presenting a merged view of remotely installed applications to which a user has terminal server (TS) based access are described. In one aspect, a client computing device generates one or more shortcuts to one or more respective applications. Each of the applications is installed at one or more installation points in an Intranet. The client computing device is external to the Intranet. The one or more shortcuts are aggregated to present a merged view of the applications. The merged view is transparent of whether the applications are managed by different information sources on the Intranet and/or configured for remote TS-based execution by different ones of one or more installation points.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","The RAP Web Server Service","The Remote Client Device","CONCLUSION"],"p":["The invention pertains to remote terminal service application presentation.","Traditionally, application publishing involves installing and running a published application on a local machine. This may be performed by an administrator publishing packages that are subsequently downloaded and installed on administrator specified client machines. Depending on the application software, the hardware requirements for such a machine (the client) may be high. In addition, the installation itself may take significant amount of time, resources, and may even conflict with existing application installations.","In view of such conventional application publishing limitations, terminal services may be used in distributed computing environments to provide a thin client computing model to resources installed and executed in a corporate intranet. Using terminal services (TSs) allows a remote computing device (i.e., a client device that is outside of the intranet) to access an application installed on a corporate server, execute the application on the corporate server, and display the applications' user interface (UI) on the remote client. Since the application is executed on the corporate server, TSs allow the remote client to take advantage of corporate infrastructure resources independent of whether the remote client has appropriate hardware and software to execute the resources locally on the client device.","An administrative entity, to configure a corporate intranet for specific user, groups of users, and\/or client device access to an application, typically must install the application and specify explicit application access policies and default\/customized application behaviors. Since these corporate-end preparations are performed in advance of end-user access to the resources, these preparations generally do not negatively affect the final application use experience of the remote client user. Yet, even in view of such corporate-end preparations, the remote client user must still undertake substantially labor intensive and time consuming procedures to determine what applications have been authorized for user access, remotely access, and then execute the application(s) installed in a corporate intranet via TSs.","For instance, today a user must set up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection to the corporate network, start a remote client, enter the name of the remote computer and the user's credentials, then use TSs to connect to a desktop, and start applications from that desktop. To make matters worse, these end-user activities must be performed by the consumer each and every time that the user desires to remotely access the applications via TS services.","In view of these substantially labor intensive and time consuming procedures that the remote client user typically needs to undertake to identify available applications on a private network for subsequent remote TS execution, the remote client user cannot seamlessly identify available corporate resources for TS access.","Systems and methods for presenting a merged view of remotely installed applications to which a user has terminal server (TS) based access are described. In one aspect, a client computing device generates one or more shortcuts to one or more respective applications. Each of the applications is installed at one or more installation points in an Intranet. The client computing device is external to the Intranet. The one or more shortcuts are aggregated to present a merged view of the applications. The merged view is transparent of whether the applications are managed by different information sources on the Intranet and\/or configured for remote TS-based execution by different ones of one or more installation points.","Overview","The following described systems and methods for presenting a merged view of remote application shortcuts from multiple providers on a users desktop substantially simplify a remote client's experience when accessing applications for terminal service execution by a server on an organizational intranet. One reason for this simplified access is because the systems and methods discover applications that have been configured for remote access across any number of corporate intranet application installation points. To this end, the systems and methods allow an organizational entity to publish remote applications using a variety of information source mechanisms and then provide a single aggregated view of the applications to remote clients over the Internet. Such application publishing is referred to as Remote Application Publishing (RAP). Remote client computer device discovery of applications that have been published via RAP for access by a user, group of users, and\/or a specific computing device is referred to as remote application discovery.","More specifically, an entity in an organizational intranet installs, or deploys some number of applications on servers and\/or end-user computing devices in the corporate intranet. For instance, an administrative entity may install an application on a corporate server for remote TS-based access. The administrative entity uses RAP to create associations between the deployed\/applications and specific user(s), group(s) of users, and\/or specific client computing device(s). These associations are then stored in one or more databases\/information sources. Such databases include, for example, Systems Management Server (SMS) and\/or a directory service (databases). In another example, a user of a computer (e.g., a general purpose computer, workstation, etc,) in the intranet uses RAP to specify that an application deployed on the computer is to be available for remote TS-based access by the user.","A remote client device, independent of whether it is outside of the corporate firewall, connected to the corporate network over a Virtual Private Network (VPN), and\/or so on, discovers these applications via a novel RAP Web Service (RWS) deployed on a public network such as the Internet. In one implementation, an end-user of the remote client device uses a Web browser or user interface shell to discover\/enumerate each application associated with the remote client device or the end-user. Responsive to receiving the RAP discovery request, the RWS queries the databases to identify each application associated with the remote client device or a single user associated with the remote client device. RWS hides the details of the protocols for communicating with each of the different databases being queried for applications.","After identifying one or more applications configured for remote client TS-based access by the user, and independent of the number and types of installation points associated with the applications, the RWS aggregates each identified application and its intranet installation point into a single comprehensive list of applications. The aggregated list is sent to the requesting remote client device for presentation, for instance, as shortcuts in a user interface (UI) shell, a Web browser window, and\/or so on. Since the presented shortcuts represent an aggregate of the remotely applications over one or more application sources, it is completely transparent to the end-user whether the RAP shortcuts are coming from a single source (installation point) or from multiple disparate information sources. In this manner, authorized users may seamlessly discover and use applications deployed on terminal server (TS) farms and\/or on their office computer from a remote location. By presenting such shortcuts via UI shell improvements, the end user is provided with seamless TS-based access to corporate resources deployed across any number of remote servers and\/or desktops.","These and other aspects of the systems and methods for a Web Service for remote application discovery are now described in greater detail.","An Exemplary System for Remote Application Discovery","Turning to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements, the invention is illustrated as being implemented in a suitable computing environment. Although not required, the invention is described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a personal computer. Program modules generally include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc., that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types.","Installing Applications on an Organizational Intranet for Remote Discovery",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","104","1","104","2","106","108","1","110","112","113","110","108","1","108","2","110","114","106"]},"Application(s)  are deployed and published on one or more installation points of the LAN . For example, applications - have been published on one or more office computer(s) , and\/or applications - have been published on one or more application server(s) . To publish an application - on an office computer , a user of the office computer  interfaces with RAP wizard  for personal publishing. The RAP wizard allows the user to specify the application to be published and generate map . Map  associates each office computer  to the specific user. Map  is subsequently utilized to provide the user with remote application discovery to published applications - for subsequent remote terminal server (TS) access by the user, as described below.","To publish an application - on an application server , an administrative entity uses a system policy editor or other administrative application to associate a specific user(s), group(s) of users, and\/or remote client device(s)  to respective ones of the applications -. The administrative entity uses the installation package installer (e.g., MSI) wizard  to generate an installation package (e.g., installation packages - through -). An installation package  contains information about an application - sufficient to point to an installation point on one or more application servers . For instance, in one implementation, each installation package  specifies, a name of an application - and the name of the application server  (e.g., alias, IP address, etc.).","Installation packages , when associated with application(s)  published on an office computer  and\/or application server(s) , may be stored on one or more databases (information sources). Any number of databases using any type of database access technology (e.g., LDAP, etc.) as a function of the specific architectural implementations of the LAN  can be used to store installation packages . In one implementation, installation package  is stored on a database as installation package - associated with a directory service  of a domain controller (not shown). In another implementation, installation package - is stored as installation package - on database  managed via Systems Management Server (SMS) . The directory service  and SMS  provide respective network services to identify LAN  resources, and make them accessible to users and applications.","For instance, the directory service  includes per-user information such as the list of published applications , as well as other information, such as firewall  navigation configuration. Although application(s)  published on an office computer  may be stored on one or more databases, these office computer mappings - may also be stored only on the associated office computer .","Referring to , RAP Web server  aggregates terminal services remote application information\/shortcuts from multiple sources so that they can be enumerated by a user of a remote client device  over the Internet. To this end, the RAP Web server  includes RAP Web service (RWS)  for receiving a discovery request  from a remote client device , for instance using Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)\u2014a known lightweight protocol intended for exchanging structured information in a distributed environment. Since the discovery request  communicated to the RWS  via SOAP, the remote client  does not need to establish a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection to the LAN  to obtain results of discovery request , as described below.","In this implementation, the RWS  utilizes an Internet Information Server (not shown) for services such as authentication, threading, and HTTP handling.","Responsive to receiving the remote application discovery request, the RWS  interfaces with each of multiple possible intranet remote application information source accessor modules  (e.g., modules - through -) to generate an aggregate list of discovered remote applications (aggregate list ). Each accessor module - through - is designed to interface with a particular type of data source, or database via implemented application programming interfaces (APIs) and sequences of operation configured to communicate with the particular data source. There may be any number of accessor modules  as a function of the desired deployment of application(s)  for Internet TS-access, and as a function of the particular architectural implementation of the LAN .","In this manner, an administrator of LAN  can use any number and combination of methods to publish applications . For example, in a corporate environment, an administrator may choose to use Software Update Services (SUS) technology in conjunction with a directory service  to publish applications . Another method could be Systems Management Server (SMS). In a Roaming environment, a user could publish his applications to a central location on a personal office computer , or could simply use a corporate identity to publish applications in a directory service . In a home environment, a home-user could publish applications using a known service bus technology.","In this implementation, for example, accessor modules  include SMS accessor -, directory service accessor -, and workstation accessor -. The SMS accessor - sends a get applications request  (\u201crequest\u201d) to the SMS Server , for example, via HTTP. Responsive to receiving a get request , the SMS server evaluates mapping - to determine whether the user of the remote client  is associated with any applications  deployed within the domain of the SMS server . If so, the SMS server sends a get application response  (\u201cresponse\u201d) identifying the associated application(s)  and their respective installation point(s)\u2014e.g., computer(s) , application server(s) , etc.\u2014back to the SMS accessor, which in turn, returns the response  to the Web service .","In one implementation, a remote application discovery response  is a text file (e.g., XML, RDP, and\/or the like) including parameters that are useful to determine where the actual application  resides. Such parameters include, for example, a server name, an application path, redirection settings, file extensions associated with the remote application , etc.","For purposes of simplicity of discussion and representation, a single get application(s) request  and a single get application response  is shown. That is, single request  and single response  represent respective get requests and responses from respective ones of the accessor modules , although separate get requests  and get responses  showing a respective get application request and get application response from each type of accessor module  could also have been shown.","In this implementation, directory service accessor (DSA) - interfaces with the directory service , which in this example, is Active Directory\u00ae. The DSA sends a respective get applications request  to the directory service , for example, using LDAP\u2014a common protocol for interfacing with a directory service. Responsive to receiving request , the directory service evaluates installed application-to-user mapping . This evaluation determines whether the user of the remote client device  is authorized\/associated with specific ones of the applications . Results of this evaluation, including respective installation point(s) of any such applications , are returned to the Web service  by the directory service  as a respective response .","Personal computer (PC) accessor - enumerates applications - installed for Internet-based remote application discovery on an office computer  on LAN . To this end, PC accessor - identifies the Intranet address of the office computer \u2014the office computer having been assigned to the user of the remote computing device . To this end, the PC accessor - communicates a get resource request  to directory service . The get resource request  indicates corporate identity of the user; the corporate identity being set-up in advance by an administrative entity on LAN  and subsequently determined by RAP setup module , as described in greater detail below. Responsive to receiving the get resource request , the directory service identifies the Intranet address (not shown) of the user's office computer  (e.g., an IP address, NAT-based address, alias, and\/or the like). The directory service communicates the network address back to the PC accessor module -.","In one implementation, the remote computing device  of the user is not connected or otherwise \u201ctunneled\u201d (via a VPN connection) into the Intranet of LAN  when the get resource request  is communicated the directory service . Instead, the RWS  acts as an intermediary by communicating with directory service . In this implementation, the get resource request  may be communicated via LDAP, or some other appropriate protocol.","Responsive to receiving the Intranet address of the user's office computer , PC accessor - sends a respective get applications request  to RAP Web service \u2014the RAP Web service  is deployed on the user's office computer . In one implementation, the get applications request  is communicated via SOAP.","Responsive to receiving a respective get application(s) request , Web service  interfaces with directory services  to retrieve information associated with the application(s)  installed on LAN  that correspond to the user's office computer. Web service  interfaces with shell accessor  to identify installed application(s) - on the desktop\/shell of the user's office computer . Techniques for identifying applications installed on a computer, for instance, via an operating system service, are known. This information includes respective installation point(s) of any such applications - installed on the user's desktop\/workspace and any information needed to execute the application(s) via a TS client session with the remote client device . This information is returned to RWS  by the directory service  as a respective get application(s) response .","RAP Web service (RWS)  receives response(s)  from respective ones of the accessor module(s) . The RWS  generates aggregate list  from the data included in the received response(s) . RWS  sends aggregate list  to the remote client device  that initiated the remote application discovery request . In one implementation, the aggregate list is communicated to the remote client device  via SOAP\/HTTP. Additionally, although list  is referred to as an aggregate list, the respective get application responses  need not be combined to form an aggregate, but might also be communicated as list(s)  comprising discovered installed application(s)  information from one or more the data sources (e.g., server(s), office computer(s), and\/or the like).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":"200"},"At block , a remote application discovery request (RADR)  () is received by the RAP Web Server (RWS)  from a remote client computing device . As described above, the RWS  is located in an Intranet such as LAN . The remote client computing device  is external to the LAN . For instance, in one implementation, the remote client  is coupled to the RWS  across a public external network  such as the Internet.","At block , the RWS  requests application data from one or more information sources deployed on the Intranet. Such a request may be made via respective message(s) . In one implementation, the RWS  send one message  to each respective data source. The application data corresponds to application(s)  installed and associated with the user of the remote computing device . The information sources include, for example, office computers , directory services , and\/or SMS server .","In one embodiment, the remote application discovery request  indicates the one or more data sources of interest as well as a local login and\/or a corporate identity of the user of the remote computing device . For instance, the request  may indicate that applications -\u2014those installed on an office computer  associated with the user\u2014are to be discovered. A corporate identify corresponds to the user's identify on the LAN .","At block , the RWS  receives the requested application data, for instance, via respective response(s)  from respective ones of the data sources on the Intranet. At block , the RWS  communicates the application data (e.g., via message(s) ) to the requesting client device , and in satisfaction of the remote application discovery request  sent to the RAP Web server .","We now describe exemplary aspects of the remote client computing device .","The following described components allow remote client device  to automatically enumerate (via a public network) applications for remote access that are installed on the user's office computer  in the end-user's office on a private Intranet. In this embodiment, remote client computing device  (\u201cremote client\u201d) includes wizard  for gathering user credentials (e.g., corporate identity), and using received configuration data to configure the remote client  for TS access and to initiate remote application discovery via the RWS . Wizard  provides roaming plug-in services for determination of a roaming knowledge worker environment. It communicates with the RAP Web service  to get the list of remote applications  published to the user. For instance, wizard  obtains user credentials for access to LAN . Wizard , via RAP setup module , sends these credentials to the RAP wizard  of the user's office computer . RAP wizard  sends these credentials to the remote client configuration (RCC) module  for verification of user access to the LAN  (e.g., via an enterprise authentication service). If the user is authorized to access LAN resources, the RAP wizard  communicates message  including LAN access authorization and a location of an outward-facing RAP Web server (RWS)  to RAP setup module .","Once the user of the remote client  has been authorized for LAN  access, wizard  sends discover remote applications request  to the RAP Web service (RWS) . As indicated above, the Internet address\/URL of the RWS  is identified in the message  and\/or identified in some other manner, such a via a configuration script executed on the remote client. As described above, responsive to receiving the discovery request, , the RWS  invokes one or more accessor  to interrogate respective data sources on the LAN to identify application(s)  associated or otherwise published for user TS access. The RWS returns this information to the wizard  as aggregated list .","Wizard  communicates aggregated list  to the RAP client worker , which takes newly discovered remote applications and presents them to the user, through shell . In one implementation, shortcuts  representing the applications  identified in the aggregated list  are presented to the user. In this example, each shortcut  is a file that points to a respective application  on an installation point of LAN . The shortcut(s)  allow a user to conveniently access files stored on the LAN  via TSs provided by TS client .","Rap spawner  component triggers TS client  when the user chooses to start an application  associated with a shortcut . When the RAP spawner is used, shell items (respective ones of shortcuts ) are refreshed by shell component . For example, when a sub-component for the current environment determines that a remote application  has been unpublished or updated, it notifies the RAP client worker , and the RAP client worker  handles the deletion or update of desktop shortcuts on behalf of the sub-component.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["106","104","1","102","112","113","122","130","134","3","142","144","302","322"]},"Directional arrow  shows a data flow to the RAP Web service . Data flow  corresponds to a request for remote application discovery. Remote application discovery request  of  is illustrative of such a request. In this example, the request indicates that applications -, which are installed on a remote client computer  associated with a specified user, are of significance for discovery. Responsive to this request, and as shown by data flow , RAP Web server  communicates a respective get applications request  to an office computer accessor such as PC accessor -. In this example, the get applications request does not identify the user's corresponding office computer . Thus, the PC accessor interrogates directory service  of LAN  for this user specific resource data\u2014this is shown via data flow , which is directed to obtaining the network address for the user's computing device  via a Domain Name Service (DNS).
