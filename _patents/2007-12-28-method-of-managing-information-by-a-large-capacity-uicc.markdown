In a GSM network, the UICC contains a SIM application and in a UMTS network it is the USIM application. A UICC may contain several applications, making it possible for the same smartcard to give access to both GSM and UMTS networks, and also provide storage of a phone book and other applications. It is also possible to access a GSM network using an USIM application and it is possible to access UMTS networks using a SIM application with mobile terminals prepared for this.\n\nSIM (Subscriber Identity Module): is part of a removable smart card or ICC (Integrated Circuit Card), also known as SIM Card, for mobile cellular telephony devices such as mobile computers and mobile phones. It is managed by a GSM mobile network operator (MNO) and comprises a module for identifying a subscriber who accesses a mobile communications network (MNO). It is also capable of storing subscriber information, such as its agenda or text messages.\n\nUSIM (Universal Subscriber Identity Module: An application for UMTS mobile telephony running on a UICC (Universal Integrated Circuit Card), also known as USIM Card, which is inserted in a 3G mobile phone.\n\nMegaSIM Card: Large capacity Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC). In other words, it is a SIM Card or USIM Card which additionally comprises a large amount of storing capacity (i.e. more than 128 MBytes), typically flash memory, which allows the subscriber and the MNO to store a large amount of information, such as video or images. A large capacity Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) or MegaSIM Card usually comprises a high-speed communications interface, such as USB but not limited thereto, which allows offering services which imply a large exchange of information. MegaSIM is a registered term (MegaSIM\u2122) by MSYSTEMS LTD., Kefar Saba, Israel.\n\nSmart Card Web Server (SCWS): Web server placed in a MegaSIM card.\n\nCard Application Runtime Environment (CAT-RE): Entity integrated in the Operative System (OS) of a large capacity Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) or MegaSIM card, which is in charge of managing and controlling the execution of Toolkit applications.\n\nRemote Application Management (RAM): Toolkit application controlled by the CAT-RE, in charge of managing the large capacity Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) or MegaSIM card in relation to the installation of new applications, management of the current applications' status and management of the status of the card itself.\n\nUSB Inter chip (USB-IC): Electrical interface between the USB of a large capacity Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) or MegaSIM and the device supporting said USB of the large capacity Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) or MegaSIM. This interface is an adaptation of the interface USB 2.0 designed for short-distance communications. It only refers to electrical parameters.\n\nhttp: Protocol used for the transfer of web pages.\n\nhttps: http protocol which includes ciphering based on the Secure Socket Layers (SSL) in order to create a ciphered channel, which is more appropriate than http for the transfer of sensitive information (information which requires a certain level of security).\n\nTCP-IP: Network protocol on which Internet is based and which allows data transmission between computer networks.\n\nServlet: Is an object that receives a request and generates a response based on that request. The basic servlet package defines Java objects to represent servlet requests and responses, as well as objects to reflect the servlet's configuration parameters and execution environment.\n","Last generation smart cards have the possibility of including a Web server capable of serving static or dynamic web pages to Internet browsers located within the mobile terminal in which the smart card is located or to Internet browsers located within a remote device having Internet access. This service is called Smart Card Web Server (SCWS).","The SCWS is feasible thanks to the recent evolution of the smart card, since there has been a significant improvement in its communications interfaces, communications protocols and storage capacity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["148","120"]},"In  three physical entities are represented: a mobile equipment or mobile terminal , a MegaSIM card or large capacity Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC)  located within said mobile equipment  and a remote device  configured for exchanging information with said large capacity Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC)  through the Internet . The large capacity UICC  comprises at least a high-capacity memory , such as a flash memory.","In order for the large capacity UICC  to communicate with an Internet browser  located within the mobile equipment , a protocol stack comprising an http or https layer  mounted over a TCP-IP layer  in turn supported by a high speed protocol, such as USB-IC interface,  is used. The high speed protocol represented in  is USB-IC. The SCWS  is mounted over said http or https layer . Similarly, at the mobile equipment , said Internet browser  is supported by a http layer  mounted over a TCP-IP layer  in turn supported by a high speed protocol, such as a USB-IC interface .","Thus, when required by a user, the Internet browser  performs http requests  to the SCWS  in order to download web pages. These contents (web pages) are stored and managed at a high-capacity memory  within the large capacity UICC . Such contents managed by the SCWS  can be either static, thus being stored in the high-capacity memory , or dynamic. The dynamic contents are obtained through the execution of applications or Servlets  which manage the requests and generate those contents depending on external parameters. The management and execution control of the Servlets  is done by the SCWS .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["154","124","148","120","130","154","146","140","122","120","134","134","120","122","134","122","124"]},"The SCWS  comprises three different entities: an http and https engine as defined in the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) \u201cOMA Smart Card Web Server\u201d, a communications protocol as defined by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) standards ETSI TS 102 600\u201d and \u201cETSI TS 102 223\u201d, and a Servlet functionality as defined by ETSI standard \u201cETSI TS 102 588\u201d.","On the other hand, the large capacity UICC comprises a multi-application platform in which different applications can co-exist, allowing the large capacity UICC to become a device offering a plurality of services and having the possibility of adding new services during its lifetime.","The entity in charge of controlling and managing the applications offered by the large capacity UICC is called Card Manager. Besides, this entity manages the status of the large capacity UICC and of its applications, as well as its privileges.","Once the large capacity UICC is provided to a final user and inserted in a mobile equipment, the entity called Card Manager is not reachable any more, due mainly to the fact that the mobile equipment does not provide the applications, either those located within the device or the remote ones, with any mechanism of communication with the Card Manager. This is due to the fact the communication with the Card Manager must be done through a basic logical channel. When the mobile equipment or terminal starts a session, it communicates with a default GSM (or USIM) application through a basic channel. Therefore, no other application can select the Card Manager in that basic channel.","In order to solve this problem of visibility of the Card Manager, there exists a Toolkit application to which the Card Manager delegates and which allows to carry out many of the tasks for which the Card Manager is responsible. This Toolkit application provides the extra advantage that these activities can be carried out during the whole life of the large capacity UICC and with different communications protocols supported by mobile equipments. This Toolkit application is called Remote Application Management (RAM) and is defined by ETSI standards \u201cETSI TS 102 226\u201d and \u201cETSI TS 131 116\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["292","220","210","274"]},"In  three physical entities are represented: a mobile equipment or mobile terminal , a large capacity UICC  located within said mobile equipment  and an operation center  of a Mobile Network Operator (MNO).
