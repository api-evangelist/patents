title: Door knob insulator
abstract: An insulated elastic cover that slips snuggly over interior or exterior door knob. It is constructed in a manner that allows locking and unlocking actions, as well as the ability to turn the door knob. Invention takes advantage of state-of-the-art materials to maximize insulating properties while minimizing bulk. Additionally, material is impregnated with anti-bacteriological medium that destroys hand-borne bacteria transferred from hand to door knob.

Substantial measures are generally taken to insulate heated\/cooled home and offices, but the door knob has been overlooked as a major energy leaker. Significant home\/office heating and cooling is lost to the environment through radiation from these small radiators. This invention provides the means to stop the loss of home\/office heating\/cooling through the door knob, while providing some protection from bacteria contamination common to most door knobs.","A need has been recognized for conserving heating and cooling through a use of thermal insulation, but solutions for these needs are just in their infancy. Solutions we have seen have included storm windows, and thermal insulation added to roofs and the interior of walls. But what about the largest single aperture of any home, the door? While the door structure may be replaced, conventional knobs and keyholes are thermal conductors, a problem that needs to be solved.","The present invention is a stretchable, thermally insulated knob cover fits over a door knob and further has a flange-like expanded fringe to cover a keyhole. The cloth can be a stretchable insulator cloth with an adhesive substance on its interior surface and an anti-bacteriological substance on its surface, as discussed below.","In one embodiment, the present invention is an insulated elastic cover that slips snugly over interior or exterior door knob. It is constructed in a manner that allows locking and unlocking actions, as well as the ability to turn the door knob. Invention takes advantage of state-of-the-art materials to maximize insulating properties while minimizing bulk. Additionally, material is impregnated with anti-bacteriological medium that destroys hard-borne bacteria transferred from hand to door knob.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","150"]},"One key to the success of the invention is the use of a suitable insulator cloth, such as that disclosed in the following U.S. Patents, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference:\n\n","These fabrics can become bacteriological insulators by coating them with anti-bacteriological agents such as alcohol, tetraclines, and any anti-viral chemicals. Suitable agents include methyl paraben, ethyl paraben, propyl paraben.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","220","201","220"]},"As mentioned above, the cover is a stretchable cloth with a silhouette and shape that fits snugly over a door knob. It may rely on friction to keep it in place, or have a mild adhesive on its interior surface.","While the invention has been described in its presently preferred embodiment it is understood that the words, which have been used, are words of description rather than words of limitation and that changes within the purview of the appended claims may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention in its broader aspects."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIGS. 1 and 2"}},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
