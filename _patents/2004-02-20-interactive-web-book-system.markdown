title: Interactive web book system
abstract: An interactive Web book (“ibook”) system is provided that allows material to be contributed to the World Wide Web. An ibook is a self-extending, self-sustaining information-redistributing Web robot, which is resident on a data network such as the Internet or an intranet. Users may enroll with an ibook as viewers or contributors. Viewers may view ibook material, such as text or multimedia content. Contributors may contribute original material to the ibook or may create derivations of existing ibook material. Attribution information that identifies the source of material in a derivation is automatically generated. Information concerning the derivation of each work and its characteristics can be used to help the user navigate through ibook material. The ibook system keeps track of how often users access each work within an ibook. Contributors may be automatically rewarded (e.g., by a monetary distribution) based on the extent to which their contributed material is viewed by the users.

No. 08\/735,727, filed Oct. 23, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,052,717.","This invention relates to the Internet, and more particularly, to techniques for creating and viewing material on the World Wide Web in the form of an interactive Web book.","The World Wide Web has made the Internet accessible to a broad range of people. One can search the Web and view a large amount of material using a Web browser. However, there is no satisfactory framework within the Web to encourage contributions of new material while rewarding contributors for their efforts. As a result, many people who might make meaningful contributions of entertaining or educational material to the World Wide Web do not make such contributions.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a way in which to facilitate the contribution of material using a data network such as the World Wide Web and to compensate the contributors of such material.","This and other objects of the invention are accomplished in accordance with the principles of the present invention by providing an interactive Web book (\u201cibook\u201d) system. An ibook is a self-extending, self-sustaining information-redistributing Web robot, which is resident on a data network such as the Internet or an intranet. Material in an ibook is preferably organized in the form of Web pages. Material may be in text, two-dimensional, three-dimensional or n-dimensional graphics, animation, audio, video, source or executable code, or any type of multimedia format. Within each Web page, material may be organized in passages. Passages can be of any suitable size, such as a paragraph for textual material, or a video or audio clip of a certain length for multimedia material.","Users can preferably enroll as viewers of the ibook or as contributors to the ibook. Viewers are allowed to view (i.e., read, hear, observe, observe the behavior of, etc.) material in the ibook. Presentation of ibook material for viewing may involve the execution of computer code associated with or contained in that material. Contributors can view material and can contribute material. The contributed material can be original or can be based on the work of other contributors.","Works that are created based on previously contributed material are called derivations. When a contributor uses certain authoring functions in the ibook system, such as by performing a cut and paste operation from existing material or by using a compiler of the contributor's to compile existing source code, attribution links are automatically formed between the material in the derivation and the original material. This attribution information is preferably used by the ibook system in rewarding contributors. Contributors are rewarded based on the amount that their material is accessed by viewers. The more often a contributor's material is used (either directly or indirectly), the more that contributor will be rewarded. Preferably, the reward may be made in the form of an automatic monetary distribution by the ibook system.","As ibook material is created, derivation information is compiled that can be used by the ibook navigation system when a user desires to view material in an ibook. For example, when viewing a passage for which a derivation exists, the viewer can be presented with the option of viewing the derivation. The viewer is also presented with options for navigating through the material in an ibook based on a selected author, subject matter, media type, etc.","The ibook system may automatically advertize its presence to various search engines by transmitting suitable keyword information (e.g., keyword information identifying the subject matter of the contents of the ibook) to databases associated with the search engines.","If desired, new ibooks may be spawned by replicating the content and structure of an existing ibook. Replicating may be achieved by copying material or by creating references from the new ibook to the existing ibook.","Further features of the invention, its nature and various advantages will be more apparent from the accompanying drawings and the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.","An interactive Web book (\u201cibook\u201d) system  is shown in . Web server computers that support one or more ibooks are called ibook servers. Ibook servers  and  are interconnected with ibook client computers , , , and  via data network . Also connected to data network  is search engine server . Data network  is preferably a packet-based data network such as the Internet or an intranet (i.e., a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN) using Internet protocols). Communication paths  are modem lines or LAN or WAN network connections.","Contributors at ibook clients , , and  can contribute material to an ibook, such as ibook A\u2032 on server . The contributed material can be in any media type supported by the Internet, such as text, audio, and video information. Some contributed material may be literary or artistic in nature, such as an essay, song, painting, or movie. Other contributed material may be of a more technical or utilitarian nature, such as the source code for computer program modules (e.g., modules of code implementing ibook functions, such as demons or plug-ins) or descriptions of inventive ideas. An ibook may contain a number of different types of contributions, such as essays, songs, and video clips, structured around a central theme. If desired, ibooks may be set up to support more limited types of media and more focused formats. For example, an ibook might be devoted to a mystery novel, might contain only contemporary music, or might be devoted to a programming environment for a particular computer programming language.","Ibooks may initially be supported by a sponsor who sets up an ibook on an ibook server and who may, for example, advertise that ibook's presence and chosen theme by arranging to have suitable information regarding the ibook included in Web index . One way in which to set up an ibook is to replicate the structure and possibly the contents of an existing ibook. For example, a sponsor at ibook server  might replicate ibook A from the ibook server  of a parent organization thereby creating ibook A\u2032 at ibook server .","People who wish to contribute content to an ibook must typically enroll with that ibook prior to making any contributions. Each ibook therefore has an associated community of contributors. Although contributors to an ibook may often make contributions that are completely their own, contributors may also make contributions that are based upon the previously contributed material of another contributor or contributors. The ultimate contents of a given ibook is therefore usually a collaborative effort between many contributors.","A viewer at ibook client  can preferably view the material contributed to an ibook without enrolling as a contributor. \u201cViewing\u201d (by a contributor or by a viewer) includes reading, listening, and observing any type of contributed material that is contained in an ibook and its behavior. Presentation of ibook material for viewing may involve the execution of computer code associated with or contained in that material.","Contributed material is preferably stored in the form of ibook web pages , as shown in . An important aspect of any ibook is that it allows derivations of contributed material to be created by adding additional Web pages. The ibook system supports derivations that are alternate versions of existing works. For example, if contributor Smith writes several chapters of a book, contributor Jones may modify a chapter to create his own alternate version of that chapter. An association between the original and alternate versions of this material is preferably automatically made by the ibook system. The association is indicated by forming derivation link  and attribution link .","If contributor Brown creates alternate versions of the material of contributors Smith and Jones, derivation links , , and  and attribution links , , and  are formed. Derivation and attribution links are used by the system when navigating through ibook Web pages . For example, when a viewer wishes to view a given portion of an ibook, derivation links , , and  may be used to present the viewer with the option of viewing the alternate versions of the material as well as the original version. Likewise, attribution links , , and  may be used to present the viewer with the option of viewing the original version of an alternate version.","In addition to creating derivations that are alternate versions of existing material, contributors can create derivations which are usually viewed in parallel to existing material. For example, a contributor may wish to create a running commentary on a multimedia segment or a song. Although the commentary is not an alternate version of the existing material, it is related in such a way that it is appropriate to recognize the original contributor. Another example is multiple audio tracks, which may be listened to and mixed in varying proportions in parallel. The ibook system facilitates the automatic or nearly automatic generation of derivation and attribution links between the original material and the derivations. The ibook system uses the attribution link information for navigating and to ensure that contributors are rewarded for their efforts. The ibook system uses the derivation link information to facilitate navigation through ibook material and thereby encourage contributions by ensuring that a contributor's material may be viewed.","A derivation may contain a quotation of existing material when a contributor creates material that is in part the same as that previously contributed by another contributor.","A derivation may be a revision of a work if it contains all of the previous work except errors and material that the contributor believes is inappropriate. The revision may have additional material that the contributor believes should have been in the original work. For example, the original material might be a rough draft of a speech, whereas the revision might be the final draft of the speech.","A derivation may be a combination containing material derived from two separate sources. For example, a derivation might be a story containing portions of stories from two different authors or a sequence of musical fragments from different composers or a mix of multiple tracks into a single song.","A derivation may be a sequel in which the subject, characters, and context of a previous work are extended into a new area. A sequel is typically intended to be viewed after the original, rather than in place of the original.","A derivation may be a transcription that contains material in a different media or language than the original material. For example, the original might contain English text and the transcription might contain the same material in French. Alternatively, the original material might contain the score of a song and the transcription might contain a recording of a performer singing the song. If the original contains a Java script for an applet, the transcription might contain an Active object that performs the same function as the Java script. If the original contains computer source code, the transcription may contain a translated or compiled version of the code.","A derivation may be an invocation which may be encountered, e.g., in the programming context. An invocation employs the contents and capabilities of an original work for the benefit of the invocation. If the original material changes, these changes are presented the next time that the invocation is viewed. Invocations therefore allow for a dynamic reference to previously contributed material.","A derivation may contain the same material as an existing work, but with a different quality or resolution. For example, it may be desired to store a high fidelity audio track at one location and a lower fidelity version of the same track at a different location.","A collaborative derivation may be created by a contributor who is viewing the work of another contributor without explicitly incorporating the work of the other contributor. For example, a composer may create a track of a song while listening to an existing track of another composer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["52","54","56","58","60","62","54","56","54","56","54","54","62","58","60","58","62"]},"Ibook functions are preferably performed by executing instructions with ibook server  and with client . Ibook server application  directs the overall operation of ibook server . In particular, ibook server application  controls databases , , , , , and , in which various ibook information is stored. Ibook demons  are programs associated with ibook server application , but which run continuously or semicontinuously in the background. Ibook demons  perform functions such as revenue collection, revenue distribution, and advertising.","Client plug-ins  are downloadable executable program modules that can be run on client  in conjunction with Web browser  to add additional capabilities to Web browser . Web browser  is preferably a standard Web browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. Downloading of client plug-ins  can be accomplished using standard techniques, such as the standard Internet file transfer protocol (FTP). When client plug-ins  are downloaded onto client , they form tools , , , and . Web browser  also controls local access database , which may be used to store information regarding the amount of time a user (i.e., a viewer or a viewing contributor) spends viewing a particular portion of an ibook. Currently downloaded Web pages  are downloaded from ibook Web pages database .","Users of a given ibook are preferably either enrolled as viewers or contributors. Viewers can view any of the material in an ibook with which they have enrolled, but cannot make contributions to the ibook. Contributors can contribute new material or can create a derivation based on previously contributed material in an ibook. Because contributors must be able to view material before it can used to create a derivation, contributors are also given rights to view ibook material.","By enrolling, both viewers and contributors agree not to violate the rights of other contributors (e.g., by copying material from an ibook without permission). Contributors must also agree to allow their works to become the basis for the works of other contributors, so that participating in an ibook is a collaborative effort.","Enrollment is preferably automated and on-line. At ibook client , the functions necessary to support enrollment are provided by ibook enrollment tool  and web browser . At ibook server , enrollment functions are provided by ibook server application . Ibook server application  downloads enrollment tool  to ibook client , and stores enrollment information in the ibook server databases. Ibook server application stores viewer enrollment information in viewer database  and contributor enrollment information in contributor database .","A suitable process for enrolling viewers is shown in . At step , an interested party begins the process of enrolling as a viewer, e.g., by clicking on an icon labeled \u201cenroll as viewer.\u201d The nature, obligations, and benefits of enrolling as a viewer of the ibook are explained to the interested party at step . At step , the party is asked whether enrollment is desired. If the party declines enrollment at step , viewer enrollment terminates at step . If the party accepts enrollment, enrollment information, such as the party's address, electronic billing information, credit card number, etc., is collected at step .","Provided that the enrollment information collected at step  does not reveal a reason that the party cannot be enrolled, the party is offered an opportunity to sign up as an ibook viewer at step . If the party does not sign up at step , viewer enrollment terminates at step . If the party decides to sign up, signing up can be accomplished by a number of techniques, including clicking on an icon, typing the words \u201cI ACCEPT\u201d, transmitting an electronic signature, live teleconference with an ibook representative, voice-mail, fax, mail, or a combination of these techniques. After signing up at step , information concerning the viewer and the viewer enrollment process is stored in viewer database  at step .","At step , ibook server application  generates a viewer ID for the viewer. The viewer ID is used to access the ibook with which the viewer has enrolled. If desired, the viewer ID can be used in conjunction with additional security measures, such as a password, etc. The viewer enrollment process ends at step .","A suitable process for enrolling contributors is shown in . At step , an interested party begins the process of enrolling as a contributor, e.g., by clicking on an icon labeled \u201cenroll as contributor.\u201d The nature, obligations, and benefits of enrolling as a contributor of the ibook are explained to the interested party at step . At step , the party is asked whether enrollment is desired. If the party declines enrollment at step , contributor enrollment terminates at step . If the party accepts enrollment, enrollment information, such as the party's address and electronic banking information, is collected at step .","Provided that the enrollment information collected at step  does not reveal a reason that the party cannot be enrolled, the party is offered an opportunity to sign up as an ibook contributor at step . If the party does not sign up at step , contributor enrollment terminates at step . If the party decides to sign up, signing up can be accomplished by a number of suitable techniques, including clicking on an icon, typing the words \u201cI ACCEPT\u201d, transmitting an electronic signature, live teleconference with an ibook representative, voice-mail, fax, mail, or a combination of these techniques. After signing up at step , information concerning the contributor and the contributor enrollment process is stored in contributor database  () at step . At step , ibook server application  generates a contributor ID for the contributor. The contributor ID is used to access the ibook with which the contributor has enrolled. If desired, the contributor ID can be used in conjunction with additional security measures, such as a password, etc. The contributor enrollment process ends at step .","Once enrolled with an ibook, a contributor may view material in the ibook, may create new original material, or may contribute material derived from that contributed by other contributors to create a derivation. Derivation types supported by the ibook system include alternate versions, commentaries, quotations, revisions, combinations, sequels, transcriptions, invocations, alternate resolutions, and collaborations. To create or modify material in an ibook, a contributor uses ibook authoring tool  (). As shown in , ibook authoring tool  includes derivation tool , linking tool , and editing tool . Editing tool  is used to enter original material and linking tool  is used to create hypertext links to existing material.","Derivation tool  is used to create material based on existing material. Preferably, derivation tool  provides style templates for different types of derivations. When a contributor wishes to create a derivation based on existing material, the contributor selects from the available derivation types (e.g., alternate version, commentary, quotation, revision, combination, sequel, transcription, invocation, alternate resolution, and collaboration). When the contributor creates the derivation, (e.g., by creating commentary based on an existing video work), derivation tool  automatically or semi-automatically generates attribution information identifying the work from which the derivation was derived. Attribution information may be automatically generated by navigation tool  when a contributor creates a derivation of existing source code (e.g., using the contributor's compiler).","The functions provided by authoring tool  may differ depending on the content of a particular ibook passage. For example, editing tool  preferably supports standard word processing functions for entering text and source code and supports graphics, animation, audio, and video editing functions for creating and modifying multimedia material. Editing tool  also preferably supports creation of audio material from telephone calls and audio-visual material from video conferencing sources. Authoring tool  preferably prevents the deletion of previously contributed material and facilitates the creation of material derived from previously contributed material.","The structure of the content of an illustrative ibook is shown in detail in . The material contributed to an ibook is contained in one or more Web pages. The content of the ibook Web pages is preferably stored in ibook Web pages database  (). Ibook Web pages  may contain both static Web pages and Web pages with content that changes dynamically whenever referenced. Web pages  include welcome message page  to introduce a user to the ibook. If desired, welcome message page  can include summary information concerning the content of ibook web pages . For example, welcome message page  can include information regarding the authors who have contributed material, the dates on which material was contributed, the sponsor's description of the theme of the ibook, the specific subject matter contained in the ibook, the media used, etc. Welcome page  preferably includes hypertext links to viewer, contributor, and sponsor enrollment pages. It is not possible to proceed past welcome page  without enrolling with the ibook. After viewing welcome message page  and completing an appropriate enrollment process, users can view, add, or create derivative material using authoring tool  ().","In , ibook Web pages , ,  were contributed by contributor Smith, ibook Web page  was contributed by contributor Jones, and ibook Web page  was contributed by contributor Brown. Contributor Smith was the first contributor, and his pages were added as original material. Contributor Jones added material that was based on some of the material contributed by contributor Smith. Contributor Brown added material that was based on material contributed by Smith and material contributed by Jones.","Web pages , , , , and  are preferably organized in the form of one or more passages . For example, ibook Web page  contains passages , , and  and ibook Web page  contains passages and . The amount and type of material contained in a passage may depend on the type of media used. If an ibook contains only text, passages  may be paragraphs. Alternatively, passages  may be characters, words, sentences, paragraphs, sections, or chapters. If an ibook contains multimedia material, passages  can be graphic images, animation sequences, portions of a sound track, still video images, or video clips. If an ibook contains executable material, passages  can be modules of code.","When an ibook contributor adds material that is based on the material previously contributed by another contributor, attribution information is preferably automatically generated that keeps track of the identity of the source of the material. The attribution information may be provided, for example, in the form of attribution links , , , and  between passages .","Attribution link  indicates that passage , which was contributed by Jones, was based on passage , contributed by Smith. Similarly, attribution link  indicates that passage , which was contributed by Brown, was based on passage , contributed by Smith. Attribution link  indicates that Jones contributed passage based on passage  of Smith. Attribution link  indicates that Brown contributed passage based on passage of Jones.","Attribution information is preferably automatically generated when a contributor copies existing ibook material. For example, contributor Jones may have used a cut and paste feature in derivation tool  to cut and paste text or multimedia material from passage  when creating passage . During the process of cutting and pasting from passage  to passage , authoring tool  automatically generates attribution information including attribution link .","Another way in which attribution information can be generated is when a contributor selects a certain derivation style template with derivation tool , prior to contributing new material. After the style template is selected, derivation tool  prompts the contributor for attribution information, which is used to automatically create attribution links that relate the new material to the original material. For example, Jones may select the derivation type commentary, in order to create a commentary based on passages  and  of Smith's work. Derivation tool  queries Jones as to the authorship of the material on which the commentary is based. Jones must enter suitable information identifying the original contributor's material. Derivation tool  preferably will not let Jones proceed until valid attribution information has been provided. If desired, a system supervisor can monitor the creation and use of attribution information, such as the implementation of attribution links , , , and .","Sequence links , , and  are hypertext links that link welcome message page  and ibook pages , , and . Sequence links ,  and  were created by authoring tool  when contributor Smith created ibook Web pages , , and . Sequence link  was created by contributor Brown using linking tool  (). The creation of sequence links such as sequence link  is at the discretion of the contributor.","Derivation links , , , and  are another type of link that is formed in connection with ibook web pages , , , , and . Derivation links , , , and  preferably point in the opposite direction of attribution links , , , and . Whenever a derivation is formed of an existing passage, a derivation link is formed that indicates that the derived passage has been formed.","Derivation links , , , and  are preferably automatically generated when passages , , , and are created. For example, if a contributor uses a cut and paste feature in derivation tool  to cut and paste material from one passage to another, authoring tool  automatically generates derivation information including derivation links , , , and .","The derivation information for each passage  (e.g., the existence and identity of any associated derivation links for a given passage) and the attribution information (e.g. the existence and identity of any associated attribution links for a given passage) are used by navigation tool  when a user navigates through the material in an ibook. For example, when a user views a passage that has a corresponding derivation, the user can be alerted that the derivation exists and can be given an opportunity to view the derivation. Likewise, when a user views a passage that is a derivation, the user can be alerted that a corresponding original exists. Derivation information and attribution information may be stored in passage database  ().","Multigenerational derivation and attribution relationships exist between passages  (e.g., between passages  and in ). These relationships may either be represented by links between immediately adjoining passages (e.g.  and or  and ) as shown in , or may be represented by direct links between nonadjoining passages (e.g., between passages  and ).","In addition, during the creation of passages  authoring tool  and ibook server application  cause information to be stored in passage database  that identifies which Web page  contains each passage . Information regarding the content of passages  (\u201cpassage characteristics\u201d) is preferably also stored during passage creation. Passage characteristics include the identity of the passage's contributor (which may be stored in contributor database ), the media (e.g., text, audio, video), the time and date of passage creation, the language of the passage, the interpreter for the passage if the passage is executable code, and the subject matter of the passage. Some of these passage characteristics can be determined automatically by ibook system . For example, the identity of the contributor can be determined from the ID number of the contributor. Other passage characteristics might be more easily entered by the contributor, such as the language of the material in the passage. Regardless of how the passage characteristics are entered into system , these characteristics are preferably stored in passage database  and are used during navigation through the ibook.","An illustrative ibook navigation tool  is shown in . In , passages  are illustrated as paragraphs of text . In a multimedia environment, passages  would be multimedia segments presented on a computer monitor as video accompanied by sound. When passages  are executable modules, navigation tool  presents the passages by downloading and executing the passages. Style buttons  allow a user to select a desired format for the presentation of information on client . Each style is controlled by an ibook passage (e.g., a Java program) which implements that style. Suitable styles include a Microsoft Windows 3.1 format with a title bar at the top of the screen or a photorealistic style, in which navigation controls are displayed in a realistic manner (e.g., as a desk containing a file drawer, etc.). Window size buttons  allow the user to adjust the size of the window containing ibook navigation tool  when Web browser  is operating in a windows-type environment. Magnification buttons  allow the user to adjust the magnification of the contents of the display window.","Cursor keys  move cursor  up, down, left, or right within a passage  on a given ibook Web page . If desired, inner portion  of cursor keys  can be used to provide slow cursor movement. Whenever a user moves cursor  into a passage that has an associated derivation or original, the user may be alerted. For example, bar  may be provided in parallel with passage to indicate that a derivation or original exists for that passage, which the user may wish to view. Navigation tool  determines when to display bars such as bar  based on the derivation information (i.e., derivation links , , ,  and derivation type information) and attribution information stored in passage database . Derivation traverse buttons  preferably light up when cursor  enters a passage (such as passage ) that has an associated derivation or original.","Clicking on the right derivation traverse button causes navigation tool to present, e.g., the next most recent derivation associated with that passage and clicking on the left derivation traverse button produces the opposite result. For example, if a user is viewing passage () and the right derivation traverse button  is selected, navigation tool  displays the contents of passage . If, however, a user is viewing passage and the left derivation traverse button  is selected, navigation tool  displays the contents of passage .","Back and forward buttons  allow a user to navigate along a browsing trail through Web pages  that has been defined by the user or a contributor who has previously navigated through the material using scroll buttons  and derivation traverse buttons . Volume buttons  control the sound volume in multimedia material. Multiple volume control buttons are preferably provided to control the mix when playing audio tracks in parallel.","An additional navigation control feature provided by navigation tool  is drop-down menu . The user can make selections with drop-down menu  that aid in navigating ibook passages . For example, drop-down menu  may contain a list of all derivations and original material associated with the passage that the user is currently viewing. The user can navigate to one of these derivations or originals by selecting a desired entry or entries from the list. Drop-down menu  can also contain a list of common passage characteristics, such as media type, identity of contributor, date of creation, language, and subject matter (e.g., as predefined by keywords entered by the contributor or extracted from passages  automatically by the ibook system). If desired, a user can view only the works of Jones by selecting \u201cJones\u201d from drop down menu . Similarly, if the user were only interested in viewing material in English, the user could select English under the drop-down menu heading entitled \u201clanguage.\u201d","If desired, the manner in which passages  are presented to a viewer by navigation tool  may be based in part on derivation type information associated with a passage. For example, if a passage is a revision of a previous passage, navigation tool  can, as a default, present only the most recent version of the passage. If a passage is an alternate version of another passage, navigation tool  can, as a default, offer the user a choice of viewing either passage. If a passage is a transcription of another passage, then navigation tool  can present both the original passage and the transcribed passage on the screen of client  at the same time, in a split screen format. Navigation tool  could give priority to a particular media (such as video) when derivations of the same passage are present in more than one type of media. Viewer preferences that may be used to automatically chose between alternative passages are preferably stored in the viewer database . If a passage is a combination, navigation tool  may enable a user to view the components of the combination sequentially (e.g., when the components are chapters in a book) or in parallel (e.g., when the components are audio tracks in a song).","As a user views passages , ibook server application  preferably stores information concerning which passages have been accessed in access database . Web browser  and ibook navigation tool  are also involved in keeping track of the length of time a user views each passage. This information is used to reward the contributors whose material is viewed. In addition, the contributors whose material was used to form the basis of the viewed work are rewarded. Contributors may therefore be compensated, even if their work is not accessed and viewed directly by the user. For example, if Smith contributes a book and Jones writes an alternate chapter, both Jones and Smith may be rewarded when the alternate chapter is viewed. The process of rewarding contributors may be substantially automatic and may be administered by ibook server  of the current ibook sponsor or may be administered by ibook server  at the ibook parent organization.","As the user navigates through an ibook using navigation tool , navigation tool  transmits certain access information to server , making requests to view material. The steps involved in processing and storing the access information are shown in . At step , the user at client  determines which passage is to be viewed, for example, by using the various buttons provided by navigation tool  (). Navigation tool  preferably generates a request to view a desired passage and transmits this request to server  at step . Server application  at server  receives the request and locates the requested passage in ibook Web pages database  at step . At step , server  records information about the access request, such as a time and date entry identifying when the requested access took place. Server  transmits the requested passage to client  at step . Client  displays the passage and may make a time and date entry in local access database  at step . If time and date entries are made in local access database , this information is periodically made available to server  for storage in access database . At step , the user completes viewing of the passage and at step , client  transmits information indicating that viewing is complete to server . At step , server  records access information in access database  that indicates when the viewing of the passage was completed, e.g., by making a time and date entry.","As defined herein, the term \u201caccess information\u201d includes information such as a passage identifier, time and date entries, and information indicating the nature of the transmission from client  to server . The passage identifier is preferably a universal resource locator (URL) for the passage requested from the ibook Web pages database . The information indicating the nature of the transmission indicates whether the transmission from client  to server  is a request for the display of a passage (shown by arrow ) or is a transmission indicating that the user has completed viewing the passage (shown by arrow ).","Ibook functions related to revenue collection and distribution are preferably provided by ibook demons  (). An illustrative revenue collection process that is implemented with an ibook demon  is shown in . The revenue collection process shown in  may be run periodically (e.g., once per day). As shown in , server  scans access database  to collect all access records for the user who has viewed material at step . The access records contain information regarding the number of accesses of ibook material that were made and the start and stop times of each access. At step , server  charges the user who has viewed material according to a predetermined rate schedule. For example, the user can be billed based on the on-line time spent by the user accessing ibook material or the user can be billed based on the number of accesses made. If desired, the user can be billed at a flat rate. At step , the users's account balance is adjusted accordingly. The user is billed (e.g., by mail or automatic credit card debit) at step .","Automatic revenue distribution may be performed by ibook demons  that implement the processes shown in .  shows a process for collating passage information from access database . The steps shown in  are performed for each passage in ibook Web pages database . At step , access database  is scanned for records containing access information pertaining to the passage. At step , server  uses these records to update passage database  to reflect the amount that the passage has been directly accessed by a viewer (e.g., using navigation tool , as shown in ). The \u201camount\u201d that the passage has been accessed can be determined based on the cumulative access time for that passage and\/or the number of \u201chits\u201d the passage has received (as determined from the access information in the access database). When a contributor's material is directly accessed by the user, the material is being directly used and the contributor is rewarded based on the amount of that access.","Preferably, a contributor is also rewarded when a derivation based on the contributor's material is accessed. When the derivation is accessed, the contributor's material is being indirectly used. At step , server  uses attribution information associated with each passage that has been accessed to determine whether the passage was based on the work of another contributor. If the passage was based on the passage of another contributor, the passage database  is updated based on the attribution information. There are preferably separate data fields associated with each passage in passage database  that allow passage database  to maintain a record of the amount of direct and indirect usage for each passage. For example, each passage can have associated data fields in which the number of direct hits and the number of indirect hits (i.e., hits on a derivation based on the passage) are stored.","After the process of  is used to update the passages in passage database  to reflect the amount of direct and indirect usage of these passages by users, the process of  is used to collate this information for each of the contributors and to reward the contributors accordingly. The process steps of  are performed for each contributor. At step , server  scans passage database  for the passages contributed by the contributor. The total amount that these passages have been directly used (e.g., when a viewer directly accesses a passage) is determined at step . For example, if each of the contributor's passages in the passage database  has an associated data field that indicates the amount of direct use for that passage, step  involves totaling the amount of such direct use for all of the passages. The total amount that the contributor's passages have been indirectly used (e.g., when a viewer accesses a derivation based on the contributor's passage) is determined at step . For example, if each of the contributor's passages in the passage database  has an associated data field that indicates the amount of indirect use of those passages, step  involves totaling the amount of such indirect use for all of the passages.","The contributor is rewarded at step . If desired, the contributor may receive a non-monetary reward. For example, ibook server  may publicly post the amount that the contributor's material receives hits, which serves to reward contributors with publicity regarding the popularity of the material they contribute. Contributors may also be rewarded by distributing revenue that has been collected from the users with the process of  or that has been generated by licensing intellectual property developed by the community of contributors associated with an ibook. Preferably, the contributor is rewarded based on both the direct use of the contributor's material (e.g., by direct viewer access) and on the indirect use of the material (e.g., access of a derivation based on the contributor's material).","Monetary rewards may be distributed automatically, e.g., by crediting the bank accounts of the relevant contributors. Preferably, the sponsor of the ibook that is viewed is also rewarded. If desired, the ibook parent organization may be compensated. If the structure or content of an ibook (e.g., ibook A in ) is replicated to form a second ibook (e.g., ibook A\u2032 in ), this information (or references to this information) is stored in ibook offspring database  and may be used to compensate the sponsor and contributors of the parenting ibook (ibook A) for revenue derived from the offspring ibook (ibook A\u2032).","The replication function used to replicate ibook A\u2032 from ibook A in  may be provided by a program that prompts an enrolled sponsor for information concerning the replication process (i.e., by a wizard program). The program used for replication is preferably a downloadable plug-in, such as ibook replication tool  (). Steps involved in replication of an ibook are shown in . At step , a potential sponsor completes an enrollment process similar to the viewer and contributor enrollment processes shown in . During the enrollment process, the nature, obligations, and benefits of becoming a sponsor of an ibook are explained. A sponsor who has already created a new ibook may enroll with additional ibooks so that the sponsor will be permitted to replicate material from any such additional ibooks into the new ibook. If the sponsor agrees to the rules governing ibook sponsorship and the replication of material from an existing ibook, the sponsor is enrolled.","At step , the sponsor specifies the identity of the child ibook server onto which a new ibook is to be placed or onto which additional material is to be replicated. At step , the sponsor specifies the identity of the new ibook. At step , it is determined whether the child server identified at step  has a server application installed. If the server application is not installed, server application  from the parent ibook with which the sponsor has enrolled is replicated (e.g. by downloading or referencing) at step . If server application  is already installed, step  is bypassed. At step , the sponsor selects which ibook demons  it is desired to replicate from the parent server to the child server. The selected demons  are replicated at step . At step , the sponsor selects which ibook parent plug-ins  are to be replicated onto the child server. The selected plug-ins are replicated at step . At step , it is determined whether ibook databases have been initialized on the child server. If not, the child ibook server databases are initialized at step . If the child ibook server databases have already been initialized, step  is bypassed.","At step , the sponsor decides whether content of the parent ibook (e.g., in the form of text or multimedia information stored in ibook Web pages database  and linking information stored in passage database ) should be replicated from the parent server onto the child server. The selected ibook Web pages and associated linking information are replicated from the parent server to the child server at step . The child ibook databases are updated at step . Information concerning the replication process is stored in offspring database . Replication terminates at step . The content of multiple ibook parents can be merged into a single child ibook by repeating the process of .","Because the ibook can be replicated, successful ibooks can spawn additional ibooks. Further, since ibooks may be created to specifically support certain media or themes, different ibooks may spawn different families of offspring ibooks each of which has an associated community of interested users.","In order to ensure that the presence of an ibook is known to those who would be interested in contributing to or viewing the content of the ibook, ibooks preferably support various functions for advertizing their presence to popular search engine databases. Suitable search engines to which the ibook can advertize its presence include Yahoo, Alta Vista, and Lycos. One suitable way in which to advertise the presence of an ibook is for ibook server application  () to send suitably formatted e-mail messages to the Web site manager at the Web site address associated with the various search engines. As shown in , search engine server  contains Web index . Ibook server application  or an ibook demon  may automatically extract hypertext markup language (HTML) keyword information from the ibook Web pages stored in ibook Web pages database  and\/or the passage characteristics for these Web pages stored in ibook passage database  and submit this information for inclusion in Web index . Ibook authoring tool  preferably also presents the contributor with queries for keywords during the authoring process. This keyword information can also be submitted for inclusion in Web index .","If desired, the ibook server associated with the ibook parent organization can be used to support a comprehensive database. The ibook server application  of each existing ibook can provide keyword and other ibook indexing information to this database.","Certain aspects involved in using an ibook system to facilitate the creation of musical works are shown in . In ibook system , a first composer at client  records a high-fidelity track (track A) in the form of ibook passage  using ibook authoring tool . For example, the first composer may create a rhythm guitar track to form the basis of a new song. Because high-fidelity audio requires a substantial amount of memory to store, the first composer can create a low-fidelity derivation of track A on server  as passage  and make this version available to other ibook contributors. Passage  is an alternate resolution derivation of passage  and has an associated derivation link . Attribution link  shows that passage  was derived from passage .","The low-fidelity version of track A in passage  can be viewed (listened to) by a second composer at client , who can then add material, such as a vocal track. Low-fidelity passage  contains less information than the corresponding high-fidelity passage , so it is easier to provide passage  to client . The second composer may listen to the contents of passage  in realtime over data network , or a local copy of passage  can be downloaded onto client . Playback of low-fidelity track A may be accomplished using navigation tool . If desired, the second composer can use authoring tool  to add a vocal track, while listening to the rhythm guitar track of the first composer. A high-fidelity version of the vocal track (track B) can be stored on client  in passage . Passage  is a collaboration derivation of passage  and has an associated derivation link  and attribution link . The second composer can create a low-fidelity version of track B on server  in passage . Passage  is an alternate resolution derivation of passage  and has an associated derivation link . Attribution link  shows that page  was derived from page .","Authoring tool  preferably supports the automatic generation of derivation and attribution information during the process of recording new tracks based on previously contributed tracks. Ibook navigation tool  allows users to listen to multiple tracks in parallel, in the form of a song. Users can select which tracks are played back and the mix of the track using tools such as drop down menu  and volume buttons for each track. For example, the user can elect to hear only those tracks contributed by a certain composer. In addition, contributors can create songs by copying selected tracks and editing them using authoring tool .","Server  maintains sufficient information concerning original passages  and  to allow passages  and  to be copied to server  or any suitable location upon request. For example, server  may contain the URLs of passages  and  in ibook databases such as passage database  and ibook Web pages database . If desired, the URLs of passages  and  can be used by navigation tool  and authoring tool  to play back the high-fidelity versions of tracks A and B.","Although various information concerning the ibook passages, such as derivation linking information, derivation type information, passage characteristics, and attribution information have been described as being stored in passage databases, a suitable alternative is to store this information in the Web pages that contain the passages or as a set of relations and tables in a suitable relational database, or as a set of objects in an object database. Another suitable alternative is to use linking technology, such as Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) or Component Object Model (COM) technology to represent the passages and their attribution and derivation relationships.","Various techniques may be used to represent the contents of ibook Web pages (e.g., the ibook Web pages in ibook Web pages database ). For example, ibook Web pages may be represented by static data. Alternatively, ibook Web pages may be represented by code that is capable of generating the Web page contents, e.g., code that generates the entries of a table or list. If desired, ibook Web pages on a given server or client may be represented by a reference (e.g., a URL) to material that is actually stored elsewhere in the data network.","In addition, although the data network preferably supports the HTML protocol that is commonly used to implement World Wide Web communications (because the HTML format has the advantages of standardization, wide-use, and sufficient capacity to implement the features of the ibook system), other protocols may be used, such as one based on Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) or Structured Generalized Markup Language (SGML) or any client-server transaction-based packet-switched protocol.","The foregoing is merely illustrative of the principles of this invention and various modifications can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 14"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
