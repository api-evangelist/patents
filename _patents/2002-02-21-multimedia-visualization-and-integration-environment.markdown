No. 08\/995,616, entitled \u201cAUTOMATIC ADAPTIVE DOCUMENT READING HELP SYSTEM\u201d filed Dec. 22, 1997, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.","The present application incorporates by reference for all purposes the entire contents of U.S. Non-Provisional application Ser. No. 10\/001,895, entitled \u201cPAPER-BASED INTERFACE FOR MULTIMEDIA INFORMATION\u201d filed Nov. 19, 2001.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the xerographic reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure in exactly the form it appears in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","The present invention relates to user interfaces for displaying information and more particularly to user interfaces for retrieving and displaying multimedia information that may be stored in a multimedia document.","With rapid advances in computer technology, an increasing amount of information is being stored in the form of electronic (or digital) documents. These electronic documents include multimedia documents that store multimedia information. The term \u201cmultimedia information\u201d is used to refer to information that comprises information of several different types in an integrated form. The different types of information included in multimedia information may include a combination of text information, graphics information, animation information, sound (audio) information, video information, slides information, whiteboard information, and other types of information. Multimedia information is also used to refer to information comprising one or more objects wherein the objects include information of different types. For example, multimedia objects included in multimedia information may comprise text information, graphics information, animation information, sound (audio) information, video information, slides information, whiteboard information, and other types of information. Multimedia documents may be considered as compound objects that comprise video, audio, closed-caption text, keyframes, presentation slides, whiteboard capture information, as well as other multimedia type objects. Examples of multimedia documents include documents storing interactive web pages, television broadcasts, videos, presentations, or the like.","Several tools and applications are conventionally available that allow users to play back, store, index, edit, or manipulate multimedia information stored in multimedia documents. Examples of such tools and\/or applications include proprietary or customized multimedia players (e.g., RealPlayer\u2122 provided by RealNetworks, Microsoft Windows Media Player provided by Microsoft Corporation, QuickTime\u2122 Player provided by Apple Corporation, Shockwave multimedia player, and others), video players, televisions, personal digital assistants (PDAs), or the like. Several tools are also available for editing multimedia information. For example, Virage, Inc. of San Mateo, Calif. (www.virage.com) provides various tools for viewing and manipulating video content and tools for creating video databases. Virage, Inc. also provides tools for face detection and on-screen text recognition from video information.","Given the vast number of electronic documents, readers of electronic documents are increasingly being called upon to assimilate vast quantities of information in a short period of time. To meet the demands placed upon them, readers find they must read electronic documents \u201chorizontally\u201d rather than \u201cvertically,\u201d i.e., they must scan, skim, and browse sections of interest in one or more electronic documents rather then read and analyze a single document from start to end. While tools exist which enable users to \u201chorizontally\u201d read electronic documents containing text\/image information (e.g., the reading tool described in U.S. Non-Provisional patent application Ser. No. 08\/995,616), conventional tools cannot be used to \u201chorizontally\u201d read multimedia documents which may contain audio information, video information, and other types of information. None of the multimedia tools described above allow users to \u201chorizontally\u201d read a multimedia document.","In light of the above, there is a need for techniques that allow users to read a multimedia document \u201chorizontally.\u201d Techniques that allow users to view, analyze, and navigate multimedia information stored in multimedia documents are desirable.","The present invention provides techniques for retrieving and displaying multimedia information.

According to an embodiment of the present invention, the present invention takes advantage of the automatic story segmentation and other features that are often provided in close-captioned (CC) text from broadcast news. Most news agencies who provide CC text as part of their broadcast use a special syntax in the CC text (e.g., a \u201c>>>\u201d delimiter to indicate changes in story line or subject, a \u201c>>\u201d delimiter to indicate changes in speakers, etc.). Given the presence of this kind of information in the CC text information included in the multimedia information, the present invention incorporates these features in the text displayed in panel -. For example, a \u201c>>>\u201d delimiter may be displayed to indicate changes in story line or subject, a \u201c>>\u201d delimiter may be displayed to indicate changes in speakers, additional spacing may be displayed between text portions related to different story lines to clearly demarcate the different stories, etc. This enhances the readability of the text information displayed in panel -.","Panel - depicted in GUI  corresponds to thumbnail image - and displays a representation of video information corresponding to the area of thumbnail image - emphasized or covered by thumbnail viewing area lens . Accordingly, panel - displays a representation of video information included in the multimedia information stored by the multimedia document and occurring between times tand tassociated with thumbnail viewing area lens . In the embodiment depicted in , video keyframes extracted from the video information included in the multimedia information are displayed in panel -. A special layout style (which is user-configurable) is used to display the extracted keyframes to enhance readability of the frames.","Various different techniques may be used to display video keyframes in panel -. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the time segment between time tand time tis divided into sub-segments of a predetermined time period.

According to an embodiment of the present invention, the size (or length) of each preview region can be changed and customized by the user. For example, in GUI  depicted in , a handle  is provided that can be used by the user to change the size of preview region . According to an embodiment of the present invention, preview areas may also be provided in second viewing area .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0138","num":"0137"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 13"],"b":["1300","1300"]},"As depicted in , text information is displayed in panel - of third viewing area  in compressed format, i.e., the white spaces between the text lines have been removed. This enhances the readability of the text information. The lines of text displayed in panel - are then used to determine the video frames to be displayed in panel -. According to an embodiment of the present invention, a timestamp is associated with each line of text displayed in panel -. The timestamp associated with a line of text represents the time when the text occurred in the multimedia document being displayed by GUI . In one embodiment, the timestamp associated with a line of text corresponds to the timestamp associated with the first word in the line of text. The lines of text displayed in panel - are then grouped into groups, with each group comprising a pre-determined number of lines.","Video keyframes are then extracted from the video information stored by the multimedia document for each group of lines depending on time stamps associated with lines in the group. According to an embodiment of the present invention, server  determines a start time and an end time associated with each group of lines. A start time for a group corresponds to a time associated with the first (or earliest) line in the group while an end time for a group corresponds to the time associated with the last line (or latest) line in the group. In order to determine keyframes to be displayed in panel - corresponding to a particular group of text lines, server  extracts a set of one or more video keyframes from the portion of the video information occurring between the start and end time associated with the particular group. One or more keyframes are then selected from the extracted set of video keyframes to be displayed in panel - for the particular group. The one or more selected keyframes are then displayed in panel - proximal to the group of lines displayed in panel - for which the keyframes have been extracted.","For example, in , the lines displayed in panel - are divided into groups wherein each group comprises  lines of text. For each group, the time stamp associated with the first line in the group corresponds to the start time for the group while the time stamp associated with the fourth line in the group corresponds to the end time for the group of lines. Three video keyframes are displayed in panel - for each group of four lines of text displayed in panel - in the embodiment depicted in . According to an embodiment of the present invention, the three video keyframes corresponding to a particular group of lines correspond to the first, middle, and last keyframe from the set of keyframes extracted from the video information between the start and end times of the particular group. As described above, various other techniques may also be used to select the video keyframes that are displayed in panel -. For each group of lines displayed in panel -, the keyframes corresponding to the group of lines are displayed such that the keyframes are temporally aligned with the group of lines. In the embodiment depicted in , the height of keyframes for a group of lines is approximately equal to the vertical height of the group of lines.","The number of text lines to be included in a group is user configurable. Likewise, the number of video keyframes to be extracted for a particular group of lines is also user configurable. Further, the video keyframes to be displayed in panel - for each group of lines can also be configured by the user of the present invention.","The manner in which the extracted keyframes are displayed in panel - is also user configurable. Different techniques may be used to show the relationships between a particular group of lines and video keyframes displayed for the particular group of lines. For example, according to an embodiment of the present invention, a particular group of lines displayed in panel - and the corresponding video keyframes displayed in panel - may be color-coded or displayed using the same color to show the relationship. Various other techniques known to those skilled in the art may also be used to show the relationships.","GUI Generation Technique According to an Embodiment of the Present Invention","The following section describes techniques for generating a GUI (e.g., GUI  depicted in ) according to an embodiment of the present invention. For purposes of simplicity, it is assumed that the multimedia information to be displayed in the GUI comprises video information, audio information, and CC text information. The task of generating GUI  can be broken down into the following tasks: (a) displaying thumbnail - displaying text information extracted from the multimedia information in second viewing area ; (b) displaying thumbnail - displaying video keyframes extracted from the video information included in the multimedia information; (c) displaying thumbnail viewing area lens  emphasizing a portion of second viewing area  and displaying information corresponding to the emphasized portion of second viewing area  in third viewing area , and displaying panel viewing area lens  emphasizing a portion of third viewing area  and displaying information corresponding to the emphasized portion of third viewing area  in fourth viewing area ; and (d) displaying information in fifth viewing area .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0145","num":"0144"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 14","FIG. 14"],"b":["1400","312","1","304","104","102","104","102","104","102","104","102","104"]},"As depicted in , the method is initiated when server  accesses multimedia information to be displayed in the GUI (step ). As previously stated, the multimedia information may be stored in a multimedia document accessible to server . As part of step , server  may receive information (e.g., a filename of the multimedia document) identifying the multimedia document and the location (e.g., a directory path) of the multimedia document. A user of the present invention may provide the multimedia document identification information. Server  may then access the multimedia document based upon the provided information. Alternatively, server  may receive the multimedia information to be displayed in the GUI in the form of a streaming media signal, a cable signal, etc. from a multimedia information source. Server system  may then store the multimedia information signals in a multimedia document and then use the stored document to generate the GUI according to the teachings of the present invention.","Server  then extracts text information from the multimedia information accessed in step  (step ). If the multimedia information accessed in step  comprises CC text information, then the text information corresponds to CC text information that is extracted from the multimedia information. If the multimedia information accessed in step  does not comprise CC text information, then in step , the audio information included in the multimedia information accessed in step  is transcribed to generate a text transcript for the audio information. The text transcript represents the text information extracted in step .","The text information determined in step  comprises a collection of lines with each line comprising one or more words. Each word has a timestamp associated with it indicating the time of occurrence of the word in the multimedia information. The timestamp information for each word is included in the CC text information. Alternatively, if the text represents a transcription of audio information, the timestamp information for each word may be determined during the audio transcription process.","As part of step , each line is assigned a start time and an end time based upon words that are included in the line. The start time for a line corresponds to the timestamp associated with the first word occurring in the line, and the end time for a line corresponds to the timestamp associated with the last word occurring in the line.","The text information determined in step , including the timing information, is then stored in a memory location accessible to server  (step ). In one embodiment, a data structure (or memory structure) comprising a linked list of line objects is used to store the text information. Each line object comprises a linked list of words contained in the line. Timestamp information associated with the words and the lines is also stored in the data structure. The information stored in the data structure is then used to generate GUI .","Server  then determines a length or height (in pixels) of a panel (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe text canvas\u201d) for drawing the text information (step ). In order to determine the length of the text canvas, the duration (\u201cduration\u201d) of the multimedia information (or the duration of the multimedia document storing the multimedia document) in seconds is determined. A vertical pixels-per-second of time (\u201cpps\u201d) value is also defined. The \u201cpps\u201d determines the distance between lines of text drawn in the text canvas. The value of pps thus depends on how close the user wants the lines of text to be to each other when displayed and upon the size of the font to be used for displaying the text. According to an embodiment of the present invention, a 5 pps value is specified with a 6 point font. The overall height (in pixels) of the text canvas (\u201ctextCanvasHeight\u201d) is determined as follows:\n\ntextCanvasHeight=duration*pps\n\nFor example, if the duration of the multimedia information is 1 hour (i.e., 3600 seconds) and for a pps value of 5, the height of the text canvas (textCanvasHeight) is 18000 pixels (3600*5).\n","Multipliers are then calculated for converting pixel locations in the text canvas to seconds and for converting seconds to pixels locations in the text canvas (step ). A multiplier \u201cpix_m\u201d is calculated for converting a given time value (in seconds) to a particular vertical pixel location in the text canvas. The pix_m multiplier can be used to determine a pixel location in the text canvas corresponding to a particular time value. The value of pix_m is determined as follows:\n\npix=textCanvasHeight\/duration\n\nFor example, if duration=3600 seconds and textCanvasHeight 18000 pixels, then pix_m=18000\/3600=5.\n","A multiplier \u201csec_m\u201d is calculated for converting a particular pixel location in the text canvas to a corresponding time value. The sec_m multiplier can be used to determine a time value for a particular pixel location in the text canvas. The value of sec_m is determined as follows:\n\nsec=duration\/textCanvasHeight\n\nFor example, if duration=3600 seconds and textCanvasHeight=18000 pixels, then sec_m=3600\/18000=0.2.\n","The multipliers calculated in step  may then be used to convert pixels to seconds and seconds to pixels. For example, the pixel location in the text canvas of an event occurring at time t=1256 seconds in the multimedia information is: 1256*pix_m=1256*5=6280 pixels from the top of the text canvas. The number of seconds corresponding to a pixel location p=231 in the text canvas is: 231*sec_m=231*0.2=46.2 seconds.","Based upon the height of the text canvas determined in step  and the multipliers generated in step , positional coordinates (horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) coordinates) are then calculated for words in the text information extracted in step  (step ). As previously stated, information related to words and lines and their associated timestamps may be stored in a data structure accessible to server . The positional coordinate values calculated for each word might also be stored in the data structure.","The Y (or vertical) coordinate (W) for a word is calculated by multiplying the timestamp (W) (in seconds) associated with the word by multiplier pix_m determined in step . Accordingly:\n\n(in pixels)=*pix\n\nFor example, if a particular word has W=539 seconds (i.e., the words occurs 539 seconds into the multimedia information), then W=539*5=2695 vertical pixels from the top of the text canvas.\n","The X (or horizontal) coordinate (W) for a word is calculated based upon the word's location in the line and the width of the previous words in the line. For example if a particular line (L) has four words, i.e., L: WWWW, then\n\nWof W=0\n\nof =(of )+(Width of )+(Spacing between words)\n\nof =(of )+(Width of )+(Spacing between words)\n\nof =(of )+(Width of )+(Spacing between words)\n","The words in the text information are then drawn on the text canvas in a location determined by the X and Y coordinates calculated for the words in step  (step ).","Server  then determines a height of thumbnail - that displays text information in second viewing area  of GUI  (step ). The height of thumbnail - (ThumbnailHeight) depends on the height of the GUI window used to displaying the multimedia information and the height of second viewing area  within the GUI window.

As depicted in , server  extracts a set of keyframes from the video information included in the multimedia information (step ). The video keyframes may be extracted from the video information by sampling the video information at a particular sampling rate. According to an embodiment of the present invention, keyframes are extracted from the video information at a sampling rate of 1 frame per second. Accordingly, if the duration of the multimedia information is 1 hour (3600 seconds), then 3600 video keyframes are extracted from the video information in step .

In this embodiment, each group comprises video keyframes extracted within an 8 second time period window. For example, if the duration of the multimedia information is 1 hour (3600 seconds) and 3600 video keyframes are extracted from the video information using a sampling rate of 1 frame per second, then if groupTime is set to 8 seconds, the 3600 keyframes will be divided into 450 groups, with each group comprising 8 video keyframes.","A start and an end time are calculated for each group of frames (step ). For a particular group of frames, the start time for the particular group is the timestamp associated with the first (i.e., the keyframe in the group with the earliest timestamp) video keyframe in the group, and the end time for the particular group is the timestamp associated with the last (i.e., the keyframe in the group with the latest timestamp) video keyframe in the group.","For each group of keyframes, server  determines a segment of pixels on a keyframe canvas for drawing one or more keyframes from the group of keyframes (step ). Similar to the text canvas, the keyframe canvas is a panel on which keyframes extracted from the video information are drawn. The height of the keyframe canvas (\u201ckeyframeCanvasHeight\u201d) is the same as the height of the text canvas (\u201ctextCanvasHeight\u201d) described above (i.e., keyframeCanvasHeight==textCanvasHeight). As a result, multipliers pix_m and sec_m (described above) may be used to convert a time value to a pixel location in the keyframe canvas and to convert a particular pixel location in the keyframe canvas to a time value.","The segment of pixels on the keyframe canvas for drawing keyframes from a particular group is calculated based upon the start time and end time associated with the particular group. The starting vertical (Y) pixel coordinate (\u201csegmentStart\u201d) and the end vertical (Y) coordinate (\u201csegmentEnd\u201d) of the segment of pixels in the keyframe canvas for a particular group of keyframes is calculated as follows:\n\nsegmentStart=(Start time of group)*pix\n\nsegmentEnd=(End time of group)*pix\n\nAccordingly, the height of each segment (\u201csegmentHeight\u201d) in pixels of the text canvas is:\n\nsegmentHeight=segmentEnd\u2212segmentStart\n","The number of keyframes from each group of frames to be drawn in each segment of pixels on the text canvas is then determined (step ). The number of keyframes to be drawn on the keyframe canvas for a particular group depends on the height of the segment (\u201csegmentHeight\u201d) corresponding to the particular group. If the value of segmentHeight is small only a small number of keyframes may be drawn in the segment such that the drawn keyframes are comprehensible to the user when displayed in the GUI. The value of segmentHeight depends on the value of pps. If pps is small, then segmentHeight will also be small. Accordingly, a larger value of pps may be selected if more keyframes are to be drawn per segment.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, if the segmentHeight is equal to 40 pixels and each group of keyframes comprises 8 keyframes, then 6 out of the 8 keyframes may be drawn in each segment on the text canvas. The number of keyframes to be drawn in a segment is generally the same for all groups of keyframes, for example, in the embodiment depicted in , six keyframes are drawn in each segment on the text canvas.","After determining the number of keyframes to be drawn in each segment of the text canvas, for each group of keyframes, server  identifies one or more keyframes from keyframes in the group of keyframes to be drawn on the keyframe canvas (step ). Various different techniques may be used for selecting the video keyframes to be displayed in a segment for a particular group of frames. According to one technique, if each group of video keyframes comprises 8 keyframes and if 6 video keyframes are to be displayed in each segment on the keyframe canvas, then server  may select the first two video keyframes, the middle two video keyframes, and the last two video keyframes from each group of video keyframes be drawn on the keyframe canvas. As described above, various other techniques may also be used to select one or more keyframes to displayed from the group of keyframes. For example, the keyframes may be selected based upon the sequential positions of the keyframes in the group of keyframes, based upon time values associated with the keyframes, or based upon other criteria.","According to another technique, server  may use special image processing techniques to determine similarity or dissimilarity between keyframes in each group of keyframes. If six video keyframes are to be displayed from each group, server  may then select six keyframes from each group of keyframes based upon the results of the image processing techniques. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the six most dissimilar keyframes in each group may be selected to be drawn on the keyframe canvas. It should be apparent that various other techniques known to those skilled in the art may also be used to perform the selection of video keyframes.","Keyframes from the groups of keyframes identified in step  are then drawn on the keyframe canvas in their corresponding segments (step ). Various different formats may be used for drawing the selected keyframes in a particular segment. For example, as shown in , for each segment, the selected keyframes may be laid out left-to-right and top-to-bottom in rows of 3 frames. Various other formats known to those skilled in the art may also be used to draw the keyframes on the keyframe canvas. The size of each individual keyframe drawn on the keyframe canvas depends on the height (segmentHeight) of the segment in which the keyframe is drawn and the number of keyframes to be drawn in the segment. As previously stated, the height of a segment depends on the value of pps. Accordingly, the size of each individual keyframe drawn on the keyframe canvas also depends on the value of pps.","Server  then determines a height (or length) of thumbnail - that displays the video keyframes in GUI  (step ).

If the value of \u201ck\u201d is equal to zero, it indicates that the range Rselected in step  is the first range in the set of \u201cN\u201d ranges created for the multimedia information implying that there is no range that occurs before range R.","Accordingly, server  determines if range Rhas a neighboring range that occurs before Rand a neighboring range that occurs after R. This is done by determining if the value of \u201cj\u201d is less than \u201cN\u201d and if the value of \u201ck\u201d is not equal to zero (step ). If the condition in step  is satisfied, then it indicates that the set of \u201cN\u201d ranges comprises a range that is a neighbor of range Rselected in step  and occurs before range R, and a range that is a neighbor of range Rand occurs after range R. In this case, processing continues with step . If the condition in step  is not satisfied, then it indicates that range Rselected in step  is either the first range in the set of \u201cN\u201d ranges implying that there is no range that occurs before range R, and\/or that range Rselected in step  is the last range in the set of \u201cN\u201d ranges implying that there is no range that occurs after range R. In this case, processing continues with step .","If the condition in step  is determined to be true, server  then determines time gaps between ranges Rand Rand between ranges Rand R(step ).

The threshold gap value is user configurable. Accordingly, server  then determines the sizes of the time gaps to determine if range Rcan be combined with one of its neighboring ranges.","Server  then determines which time gap is larger by comparing the values of time gap Gand time gap G(step ).

It should be apparent that various other values may also be used for GapThreshold.","If it is determined in step  that the time gap (G) between range Rand range Ris less than or equal to threshold gap value GapThreshold (i.e., G\u2266Gap Threshold), then ranges Rand Rare combined to form a single range (step ). The process of combining ranges Rand Rinvolves changing the end time of range Rto the end time of range R(i.e., Rof Ris set to Rof R) and deleting range R. Processing then continues with step  wherein the value of variable \u201ci\u201d is incremented by one.","If it is determined in step  that time gap Gis greater than GapThreshold (i.e., G>GapThreshold), it indicates that both ranges Rand Rare outside the threshold gap value and as a result range Rcannot be combined with either range Ror R.
