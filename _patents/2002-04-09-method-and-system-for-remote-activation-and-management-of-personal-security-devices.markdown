No. 09\/844,246 filed Apr. 30, 2001, now abandoned, and which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/844,272 filed Apr. 30, 2001, now U.S. Pat.

No. 7,363,486 issued Apr. 22, 2008.","The present invention relates to a data processing method and system for remote activation and management of Personal Security Devices (PSD) over a network for purposes of obtaining services or data from one or more Remote Computer Systems. More particularly, the invention relates to a secure single-step method of activating and managing a Personal Security Device.","The current art involving the management of Personal Security Devices (PSD), for example, smart cards, requires a multi-step process where all the information necessary to use a PSD is loaded into this PSD prior to distribution, including an initial Personal Identification Number or PIN. The PSD is then sent to the end user followed by a separate letter containing the initial PIN which the user must enter the first time the PSD is used. Another current alternative affixes an adhesive label containing a telephone number on a PSD prior to issuance. This label provides instructions for the end user to telephone a call center to activate the PSD before the device can be used.","The latter and former methods constitute multi-step processes, which adds considerably to the initial distribution and subsequent management costs of the PSDs. For example, in issuing smart cards, additional equipment, maintenance, labor and operating costs are required to generate either the separate mailings containing an initial PIN, or to generate adhesive labels to be placed on the smart cards and to operate the call centers which activate the cards.","Another major drawback of the current art concerns the lack of ability to manage information contained within the PSD after the device is issued. Currently, PSDs, which require changes, are either sent back to a central location or simply discarded and replaced with a new device. Both processes are time consuming and costly.","It is an object of the present invention to provides a post-issuance method for securely downloading and managing information inside the protected domain of a PSD.","This object is achieved with a method for activating and\/or managing at least one PSD with at least a first Remote Computer System over a first network using at least one Client as a host to said at least one PSD, said method comprising the steps of:\n\n","This improvement over the current art utilizes a communications pipe which allows downloading of information into a blank PSD and subsequently managing that information. For purposes of this invention, a blank PSD lacks proprietary algorithms and\/or data but does contain an embedded runtime environment and optionally a unique identifier code.","In a first embodiment of the method of the invention, said remote storage location is in said at least first Remote Computer System.","In a second embodiment of the method of the invention, said remote storage location is in an at least one subsequent Remote Computer System functionally connected to said at least first Remote Computer System over a second network, and said step b) comprises the step of transmitting said proprietary information from said at least one subsequent Remote Computer System to said at least first Remote Computer System through said second network.","These embodiments allow either the Remote Computer System maintaining the communications pipe (first embodiment) or a subsequent Remote Computer System (second embodiment) to download proprietary information such as authentication algorithms, cryptographic keys, credentials or certificates directly into a PSD connected to a local Client through the communications pipe without disclosing proprietary information to the local Client.","A major advantage of the method of the invention is that it allows blank PSDs to be issued in bulk and activated at a future date without risk of compromise. Since no proprietary data is included in a bulk distribution, the PSDs are not usable to gain access to secure functions or data.","An example process by which a blank PSD becomes activated is as follows; an end user, who has previously received a blank PSD, connects the PSD to a local Client and accesses a predetermined site over a network located on a Remote Computer System. The Remote Computer System may optionally perform end user authentication by some predetermined method such as prompting for a social security number, static PIN, mother's maiden name, etc. Alternatively, authentication may be implied using a unique identifier contained within the PSD.","Once the end user is properly authenticated or valid PSD connected, a Remote Computer System forms a communications pipe and downloads (first embodiment), or causes a subsequent Remote Computer System to download (second embodiment), the necessary information through the communications pipe and into the PSD. The PSD may become activated upon completion of the process or as an additional security measure, the end user is prompted to devise and enter a unique PIN code to further protect access to the PSD.","In both said embodiments of the invention, a means to manage (e.g. upgrade, change, delete) PSD algorithms and data is facilitated by remotely gaining access to the PSDs and then downloading the changes directly into the PSDs, again without leaving proprietary information on the Clients. Any changes necessary to proprietary information may be performed entirely within the secure domain of the PSD.","In both said embodiments of the invention, all transactions occur within the secure domain of a PSD and a secure remote computer system, thus providing end-to-end security.","In said second embodiment of the invention, a centralized depository for tracking of PSD changes is provided, which greatly simplifies the management of large numbers of PSDs.","It is another object of the invention to provide a system for implementing the above-mentioned method.","In a first part (section 5.1.), the present Detailed Description of the Invention will disclose how to establish a plain communications pipe and a secure communications pipe between a PSD and a Remote Computer System.","In a second part (section 5.2.), the present Detailed Description of the Invention will disclose how to enhance security of an authentication process of a PSD vis-\u00e0-vis a Remote Computer System using said secure communications pipe, and how to use said Remote Computer System as a secure hub for authentication of said PSD vis-\u00e0-vis a plurality of subsequent Remote Computer Systems.","In a third part (section 5.3.), the present Detailed Description of the Invention will disclose a post-issuance method and system for securely downloading and managing information inside the protected domain of a PSD.","Said second part of the Detailed Description will be based on the use of a secure communications pipe, but the present invention is not limited to such a use.","The use of a plain communications pipe, i.e. of a communications pipe which does not involve end-to-end cryptographic mechanisms, falls within the scope of the present invention.","Note also that the following description of the invention will be based on a PSD which receives and sends APDU\u2014(Application Protocol Data Unit)\u2014formatted messages.","APDU messaging format, which is per se known in the art, is a lower-level messaging format which allows a PSD to communicate with higher-level applications located in devices to which the PSD is to be connected.","It must be clear that the present invention is not limited to the use of an APDU messaging format, and that any other low-level messaging format that can be processed by the PSD enters within the scope of the present invention.","Referring to , a generalized system block diagram of the architectures of a Client  and of a Remote Computer System is depicted. The various layers shown are based on the Open System Interconnection model (OSI). For simplicity, certain layers common to both the Client and Remote Computer System are not shown and should be assumed to be present and incorporated into adjacent layers.

Outgoing APDUs generated by the PSD are communicated through the PSD Hardware Device Interface  through the I\/O device port to the PSD Software Interface  and subsequently communicated to the Pipe Client .","A first specialized program contained within the API Layer  of the Remote Computer System  and referred to as an APDU Interface , translates higher level messaging formats into low-level APDU messaging format required to communicate with a PSD .

Likewise the connection  between the Client  and the network , and the connection  between the Remote Computer System  and the network  may be accomplished analogously.","The network, shown generally at , includes both public and private telecommunications networks connected by traditional electrical, optical, electro-acoustical (DTMF) or by other wireless means.

The encapsulated APDUs are then sent  to the Communications Programs S for incorporation into outgoing message packets .","The message packets  containing the encapsulated APDUs are transmitted  over the network  via a Network Interface Card (I\/O) S. The Client  receives the message packets  containing the encapsulated APDUs which are received from the network  via a Network Interface Card (I\/O) C installed on the local Client. The incoming messages are processed by Client-side Communications Programs C and routed  into the Pipe Client  for APDU extraction. The extracted APDUs are sent  through hardware device port , routed  into the PSD Interface  and sent to PSD  via connection  for processing within PSD domain .","Alternative requests to form a plain communications pipe  between a Remote Computer System  and a PSD  may be initiated by Client  requesting access to information contained on one or more networked local Clients, by connecting a PSD  to PSD Interface  which initiates a request to form a plain communications pipe , or by another Remote Computer System requesting access to PSD .","Referring now to , depicts a PSD response which establishes the plain communications pipe between PSD  and Remote Computer System .

For PSDs already containing proprietary information, the algorithm may be the same or a different algorithm, which may include cryptographic capabilities.","Referring to , this drawing illustrates the transfer of proprietary information from a remote storage location \u2032 over a network  and injection into a PSD  using a plurality of remote computer systems , . This second embodiment of the invention involves retrieving proprietary information \u2032 from one or more  remote computer systems, sending  the proprietary information over a network  where the proprietary information is received and processed by a first Remote Computer System  which is supporting a communications pipe  and injected into the secure domain  of the PSD .","This second embodiment of the invention is applicable for either activating a blank PSD or changing information in an active PSD subsequent to authentication. In instances where authentication is required, the Remote Computer System supporting the communications pipe may operate as a secure hub as described in previous section 5.2.","In this second embodiment of the invention, the proprietary information \u2032 is called from a storage location inside a subsequent Remote Computer System  or another Remote Computer System, which is local to, and communicating with, the subsequent Remote Computer System . The proprietary information \u201cI\u2032\u201d \u2032 is retrieved and sent  over the network  to the Remote Computer System  supporting the communications pipe  with the designated PSD .","Remote Computer System  receives the proprietary information through the network interface  and routes the incoming proprietary information \u2032 for processing it  into APDU format and encapsulation into the proper communications messaging format  as described in previous section 5.1. After processing, the message  is sent through the network interface S, into the communications pipe  over network  and received by the client  via a complementary network interface C.","The incoming communications messages are sent  for processing in  where the APDU formatted information is separated as described in previous section 5.1. The separated APDUs are then routed  through the hardware device port  and into  the PSD interface . The incoming APDUs are then routed  into the secure domain  of the PSD  where the information is processed and stored by at least one embedded algorithm.","As previously described, for newly issued PSDs lacking proprietary information, the embedded algorithm is installed by the PSD issuer and functions to manage the initial installation of proprietary information. For PSDs already containing proprietary information, the algorithm may be the same or a different algorithm, which may include cryptographic capabilities.","The foregoing described embodiments of the invention are provided as illustrations and descriptions. They are not intended to limit the invention to precise form described. In particular, it is contemplated that functional implementation of the invention described herein may be implemented equivalently in hardware, software, firmware, and\/or other available functional components or building blocks. Other variations and embodiments are possible in light of above teachings, and it is not intended that the scope of the invention be limited by this Detailed Description, but rather by the Claims following herein."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"4.
