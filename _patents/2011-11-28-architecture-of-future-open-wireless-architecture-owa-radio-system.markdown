Field of the Invention","This invention relates to an open architecture of future radio system supporting multi-bands, multi-standards wireless and mobile communications and enabling extensibility and upgradeability of the system modules including, but not limited to, radio frequency transceiver including front-end, signal converter and base-band processing core, wherein the open system platforms are based on the open wireless architecture (OWA) technology. The OWA radio frequency transceiver utilizes non-broadband hardware to support wide range frequency bands and broad transmission bandwidth which is different from the conventional software defined radio approach.","2. Description of the Related Art","With the proliferation of wireless standards in television, radio and mobile communications, compatibility issues have emerged in wireless networks and systems. Inconsistency between wireless standards is causing problems to subscribers, wireless network operators and equipment vendors. Subscribers are forced to change their handsets whenever the latest breed of standards is introduced. Network operators face the dilemma during the upgrade of a network from one generation to another due to the presence of a large number of subscribers using legacy handsets incompatible with newer generations of standards. Equipment vendors face difficulty in airing new technology because of short time-to-market requirements. Inconsistency between wireless standards is inhibiting deployment of global roaming facilities and causing problems in introducing new features and services. Users are expecting more from their mobile terminals in terms of quality of service and multimedia applications. Traditional wireless systems, with their capabilities hard-coded in them, are no longer able to keep step with this brisk growth rate.","Open Wireless Architecture (OWA) technology is the solution to the issues mentioned here. The term OWA refers to the open broadband platform, both in radio frequency (RF), base-band, network and application, that can support diverse communication standards and can integrate multiple wireless networks and systems into one common platform. To achieve this flexibility and extensibility, OWA focuses on all aspects of a communication system such as RF section, baseband processing and application domains. The flexibility and adaptability required for the converged wireless platform can be achieved by implementing the radio functionality as software modules running on a generic platform or by using extensible hardware modules.","Continuous evolution is foreseen in future mobile terminals, with use of new components, architectures, hardware, software platforms and improved user interfaces together providing increased performance. The key technologies that will enable the future advanced mobile terminals as described in the present invention include:\n\n","A unified global standard of mobile communications becomes extremely difficult and almost impossible. An Open Wireless Architecture (OWA) based converged wireless platform will thus become reasonable and feasible in both business and technology, and therefore ITU (international telecommunication union) IMT-Advanced standardization has been targeting this direction in long run.","Open Wireless Architecture (OWA) technology is one optimal solution for the Fourth Generation wireless and mobile communications (4G) and beyond on the worldwide basis. OWA refers to the open broadband wireless platform that can support diverse wireless and mobile standards, and can converge multiple wireless networks. To achieve this flexibility, OWA focuses on all aspects of a communication system including RF (radio frequency), baseband processing, networking and application segments. The flexibility and adaptability required for the converged open wireless platform can be achieved by defining the open interface parameters for the OWA systems and networks.","OWA helps in realizing global roaming facilities and seamless networking capabilities amongst different radio transmission technologies. It allows the network operators and subscribers to use third party solutions or user-defined solutions on their systems and to customize their systems according to their business models. Using OWA we can build systems which support multiple standards, multiple bands, multiple modes and offer diverse services to the customers.","OWA is different from SDR (software defined radio) as OWA basically maps various wireless standards into open interface parameters and maintain the system platform including RF, baseband, networks and applications an open architecture. Hence, in OWA systems, different modules (both hardware and software) can be from different vendors. It is similar to the open computer architecture in personal computer system and open network architecture in packet router system.","However, SDR is primarily a broadband radio in which the preset operating parameters including inter alia frequency range, modulation type, and\/or output power limitations can be reset or altered by software in order to support different radio frequency bands and\/or standards. Though SDR has been improved a lot to support re-configurability and flexibility, it is a closed architecture in coupling different radios into one broadband transceiver hardware. In other words, SDR consumes much more power and spectrum in exchange of the system flexibility. From the business point of view, SDR is not a cost-effective solution in wireless communications.","Furthermore, SDR uses broadband transceiver hardware to support multiple wireless standards which is very expensive in the commercial environment. However, OWA converges multiple air interfaces in an open system platform to maximize the transmission bandwidth and system performance, but each wireless transmission still uses the narrowband transceiver, therefore maintaining the system in a cost-effective way which is very important for the commercial business. Furthermore, OWA supports multiple wireless air interfaces in same open wireless system platform without relying on broadband transceiver hardware which is an innovative approach for the future mobile wireless device.","By using OWA technology, we can converge multiple wireless standards in one open system to support both broadband high-speed radio transmission and seamless fast mobility capability in a mobile fast-fading propagation model environment while maintaining the very high mobile network capacity for the commercial mobile business.","In addition, OWA allows allocating multiple air interfaces into an external card so that the users can simply change wireless standards by updating such air interface card without having to change the mobile terminal device or terminal system.","Cognitive Radio is also different from OWA because the cognitive radio is a radio which has the capability of sensing and adapting to the environment and spectrum automatically and intelligently. However, cognitive radio is not an open system from the architecture point of view, and does not meet the requirements of the open system definition.","With this OWA architecture, the key system units including RF transceiver, CPU (central processing unit) platform and base-band processing core are fully open and extensible, especially the open RF transceiver can be operable in either statically allocated spectrum bands, or in dynamically optimized spectrum bands based on spectrum sharing and spectrum recycling techniques which maximize the spectrum utilization.","With this OWA architecture, many system modules including, but not limited to, the RF front-end module, Digital controlled oscillator module, IF (intermediate frequency) processing module, Build-In Self-Test module, Signal Converter module and Base-band processing module can be replaced, extended and upgraded by the users, and developed by the third-party vendors.","This invention is directed to an architecture of future open wireless architecture (OWA) radio system which provides an open, extensible, reconfigurable and upgradeable system platform supporting multi-bands, multi-standards wireless and mobile communication technologies, either in the statically allocated frequency spectrum bands or in the dynamically optimized spectrum bands based on spectrum sharing and spectrum recycling techniques, wherein the main system units and modules including RF (radio frequency) transceiver (including RF front-end) and base-band processing core are upgradeable and plug-and-play through the OWA BIOS (basic input\/output system) and Framework open interface definitions.","The architecture of future open wireless architecture (OWA) radio system of the present invention incorporates an OWA BIOS (basic input\/output system) AND FRAMEWORK architecture which defines the open bus and interfaces architecture to manage the \u201cplug and play\u201d open architecture of the whole OWA radio systems, as well as provides the extensibility and upgradeability of the different system units and functional modules.","More specifically, the architecture of future open wireless architecture (OWA) radio system of the present invention comprises the utilization of OWA BIOS and Framework, as set forth above, constructing the Open RF (radio frequency) Transceiver including RF front-end, wherein multi-bands transmitters array and multi-bands receivers array are reconfigurable and upgradeable through OWA extensible interfaces, defined by aforementioned OWA BIOS and Framework.

More specifically, the Open RF Transceiver, as set forth above, comprises an RF Front-End both in transmitter and receiver, and the related digital phase lock loop, frequency synthesizer and RF power amplifier, but not limited hereto, in supporting multi-bands transceiver array architecture, as illustrated above.","The architecture of future open wireless architecture (OWA) radio system of the present invention incorporates a multi-cores processing platform with well-defined targets from algorithmic, software and architecture standpoint for the OWA system, wherein different functional modules such as, but not limited to, aforementioned Open RF Transceiver including RF Front-End, Signal Converter, Open base-band processing Core, Antenna Array and Build-In Self-Test, are capable of operating separately and in parallel, facilitating extensible and reconfigurable system platform, as set forth in details above.","The architecture of future open wireless architecture (OWA) radio system of the present invention also incorporates the layered OWA system framework, as set forth in part above, comprising the physical layer framework including, but not limited to, the aforementioned open RF transceiver, open ADC\/DAC (analog-to-digital converter and digital-to-analog converter), the aforementioned open base-band core and antenna array; middle ware layer framework including, but not limited to, OWA device drivers supporting aforementioned RF transceiver, ADC\/DAC, baseband core and network devices, OWA real-time OS (operating system) with network protocol capability and OWA API (application programming interface) supporting underlying physical layer system units; application layer framework supporting the services and applications of different wireless transmission technologies. Furthermore, the OWA API, as set forth above, is in charge of high layer system management including, but not limited to, resource management (channel, network, bandwidth, capacity and antenna), spectrum management (band identification, location, spectral condition, index and priority) and power management (sleep mode, standby mode, receiving mode and transmitting mode as well as their cloud operation modes).","In addition to the above, the architecture of future open wireless architecture (OWA) radio system of the present invention also include the firmware flow architecture capabilities of the OWA BIOS and Framework, as set forth above, comprising the task modules such as, but not limited to, OWA Security, OWA Initialization, OWA Drivers, OWA Network Boot, OWA OS Load, OWA Network Optimization, OWA Run-Time and OWA Termination, wherein such architecture is capable of integrating the future wireless architecture with the computer architecture to construct the OWA future radio system. As set forth above, the firmware flow architecture may be pre-established and determined based on current technological standards and may vary greatly.","One advantage of the architecture of future open wireless architecture (OWA) radio system of the present invention which may serve as an incentive is the concept of \u201cspectrum sharing and spectrum recycling\u201d. More specifically, the system provides the capability of users and providers to utilize the existing common frequency bands through the extensible transceiver array, as set forth above, or to search for the available spectrum, both licensed or unlicensed, based on spectrum management, as set forth in details above, wherein the system provides real-time view of available spectrum resource.","Other features of the architecture of future open wireless architecture (OWA) radio system of the present invention comprise the open RF transceiver, as set forth above, whether incorporating cellular mobile technology, local wireless access technology, short-distance wireless technology or its equivalent, including a network searching capability wherein searching for different air interfaces in certain bands based on various criteria such as, but not limited to, signal strength, waveform, frequency, coding and modulation, and whenever necessary, the aforementioned open RF transceiver can replace its transceiver array with other portable \u201cplug-and-play\u201d components such as, but not limited to, RF Power Amplifier, RF Receiver Front-End, RF Transmitter Front-End.","OWA RF Front-End system supports open wireless air interfaces by using non-broadband RF hardware for the consumer markets in the cost-effective and spectrum-efficient way.","To facilitate the OWA RF front-end supporting wideband frequency bands from 500 MHz to 6 GHz for open wireless air interfaces without relying on broadband RF hardware, the architecture of future open wireless architecture (OWA) radio system of the present invention utilizes the following innovations disclosed in the present invention:\n\n","The present invention comprises a low noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA) and a direct RF sampling mixer (DSM) with embedded programmable discrete-time filtering. The LNTA has the features of wideband in nature, input matching and low noise. The embedded filters following the DSM operates in discrete-time charge domain, filtering the aliasing signals and interferences while controlling the IF bandwidth according to the clock frequency.","Charge sampling has advantage over conventional voltage sampling. In voltage sampling, the bandwidth of the sample and hold system is limited by the value of the on-resistance and capacitance. However, charge sampling does not track the signal voltage but integrates the current into the sampling capacitors. The transconductor can provide an almost constant output current across very wide frequency bands up to 10 GHz to charge the sampling capacitors. Furthermore, the value of the capacitance can be so large that both noise and clock\/charge feedthrough are largely reduced.","These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more clear when the drawings as well as the detailed description are taken into consideration.","Like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the several views of the drawings.","The present invention relates to an implemental and commercial multi-bands common wireless and mobile communication platform for the future open wireless architecture radio system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Open RF (Radio Frequency) Transceiver including RF Front-End\u2014it converts the radio frequency (RF) signal into the low frequency or intermediate frequency (IF) signal, and vice verse.
