In traditional reactors, neutrons interact with the fissile material creating fission-products that cannot be transmuted. This expedites fission product buildup and causes swelling. Consequently, substantial fission product poisoning negatively affects nuclear fuel longevity and efficiency.","Compared to traditional reactors, fast reactors are more immune to fission product poisoning. The fission-products created can be further transmuted, using more fuel, more efficiently. However, more fission-products and helium gas are created due to the increased number of transmutations that occur. Additionally, the extra fission-products and fission gases cause fuel swelling because current fuel designs cannot accommodate fission product buildup within the fuel. This causes accelerated damage of the nuclear fuel and cladding due to the excessive swelling.","Therefore, there is a need for a nuclear fuel, and a process for fabricating it, that limits fuel swelling by accommodating fission-products and gases, and, as a result, facilitating higher burnup rates.","A method of fabricating a nuclear fuel comprising providing a fissile material, one or more hollow microballoons, and a phenolic resin.

The fissile material microspheres are then overcoated with a microballon mixture of the phenolic resin and microballoons. In another preferred embodiment, the fissile material, phenolic resin and the one or more hollow microballoons are combined by particle spheronization.

In another preferred embodiment, the fissile material, phenolic resin and the one or more hollow microballoons are all combined by spheronizing the mixture.","Fissile material comprises any fissile, or combination of fissile materials, that is capable of undergoing fission or is fissionable. The fissile material preferably comprises transuranics including, but not limited to: U metal, UO, UN, UC, Pu metal, and PuO, or a combination thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the fissile material is a fissile material oxide. Preferably, the fissile material is eventually thermally treated in a carbothermic reduction of the oxide to form fissile material carbides.","Preferably, the fissile material is melted and electrochemically separated to remove residual salts, or dissolved and aqueously separated to remove fission products and undesirable elements. In a preferred embodiment, the fissile material is first atomized into solid microspheres. Preferably, the fissile material is gelation precipitated, formed using the Wurster Process, atomized by shot tower, gas atomization, or rotating electrode atomization, or spheronized from powder. Preferably, the solid microspheres of fissile material have a representative diameter between approximately 2-500 microns. A representative diameter is the average distance across a cross-section of any shape, for example cubes, cuboids, spheres, cylinders, cone, triangular prism, hexagonal prism, square-based pyramid, hexagonal pyramid, spheroids, etc,","The one or more hollow microballoons each comprises a hollow shell. The shell of each microballon comprises carbon. Preferably, each hollow microballon has a representative diameter of approximately 2 to 60 \u03bcm and a spherical or spheroid geometry. Preferably, each hollow microballon has a partial vacuum. In one preferred embodiment, each hollow microballoons has a tap density of approximately 0.146 g\/cmor approximately 6% of the density of graphite. In another preferred embodiment, each hollow microballon has a tap density of approximately 0.265 g\/cmor approximately 12% of the density of graphite.","In one preferred embodiment, the one or more hollow microballoons are made using the method discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,749,456, hereby fully incorporated by reference. Briefly, in this embodiment, a cured phenolic resin microballoon is heated using a heat dissipation reactor in a furnace. The phenolic resin microballoons are preferably carbonized by subjecting the phenolic resin microballoons to a stepped heating cycle that incrementally heats the phenolic resin microballoons over several hours, and then cools the phenolic resin microballoons over several hours until the phenolic resin microballoons are completely converted into carbon microballoons.","The resulting one or more hollow microballoons are then preferably sized using a cyclone separation. Preferably, the one or more hollow microballoons are thermally treated to over 2,400\u00b0 C. in a vacuum.","The Phenolic resin is capable of bonding with the fissile material and the one or more microballoons. The phenolic resin is preferably a synthetic thermosetting resin such as obtained by the reaction of hydroxybenzine with formaldehyde. Preferably, the phenolic resin is formed by a step-growth polymerization reaction that can be either acid-catalyzed or alkaline-catalyzed. Preferably, the phenolic resin is cured sufficiently to remove volatile organic and preferably from the resin and preferably form the resin into a glassy carbon structure. In a preferred embodiment, the phenolic resin is an acid catalyzed resin using Hexamethylenetetramine as the hardening agent (formaldehyde donor).","The fissile material, phenolic resin and one or more microballoons are combined, preferably into a plurality of granules. In a preferred embodiment, the combination of fissile material, phenolic resin and one or more microballoons is combined by overcoating one or more of the fissile material, phenolic resin and microballoons using a process such as the GRANUREX process trademarked by VECTOR Corporation. In this process, the interior of a conical rotor chamber is maintained at a slight vacuum, and pressurized air is allowed to flow around the interior to fluidize the starting particles. The coating particles are also vacuum inducted into the interior of the conical chamber, thereby coating the particles. In one embodiment, the microballoons are overcoated with a fissile matrix of the resin and fissile material. More preferably, fissile material granules are overcoated with a microballon mixture of the resin and microballoons.","Preferably, the combination of fissile material, phenolic resin and the one or more hollow microballoons has excess carbon, thereby enhancing the production of fissile carbides during heating.","The combined fissile material, phenolic resin and the one or more hollow microballoons are heated sufficiently to form at least some fissile material carbides creating a nuclear fuel particle with one or more fission product collection spaces. Preferably, the combined fissile material, phenolic resin and the one or more hollow microballoons are heated to a temperature greater than 1,400\u00b0 C. to form fissile material carbides. In a preferred embodiment, the heating is conducted in a vacuum, soaking the agglomerated microballoons and fissile material at approximately 1,800\u00b0 C. for four hours or until complete bonding between the one or more microballoons and fissile material has occurred for densification. In a preferred embodiment the one or more microballoons form a bonded honeycomb structure when the carbon from the phenolic resin reacts with the fissile material. Preferably, the resulting nuclear fuel particle is substantially carbides of the fissile material. Preferably, the resin is cured at a temperature up to 200\u00b0 C., thereby holding the nuclear fuel particle together during any future carbonization and heat treatments of the nuclear fuel particle. In a preferred embodiment, the resin is an uncured, solid powder during overcoating, heated to a viscous liquid and then cured at a temperature up to 200\u00b0 C., thereby holding the nuclear fuel particle together during any future carbonization and heat treatments of the nuclear fuel particle.","The one or more fission product collection spaces are capable of capturing fission products during the fission of the nuclear fuel particle. Preferably, the one or more fission product collection spaces are generated from the one or more hollow microballoons. Preferably, the one or more hollow microballoons are heated in the fissile material thereby creating voids. In one preferred embodiment, the one or more fission product collection spaces are voids generated from heating and reacting the one or more hollow microspheres and glassy carbon from the resin with the fissile material, preferably generating fissile material carbides. The one or more fission product collection spaces reduce fuel swelling that compromises nuclear fuel particle cladding integrity. As the internal pressure of the fuel increases as the buildup of solid and gaseous fission-products occurs, the fission-products are isolated from the fuel in the fission product collection spaces, eliminating fuel swelling. Consequently, damage due to fuel swelling to any surrounding cladding at the fuel interface due to swelling is reduced, or more preferably eliminated. Fabricating fuel with fission product collection spaces substantially reduces the risk of a breach of the cladding, lengthens the life of the nuclear fuel particle and increases efficiency.","The fission product collection spaces prevent the corrosion and swelling of the resulting nuclear fuel particle by isolating fission-products away from any fuel cladding. In addition, because the fission product collection spaces are contained within the nuclear fuel particle, the need for plenum space at either end of the fuel rod is eliminated. Eliminating the need for plenum space at either end of the fuel rod shortens the length of the fuel rod or allows for more fuel to be used in one fuel rod. Additionally, because the fission-products are fully contained within the one or more fission product collection spaces of nuclear fuel particle, one more barrier is added to the physical barriers that prevent the escape of the fission-products in case of a reactor breach. Preferably, the fission product collection spaces account for greater than 5%, but less than 50% of the resulting fuel particle by volume.","Preferably, the resulting combination of fissile material, phenolic resin, and microballon is overcoated with a metal, preferably a powder, forming a metal matrix. In a preferred embodiment, the resulting combination of fissile material, phenolic resin, and microballon is overcoated with Zirconium (Zr), Titanium (Ti), Niobium (Nb), Ferritic or marensitic chromium steel (based on HT-9 or Mod 9Cr-1 Mo), ODS powder, Intermetallics (e.g., NiAl3), or a combination thereof.","In a preferred embodiment, the resulting combination of fissile material, phenolic resin, and microballon is overcoated with zirconium, as zirconium materials have good neutronics characteristics, irradiation behavior with alpha microstructure, high temperature strength. The broad working range of temperatures of zirconium makes it a preferred candidate to be coupled with other metals, allowing a greater variety of materials to be used for nuclear fuel particles.","In another preferred embodiment, the resulting combination of fissile material, phenolic resin, and microballon is overcoated with titanium materials as they have good high temperature properties and formability characteristics. Titanium is also fully miscible with zirconium, niobium, and tantalum (Ta).","In yet another preferred embodiment, the resulting combination of fissile material, phenolic resin, and microballon is overcoated with niobium materials, as they have high melting points with good high temperature properties.","A plurality of the nuclear fuel particle formed using one of the discussed methods herein is preferably compacted and extruded forming one or more fuel rods. Preferably, a plurality of the nuclear fuel particle formed using one of the discussed methods herein is preferably compacted and extruded forming one or more fuel rods at a temperature at least approximately 1,100\u00b0 C., but less than the reaction temperature of the particles, preferably less than approximately 1,400\u00b0 C.","Preferably, the resulting fuel has a fissile material by volume fraction optimized for extrusion and the resulting rod fuel density, depending on various factors, for example, matrix metal, extrusion temperature, sodium bond barrier (if used), fissile material, cladding used etc. Preferably, the resulting fuel has less than approximately 30% fissile material by volume fraction, more preferably approximately 10 percent. The fuel rods are formed after the nuclear fuel particle is heated sufficiently to form at least some fissile material carbides, thereby maintaining the fission product collection spaces during the formation of the fuel rods.","In a preferred embodiment, one or more fuel rods formed using one of the above discussed methods, is encapsulated in a cladding. The cladding is preferably made of zirconium alloy. Preferably, the cladding is metallurgically bonded or sodium bonded with the fuel rod. Preferably, the fuel rods are cooled after they are formed and subsequently heated for alignment of microstructures of the, at a temperature less than the reaction temperature of the particles, more preferably less than approximately 1400\u00b0 C.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["20","22","24","24","24"]},"Each fission product collection space  is defined within the fissile material  and each fission product collection space  is capable of capturing fission-products produced from the fissions of the fissile material .

In another preferred embodiment, when the fission product collection spaces  are created in a fluidized bed of a partial pressure, the fission product collection spaces  comprise fluidizing gas.","The fission product collection spaces  are distinctly separate and from each other and are not connected to each other. Preferably, the location of the fission products collection spaces  is optimized for use in a nuclear reactor, preferably by distributing the fission product collection spaces  evenly across the nuclear fuel particle . Preferably, the fission product collection spaces  are spheroid in shape, including, but not limited to, both spheroids (ovals) and spheres (circles).","Additionally, because the fission product collection spaces  are incorporated into the nuclear fuel particle  design, less fissile material  is necessary for fabrication of the nuclear fuel particle . This allows higher fuel fissile densities to be used when fabricating the nuclear fuel particle , and, higher burn-up efficiency is achieved because burn-up is limited to using the fissile material .
