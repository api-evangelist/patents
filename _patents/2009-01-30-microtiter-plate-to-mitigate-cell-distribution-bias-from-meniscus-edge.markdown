In particular, the invention provides devices to suppress or redistribute surface tension effects of the liquid contained in the wells.","Multiwell or microtiter plates, are ubiquitous in biological and pharmaceutical research. A microtiter plate (also known as \u201cmicroplate\u201d) represents a flat plate with multiple uniform \u201cwells\u201d used as small test tubes. The microplate has become a standard tool in analytical research and clinical diagnostic testing laboratories.","Conventional wells in a microtiter plate yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, various exemplary embodiments provide a lid assembly for superposition above the microtiter plate to mitigate or remove the meniscus along the periphery of sample liquid in the cavity wells of a microtiter plate. The assembly includes a lid plate having a mount surface, an array of plugs corresponding to the array of wells, and a plurality of posts.","In various exemplary embodiments, each plug extends below from the mount surface and is insertable into the periphery of a counterpart well for contact with the liquid. The plurality of posts suspends the lid plate above the microtiter plate. In various exemplary embodiments, each post optionally passes through an orifice through the mount surface, with each post including an adjustable clamp to support the lid plate. In alternate exemplary embodiments, the mount surface optionally includes an array of cavities that correspond in disposition to the array of plugs. Each plug is independently insertable through the mount surface to adjust depth of each plug into its counterpart well.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","110","130","130","140","130","110"]},"Such devises allow researchers to perform optical and spectroscopic analysis on biological samples by submersing them within various fluidic environments.

The curvature can be concave or convex depending on the contact angle between the liquid and the peripheral boundary. This phenomenon is most pronounced by the meniscus rise  along the edges adjacent the boundary of the well , thereby producing a concave curvature.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","210","310","320","330","340","330","350","360","370","310","380","310"]},"Non-uniform sedimentation of cells  yields a survival consequence such that those that settle within the meniscus edge  region (with many neighbors) survive (as indicated by lighter shade), whereas those in the other regions  and  toward the center (with few neighbors) perish (as denoted by darker shade).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A","FIG. 4A"],"b":["4","4","400","410","420","430","435","430","440","410","420"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":["450","460","465","470","475","465","475","430","450","435","475","465"]},"This technique can be labeled as a beveled-well meniscus-reduction microplate to reduce the degree of meniscus curvature by confining the outer periphery that adjoins a boundary to an annular bevel portion. The liquid surface spans across a wider extent within the bevel , thereby flattening the surface  within the section . The reduced curvature of the liquid surface homogenizes cell distribution within the well .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 4C","b":["480","490","495","450","480","440"]},"This technique can be labeled as a meniscus-suppression lid applicable for either fixed or variable liquid volume. The lid employs a plug  that protrudes into the well . The plug's terminating surface  contacts the surface of the liquid  contained in the well , thereby removing the meniscus curvature. Special coatings can be employed on the surface  to inhibit material of the liquid  from adhering to the plug . Typical microtiter plates (having arrays of 6, 12, 24, 48, 96 and 384 wells) can remain unmodified for this embodiment. Instead, a researcher merely obtains lid inserts to use with commercially-available microplates.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","510","520","530","540","550","510","560","550"]},"These plugs  correspond to and are disposed above the wells  to suppress meniscus formation in their liquid contents . A set of displacement posts  provide support adjacent the outer corners of the lid plate .

The combination of lid plate , plugs , posts  and clamp  represent a lid assembly  to retrofit with a conventional plate .","Each plug  insertably fits into its corresponding well . For circular geometries, the plug's outer diameter is therefore less than the well's inner diameter. Preferably, the plug's outer diameter is only slightly smaller than the well's inner diameter to minimize meniscus effects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","590","520","610","510","570","540","570","620","570","630","540"]},"The clamps  support the lid plate  along their corresponding posts  to be disposed above the microplate .

By contrast,  demonstrates cell distribution effect from meniscus mitigation in a photograph , also showing the wall . Distribution of cells  exhibits considerable uniformity along the vector .","By suppressing meniscus formation in well liquid, cell distribution uniformity can be augmented. This can be accomplished by engaging a lid plug  against the liquid at its top surface. Alternatively, this can also be accomplished by providing radially segregated chambers at the liquid surface. These chambers can be bounded by an upper cylinder  for the cells under evaluation and a bevel cone  for diverting the meniscus by its extension.","The efforts leading to the described embodiments are directed to providing tissue culture plates that mitigate differential stacking of cells towards the well's periphery. The photograph  illustrates effects of cell stacking. In addition to there being more cells on the perimeter  of the well , the cells  towards the middle are dead as indicated by the stain from the darkening (blue) dye.","These untreated cells  were seeded in the well , washed, and deposited in the incubator for an interval. This heterogeneous pattern also extends to treated cells. Various exemplary embodiments present techniques to distribute the cells  homogeneously on the bottom of the well  in the plate . The principle options include modifying the well to expand the meniscus and incorporating a lid to conform the meniscus to a flat solid surface.","For a multiwell microplate in which each well  contains equal volumes, the configuration of the lid assembly  shown in views  and  is appropriate. This application, in which overall plate volume changes are required for different experiments, employs the lid  for constant-volume meniscus removal with fixed plugs . Each plug  has the same dimension and extension from the lid surface  being permanently attached thereto.","Adjustability for different overall meniscus heights for different experiments can be achieved by sliding the entire lid  upon the posts  that protrude through orifices  in the lid  and include adjustably translatable clamps  capable of supporting the lid's weight at a desired height. To avoid splay, the posts  can optionally interface with the bracketing tray , which can be designed for adaptability to enclose standard microplates  of various sizes or else be rigid for a fixed configuration.","For a multiwell plate in which each well  contains a different volume, the configuration of the lid assembly  shown in view  can be implemented. In this application, the lid plate  has an array of cavities, and each plug  individually slides through its corresponding cavity, such as by pushing with a finger. The lid plate  has support columns  that remain fixed in position to provide a constant separation from the microplate  enabling for maximum penetration of any particular plug  to the bottom of any given well .","The dimensions of the extruding plugs  and  need not fill the entire corresponding well  and . Although such variation might affect the meniscus response, plugs narrower than the inner region of the well may exhibit advantages in production cost and reduced surface interaction. Additionally, a single plug may be replaced with multiple smaller plugs whose adjustability can be individually customized for either the lid plate  or within a sub-plug platform inserted in lieu of the plug .","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art.
