title: Method and apparatus to control visited network access for devices
abstract: Methods and apparatuses are provided that facilitate controlling device access to one or more restricted groups of access points in a visited network. An indicator can be provided by a home network that specifies whether a device registering with a visited network is allowed to access restricted groups in the visited networks. If so, the visited network can request restricted group subscription information for the device. Additionally or alternatively, the device can control whether restricted groups are displayed for selecting access points based on one or more indicators regarding whether the device is allowed to access restricted groups in visited networks.

Field","The following description relates generally to wireless network communications, and more particularly to communicating with nodes in a restricted group.","2. Background","Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication content such as, for example, voice, data, and so on. Typical wireless communication systems may be multiple-access systems capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, . . . ). Examples of such multiple-access systems may include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, and the like. Additionally, the systems can conform to specifications such as third generation partnership project (3GPP), 3GPP long term evolution (LTE), ultra mobile broadband (UMB), evolution data optimized (EV-DO), etc.","Generally, wireless multiple-access communication systems may simultaneously support communication for multiple mobile devices. Each mobile device may communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from base stations to mobile devices, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from mobile devices to base stations. Further, communications between mobile devices and base stations may be established via single-input single-output (SISO) systems, multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, and so forth. In addition, mobile devices can communicate with other mobile devices (and\/or base stations with other base stations) in peer-to-peer wireless network configurations.","To supplement conventional base stations, additional base stations can be deployed to provide more robust wireless coverage to mobile devices. For example, wireless relay stations and low power base stations (e.g., which can be commonly referred to as access point base stations, Home NodeBs or Home eNBs, collectively referred to as H(e)NB, femto access points, femtocells, picocells, microcells, etc.) can be deployed for incremental capacity growth, richer user experience, in-building or other specific geographic coverage, and\/or the like. In some configurations, such low power base stations are connected to the Internet and the mobile operator's network via broadband connection (e.g., digital subscriber line (DSL) router, cable or other modem, etc.). Some H(e)NBs provide closed subscriber group (CSG) access that restricts access to certain devices or related users that are members of the CSG. A home subscriber server (HSS), home location register (HLR), or one or more other nodes of a device's home network can store CSG membership information.","H(e)NBs can be deployed by various network operators, and thus devices can attempt access to, and indeed be provisioned at, one or more H(e)NBs at a visited network. In this regard, one or more nodes of a visited network can request CSG membership information from the HSS, HLR, etc. at a device's home network to determine whether the device is able to access a CSG on the visited network, to provision the device at the CSG on the visited network, etc. In one example, a CSG subscription server (CSS) is provided in the visited network, or otherwise coupled with one or more nodes of the visited network, to store visited network CSG subscription information for the device.","The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","In accordance with one or more aspects and corresponding disclosure thereof, various aspects are described in connection with controlling device access to restricted group nodes in a visited network at the home network, at the device, and\/or the like. For example, a home network of a device can specify an indicator related to allowing the device membership to restricted groups of access points in the visited network. For example, a network node in the visited network can utilize the indicator to determine whether to obtain restricted group subscription information for the device. In another example, a device can control whether to display one or more restricted group access points of a visited network in a list for manual selection based at least in part on one or more indicators. For example, the device can obtain an indicator that relates to specifying any restricted group access points of visited networks, an indicator that relates to specifying restricted group access points of certain specific visited networks, and\/or the like.","According to an example, a method for provisioning closed subscriber group (CSG) information for a device communicating in a visited network is provided including receiving an indication from a visited network related to registering a device on the visited network.

The apparatus further includes a CSG roaming determining component for determining whether to request CSG subscription information for the device based at least in part on the CSG roaming indicator.","In another example, a method for determining a set of CSG cells to display is provided that includes detecting signals from one or more neighboring CSG cells and receiving one or more indicators that specify whether access is allowed to CSGs in one or more visited networks. The method further includes determining whether to display an identifier of one or more CSGs related to the one or more neighboring CSG cells based at least in part on the one or more indicators.","In another aspect, an apparatus for determining a set of CSG cells to display is provided that includes at least one processor configured to detect signals from one or more CSG cells and receive one or more indicators that specify whether access is allowed to CSGs in one or more visited networks.

The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative features of the one or more aspects. These features are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of various aspects may be employed, and this description is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents.","Various aspects are now described with reference to the drawings. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident, however, that such aspect(s) may be practiced without these specific details.","As described further herein, one or more indicators can be communicated and processed to determine behavior related to allowing device membership to restricted group nodes on a visited network. For example, a node of a home network for a device can communicate an indicator to a node of a visited network that specifies whether the device is allowed to become a member of restricted groups of access points or other nodes at the visited network (e.g., in order to access the restricted group of access points to receive at least some level of service) where membership to the restricted group is not provisioned by the home network. The node of the visited network can utilize this indicator to determine whether to request restricted group subscription information for the device from one or more of a subscription server at the visited network, a node at the home network, or the like. Moreover, for example, a device can obtain one or more parameters related to whether to display any restricted group access points of a visited network, display restricted group access points of one or more specific visited networks, etc. in a list for manual selection by a user of the device. In this regard, restricted group access point selection ability can be controlled at the home network, at the device, and\/or the like.","As used in this application, the terms \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201cmodule,\u201d \u201csystem\u201d and the like are intended to include a computer-related entity, such as but not limited to hardware, firmware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and\/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a computing device and the computing device can be a component. One or more components can reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers. In addition, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components may communicate by way of local and\/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets, such as data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and\/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems by way of the signal.","Furthermore, various aspects are described herein in connection with a terminal, which can be a wired terminal or a wireless terminal. A terminal can also be called a system, device, subscriber unit, subscriber station, mobile station, mobile, mobile device, remote station, remote terminal, access terminal, user terminal, terminal, communication device, user agent, user device, or user equipment (UE). A wireless terminal may be a cellular telephone, a satellite phone, a cordless telephone, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a handheld device having wireless connection capability, a computing device, or other processing devices connected to a wireless modem. Moreover, various aspects are described herein in connection with a base station. A base station may be utilized for communicating with wireless terminal(s) and may also be referred to as an access point, a Node B, evolved Node B (eNB), or some other terminology.","Moreover, the term \u201cor\u201d is intended to mean an inclusive \u201cor\u201d rather than an exclusive \u201cor.\u201d That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from the context, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is satisfied by any of the following instances: X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B. In addition, the articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean \u201cone or more\u201d unless specified otherwise or clear from the context to be directed to a singular form.","The techniques described herein may be used for various wireless communication systems such as CDMA, TDMA, FDMA, OFDMA, SC-FDMA and other systems. The terms \u201csystem\u201d and \u201cnetwork\u201d are often used interchangeably. A CDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA), cdma2000, etc. UTRA includes Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA) and other variants of CDMA. Further, cdma2000 covers IS-2000, IS-95 and IS-856 standards. A TDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). An OFDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), IEEE 802.20, Flash-OFDM\u00ae, etc. UTRA and E-UTRA are part of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a release of UMTS that uses E-UTRA, which employs OFDMA on the downlink and SC-FDMA on the uplink. UTRA, E-UTRA, UMTS, LTE and GSM are described in documents from an organization named \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project\u201d (3GPP). Additionally, cdma2000 and UMB are described in documents from an organization named \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project 2\u201d (3GPP2). Further, such wireless communication systems may additionally include peer-to-peer (e.g., mobile-to-mobile) ad hoc network systems often using unpaired unlicensed spectrums, 802.xx wireless LAN, BLUETOOTH and any other short- or long-range, wireless communication techniques.","Various aspects or features will be presented in terms of systems that may include a number of devices, components, modules, and the like. It is to be understood and appreciated that the various systems may include additional devices, components, modules, etc. and\/or may not include all of the devices, components, modules etc. discussed in connection with the figures. A combination of these approaches may also be used.","Referring to , illustrated are several nodes of a sample communication system . For illustration purposes, various aspects of the disclosure are described in the context of one or more devices, access points, and network nodes that communicate with one another. It is to be appreciated, however, that aspects herein may be applicable to other types of apparatuses or other similar apparatuses that are referenced using other terminology. For example, access points can be referred to or implemented as base stations, eNodeBs (eNB), Home Node Bs (e.g., in UMTS) or Home eNBs (e.g., in LTE), collectively referred to as H(e)NBs, femtocell or picocell access points, mobile base stations, relay nodes, hot-spots, routers, gateways, etc., while devices may be referred to or implemented as user equipment (UE), mobile devices, access terminals, modems (or other tethered devices), and so on.","Access points in the system  provide one or more services (e.g., network connectivity) for one or more wired or wireless devices (e.g., device ) that can be installed within or that can travel throughout a coverage area of the system . For example, at various points in time device  can connect to an access point  or some other access point in the system  (not shown). Each of these access points can communicate with one or more network nodes (represented, for example, by network node(s)  and ) to facilitate wide area network connectivity. Network nodes  and  can take various forms such as, for example, one or more radio and\/or core network entities. Thus, in various examples, network nodes  and  can represent functionality such as at least one of: network management (e.g., via an operation, administration, management, and provisioning entity), call control, session management, mobility management, gateway functions, interworking functions, or some other suitable network functionality.","In some cases, device  can access a restricted group access point associated with a wireless cell set. In general, a wireless cell set comprises a set of one or more cells (e.g., provided by at least one access point) where there is a defined relationship specific to that set. An example of a wireless cell set is a closed subscriber group (CSG). For convenience, the discussion that follows may simply refer to the term CSG, rather than the more general term wireless cell set. It should be appreciated, however, that the described concepts may be applicable to other types of defined sets or groups (e.g., restricted groups) of wireless cells or other similar entities. Also, restricted groups can provide a diminished level of access to non-members (e.g., hybrid cells), to which aspects described herein can apply as well. In addition, it is to be appreciated that an access point can provide one or more cells within which devices can communicate with the access point.","As device  travels throughout a network, device  can use some form of list (e.g., an allowed list or whitelist) of CSGs and\/or related access points to identify the access points that device  is allowed to access. In one example, this list can be maintained by the network (e.g., one or more of network nodes  or ), such that the network can periodically send messages to device  to update the list. This list can be referred to as an operator CSG list . Device  can also maintain a local list of CSGs and\/or related access points, since the network list may be updated according to a schedule (e.g., once a day, based on device  connecting to the network, etc.). In addition, the local list allows device  to update the list with CSGs or related access points that are manually selected and provisioned. The local list can be referred to as an allowed CSG list . It is to be appreciated that the network can also update the allowed CSG list  (e.g., when updating the operator CSG list), for example.","For example, operator CSG list  can be updateable by one or more of network nodes  or , such as a CSG list server . For example, as the network obtains information about which CSGs the access terminal  is allowed to access (and\/or according to a schedule or one or more other events, as described), CSG list server  can send a message to device  instructing to update the operator CSG list . CSG list component  can obtain the message and accordingly update operator CSG list . Allowed CSG list  is updateable by a user of device . For example, device  can perform manual selection of one or more CSG access points or related CSGs, and device  (e.g., via CSG list component ) can update the allowed CSG list  where device  is permitted access to an access point associated with a CSG identifier that is not currently present in the operator CSG list .","Thus, device  can then use both lists to determine whether at least some level of access to one or more CSGs is allowed while in the home network or roaming in a visited network. System  can comprise more than one network (e.g., different public land mobile networks (PLMN)). In one example, device  and network nodes  can be of a home PLMN (HPLMN) of device , and the access point  and the network node(s)  can be of a visited PLMN (VPLMN), which is also referred to herein as a visited network. Thus, for example, device  can attempt to establish connection with access point , which can be a CSG access point in the VPLMN. In this example, one or more of network nodes , such as mobility manager , can communicate with one or more of network nodes  in the HPLMN to register device  on the VPLMN, and can obtain some subscription information regarding device  and\/or a user (e.g., subscriber) thereof.","In one example, one or more network nodes  of the HPLMN can provide CSG subscription information related to device  to the one or more network nodes  of the VPLMN (e.g., by including CSG subscription information along with other subscription information transferred from the network nodes  of the HPLMN to the network nodes  of the VPLMN when the device  registers in the visited network). CSG subscription information can include a list of one or more CSGs (e.g., identifiers thereof) to which device  is a member. In another example, the CSG subscription information can include a level of access and\/or other parameters regarding device membership at the one or more CSGs. In one example, the CSG subscription information can include membership information related to one or more CSGs in the VPLMN, and thus the subscription information can additionally include the PLMN related to the one or more CSGs.","In one example, home subscriber server (HSS)  can additionally provide a CSG roaming indicator related to device  to mobility manager  to facilitate determining whether device  is allowed autonomous CSG roaming in the VPLMN. For example, autonomous CSG roaming can refer to device  being allowed membership to and\/or access of CSG access points in the VPLMN. These can be CSGs and\/or related access points for which membership is not already provisioned in the CSG subscription information received from the HSS . Where the CSG roaming indicator specifies that device  is allowed to perform autonomous CSG roaming, mobility manager  can request and maintain additional CSG subscription information related to the VPLMN for device .","Where mobility manager  communicates CSG subscription information with HSS , however, this can require an interface between nodes of the VPLMN and HPLMN to request such information, support for VPLMN roaming at the HPLMN, etc. Thus, in one example, CSG subscription server (CSS)  can be provided at the VPLMN to maintain CSG subscription information for roaming devices. In this regard, mobility manager  can communicate CSG subscription information for device  at the VPLMN with CSS . When device  requests to establish a connection at an access point that is a member of a CSG (e.g., access point ), mobility manager  can determine whether device  is allowed access according to the received CSG subscription information for device . Similarly, when a device  is provisioned at a CSG access point in the VPLMN (e.g., access point ), CSS  can store the provisioning information. Mobility manager  can then determine whether to allow device  to establish a connection at the access point  based on whether the CSG subscription information for the device  related to the VPLMN indicates that access to access point  and\/or membership in the CSG of the access point  is allowed.","In another example, the CSG list component  can optionally generate a manual selection list  for display to a user of device . For example, CSG list component  can detect signals from neighboring access points and\/or provided cells and can determine whether to display at least a portion of the neighboring access points, or related CSG identifiers, in the manual selection list . In one example, CSG list component  can obtain one or more indicators that specify whether to include any CSGs from VPLMNs in the manual selection list , whether to include CSGs from certain VPLMNs, and\/or the like. Similarly, the indicators can relate to whether to display CSGs from the VPLMNs that are not in an operator CSG list received from the HPLMN. For example, device  can store the indicators (e.g., as a hardcoded parameter, parameter in a configuration or specification, etc.), receive the indicators from one or more network nodes  and\/or , and\/or the like.","In any case, for example, where CSG list component  determines an indicator is set that specifies to not include any CSGs from VPLMNs, CSG list component  can exclude access point , and\/or a related CSG identifier, from the manual selection list . Similarly, where CSG list component  determines an indicator is set that specifies to not include CSGs from the VPLMN of network nodes  and access point , CSG list component  can exclude access point , or a related CSG identifier from manual selection list . Otherwise, CSG list component  can include access point , or a related CSG identifier, in manual selection list . Thus, device  can control whether a user can request access to one or more access points in one or more CSGs.","Turning to , an example wireless communication system  is illustrated that facilitates requesting CSG subscription data for a device roaming at a visited network. System  can include a device  that can communicate with one or more access points to receive access to a wireless network, an H(e)NB  that provides restricted access to one or more devices, and a mobility manager  that authorizes one or more devices to communicate with one or more core network components. System  can additionally comprise a HSS\/home location register (HLR)  related to the device , and a CSS  that maintains CSG subscription information for one or more devices. In one example, device  can be a UE, modem (or other tethered device), a portion thereof, and\/or the like, and H(e)NB  can be a femtocell, picocell, or similar access point, a portion thereof, etc., as described. In addition, for example, mobility manager  can be a mobility management entity (MME), serving general packet radio service (GPRS) support node (SGSN), mobile services switching center (MSC)\/visiting location register (VLR), or similar node. Moreover, it is to be appreciated that additional components or nodes can be present between those shown (e.g., one or more gateways can be present between mobility manager  and HSS\/HLR , mobility manager  and CSS , etc.) to facilitate access.","Device  can comprise an access requesting component  for attempting to access one or more access points in a HPLMN or VPLMN, and an optional CSG list component  for processing a CSG list based at least in part on whether access is allowed to the one or more access points. Mobility manager  can comprise a device registering component  for performing a registration for one or more devices over a related PLMN, and a CSG roaming determining component  for discerning whether a roaming device is allowed access to CSG nodes in the PLMN related to the mobility manager . Mobility manager  also comprises a subscription requesting component  for obtaining CSG subscription information for a roaming device, and a CSG access controlling component  for providing CSG access to the roaming device based at least in part on the subscription information.","HSS\/HLR  can comprise a visited network registering component  that can allow a device to be registered on a VPLMN and can provide one or more service parameters to the VPLMN for the device, and a CSG roaming indicating component  that can specify whether the device is allowed to communicate with CSG nodes at the VPLMN. CSS  can include a subscription providing component  for retrieving CSG subscription information for a device roaming in a VPLMN related to CSS  or a requesting entity, and a subscription updating component  for receiving and storing CSG subscription information for a device roaming in the VPLMN.","According to an example, device  can relate to a network operator that provides a PLMN, which can be the HPLMN for device . HSS\/HLR  can additionally be a node in the HPLMN that stores subscription information for device . H(e)NB  and mobility manager  can be part of a PLMN provided by a different network operator, which can be a VPLMN of device . Access requesting component , however, can attempt access to one or more access points of the VPLMN, such as H(e)NB , and H(e)NB  can notify mobility manager  of the access attempt to facilitate authenticating\/authorizing the device  at the VPLMN. In this example, device  can perform a registration or attach procedure with the VPLMN. In one example, access requesting component  can transmit an attach request, registration request, tracking area update (TAU), location area update (LAU), routing area update (RAU), or similar request to H(e)NB , and H(e)NB  can forward the message to mobility manager .","In either case, device registering component  can accordingly obtain one or more device  parameters from H(e)NB  (e.g., from the attach request, registration request, TAU, LAU, RAU or similar message). In this example, device registering component  can request registration for device  on the VPLMN from HSS\/HLR . For example, this can be part of an Update Location Request, or similar message. Visited network registering component  can obtain the request for registering device , and CSG roaming indicating component  can provide device subscription information related to device  to mobility manager . For example, this can be part of an Update Location Request Acknowledgement message, an Insert Subscriber Data message, and\/or similar messages used to provision device information in an LTE network. Device registering component  can receive the device subscription information for providing access to device  in accordance with the device subscription information. In another example, visited network registering component  can provide, and device registering component  can obtain, CSG subscription information for device  from the visited network registering component  (e.g., as part of the subscription information or otherwise).","As part of the device subscription information, and\/or in other messages related to registration, attachment, etc. of device , CSG roaming indicating component  can additionally communicate a CSG roaming indicator  to mobility manager  that specifies whether device  is allowed membership to and\/or access of CSGs or related access points (e.g., via one or more provided cells) in the VPLMN. For example, this can relate to CSGs for which membership or access is not provisioned in the CSG subscription from the HPLMN (e.g., from HSS ). As described, in this regard, the CSG roaming indicator  can relate to whether device  is allowed to utilize autonomous CSG roaming among such CSGs in the VPLMN. In one example, CSG roaming indicating component  can determine and\/or store the CSG roaming indicator  for a specific device . For example, the CSG roaming indicator  can be initialized by a network operator (e.g., via an interface to the CSG roaming indicating component ) based at least in part on operator policy, a roaming agreement, a subscription class, a billing model, etc., which can be specific to device  and\/or a related user\/subscriber.","In addition, the CSG roaming indicator  can apply for a given VPLMN (and thus CSG roaming indicating component  can include multiple CSG roaming indicators each for a different VPLMN) or generally to any visited network. CSG roaming determining component  can obtain the CSG roaming indicator  (e.g., from the device subscription information or otherwise). Where the CSG roaming indicator  specifies that device  is allowed to utilize autonomous CSG roaming, subscription requesting component  can transmit a request to CSS  for CSG subscription information of device  related to one or more CSGs in the VPLMN. In one example, this can be an Update CSG Location Request message or similar message communicated in an LTE network. Subscription providing component  can obtain the request and can transmit CSG subscription information for device . In one example, this can be additional CSG subscription information related to CSGs in the VPLMN.","In this regard, for example, CSS  can store CSG subscription information for device  related to the VPLMN. In one example, CSS  can store the CSG subscription information based at least in part on subscription updating component  receiving provisioning information for device  regarding one or more CSGs. This provisioning information can be provided to subscription updating component  manually by one or more out-of-band procedures, by device  using one or more in-band procedures, and\/or the like. For example, the one or more in-band procedures can be conditioned on whether device  is allowed to utilize autonomous CSG roaming. Where the CSG roaming indicator  specifies that device  is not allowed to utilize autonomous CSG roaming in the VPLMN, subscription requesting component  can refrain from requesting CSG subscription information from CSS . In any case, CSG access controlling component  can determine whether to allow device  access to a CSG related to H(e)NB  based at least in part on the CSG roaming indicator  and\/or CSG subscription information received for device  from CSS . For example, where the CSG roaming indicator  specifies the device  is not allowed to utilize autonomous CSG roaming in the VPLMN, CSG access controlling component  can deny device  access to H(e)NB .","Moreover, in an example, CSG list component  can process one or more lists of CSGs according to whether access is allowed to H(e)NB  and\/or a related CSG. As described, for example, CSG access controlling component  can manage access to the H(e)NB  and can indicate to device  whether access to H(e)NB  and\/or a related CSG is allowed. Access requesting component  can receive an indicator of whether access is allowed. In one example, CSG access controlling component  can send a rejection code to device  where access to the H(e)NB and\/or related CSG is rejected. Where access is not allowed, for example, CSG list component  can exclude an identifier of the H(e)NB and\/or a related CSG identifier from a list of allowed CSGs provided from a non-access stratum (NAS) layer to an access stratum (AS) layer at device . In another example, where access is not allowed, for example, CSG list component  can exclude the H(e)NB and\/or a related CSG identifier from a list of cells available for manual mode selection displayed by device , as described further herein. In either case, for example, access requesting component  can refrain from accessing CSG H(e)NBs (e.g., and\/or hybrid H(e)NBs) in the VPLMN.","Referring to , illustrated is an example wireless communication system  that facilitates generating a list of neighboring cells. System  can comprise a device  that communicates in a wireless network. In addition, system  can comprise one or more H(e)NBs, such as HPLMN H(e)NB , which is an H(e)NB of a HPLMN of device , VPLMN H(e)NB , which is an H(e)NB of VPLMN, and VPLMN H(e)NB , which is an H(e)NB of VPLMN. VPLMN and VPLMN can be different VPLMNs (e.g., operated by different network operators from a network operator for device ). System  further comprises an HPLMN network node , which can be substantially any core network node of an HPLMN, such as a MME, SGSN, MSC\/VLR, HSS\/HLR, and\/or the like that provisions one or more parameters to the device . Though shown as directly coupled to HPLMN network node , it is to be appreciated that device  can communicate with HPLMN network node  through one or more other HPLMN network components, such as one or more access points (which can include HPLMN H(e)NB , in one example), gateways, routers, etc.","Device  can comprise a CSG list component  that generates a list of CSGs available for manual selection, and a display component  that can render the list on a display of device . CSG list component  can comprise a neighboring access point detecting component  for determining one or more access points or related cells with which or within which device  can communicate, a VPLMN indicator obtaining component  for receiving one or more indicators that specify whether device  can utilize CSG cells in one or more VPLMNs, and a list generating component  that compiles a list of neighboring CSGs (e.g., and\/or access points or cells of the CSGs) available for communication based at least in part on the one or more indicators. HPLMN network node  can comprise a VPLMN access indicating component  that provisions one or more indicators to device  that specify whether device  can utilize CSG cells in one or more VPLMNs.","According to an example, neighboring access point detecting component  can determine one or more access points with which device  can communicate. For example, this can be based at least in part on detecting signals from the one or more access points that have a threshold signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or other quality measurement. For example, neighboring access point detecting component  can initiate the detection of neighboring access points based at least in part on a request received from a user interface for a list of neighboring access points, a timer or event related to reselection, and\/or the like. In addition, VPLMN access indicating component  can provide one or more indicators to device  that specify whether device  can access CSG cells in one or more VPLMNs, and VPLMN indicator obtaining component  can receive the indicators.","In one example, VPLMN indicator obtaining component  can request the indicators (e.g., based at least in part on a neighboring access point detecting component  initiating a search for neighboring access points, as part of establishing a connection with the HPLMN, based at least in part on a timer or other event, etc.). For example, an indicator received from VPLMN access indicating component  can relate to whether device  is allowed to access CSGs in any VPLMN (e.g., CSGs for which membership or access is not provisioned by the HPLMN). In an additional or alternative example, an indicator received from VPLMN access indicating component  can relate to whether device  is allowed to access CSGs in specific VPLMNs. For example, this can be a collection of flags each related to a VPLMN, an operator controlled list of VPLMNs within which device  can (or cannot) access CSGs, and\/or the like. In addition, the VPLMNs can be indicated by a PLMN identifier thereof, such that the device  can determine the VPLMN from broadcast information from the H(e)NBs and determine whether to accordingly include the H(e)NBs in a CSG list.","Thus, for example, VPLMN indicator obtaining component  can receive the one or more indicators, and list generating component  can exclude CSGs (e.g., and\/or related access points or cells) from a CSG list to which device  is not allowed access and\/or include CSGs for the CSG list related to CSGs for which device  is allowed access. In a specific example, neighboring access point detecting component  can detect presence of HPLMN H(e)NB , VPLMN H(e)NB , and VPLMN H(e)NB . For example, VPLMN indicator obtaining component  can receive an indication that device  is generally allowed to access CSGs in VPLMNs. Thus, list generating component  can create a CSG list that includes HPLMN H(e)NB , VPLMN H(e)NB , and VPLMN H(e)NB  (e.g., and\/or related CSG and\/or cell identifiers). In another example, VPLMN indicator obtaining component  can also receive an indicator that device  is not allowed to access CSGs in VPLMN. In this example, list generating component  can create a CSG list that includes HPLMN H(e)NB  and VPLMN H(e)NB  (e.g., and\/or related CSG and\/or cell identifiers). In either case, display component  can display the CSG list in a manual selection or similar list. It is to be appreciated that device  can utilize the CSG list in other examples, such as to perform reselection to one or more CSG access points on the HPLMN or VPLMN, etc.","In addition, it is to be appreciated, as described, that CSG list component  can maintain an operator CSG list received from an MME or similar node (e.g., of the HPLMN or one or more VPLMNs) and\/or a allowed list of CSGs. Thus, in one example, list generating component  can determine whether to display H(e)NBs in the CSG list additionally based at least in part on whether the CSGs are present in the operator CSG and\/or allowed CSG lists. In one example, where the CSGs are in one of the operator CSG and\/or allowed CSG lists, list generating component  can include the CSGs in the manual selection CSG list regardless of other parameters. Thus, for example, list generating component  can evaluate the one or more indicators for CSG cells detected by neighboring access point detecting component  that are not in the operator CSG or allowed CSG lists.","Turning to , an example wireless communication network  is depicted that comprises entities such as UE  and one or more components of a VPLMN, such as an eNB  (e.g., H(e)NB), a MME , a serving gateway (SGW) , a packet data network (PDN) gateway (PGW) , a PDN , a HSS , a CSG administration server , a CSS . Network  can also comprise a CSG list server  and an HSS  of an HPLMN of UE . Though shown an generally described in relation to a 3GPP LTE network, it is to be appreciated, however, that the concepts described herein may be applicable to other implementations (e.g., a UMTS-based system, etc.), which can include additional or alternative nodes.","According to an example, UE  can attempt access to eNB  of the VPLMN (e.g., by sending an attach request, registration request, TAU, LAU, RAU, or similar message thereto). eNB  can forward one or more messages related to the access attempt to MME . MME  can determine the UE  is a member of another network, and can query HSS  for device subscription information related to UE . As described, HSS  can provide the device subscription information to MME  along with a CSG roaming indicator. In addition, in an example, HSS  can provide CSG subscription information related to device  to MME . For example, HSS  can obtain the CSG subscription information from CSG list server . MME  can obtain the CSG roaming indicator, and can query CSS  for additional CSG subscription information for UE  related to the VPLMN where the CSG roaming indicator specifies that UE  is allowed to utilize autonomous CSG roaming in the visited network. In this example, CSS  can obtain CSG subscription information of CSGs accessible by UE  in the VPLMN (e.g., one or more lists, as described, from CSG administration server ), and can provide the information to MME . In addition, in an example, CSS  can allow for provisioning of UE  to one or more CSGs in the VPLMN via CSG administration server .","Once MME  obtains the CSG roaming indicator and\/or operator CSG list, MME  can determine whether UE  can access eNB . For example, where the CSG roaming indicator specifies that UE  is not allowed to utilize autonomous CSG roaming in the VPLMN, MME  can refrain from requesting CSG subscription information from CSS  and can deny UE  access to eNB . In another example, where the CSG roaming indicator specifies that UE  is allowed to utilize autonomous CSG roaming in the VPLMN, but the requested CSG subscription information does not include a CSG related to eNB , MME  can deny UE  access to eNB . Where the CSG is in the CSG subscription information, for example, MME  can grant UE  access to eNB . It is to be appreciated, for example, that MME  can grant UE  a certain level of access to eNB , which can be based on information in the CSG subscription information or other parameters.","In addition, as described, UE  can obtain one or more indicators regarding access CSGs in VPLMNs from a configuration, hardcoding, one or more nodes of the HPLMN, etc. The one or more indicators can specify whether UE  is allowed access to CSGs in any VPLMNs, CSGs in certain VPLMNs, etc., as described. UE  can accordingly first determine whether access is allowed for CSGs generally and\/or for CSGs in the VPLMN before attempting access to eNB  using the one or more indicators. In another example, UE  can determine CSGs to display in a manual selection list based at least in part on the one or more indicators, as described.","Referring to , an example wireless communication system  is illustrated that performs a TAU procedure including determining to request CSG subscription information for a UE on a visited network. System  can include a UE , eNB  (e.g., H(e)NB), base station controller (BSC) (and\/or radio network controller (RNC)) , MME , old MME  (either of which can be an SGSN and\/or the like), SGW , PGW , policy charging and rules function (PCRF) , HSS , and CSS . It is to be appreciated that HSS  can be in a HPLMN of UE , while the remaining nodes are part of a VPLMN, for example. Messages  are shown relating to performing a TAU procedure in an LTE, or similar E-UTRA network, including a trigger to start the TAU procedure at UE , a TAU request between UE  and eNB , the TAU request forwarded from eNB  to MME , a context request and response, optional authentication and\/or security for UE  between MME  and HSS , a context acknowledge, a modify bearer request to SGW , a corresponding modify bearer request from SGW  to PGW , a policy and charging enforcement function (PCEF) initiated internet protocol connectivity access network (IP-CAN) session modification, corresponding modify bearer responses, an Update Location Request from MME  to HSS , as described above, a cancel location and corresponding acknowledgement between the old MME  and HSS , and an lu release command and lu release complete for the BSC .","HSS  can transmit an Update Location Acknowledgement  to MME , which can include subscription information related to UE . Additionally, as described, the Update Location Acknowledgement can also include a CSG roaming indicator to specify whether UE  is allowed to utilize autonomous CSG roaming in the VPLMN of MME . In this example, the CSG roaming indicator can specify that UE  is allowed to utilize autonomous CSG roaming in the VPLMN, and thus MME  can transmit an Update CSG Location Request  to CSS  to obtain CSG subscription information therefrom, such as one or more operator CSG or allowed CSG lists related to UE . CSS  can return an Update CSG Location Acknowledgement  to MME  including one or more such lists or other information regarding CSGs with which UE  can communicate in the VPLMN. Additional TAU procedure messages  are shown including a TAU accept from MME  and an optional TAU complete from UE .","Referring to , example methodologies relating to controlling CSG access for a device in a visited network are illustrated.

At , one or more parameters can be sent in response to the indication along with a CSG roaming indicator that specifies whether the device is allowed to utilize autonomous CSG roaming at the visited network. For example, the one or more parameters can relate to subscription information for the device or a related user. The CSG roaming indication, in an example, can be initialized by a network operator based on operator policy, a roaming agreement, a subscription class, a billing model, etc., as described. Moreover, the CSG roaming indicator can be specific to the visited network or can apply generally to visited networks.

System  comprises a base station  that can include multiple antenna groups. For example, one antenna group can include antennas  and , another group can comprise antennas  and , and an additional group can include antennas  and . Two antennas are illustrated for each antenna group; however, more or fewer antennas can be utilized for each group. Base station  can additionally include a transmitter chain and a receiver chain, each of which can in turn comprise a plurality of components associated with signal transmission and reception (e.g., processors, modulators, multiplexers, demodulators, demultiplexers, antennas, etc.), as is appreciated.","Base station  can communicate with one or more mobile devices such as mobile device  and mobile device ; however, it is to be appreciated that base station  can communicate with substantially any number of mobile devices similar to mobile devices  and . Mobile devices  and  can be, for example, cellular phones, smart phones, laptops, handheld communication devices, handheld computing devices, satellite radios, global positioning systems, PDAs, and\/or any other suitable device for communicating over wireless communication system . As depicted, mobile device  is in communication with antennas  and , where antennas  and  transmit information to mobile device  over a forward link  and receive information from mobile device  over a reverse link . Moreover, mobile device  is in communication with antennas  and , where antennas  and  transmit information to mobile device  over a forward link  and receive information from mobile device  over a reverse link . In a frequency division duplex (FDD) system, forward link  can utilize a different frequency band than that used by reverse link , and forward link  can employ a different frequency band than that employed by reverse link , for example. Further, in a time division duplex (TDD) system, forward link  and reverse link  can utilize a common frequency band and forward link  and reverse link  can utilize a common frequency band.","Each group of antennas and\/or the area in which they are designated to communicate can be referred to as a sector of base station . For example, antenna groups can be designed to communicate to mobile devices in a sector of the areas covered by base station . In communication over forward links  and , the transmitting antennas of base station  can utilize beamforming to improve signal-to-noise ratio of forward links  and  for mobile devices  and . Also, while base station  utilizes beamforming to transmit to mobile devices  and  scattered randomly through an associated coverage, mobile devices in neighboring cells can be subject to less interference as compared to a base station transmitting through a single antenna to all its mobile devices. Moreover, mobile devices  and  can communicate directly with one another using a peer-to-peer or ad hoc technology as depicted. According to an example, system  can be a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIGS. 1-5","FIG. 9","FIG. 10","FIGS. 6-8"],"b":["1500","1500","1510","1550","1500","1510","1550","1510","1550","11","14","1532","1572","1530","1570","1530","1570"]},"At base station , traffic data for a number of data streams is provided from a data source  to a transmit (TX) data processor . According to an example, each data stream can be transmitted over a respective antenna. TX data processor  formats, codes, and interleaves the traffic data stream based on a particular coding scheme selected for that data stream to provide coded data.","The coded data for each data stream can be multiplexed with pilot data using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) techniques. Additionally or alternatively, the pilot symbols can be frequency division multiplexed (FDM), time division multiplexed (TDM), or code division multiplexed (CDM). The pilot data is typically a known data pattern that is processed in a known manner and can be used at mobile device  to estimate channel response. The multiplexed pilot and coded data for each data stream can be modulated (e.g., symbol mapped) based on a particular modulation scheme (e.g., binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), M-phase-shift keying (M-PSK), M-quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM), etc.) selected for that data stream to provide modulation symbols. The data rate, coding, and modulation for each data stream can be determined by instructions performed or provided by processor .","The modulation symbols for the data streams can be provided to a TX MIMO processor , which can further process the modulation symbols (e.g., for OFDM). TX MIMO processor  then provides NT modulation symbol streams to NT transmitters (TMTR) through . In various aspects, TX MIMO processor  applies beamforming weights to the symbols of the data streams and to the antenna from which the symbol is being transmitted.","Each transmitter  receives and processes a respective symbol stream to provide one or more analog signals, and further conditions (e.g., amplifies, filters, and upconverts) the analog signals to provide a modulated signal suitable for transmission over the MIMO channel. Further, NT modulated signals from transmitters through are transmitted from NT antennas through , respectively.","At mobile device , the transmitted modulated signals are received by NR antennas through and the received signal from each antenna  is provided to a respective receiver (RCVR) through .

In addition, an access terminal  can be capable of operating both in macro environments and in smaller scale (e.g., residential) network environments. Thus, for example, depending on the current location of the access terminal , the access terminal  can be served by an access node  or by any one of a set of femto nodes  (e.g., the femto nodes A and B that reside within a corresponding user residence ). For example, when a subscriber is outside his home, he is served by a standard macro cell access node (e.g., node ) and when the subscriber is at home, he is served by a femto node (e.g., node A). Here, it should be appreciated that a femto node  can be backward compatible with existing access terminals .","A femto node  can be deployed on a single frequency or, in the alternative, on multiple frequencies. Depending on the particular configuration, the single frequency or one or more of the multiple frequencies can overlap with one or more frequencies used by a macro cell access node (e.g., node ). In some aspects, an access terminal  can be configured to connect to a preferred femto node (e.g., the home femto node of the access terminal ) whenever such connectivity is possible. For example, whenever the access terminal  is within the user's residence , it can communicate with the home femto node .","In some aspects, if the access terminal  operates within the mobile operator core network  but is not residing on its most preferred network (e.g., as defined in a preferred roaming list), the access terminal  can continue to search for the most preferred network (e.g., femto node ) using a Better System Reselection (BSR), which can involve a periodic scanning of available systems to determine whether better systems are currently available, and subsequent efforts to associate with such preferred systems. Using an acquisition table entry (e.g., in a preferred roaming list), in one example, the access terminal  can limit the search for specific band and channel. For example, the search for the most preferred system can be repeated periodically. Upon discovery of a preferred femto node, such as femto node , the access terminal  selects the femto node  for camping within its coverage area.","A femto node can be restricted in some aspects. For example, a given femto node can only provide certain services to certain access terminals. In deployments with so-called restricted (or closed) association, a given access terminal can only be served by the macro cell mobile network and a defined set of femto nodes (e.g., the femto nodes  that reside within the corresponding user residence ). In some implementations, a femto node can be restricted to not provide, for at least one access terminal, at least one of: signaling, data access, registration, paging, or service.","In some aspects, a restricted femto node (which can also be referred to as a Closed Subscriber Group H(e)NB) is one that provides service to a restricted provisioned set of access terminals. This set can be temporarily or permanently extended as necessary. In some aspects, a Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) can be defined as the set of access nodes (e.g., femto nodes) that share a common access control list of access terminals. A channel on which all femto nodes (or all restricted femto nodes) in a region operate can be referred to as a femto channel.","Various relationships can thus exist between a given femto node and a given access terminal. For example, from the perspective of an access terminal, an open femto node can refer to a femto node with no restricted association. A restricted femto node can refer to a femto node that is restricted in some manner (e.g., restricted for association and\/or registration). A home femto node can refer to a femto node on which the access terminal is authorized to access and operate on. A guest femto node can refer to a femto node on which an access terminal is temporarily authorized to access or operate on. An alien femto node can refer to a femto node on which the access terminal is not authorized to access or operate on, except for perhaps emergency situations (e.g., 911 calls).","From a restricted femto node perspective, a home access terminal can refer to an access terminal that authorized to access the restricted femto node. A guest access terminal can refer to an access terminal with temporary access to the restricted femto node. An alien access terminal can refer to an access terminal that does not have permission to access the restricted femto node, except for perhaps emergency situations, for example, 911 calls (e.g., an access terminal that does not have the credentials or permission to register with the restricted femto node).","For convenience, the disclosure herein describes various functionality in the context of a femto node. It should be appreciated, however, that a pico node can provide the same or similar functionality as a femto node, but for a larger coverage area. For example, a pico node can be restricted, a home pico node can be defined for a given access terminal, and so on.","A wireless multiple-access communication system can simultaneously support communication for multiple wireless access terminals. As mentioned above, each terminal can communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on the forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from the base stations to the terminals, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from the terminals to the base stations. This communication link can be established via a single-in-single-out system, a MIMO system, or some other type of system.","The various illustrative logics, logical blocks, modules, components, and circuits described in connection with the aspects disclosed herein may be implemented or performed with a general purpose processor, a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or other programmable logic device, discrete gate or transistor logic, discrete hardware components, or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein.
