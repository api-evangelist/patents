{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)","Definitions and Terminology"],"p":["The invention described here may be made, used and licensed by and for the U.S. Government for governmental purposes without paying royalty to me.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to reactive armor, and in particular, to a propelled impacter reactive armor.","2. Background Art","Conventional reactive armor structures and systems that are configured to defeat projectile and\/or other threats include systems and methods that have been implemented with varying degrees of success since the 1970's. One example of prior art armor can be found in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,368,660 ('660). As recited in the Abstract, the '660 patent discloses: \u201cA protective arrangement against projectiles is a wall structure formed from a wall layer of explosive material, and at least one additional wall layer covering at least one face of the wall layer of explosive material. The additional wall layer is made of a non-explosive, inert high-density material such as metal. In one embodiment both faces of the explosive wall layer are covered with a layer of inert, non-explosive high-density material such as metal. The protective arrangement is particularly suitable for protection against the destructive force of hollow explosive charge projectiles.\u201d","U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,665,794; 4,981,067; 5,025,707; 5,293,806; 5,637,824; 5,824,941; 6,311,605; 6,345,563; 6,846,372; 7,424,845; 7,540,229; and U.S. Published Applications 2006\/0065111; 2006\/0162539; and 2009\/0173250 also provide additional examples of some conventional protective armoring structures and systems.","However, conventional reactive armor generally presents compromises and limitations in performance, generally manifested as inadequate performance against threats and\/or potential hazard to nearby individuals and\/or equipment, collateral damage, and the like. In many cases, conventional reactive armors are either too fast reacting or too slow reacting for effective defeat of some threats. For example, conventional reactive armor implementations may react quickly enough to degrade a shaped charge threat, but are spent before the second charge in a tandem charge arrives. In other examples, the conventional reactive armor implementations may be slow, reacting at a rate suitable to effectively degrade a long rod penetrator, but moving too slowly to have good effect on a shaped charge jet. As such, there is a desire for improved reactive armor.","Accordingly, the present invention may provide a reactive armor that includes a tube; end caps installed on the ends of the tube; a plurality of impacters included inside of the tube; explosive included between the impacters and between the end caps and the impacters; and one or more passages, wherein the passages provide communication such that when a threat ruptures the tube, the propellant is progressively ignited from the rupture; and, except for the rupture that results from intrusion of the threat, the tube remains essentially intact.","The reactive armor that includes the tube and the end caps formed from at least one of steel, aluminum, composite, cermet, and ceramic.","The reactive armor that includes the impacters formed from at least one of steel, titanium, aluminum, composite, cermet, and ceramic.","The reactive armor that includes the passages implemented in connection with the impacters.","The reactive armor that includes the passages implemented in connection with the inside surface of the tube.","The reactive armor further includes a communication modifier, wherein the communication modifier seals, wholly or in part, the passage after the ignition of the explosive at one section within the tube has been communicated to a next charge of the explosive.","The reactive armor, wherein the communication modifier further comprises a bidirectional check valve in the impacter.","The reactive armor, wherein the bidirectional check valve has a barbell shape.","The reactive armor, wherein the bidirectional check valve comprises a metal ball that is held within an expanded region in the passage by a retainer that is snugly fit in the passage.","The reactive armor, wherein the bidirectional check valve has a barbell shape and the ends of the barbell have a tappet shape.","The reactive armor, wherein the communication modifier further includes a restriction within the passage.","The reactive armor, wherein the communication modifier further includes a flap that is positioned at the entrance of the passage.","The reactive armor, wherein the communication modifier further includes a shaped charge that is positioned at the entrance of the passage and is held in place by a strut, wherein, in response to the ignition of the explosive, the shaped charge generates a jet and a slug that are directed into the passage.","The reactive armor, wherein the impacters further include tapered, cone shaped with narrow end inwardly oriented hollowed out regions at one or both ends of the impacter.","The reactive armor, wherein the impacters are substantially adjacent.","The reactive armor, wherein the reactive armor further includes an end sleeve positioned inside of the tube and between the outermost impacter and the end cap.","The reactive armor, wherein the retainer further includes a frangible glass bead or an adhesive.","The reactive armor, wherein the retainer further includes a material that is combustible.","The reactive armor, wherein the restriction has a diameter that is in the range of 3% to 15% of the outside diameter of the impacter.","The reactive armor, wherein the shaped charge has an outside diameter in the range of 5% to 25% of the outside diameter of the impacter.","The above features, and other features and advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed descriptions thereof when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.","The following definitions and terminology are applied as understood and used by one skilled in the appropriate art.","The singular forms such as \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural references unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. For example, reference to \u201ca material\u201d includes reference to one or more of such materials, and \u201can element\u201d includes reference to one or more of such elements.","As used herein, \u201csubstantial\u201d and \u201cabout\u201d, when used in reference to a quantity or amount of a material, characteristic, parameter, and the like, refer to an amount that is sufficient to provide an effect that the material or characteristic was intended to provide as understood by one skilled in the art. The amount of variation generally depends on the specific implementation. Similarly, \u201csubstantially free of\u201d or the like refers to the lack of an identified composition, characteristic, or property. Particularly, assemblies that are identified as being \u201csubstantially free of\u201d are either completely absent of the characteristic, or the characteristic is present only in values which are small enough that no meaningful effect on the desired results is generated.","A plurality of items, structural elements, compositional elements, materials, subassemblies, and the like may be presented in a common list or table for convenience. However, these lists or tables should be construed as though each member of the list is individually identified as a separate and unique member. As such, no individual member of such list should be considered a de facto equivalent of any other member of the same list solely based on the presentation in a common group so specifically described.","Concentrations, values, dimensions, amounts, and other quantitative data may be presented herein in a range format. One skilled in the art will understand that such range format is used for convenience and brevity and should be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. For example, a size range of about 1 dimensional unit to about 100 dimensional units should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited limits, but also to include individual sizes such as 2 dimensional units, 3 dimensional units, 10 dimensional units, and the like; and sub-ranges such as 10 dimensional units to 50 dimensional units, 20 dimensional units to 100 dimensional units, and the like.","With reference to the Figures, the preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail. Generally, the present invention provides an improved system for a propelled impacter reactive armor. The reactive armor of the present invention may advantageously address (i.e., defeat or reduce the effect of) segmented kinetic energy threats, and also effectively defeat common projectile threats against which rapid reaction combined with sustained reaction is generally beneficial.","Referring to , a partial sectional view of an embodiment of a propelled impacter reactive armor (e.g., apparatus, device, system, assembly, etc.)  is shown. The armor  generally comprises a tube (e.g., case, shell, housing, container, encapsulation subassembly, etc.) ; at least one, and generally more than one (i.e., a plurality), impacter (e.g., piston, interrupter, disruptor, projectile, etc.)  (e.g., impacters -); a propellant (e.g., energetic material, pyrotechnic, explosive, and the like) ; and end caps (e.g., plugs, covers, opening encapsulators, retainers, and the like)  (e.g., end caps and ).","The end caps  are generally installed (i.e., fixed, fastened, crimped, threaded (as illustrated on ), adhered, etc.) on the respective ends of the tube ; the plurality of impacters  are generally included inside of the tube ; and the propellant  is generally included as a series of charges between the impacters  as well as between the end caps  and the impacters  that are located closest to the end caps . In alternative embodiments (not illustrated), the armor  may be implemented having a non-cylindrical cross sectional shape (e.g., square, hexagonal, etc.).","The tube  is generally implemented having a hollow cylindrical (i.e., tube, pipe, etc.) shape. The tube  and the end caps  are generally made from a rugged, strong material such as steel or aluminum, or, alternatively, any other suitable material for pressure containment, usually metal; however, may also include composites, cermets, ceramics, and the like; and having a wall thickness that is capable of withstanding the pressures that may be generated when the explosive  is ignited.","The impacters  are generally implemented having a cylindrical (i.e., piston, short rod, and the like) shape. The longitudinally positioned elements (e.g., end caps  and impacters ) are generally separated by a distance D (e.g., separations Da and Dn); however, in some examples, the separation D may be about zero. For example, the impacter and the end cap may have a longitudinal separation of Da; the impacters and may have a longitudinal separation of Dn, where Dn>Da; and the impacters and may be substantially adjacent. As such, the longitudinal separation distance, D, between longitudinally positioned elements (e.g., end caps  and impacters ) is not necessarily equal in all instances.","The plurality of impacters  are generally sized to snugly (i.e., sealably) and movably (i.e., longitudinally slidingly) fit within the interior of the tube . While illustrated having similar length, the plurality of impacters  are not necessarily equal in length. The impacters  are generally made from a material that is ballistically resistant such as steel, titanium, aluminum, composite, cermet, ceramic, and the like.","A threat  may rupture (e.g., puncture, pierce, etc.) the case . The threat  may include such threats as one or more projectiles, segmented rounds, metal fragments, fluid metals, penetrating jets (\u201cthorns\u201d, \u201cspikes\u201d, etc.) as generated by chemical energy rounds, high energy kinetic rounds, and the like. The propellant  is generally implemented as a granular (or, alternatively, solid cast, pressed, liquid, etc.) explosive material that is ignitable (e.g., detonated, deflagrated, set off, exploded, etc.) by the intrusion of the threat  through the tube .","The threat  generally ruptures the case  locally, and ignites the series of charges of the propellant ; however, except for the rupture that results from the intrusion of the threat , the case  generally remains essentially intact. When the separation distance, D, is zero or about zero, the reaction time of the propelled impacter reactive armor  to the threat  is generally enhanced (i.e., faster).","Referring to , diagrams illustrating cross sectional views, taken at line - of , of alternative embodiments of the armor  are shown. For clarity, illustration of the explosive  is omitted. The reactive armor  may further comprise one or more passages (e.g., orifices, channels, throughways, holes, vias, tunnels, passageways, communication elements, and the like)  that provide communication such that, when the threat  ruptures the tube , the explosive propellant  is progressively (e.g., serially, longitudinally, along the main axis of the case , etc.) ignited from the rupture through the inside of the tube .","Ignition and explosion of the propellant  generally proceeds serially from the rupture throughout the interior of the tube  by way of the passage . The gap between the inside wall of the case  and the impacter  is exaggerated in  for clarity. In one example, the passage  may be formed having a uniform cross section; however, as discussed in connection with  and , other alternative embodiments of the channel  may be implemented to meet the design criteria of a particular application.","In one embodiment (e.g., as illustrated in connection with ), the passages  may be implemented in connection with the impacters  as a single passage (e.g., impacter passage ). Alternatively, in another embodiment (e.g., as illustrated in connection with ), the passages  may be implemented in connection with the impacters  as a plurality of passages (e.g., impacter passages -). While illustrated as having substantially the same cross sectional shape and area, the passages -may be implemented having any different shapes and areas to meet the design criteria of a particular application. Alternatively, in yet another embodiment (e.g., as illustrated in connection with FIG. CB), one or more of the passages  may be implemented in connection with the case  (e.g., case passages ).","While illustrated as having substantially the same cross sectional shape and area, the passages may be implemented having any different shapes and areas to meet the design criteria of a particular application. Further, the passage  may be modified to alter the communication as is described below in connection with . In yet another embodiment (not illustrated), the passages -and may be implemented alone or in combination in the reactive armor .","Referring to , cross sectional side elevation views, taken at line - of , of alternative embodiments of a communication modifier (e.g., communication modification element and\/or elements, check valve, restrictor, and the like)  that may be implemented in connection with the armor  are illustrated. For clarity, illustration of the propellant  is omitted. In addition, further details of alternative embodiments of the impacter  (e.g., impacters -), and the passage  are illustrated in connection with the respective embodiments of the modifier .","The modifier  generally operates in connection with ignition of the explosive  to increase the velocity of the movement of the impacter  that results from the ignition and explosion of the propellant . The communication modifier  generally prevents the loss of propelling pressure through the ignition passage  by operation as a bidirectional check valve in the piston  that seals, wholly or in part, the passage  after the ignition of the propellant  at one section within the tube  has been communicated to the next charge of the explosive .","As implemented in the embodiment illustrated in , the impacter  may further comprise tapered (e.g., cone shaped, funnel shaped), inwardly oriented (i.e., longitudinally positioned having the base of the cone at the ends of the impacter  with the narrow portion of the cone towards middle) hollowed out (open) regions (e.g., chambers)  at one or both ends (both ends are illustrated having the tapered region ) of the impacter . The region  generally provides additional capacity for the propellant  within the tube .","In one example (e.g., as implemented in connection with the impacter ), the check valve  may be implemented having a \u201cbarbell\u201d shape where the stem (bar) of the barbell is within the passage  and the large ends of the barbell are within the regions  of the impacter . While illustrated having a \u201ctappet\u201d shape on , the barbell  ends may have any appropriate shape (e.g., spool shape). The barbell  generally rapidly moves longitudinally in response to the explosion of the propellant .","In another example, (e.g., as implemented in connection with the impacter ), the modifier  may be implemented as a ball that is contained within an enlarged region  of the passage . The valve  can be, for example, a metal ball that is retained (held in place) by a frangible or combustible retainer element  that is snugly positioned in the passage . In one embodiment, the retainer  may be implemented as a combustible material such as an explosive that is implemented mechanically to hold the ball  in place. In another example, the retainer  may be implemented as a frangible glass bead. In yet another example, the retainer  may be implemented as an adhesive bond. The ball  generally rapidly moves longitudinally in response to the explosion of the explosive propellant .","In another example, (e.g., as implemented in connection with the impacter ), the modifier  may be implemented as a valve (e.g., reed, flap, flapper, swing plate, hinge, tab, and the like) that is positioned at the entrance of the passage . When the explosive  is detonated, the force of the explosion will generally force the valve  to a substantially closed position across the passage .","In another example, (e.g., as implemented in connection with the impacter ), the modifier  may be implemented as a shaped charge igniter\/plug that is held in place in front of the entrance of the passage  with a strut . In response to the detonation of the explosive mass element  causing the collapse of the shaped charge liner element (typically made of a ductile metal such as copper), a shaped charge device is known to generate as output two components: (i) a so-called jet having a tip which travels at an extremely high speed (e.g., about 30,000 feet per second); (ii) followed by a so-called slug which generally travels at a lower speed than the jet. The difference in velocity between the tip and tail (slug) of the jet (as well as other jet characteristics) is determined by the design of the \u201ccone\u201d or \u201cliner\u201d (i.e. included angle, wall thickness, material properties, and contour). A shaped charge may be specifically designed to enhance the diameter and mass of the slug while keeping a high tip speed.","For details of shaped charge construction and operation, see, for example, Newhouse, Paul, \u201cA Primer on Shaped Charges\u201d, The Small Arms Review, Vol. 11, No. 1, October, 2007, pp. 94-97, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. In any case, the details of shaped charge construction and operation would be well known and understood by one of skill in the relevant art.","The modifiers  that are illustrated in connection with the impacter , may comprise the very small (e.g., having an outside diameter in the range of 5% to 25% of the outside diameter of the piston , and components sized accordingly per the Newhouse reference cited above) shaped charge . The shaped charge  generates a jet and a slug that are directed into the passage . The tip portion of the output of the shaped charge modifier  is used to pass through the center of the piston  aperture , and ignite the next charge, (the tip of shaped charge jets are generally the most effective form of energetic material initiation). The slug which follows the tip and is located in the rear portion of the jet from the shaped charge  then plugs the central passage  of the piston ","In another example, (e.g., as implemented in connection with the impacter ), the modifier  may be implemented as a restriction (e.g., orifice, reduced cross section, choke point, etc.) within the passage . To generate the desired longitudinal force on the piston when the explosive  is detonated, the small (e.g., having a diameter in the range of 3% to 15% of the outside diameter of the piston ) orifice  connecting larger cross sectional area regions of the passage  is generally adequate (i.e., will not leak too much) to generate the desired force may be implemented.","The reactive armor  may further comprise an end sleeve (e.g., spacer, stand off, etc.)  positioned inside of the case  and between the outermost impacter  (e.g., the piston and the end cap . The spacer  is generally implemented as a short tube, cylinder, and the like that fits snuggly inside the tube . The end sleeve  generally provides additional volume for the explosive  so that the piston element  that is nearest the end cap  (e.g., the piston ) can react as energetically as the other piston elements . While space could be provided within the end cap  to achieve the additional volume for the explosive , the implementation of the end sleeve  is generally preferable as more safe assembly of the armor  may be conducted when the explosive  is isolated from movement of the end cap  when the end cap  is screwed into place.","While not illustrated, any embodiment of the modifier  may be implemented in connection with the passage  on the inside of the inner wall of the case  as shown in connection with .","The armor  may potentially mitigate, disrupt, diminish, reduce, and\/or eliminate damaging or harmful effects from the threat  and collateral effects. The propelled impacter reactive armor  may be implemented as a plurality of assemblies . The armor  is generally positioned such that the anticipated direction of the threat  is intercepted, and the area to be protected is thus behind the armor  relative to the threat . The threat  may impact the tube  from any angle.","In one example, the armor  may be implemented positionally similar to the tubular packing bodies 3 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,665,794 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety; and in particular, as shown in FIGS.  and - and described throughout the patent document. In another example, the armor  may be implemented positionally similar to the tube and projectile apparatus (element 60) of U.S. Published Application 2006\/0065111, on FIGS. 12-16 and in the related description at paragraphs [0067]-[0071], which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","As is apparent then from the above detailed description, the present invention may provide an improved reactive armor , wherein the propelled impacters  are implemented within the housing  in connection with the explosive propellant  to act upon a variety of threats .","Various alterations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention and it is understood this invention is limited only by the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2C","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
