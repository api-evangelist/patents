{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was made, at least in part, under U.S. Government, Department of Energy, Contract No. DE-EE0002720. The Government may have rights in this invention.","The present disclosure relates to powertrain control in plugin hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).","Conventional hybrid electric vehicles combine internal combustion (IC) engines with electric propulsion systems to achieve better fuel economy than non-hybrid vehicles. Plugin hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) share the characteristics of both conventional hybrid electric vehicles and all-electric vehicles by using rechargeable batteries that can be restored to full charge by connecting (e.g. via a plug) to an external electric power source.","PHEVs are generally designed to operate in two modes. In the first mode, known as a charge depleting mode, vehicle operation results in a net discharge of the battery. Most PHEVs operate only the electric propulsion system in this first, charge depleting mode so as to provide all-electric operation. Charge depleting mode operation is generally continued until the battery charge drops below a threshold, at which time the PHEV operates in a second, charge sustaining mode. In the charge sustaining mode, the PHEV operates much like a conventional hybrid, using both the IC engine and electric propulsion system to keep the battery at a sufficiently high level of charge to enable, for instance, start\/stop operation of the IC engine.","Generally, powertrain control in PHEVs is designed such that the PHEV aggressively operates in charge depleting mode from the beginning of each drive cycle. Charge depleting mode remains active until the battery charge level drops below a charge sustaining threshold. After this, the PHEV operates in charge sustaining mode. Thus, the IC engine, if and when it operates, will not likely be operated as efficiently as it could. Likewise, because the PHEV generally uses the electric propulsion system exclusively in the charge depleting mode, it too will likely not be operated as efficiently as it could. In a typical PHEV, the power needs of the vehicle are not known for any drive cycles, even if the vehicle is travelling a highly repeated route.","A powertrain control system for a plugin hybrid electric vehicle. The system comprises an adaptive charge sustaining controller; at least one internal data source operably connected to the adaptive charge sustaining controller; and a memory connected to the adaptive charge sustaining controller for storing data generated by the at least one internal data source. The adaptive charge sustaining controller is operable to select an operating mode of the vehicle's powertrain along a given route based on programming generated from data stored in the memory associated with that route.","In one form, the powertrain control system further includes at least one navigational data source connected to the adaptive charge sustaining controller, wherein the memory also stores data generated by the at least one navigational data source,","In another form, powertrain control system further includes at least one external data source operably connected to the adaptive charge sustaining controller.","A method of adaptively controlling operation of a plugin hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) powertrain is provided. The method includes identifying a route being traveled. The method further includes loading the stored adaptive charge sustaining mode programming for the identified route, if stored adaptive charge sustaining mode programming exists for the identified route. The method further includes controlling operation of the PHEV powertrain along the identified route by selecting from a plurality of operational modes, the mode selection being defined by the stored adaptive charge sustaining mode programming.","In one form, the step of identifying the route being traveled includes empirically matching data from an initial period of vehicle operation to route identifying data associated with the stored adaptive charge sustaining mode programming.","In another form, the step of identifying the route being traveled includes evaluating navigational data collected in the initial period of vehicle operation.","In another form, the method further includes generating adaptive charge sustaining mode programming if no stored adaptive charge sustaining mode programming exists for the identified route.","In another form, wherein the generating step includes collecting vehicle data from a drive cycle start to end and analyzing the vehicle data to determine which operational mode is appropriate for each segment of the given route.","In another form, the method further includes collecting navigational data from the drive cycle start to end and using the navigational data in analyzing which operational mode is appropriate for each segment of the given route.","In another form, the method further includes altering the stored adaptive charge sustaining mode programming based on external data.","Further areas of applicability of the present disclosure will become apparent from the detailed description, drawings and claims provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description, including disclosed embodiments and drawings, are merely exemplary in nature intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention, its application or use. Thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be within the scope of the invention.","In one form, the present disclosure provides a new powertrain control methodology for plugin hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) that provides an adaptive charge sustaining mode in which the rate of battery depletion is based on statistical and empirical learning. Broadly, the PHEV is switched between the charge depleting and charge sustaining modes based on learned route attributes, e.g., distance, average rate of speed, and elevation changes, and\/or driving conditions, e.g., temperature, precipitation, and traffic levels.","An adaptive system such as the one disclosed herein allows decisions to be made about the vehicle operating mode intelligently based on the drive history along a certain route, accounting for both driver preference and driving conditions. As a result, the percentage of time that the drivetrain operates in its Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC)-mapped maximum efficiency region would be higher compared to conventional PHEV operational strategies. An adaptive methodology will enable the vehicle to achieve higher fuel economy on a learned route compared to a static system.","It is well known that the discharge rate of a battery directly correlates to its efficiency. If the PHEV can be operated in charge sustaining mode (i.e., with the IC engine on) in a high efficiency region even in the early part of a drive cycle, the PHEV can be operated to conserve battery power and\/or discharge the battery at a lower rate and increase overall fuel economy over the course of an entire drive cycle.","Generally, the route is determined based on driving history or empirical matching to the driver's initial route on starting a driving cycle. For instance, the certainty of the current route can be assured as the driver proceeds along an already learned path. As the confidence in the driver's heading increases, battery control strategy can be weighted more towards the optimum operation strategy that has been determined for that route, as opposed to nominal operation.","For routes that have been learned, i.e., those which programming has already been determined, adaptive powertrain control can optimize use of the charge depleting and charge sustaining modes where the methodology best determines use of each mode is appropriate. Where distance and drive cycle attributes are learned, the PHEV need not necessarily choose the charge depleting mode from the start of the drive cycle to the point where the battery charge falls below the charge sustaining threshold. For instance, the PHEV can operate in a charge depleting, all electric mode for the entirety of a 20 mile commute except a short sustained elevation climb portion at the very beginning of the route that would normally result in near complete depletion of the battery. Without the adaptive change, the PHEV would have operated in charge depletion mode for the climb, thus requiring the PHEV to operate in charge sustaining mode for the entire return trip.","The adaptive charge sustaining methodology can be used to deliberately constrain battery power based on the distance to be driven and the type of route to be taken. This strategy enhances the charge depletion mode range of the vehicle by allowing the system to turn the IC engine on (switch to charge sustaining mode) more aggressively during portions of the route where it would be more efficient to use the IC engine instead of the electric propulsion system.","In another embodiment described herein, learning need not be based on actual driving. Learning can be based on evaluating certain characteristics of an entered route (i.e., in a GPS navigation system) and comparing them to operational characteristics of the PHEV (i.e., rate of battery charge depletion at certain speeds, or at certain elevation grades). The characteristics of the new route can also be evaluated based on their similarity to already learned routes. Specifically, programming for portions for already learned routes that are repeated can be recycled to generate programming for new routes.","In yet another embodiment, the powertrain control system can perform certain operations, e.g., warming up\/conditioning the batteries, at a certain interval before expected execution of a route. For instance, battery conditioning can occur every weekday a certain time before the driver is known to operate the vehicle (i.e., every day the driver leaves for work at 7:00 AM, so the powertrain control system begins battery conditioning at 6:45 AM)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","1","2","4","6","8","6","10","12","16","18","20","24","26","22","28","24","26","8","8","3","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","2","4","2","3","8","8","8","28"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["30","1","2","31","34","40","41","42","31","32","33","35","31","30","36","31","31"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["60","31","61","31","32","31","63","33","32","62","31","64"]},"At step , the data collected is analyzed to determine which modes of operation should be used at which times on the learned route. For instance, ACSC  can be programmed to prefer charge sustaining mode during expected periods of acceleration or increased power consumption, such as during a sustained elevation climb. Optionally, collected navigation data is injected into this determination (step ). Once the programming is generated (step ) it is stored for future use on the same route, or as mentioned above, for use in generating programming on similar routes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["70","31","60","71","31","31","73","33","75","31","76","31","60"]},"The determination can also be pre-established (step ). For instance, the driver can enter a destination into a navigation system , or ACSC  can learn that a particular route will be driven at a particular time (i.e., ACSC  can be programmed to know that the driver always commutes to work during the weekdays at 7:00 AM). If ACSC  already knows the route in advance, it can perform certain pre-start operations at step , e.g., preconditioning the battery system  before operation commences.","Once adaptive charge sustaining mode programming is activated (step ), the PHEV will operate in either charge sustaining or charge depleting mode as determined by the ACSC  (step ). Optionally, ACSC  can temporarily alter the programming based on input from external data sources  (e.g., traffic data, temperature, or weather conditions) (step ). For instance, if high traffic levels are detected, preference for charge sustaining mode can be increased. Additionally, as a route is driven, further data can be collected to refine the adaptive charge sustaining mode programming for an existing route (step ), as in methodology .","Although ACSC  will generally attempt to identify the route being driven with statistical confidence before applying the adaptive charge sustaining mode programming, ACSC  can also phase in the adaptive charge sustaining mode programming as the confidence in the driver's heading increases. Thus, the control strategy can be weighted more towards the optimum operation strategy that has been determined for that route, as it becomes clearer that the vehicle is actually on that route. In certain traveled routes the control strategy having learned and adapted to the various factors such as traffic conditions at different times of day will provide optimum operation strategy and direct the vehicle operation accordingly including any pre-start operations and operating between charge depleting and charge sustaining modes based on the learned data and current data.","It should also be noted that for pre-established\/driver entered routes, an analysis can be performed based on navigational data to prepare preliminary adaptive charge sustaining mode programming, which can be later refined with information about the driver's driving preferences (as expressed through, among other things, monitored speed\/acceleration rates).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIGS. 6-8","FIG. 6","FIG. 7","FIG. 8"],"b":["60","70","30","60","70","7","60","70","1","2","3"]}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
