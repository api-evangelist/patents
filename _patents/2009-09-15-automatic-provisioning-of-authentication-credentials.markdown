{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["IEEE 802.1x authentication is currently a standard solution for hospital information technology departments. Typically, each network device must be manually provisioned with authentication credentials. For example, in order to use 802.1x authentication hospitals and institutes need to manually install certificates on hundreds of infusion pumps. These certificates may have a lifetime of 12 months, so the effort must be repeated each year. Adding in thousands of other devices, one may see the substantial effort required to manually update the authentication credentials on each device.","It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present invention has been made.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Embodiments described herein relate to methods and systems of automatically provisioning authentication credentials on a plurality of network devices.","As discussed herein, an aspect of some embodiments relates to a method of automatically provisioning authentication credentials on a plurality of network devices. The method includes determining a process for provisioning the authentication credentials for the plurality of network devices, providing a computer program to follow the process, and applying the computer program to automatically provision the authentication credentials for the plurality of network devices.","Another aspect of some embodiments relates to a computer-readable storage medium containing computer executable instructions which when executed by a computer perform a method of automatically provisioning authentication credentials on a plurality of network devices, comprising: determining a process for provisioning the authentication credentials for the plurality of network devices; providing a computer program to follow the process; and applying the computer program to automatically provision the authentication credentials for the plurality of network devices.","Further aspects relate to a method of automatically provisioning authentication credentials on a plurality of network devices. The method includes determining a process for provisioning the authentication credentials for the plurality of devices. The process includes steps of gaining access to a network device, entering a command to reach a network service interface associated to the network device, indicating a location of the authentication credentials, and initiating installation of the authentication credentials. The method also includes providing a computer program to follow the process. The computer program is a script that is automatically executed without user intervention. The method further includes developing a list of the plurality of devices that need to be provisioned, associating the list of the plurality of devices to the computer program, executing the computer program for each device, and outputting whether each of the plurality of network devices has a successful authentication credential update.","These and other features and advantages, which characterize the present invention, will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed.","As briefly described above, embodiments of the present invention are directed to automatically provisioning authentication credentials on a plurality of network devices. In the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustrations specific embodiments or examples. These embodiments may be combined, other embodiments may be utilized, and structural changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals refer to like elements through the several figures, aspects of the present invention and an exemplary computing operating environment will be described.  and the following discussion are intended to provide a brief, general description of a suitable computing environment in which the invention may be implemented. While the invention will be described in the general context of program modules that execute in conjunction with an application program that runs on an operating system on a personal computer, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention may also be implemented in combination with other program modules.","Generally, program modules include routines, programs, components, data structures, and other types of structures that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, cellular and personal communication service (PCS) telephones, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. The invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.","Embodiments of the invention may be implemented as a computer process (method), a computing system, or as an article of manufacture, such as a computer program product or computer readable media. The computer program product may be a computer storage media readable by a computer system and encoding a computer program of instructions for executing a computer process. The computer program product may also be a propagated signal on a carrier readable by a computing system and encoding a computer program of instructions for executing a computer process.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","104","106","104","106","102","104","104","104"]},"In one example embodiment, the network is the Internet in which embodiments of the invention may be implemented; however the invention applies to any network on which a network device  requires authentication credentials. The specific examples are not intended to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","In one example embodiment, the network devices  may use the IEEE 802.1x standard for network access control. The IEEE 802.1x standard may provide an authentication mechanism to the network devices  wishing to attach to a network, either establishing a point-to-point connection or preventing it if authentication fails. The IEEE 802.1x standard may be used for wireless 802.11 access points and may be used to implement Extensible Authentication Protocol.","Each network device  may need authentication credentials to access the network infrastructure as well as services on the network. The network devices  may need to be provisioned with the authentication credentials when the existing credentials are approaching an expiration date, when the devices are being configured for a different purpose or area of the institution, or when altering the state of an existing service or capability. Generally, provisioning is a process of preparing and equipping a network device so that it can provide services to other systems on the network and to the end users.","Referring still to , the network devices  may receive and store authentication credentials. According to one embodiment, each network device  may include a network service interface  which may be configured to receive authentication credentials. The network service interface  may be a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. One example of the network service interface  is an Internet application programming interface that can be accessed over a network, such as the Internet, and executed on a remote system hosting the requested services such as the network devices . According to one embodiment, the network service interface  may support a user interface to receive and install the authentication credentials to the network device . The network service interface  may have a user interface such as a web server application to interact with a user. In another embodiment, the network service interface  may not necessarily have a user interface, instead, the network service interface  may be an application programming interface (API) configured to directly receive and install the authentication credentials.","Each network device  may also include a storage means , such as a database to store the authentication credentials. The storage means  may also store other information or data relating to the network device , including the status of the most recent authentication update.","Referring still to , the network system  may include the authentication provisioning application  which may be configured to automatically provision the authentication credentials for the network devices . The authentication provisioning application  may communicate with the network devices  using internet protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, SNMP, Telnet, SSH or any other suitable Internet protocols. The authentication provisioning application  may include a computer program  to be executed to provision the authentication credentials for the network devices . According to one embodiment, the computer program  may be developed in a Python programming script or any other suitable computer languages. The computer program  may be configured to run in the authentication provisioning application  and allow the authentication provisioning application  to access and navigate the network service interface  of the network devices . This will allow the provisioning application  to provision the authentication credentials remotely. Specifically, the computer program  may follow and automatically execute pre-determined provisioning process or steps for each network devices . The computer program  thus may be executed without a user intervention, for example by running as a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program or as a cron job. In one example, a TSR may be a computer system call in DOS computer operating systems that returns control to the system as if the program has quit, but keeps the program in memory. In another example, a cron job may be a time-based job (e.g., a command or shell script) in Unix-like computer operating systems which is scheduled to run automatically at a certain time or date.","The network devices  may be different types or classes of devices. Different types or classes of devices may have different pre-determined provisioning process and interface for each type. The authentication provisioning application  may identify different types of the network devices  and automatically apply each associated pre-determined provisioning process for each different type of the network devices . The network service interface  may be different for each different type of devices. The authentication provisioning application  may be able to identify and navigate each different network service interface . According to one embodiment, the authentication provisioning application  may recognize the device type by checking a universally unique identifier (UUID) such as a media access control address (MAC address) that is associated with that network device .","Referring still to , the authentication provisioning application  may have a database  that may store information about mapping each specific class of network devices to a particular script or sub-routine of the computer program . The computer program  may execute and automatically apply each associated provisioning process to each specific type of the network devices . According to one embodiment, the particular script or sub-routine of the computer program  may be developed and provided to replicate keystrokes needed to provision a device in that class, or scripts may be created manually, then executed multiple times by the authentication provisioning application . Once this is done, any device in that class can be provisioned by creating a list of devices, connecting to each of those devices and running the script appropriate for that device. In addition, the database  may retain information of registered devices for future reference.","The authentication credentials may be installed and updated remotely through the authentication provisioning application . Using the infusion pumps as an example, there may be hundreds of infusion pumps in various locations of several hospitals. Each infusion pump may be configured to have a network connection  and to receive and store an authentication certificate. The authentication credentials thus may be updated remotely through the authentication provisioning application  without taking the devices out of service.","The authentication provisioning application  may develop a list of network devices  that need to be provisioned. The list may be from a database, user entry, or it may look up the network devices  based on a filter of information derived from a network appliance such as a wireless controller (not shown), for example, an Aruba 3200 or a Cisco 4402. The filter may operate on any data on data that may be used to derive the device type, manufacturer, or user including a MAC address, devices associated to a certain access point, and devices with certificates about to expire. A TSR or cron job could scan for new devices of a known type and then alert the administrator and\/or install the credentials if the network is known to be secure, as in a stand-alone network in an IT lab. Using HTTP, HTTPS, SNMP, Telnet, SSH or other suitable interne protocols as appropriate for the target device , the authentication provisioning application  may be configured to connect to each network device  and perform authentication provisioning for each device  in the list. In one example embodiment, the authentication provisioning application  may provision authentication credentials on multiple types of devices that are extensible to include different authentication credentials. For example, the authentication provisioning application  may install different 802.1x certificates on each device . The authentication provisioning application  may also install a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) on each device . The authentication provisioning application  may extract distinguished features or identify from the network service interface , e.g., text or graphics, on an opening web page.","After the authentication credentials are installed, the authentication provisioning application  may output and indicate whether each network device  has a successful authentication credential update or not. The authentication provisioning application  may update the database  as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"202"},"Next at operation , a computer program such as a script may be developed to follow the provisioning process or steps of each network device. For example, these steps may include: entering a username and password, navigating to an authentication page, entering the pathname and filename for the certificate, and pressing the upload button.","Finally at operation , the computer program may be applied to and automatically executed to provision the authentication credentials for the network devices without a user intervention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"302"},"Then at operation , each specific class of network devices may be mapped to a particular script or sub-routine of the computer program. Any device in that class may then be provisioned by running the particular script or sub-routine appropriate for that device.","Next at operation , the particular script or sub-routine may be executed for each specific class of network devices. Finally at operation , the authentication provisioning application may output and indicate whether each network device has a successful authentication credential update or not. This output may include updating the database status for each device to indicate which devices have been successfully updated, which devices failed to update, and which devices are missing or inaccessible. This information may be used in turn to provide a periodic update or report to network administrators so that they know which devices require manual intervention or service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","404","116","406","400"]},"Referring now to , the following discussion is intended to provide a brief, general description of a suitable computing environment in which embodiments of the invention may be implemented.
