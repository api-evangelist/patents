NAD is necessary for several signaling pathways including among others poly ADP-ribosylation in DNA repair, mono-ADP-ribosylation in both the immune system and G-protein-coupled signaling, and NAD is also required by sirtuins for their deacetylase activity (Garten, A. et al 20, 130-138, 2008).","NAMPT (also known as pre-B-cell-colony-enhancing factor (PBEF) and visfatin) is an enzyme that catalyzes the phosphoribosylation of nicotinamide and is the rate-limiting enzyme in one of two pathways that salvage NAD.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"8.38mm","wi":"17.19mm","file":"US09334264-20160510-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Increasing evidence suggests that NAMPT inhibitors have potential as anticancer agents. Cancer cells have a higher basal turnover of NAD and also display higher energy requirements compared with normal cells. Additionally, increased NAMPT expression has been reported in colorectal cancer (Van Beijnum, J. R. et al 101, 118-127, 2002) and NAMPT is involved in angiogenesis (Kim, S. R. et al. 357, 150-156, 2007). Small-molecule inhibitors of NAMPT have been shown to cause depletion of intracellular NAD+ levels and ultimately induce tumor cell death (Hansen, C M et al. 20, 42111-4220, 2000) as well as inhibit tumor growth in xenograft models (Olese, U. H. et al. 9, 1609-1617, 2010).","NAMPT inhibitors also have potential as therapeutic agents in inflammatory and metabolic disorders (Galli, M. et al 70, 8-11, 2010). For example, NAMPT is the predominant enzyme in T and B lymphocytes. Selective inhibition of NAMPT leads to NAD+ depletion in lymphocytes blocking the expansion that accompanies autoimmune disease progression whereas cell types expressing the other NAD+ generating pathways might be spared. A small molecule NAMPT inhibitor (FK866) has been shown to selectively block proliferation and induce apoptosis of activated T cells and was efficacious in animal models of arthritis (collagen-induced arthritis) (Busso, N. et al. 3, e2267, 2008). FK866 ameliorated the manifestations of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of T-cell mediated autoimmune disorders. (Bruzzone, S et al. 4, e7897, 2009). NaMPT activity increases NF-kB transcriptional activity in human vascular endothelial cell, resulting in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activation, suggesting a role for NAMPT inhibitors in the prevention of inflammatory mediated complications of obesity and type 2 diabetes (Adya, R. et. Al. 31, 758-760, 2008).","One embodiment of this invention, therefore, pertains to compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which are useful as inhibitors of NAMPT, the compounds having Formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"31.92mm","wi":"71.63mm","file":"US09334264-20160510-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Rand Rare each independently selected from the group consisting of R, C(O)R, C(O)NHR, and C(O)N(R);

This invention, therefore, is not limited to the embodiments described in this patent application, and may be variously modified.","Abbreviations and Definitions","Unless otherwise defined herein, scientific and technical terms used in connection with the present invention shall have the meanings that are commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. The meaning and scope of the terms should be clear, however, in the event of any latent ambiguity, definitions provided herein take precedent over any dictionary or extrinsic definition. In this application, the use of \u201cor\u201d means \u201cand\/or\u201d unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, the use of the term \u201cincluding\u201d, as well as other forms, such as \u201cincludes\u201d and \u201cincluded\u201d, is not limiting. With reference to the use of the words \u201ccomprise\u201d or \u201ccomprises\u201d or \u201ccomprising\u201d in this patent application (including the claims), Applicants note that unless the context requires otherwise, those words are used on the basis and clear understanding that they are to be interpreted inclusively, rather than exclusively, and that Applicants intend each of those words to be so interpreted in construing this patent application, including the claims below. For a variable that occurs more than one time in any substituent or in the compound of the invention or any other formulae herein, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Combinations of substituents are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. Stable compounds are compounds which can be isolated in a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture.","It is meant to be understood that proper valences are maintained for all combinations herein, that monovalent moieties having more than one atom are attached through their left ends, and that divalent moieties are drawn from left to right.","As used in the specification and the appended claims, unless specified to the contrary, the following terms have the meaning indicated:","The term \u201calkyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a straight- or branched-chain saturated hydrocarbyl substituent typically containing from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms; or in another embodiment, from 1 to about 8 carbon atoms; in another embodiment, from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms; and in another embodiment, from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms. Examples of such substituents include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, iso-amyl, and hexyl and the like.","The term \u201calkenyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a straight- or branched-chain hydrocarbyl substituent containing one or more double bonds and typically from 2 to about 10 carbon atoms; or in another embodiment, from 2 to about 8 carbon atoms; in another embodiment, from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms; and in another embodiment, from 2 to about 4 carbon atoms. Examples of such substituents include ethenyl (vinyl), 2-propenyl, 3-propenyl, 1,4-pentadienyl, 1,4-butadienyl, 1-butenyl, 2-butenyl, and 3-butenyl and the like.","The term \u201calkynyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a straight- or branched-chain hydrocarbyl substituent containing one or more triple bonds and typically from 2 to about 10 carbon atoms; or in another embodiment, from 2 to about 8 carbon atoms; in another embodiment, from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms; and in another embodiment, from 2 to about 4 carbon atoms. Examples of such substituents include ethynyl, 2-propynyl, 3-propynyl, 2-butynyl, and 3-butynyl and the like.","The term \u201ccarbocyclyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a saturated cyclic (i.e., \u201ccycloalkyl\u201d), partially saturated cyclic (i.e., \u201ccycloalkenyl\u201d), or completely unsaturated (i.e., \u201caryl\u201d) hydrocarbyl substituent containing from 3 to 14 carbon ring atoms (\u201cring atoms\u201d are the atoms bound together to form the ring or rings of a cyclic substituent). A carbocyclyl may be a single-ring (monocyclic) or polycyclic ring structure.","A carbocyclyl may be a single ring structure, which typically contains from 3 to 8 ring atoms, more typically from 3 to 6 ring atoms, and even more typically 5 to 6 ring atoms. Examples of such single-ring carbocyclyls include cyclopropyl (cyclopropanyl), cyclobutyl (cyclobutanyl), cyclopentyl (cyclopentanyl), cyclopentenyl, cyclopentadienyl, cyclohexyl (cyclohexanyl), cyclohexenyl, cyclohexadienyl, and phenyl. A carbocyclyl may alternatively be polycyclic (i.e., may contain more than one ring). Examples of polycyclic carbocyclyls include bridged, fused, and spirocyclic carbocyclyls. In a spirocyclic carbocyclyl, one atom is common to two different rings. An example of a spirocyclic carbocyclyl is spiropentanyl. In a bridged carbocyclyl, the rings share at least two common non-adjacent atoms. Examples of bridged carbocyclyls include bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanyl, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-enyl, and adamantanyl. In a fused-ring carbocyclyl system, two or more rings may be fused together, such that two rings share one common bond. Examples of two- or three-fused ring carbocyclyls include naphthalenyl, tetrahydronaphthalenyl (tetralinyl), indenyl, indanyl (dihydroindenyl), anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl, and decalinyl.","The term \u201ccycloalkyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a saturated cyclic hydrocarbyl substituent containing from 3 to 14 carbon ring atoms. A cycloalkyl may be a single carbon ring, which typically contains from 3 to 8 carbon ring atoms and more typically from 3 to 6 ring atoms. Examples of single-ring cycloalkyls include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. A cycloalkyl may alternatively be polycyclic or contain more than one ring. Examples of polycyclic cycloalkyls include bridged, fused, and spirocyclic carbocyclyls.","The term \u201caryl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an aromatic carbocyclyl containing from 6 to 14 carbon ring atoms. An aryl may be monocyclic or polycyclic (i.e., may contain more than one ring). In the case of polycyclic aromatic rings, only one ring the polycyclic system is required to be unsaturated while the remaining ring(s) may be saturated, partially saturated or unsaturated. Examples of aryls include phenyl, naphthalenyl, indenyl, indanyl, and tetrahydronapthyl.","In some instances, the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbyl substituent (e.g., alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or cycloalkyl) is indicated by the prefix \u201cC-C-\u201d, wherein x is the minimum and y is the maximum number of carbon atoms in the substituent. Thus, for example, \u201cC-C-alkyl\u201d refers to an alkyl substituent containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Illustrating further, C-C-cycloalkyl means a saturated hydrocarbyl ring containing from 3 to 8 carbon ring atoms.","The term \u201chydrogen\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a hydrogen radical, and may be depicted as \u2014H.","The term \u201chydroxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014OH.","The term \u201ccarboxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014OH.","The term \u201camino\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014NH.","The term \u201chalogen\u201d or \u201chalo\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a fluorine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014F), chlorine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014Cl), bromine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014Br), or iodine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014I).","If a substituent is described as being \u201csubstituted\u201d, a non-hydrogen radical is in the place of hydrogen radical on a carbon or nitrogen of the substituent. Thus, for example, a substituted alkyl substituent is an alkyl substituent in which at least one non-hydrogen radical is in the place of a hydrogen radical on the alkyl substituent. To illustrate, monofluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with a fluoro radical, and difluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with two fluoro radicals. It should be recognized that if there are more than one substitution on a substituent, each non-hydrogen radical may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated).","If a substituent is described as being \u201coptionally substituted\u201d, the substituent may be either (1) not substituted or (2) substituted. If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non-hydrogen radicals, that substituent may be either (1) not substituted; or (2) substituted by up to that particular number of non-hydrogen radicals or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent, whichever is less. Thus, for example, if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non-hydrogen radicals, then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non-hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate, tetrazolyl (which has only one substitutable position) would be optionally substituted with up to one non-hydrogen radical. To illustrate further, if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non-hydrogen radical.","This patent application uses the terms \u201csubstituent\u201d and \u201cradical\u201d interchangeably.","The prefix \u201chalo\u201d indicates that the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with one or more independently selected halogen radicals.

Examples of haloalkyls include chloromethyl, 1-bromoethyl, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, and 1,1,1-trifluoroethyl. It should be recognized that if a substituent is substituted by more than one halogen radical, those halogen radicals may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated).","The prefix \u201cperhalo\u201d indicates that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is replaced with independently selected halogen radicals, i.e., each hydrogen radical on the substituent is replaced with a halogen radical.

Isotope containing compounds have been used in pharmaceutical research to investigate the in vivo metabolic fate of the compounds by evaluation of the mechanism of action and metabolic pathway of the nonisotope-labeled parent compound (Blake et al. 64, 3, 367-391 (1975)). Such metabolic studies are important in the design of safe, effective therapeutic drugs, either because the in vivo active compound administered to the patient or because the metabolites produced from the parent compound prove to be toxic or carcinogenic (Foster et al., Advances in Drug Research Vol. 14, pp. 2-36, Academic press, London, 1985; Kato et al., J. 36(10):927-932 (1995); Kushner et al., 77, 79-88 (1999).","In addition, non-radio active isotope containing drugs, such as deuterated drugs called \u201cheavy drugs,\u201d can be used for the treatment of diseases and conditions related to NAMPT activity.

These effects and alterations can affect the pharmacodynamic response of the drug molecule if the isotopic substitution affects a region involved in a ligand-receptor interaction. While some of the physical properties of a stable isotope-labeled molecule are different from those of the unlabeled one, the chemical and biological properties are the same, with one important exception: because of the increased mass of the heavy isotope, any bond involving the heavy isotope and another atom will be stronger than the same bond between the light isotope and that atom. Accordingly, the incorporation of an isotope at a site of metabolism or enzymatic transformation will slow said reactions potentially altering the pharmacokinetic profile or efficacy relative to the non-isotopic compound.","Compounds","Suitable groups for R, R, R, R, and Rin compounds of Formula (I) are independently selected.
