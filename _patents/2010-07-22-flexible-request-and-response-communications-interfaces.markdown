No. 11\/833,867 filed Aug. 3, 2007, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,788,250 and entitled \u201cFlexible Request and Response Communications Interfaces,\u201d which claims the priority benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60\/821,516 filed Aug. 4, 2006 and entitled \u201cFlexible Request\/Response Communications Interfaces.\u201d The disclosure of each of the aforementioned applications is incorporated by reference.","1. Field","This invention relates to storage of items in a database, and in particular to storage with user-defined item categories and parameters to allow for extensible customized searching and retrieval.","2. Related Art","The Internet is a vast pool of information and data that, when manageable, is a very useful resource. However, data accessible via the Internet is stored following different standards, file types and layouts, thus finding relevant data is often difficult.","In searching for data and information on the Internet or on any network, users have two choices: first, one may use a keyword search that matches the user provided search terms to the terms present in a document. For example, one may enter a set of laptop specifications, and results returned would hopefully include laptops for sale, but may also include reviews of laptops or forum posts looking for laptops with those specifications.","Alternatively, one may use a specially designed interface that searches a particular website or database or other resource for specialized information. For example, if one were to visit a laptop website and fill in fields for memory, size, weight and hard drive capacity, laptops fitting those criteria would be returned as results. However, such specialized interfaces are only available on specialized websites and for certain products.","Thus, in general the quality of search results is negatively proportional to the amount and variety of data that can be searched.","Disclosed are methods and systems for database storage allowing subscriber entities to create custom, specialized interfaces for storing different classes of information based on subscribed-defined categories and parameters, allowing for efficient search and retrieval of the information by users using the subscriber-defined categories and parameters.","In one aspect, a method for defining an interface comprises sending an interface to a supplier for defining a new request type based on a set of attributes and a set of parameters, receiving from the supplier a set of attribute values for the set of attributes and a set of parameter names and parameter data type values for the set of parameters, creating a request type in a database based on the set of attribute values and associating the set of parameter names and parameter data types with the request type, receiving from the supplier a supplier link for communicating with the supplier, and associating the supplier link with the newly created request type, thereby allowing the database to be searched for the supplier according to the request type and the set of parameter names and parameter data types and allowing communication with the supplier via the supplier link for the request type.","In another aspect, a method for processing a search request comprises receiving from a user a set of search terms indicating a category and a set of parameter values associated with the category, retrieving from a database a request type satisfying the search terms wherein the request type indicates one or more supplier links, sending the search terms to one or more suppliers as indicated by the one or more supplier links, receiving a set of results from the one or more suppliers in response to the search terms, and sending the set of results to the user. Further aspects of the present invention are described herein.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the invention can be practiced without these specific details.","Reference in this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment, nor are separate or alternative embodiments mutually exclusive of other embodiments. Moreover, various features are described which may be exhibited by some embodiments and not by others. Similarly, various requirements are described which may be requirements for some embodiments but not other embodiments.","Disclosed is a system for allowing the creation of user-defined request types and for allowing entities to communicate with the system using such request types. The system allows users to create specialized custom interfaces for different classes of information. The system utilizes a database to store information and respond to queries, and in particular allows searching based on subscriber-defined categories and parameters.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"One or more users  and subscribers  (hereafter also referred to as \u201csuppliers\u201d) communicate with the system  (hereinafter also referred to as \u201chost\u201d) via a network . A user  may or may not be a subscriber . Via an interface, the host  receives and responds to messages, hereinafter also known as \u201crequests,\u201d from users  and subscribers . Request types and how the system  processes them are determined by the request's parameters, as described below.","A subscriber  interacts with a host  via an interface. The interface may be a website, an application programming interface (API), a program, or any other means by which a subscriber  may transmit data to and from the host over the network .","The system  allows subscribers  to add items to the system  for storage, and allows users  to interact with the system , for example to search the system for items of interest. A subscriber  may be a product vendor, service provider or anyone offering an item. As understood herein, an item may be a product, service, website, information source or anything else a supplier may provide.","The system  allows subscribers to define categories and parameters describing the item being listed. Optionally, supplier functions can be specified as well, indicating a relationship of the supplier to the item being listed. One advantage of allowing individual subscribers to define categories and associated parameters is the spreading of the effort of creating a large collection of categories and parameters for structuring the items stored in the system . Another advantage of having individual subscribers define and\/or extend categories and associated parameters is that it eliminates or substantially reduces the need for a developer or designer to a priori generate a large number of different categories, as well as a large number of parameters for further describing the different categories, in order to structure or organize the items stored in the system .","For example, for a request type indicating a category \u201cAutomobile\u201d and a supplier function \u201cSeller,\u201d the request parameters may be \u201cMake,\u201d \u201cModel,\u201d \u201cYear,\u201d \u201cColor,\u201d and a response parameter may be \u201cPrice\u201d. However, for a category of \u201cAutomobile,\u201d and supplier function \u201cRental Service,\u201d the request parameters may be \u201cFrom date,\u201d \u201cTo date,\u201d \u201cVehicle Class,\u201d and response parameters may include \u201cAvailability\u201d and \u201cRate.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["201","120","120","202","120","206","120"],"i":"a "},"At step  or , after specifying a category, the subscriber specifies a supplier function. A supplier function indicates a relationship between the item and the subscriber. Some examples of supplier functions for the category \u201cAutomobile\u201d are \u201cSeller,\u201d \u201cPainter\u201d and \u201cTowing Service.\u201d","In one embodiment, the specified supplier function is preexisting. The interface may comprise a pull down menu, a field, a list or another method of specifying the preexisting supplier functions from which the subscriber may choose. In another embodiment the subscriber generates a new supplier function for the item to be listed under. The interface may provide a textbox or other methods of receiving a new supplier function from the subscriber.","At step , a new request type is created for the combination of the specified category and supplier function. At step , the request type is saved for subsequent reference.","After creating the request type, the supplier  specifies one or more parameters for the request type. Parameters are the attributes of the item being offered by the supplier, and are used to distinguish different items stored under the same request type. Parameters are defined by parameter metadata. A parameter metadata indicates one or more of a name, a display name, a data type, an owner type, a description for the parameter, or any other attribute.","In one embodiment, parameters are associated with specific request types and are not shared between different request types. For example, items under a request type given by a category \u201cShirts\u201d and a supplier function \u201cSeller\u201d, and items under a request type given by a category \u201cShoes\u201d and a supplier function \u201cSeller,\u201d may both have a parameter named \u201cSize,\u201d but the parameters have their own sets of metadata. For example, for \u201cShirts\u201d the \u201cSize\u201d parameter may be of data type \u201ctext\u201d and take the possible values of \u201cSmall,\u201d \u201cMedium\u201d and \u201cLarge.\u201d On the other hand, for the category \u201cShoes,\u201d the \u201cSize\u201d parameter may be of a data type \u201cNumber\u201d or \u201cInteger\u201d and take on possible values of 5, 5.5, 6, etc. Thus, while the two \u201cSize\u201d parameters may share a common name, the parameters are not shared between the request types and comprise different metadata.","A data type indicates the type of data that can be used for a given parameter. A data type can represent a single piece of data, such as a string, a number, a true or false value, or a collection of data values, such as an address with street, city, state, and postal code data.","Optionally, a data type may comprise a collection of data that can be extended or modified. For example, a list data type may comprise a list of text for available colors for an item. Suppliers can add to such lists so that other suppliers or users can subsequently choose from them. A data type may also support a range. For example, a number data type may indicate an exact value, a minimum value, and\/or a maximum value. Similarly, a data type for date or time may indicate an exact value, or it may indicate a range of values given by a \u201cFrom\u201d value and a \u201cTo\u201d value.","In an embodiment wherein the subscriber  specifies a preexisting request type, the system  presents a list of parameters associated with the request type (when such parameters are already associated). Optionally, at step  the supplier  may add one or more new parameters which will then be associated with this request type at step .","In another embodiment where the request type are not preexisting and are newly defined by a supplier , the supplier  defines a new set of one or more parameters to be associated with the request type.","A supplier  may subscribe to a request type by associating a link, hereinafter also referred to as a \u201csupplier request link\u201d, with the request type. The supplier request link indicates where and how the supplier  wants requests for the request type to be sent to the supplier , as described in more detail below. This link may comprise a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), an email address, an address for receiving an API call, or other similar resource. The method of sending the request depends on the type of the supplier request link, as should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. The system may then use the supplier request link to communicate with the supplier for the request type.","Optionally, a supplier request link indicates that some default information is stored on the system for a subscribed request type, thereby eliminating the need for a separate communication with the supplier . An example of such default information is a web link to the supplier's  web site, or the supplier's  contact information.","Another way a supplier  may subscribe to a request type is by adding one or more items for the request type to the system . -show a series of screenshots illustrating an example process of listing an item on system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIGS. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["a","b","c ","d ","e "],"b":["3","120","120","120","120"]},"Starting with , the supplier  defines data for a particular listing. First, the supplier  may provide a supplier request link for requests to be sent to, as described above. shows the supplier providing values for one or more of the parameters associated with the request type given by the category and supplier function. In this particular example, the supplier has specified an item of category \u201cAutomobile,\u201d namely a blue Mercedes. Optionally the supplier may also provide a link (indicated in the \u201cweb link\u201d text box at the top of ), as well as other support information such as part numbers, quantities, etc.","Similarly, if the supplier  is a dealership wishing to list an item indicating an \u201cOil Change\u201d service on the system , the item may be listed under the category \u201cAutomobile,\u201d but with supplier function \u201cOil Change Service\u201d and with such parameters as \u201cInspection Points,\u201d \u201cPrice,\u201d \u201cLocation,\u201d \u201cOpening Times,\u201d etc.","In an optional embodiment, system  does not require the use of supplier functions. For example, a category name may implicitly indicate a supplier function. Examples of such categories include \u201cAircraft seller,\u201d \u201cAutomobile Repair,\u201d \u201cDog Groomer\u201d and \u201cBarber Shop.\u201d In such a case, the request type is the category without a supplier function.","The system  allows users to search the items added by subscribers . Upon a search request from a user , the system  responds with one or more results from suppliers  that match the criteria set by the user's  search.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 4","i":"a ","b":["401","100","110","402","100","403","100","405","100","406","100","407","412","410","100","120","110","120","100","412","120","100","120","100","411","100","100","100"]},"In addition to providing supplier information as described in , the system  also retrieves items stored in the system  which match the user's  search criteria. is a flow chart illustrating a method for generating such a search response based on data stored in the system . At steps  and , the system  receives a set of parameters associated with a search request from a user  and retrieves a set of one or more items for the request type of the search request. Steps - iterate over the retrieved items, checking whether the item parameters satisfy the request's parameter values. For example, a request parameter with name \u201cLength\u201d and value \u201c20\u201d matches an inventory item with exactly the same parameter name and value, whereas a parameter value comprising a range matches an inventory item with a parameter value within that range. If the inventory parameters satisfy the request parameters, then step  creates a response to the user's search request. The system  then presents the response to the user, or saves the response for later presentation to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIGS. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"i":["a","e ","a ","b ","c","c","d ","e "],"b":["5","100","110","110","110","110","110","110","100","110","110","110","120"]},"Suppliers  can send zero, one, or more than one response for a request. In one embodiment, the response comprises a web link to the supplier site that provides more information or provides an opportunity for the user to engage with the supplier for a purchase, for requesting more information, to sign up for a service, or to otherwise communicate with the supplier  about the results.","Optionally, a supplier  may partially meet the search criteria but still be allowed to send a response for the request. Suppliers  may use any of the request parameters in the response to determine whether they have items of relevance for the searcher. If a supplier does not have a relevant item, the supplier may still respond with items or information of potential interest and the system  may sort the responses by relevance for displaying to the searcher. Optionally, users are given an opportunity to indicate their preferences relating to result relevance and sorting.","For example, a user may submit a search with a value of \u201cRed\u201d assigned to a \u201cColor\u201d parameter. A supplier  with a matching result may return the result comprising \u201cRed\u201d as the \u201cColor\u201d. Additionally, a supplier  with a result that matches the other parameters except with \u201cWhite\u201d assigned to the \u201cColor\u201d may still return that result, and the system  may assign a lower rank to the result in the sorting order for presentation to the user .","Optionally, a supplier  can control access to items which the supplier  has listed in the system . Thus, the supplier  can use the system  as a personal database, or allow access to specific users  or groups of users  (or the public), as specified by the supplier . Optionally, the system  may restrict particular searches to the items of a particular supplier . One particular use for this is to allow users visiting a supplier's  website to search that supplier's  items. The user  would be redirected to the system  where the user  will be restricted to the items for that particular supplier .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["601","110"]},"At step , the metadata for the parameters associated with the request type are determined.

A request type may be associated with more than one link, depending on the number of suppliers  that have subscribed for that particular request type. An example of this is the case where a supplier  uses one link, such as a web address, for more than one request type.","A link type table  defines the types of the links, such as email address, web addresses, API call addresses, links for default information, etc. A parameter metadata table  associates parameters, stored in table , with corresponding request types.","A parameter metadata comprises one or more data types stored in table  and one or more owner types stored in table . Parameters stored in table  may be of data type \u201cText\u201d (stored in table parameter_text ), data type \u201cDate\u201d (stored in table parameter_date ), data type \u201cNumber\u201d (stored in table parameter_number ), or of other data types. Optionally, parameters may be collectively stored in table  regardless of data type, with the parameter data stored in string format or in another universal format. Depending on the owner type , a parameter belongs to a request  or to a response  or item . Other owner types are possible and the system  is extensible to allow such extensions. Optionally, separate tables can be used for request, response and item parameters.","A user table  stored entities that are allowed to send and receive messages to and from the system. A user may be an entity using the system  to search for items of interest, and may or may not be one of the entities that have subscribed to particular request types.

As described above, a response may comprise a link that the user may use to get more information. An optional response view tracker in  may keep track of when and\/or how often a user clicks on such a link.","Optionally, responses may be presented to the user  in the order or priority decided by the user . In one embodiment, a temporary table in the database is created, using parameter names and metadata (obtained from the request type's response parameter metadata) for column definitions. For example, for metadata that has the name \u201cPrice\u201d and data type \u201cNumber,\u201d a columns with the name \u201cPrice\u201d and data type \u201cNumber\u201d is created in the table.","In an alternate embodiment for data types that comprise collections of data, such as an address, an indirect data type such as \u201cDistance\u201d can be used as the response's data type. Alternatively, one of the data types and its name may be used as the collective data type for the column. For example, a zip code and\/or city name data type may be used for a column.","The system  can present results in sorted order, based on database columns or parameter metadata. Responses may be generated in a desired ordering using a Structured Query Language (SQL) query with an \u201corder-by\u201d clause. This method can be used to order the responses for a plurality of metadata or columns, or to further filter the responses.","Optionally, categories may comprise a hierarchical structure, allowing suppliers  to create categories within categories and supplier functions.","Optionally, users may constrain search results to certain geographical regions such as nearby cities, states, countries, or regions, depending on user preference and search criteria.","In an optional embodiment, the system  provides suppliers  with visibility into searches that comprise parameters similar or related to items offered by the suppliers .

A marketer may generate one or more relevant ads to a user at the time of the search request. The system  may generate or provide the ad itself, or coordinate with a third party who generates or provides the ad. The third party may be implemented by an automated ad generation engine, such as a \u201cSponsored Search\u201d ad generation service (such as Google\u2122 AdWords\u2122) or a \u201cContextual Advertisement\u201d ad generation service (such as Google\u2122 AdSense\u2122). The ad engine or the third party may generate an ad based on the request and its parameters, and send the ad to the system  for displaying to the searcher.","Optionally, some or all suppliers  have their data or services hosted by the system . In such an embodiment, the messages are generated by the system .","Optionally, requests and their responses may be saved in user accounts. Optionally, information about when a web link in a response is clicked is saved for billing purposes. The system may also help in avoiding or reducing click fraud.","Optionally, the system  may verify the quality and\/or identity of the suppliers  using the system  using one or more options. One example comprises verifying that phone numbers and addresses are not reused when a supplier's  account is suspended. This can be done by having the supplier  send a text message or voice mail message to the phone number provided by the user. In another embodiment, credit card numbers are verified. Alternatively, security certificates may be used by one or more of the suppliers .
