Technical Field","The present invention generally relates to wireless mobile apparatus and methods and, specifically, to wireless mobile multiprocessor apparatus and methods.","2. Background","Telecommunications services are evolving toward sharing richer and more realistic still and motion images, sound, and data across great distances, and doing so within the context of mobile services. Increasingly, personal financial transactions, commercial buying and trading transactions, health information, and other private messages may be exchanged using a mobile device, with attendant expectations of security. These and other applications and services may employ advanced compression, encryption, and signal modulation techniques. A vast range of consumer applications may be deployed with mobile devices, including sophisticated interactive services, familiar desktop applications, and operating system environments, indicating a need for both computing flexibility and power. Mobile devices that furnish superior and secure speech, audio, video, and data services, including real-time or isochronous communications, often employ compute-intensive, high-bandwidth, digital techniques. Additionally, a consumer may desire to use the same mobile device to receive these high-quality services from multiple service providers within a region or, while traveling through multiple regions, to receive services from different regional providers, who use different communication protocols. A mobile device capable of delivering an array of high-quality digital services, using different providers and protocols, commonly includes substantial computing power. Further, mobile device manufacturers and vendors may prefer a versatile, low cost, energy-efficient, and readily-manufacturable wireless platform as a basis for one or more products. Such a platform may be augmented by adding IP library-based components early in the manufacturing process, or by attaching inexpensive commodity components at the point-of-sale by a vendor\u2014or even as an simple upgrade by a consumer\u2014giving rise to a diversity of very compact, portable wireless mobile devices.","Therefore, there is a need for a mobile device which offers manufacturers and vendors a versatile, high-performance, compact wireless platform; and which also may offer consumers a compact, flexible, and feature-filled mobile device capable of relatively inexpensive and simple upgrades.","A wireless mobile communication device includes a memory, which includes a unified memory; processing units; and a fault inhibitor. The processing units and a fault inhibitor are coupled with the unified memory portion. One processing unit communicates the message with another processing unit through the unified memory portion. The fault inhibitor is configured to inhibit an operational fault state corresponding to a nocent informon in the unified memory portion. The memory, processing units, and fault inhibitor are fabricated on a monolithic integrated circuit chip. The wireless mobile communication device, being coupled with a memory device, and being capable of having a unified memory portion when the memory device is connected with the wireless mobile communication device.","The wireless mobile communication device may further include an operational control unit configured to coordinate communication between the processing units communicating through the unified memory portion. The operational control unit is coupled with the unified memory, the processing units, and the fault inhibitor. The operational control unit also may manage memory resources selected as the unified memory portion. The operational control unit also can include a memory manager coupled with the memory and the fault inhibitor, and may be configured to cooperate with the fault inhibitor to inhibit the operational fault corresponding to the nocent informon. The first processing unit of the device may be adapted to perform first processor applications operations and the second processing unit may be adapted to perform second processor operations. The operational control unit can provide one or both of a process control signal and a memory control signal to coordinate exchange of messages between the first processing unit and the second processing unit. The wireless mobile communication device may include a functional constituent, which is coupled with and is configured to augment, one or both of the applications operations of the first processing unit and the communications operations of the second processing unit. This functional constituent can be an interprocessor communications manager, a graphics accelerator, or a digital signal processor.","The wireless mobile communication device also includes an application bus coupled with the first processing unit, and adapted to facilitate applications operations; a communications bus coupled with the second processing unit and adapted to facilitate communications operations; and a bus master unit coupled between the application bus and the communications bus. The bus master unit communicates one or both of control signals and messages between the applications bus and the communications bus. The device also can include a transceiver coupled with the communication bus and using a wireless communication technique to exchange the message with the remote host. The wireless mobile communication device may include a direct interface coupled with one or both of the applications bus and the communications bus, by which the wireless mobile communication device may be coupled with an information signal source.","The invention also provides a wireless mobile communication multiprocessor module adapted to exchange a message using wireless communication. The multiprocessor module includes an application bus and a communication bus; an applications processing unit coupled with the application bus; a communications processing unit coupled with the communication bus; memory having a unified memory portion and coupled with the application bus and the communication bus; a fault inhibitor coupled between the unified memory and one of the communication bus and the application bus; and an operational control unit coupled with the applications processing bus, the communications processing bus, the memory, and the fault inhibitor.","The operational control unit controls one or more of coordinating communication between the application bus and the communications bus; managing unified memory for at least one of the applications processing unit and the communications processing unit; and cooperating with the fault inhibitor provide a selected response to the presence of a nocent informon. The applications bus, the communications bus, the applications processing unit, the communications processing unit, the communication bus, the fault inhibitor, and the operational control unit are fabricated together as wireless mobile communication multiprocessor module monolithic integrated circuit.","The multiprocessor module can include a functional constituent responsive to the operational control unit and operably coupled with one of the application bus and the communications bus. This functional constituent can facilitate one or both of the applications processing unit's applications operations and the communications processing unit's communications operations. The operational control unit can include a memory manager cooperating with the fault inhibitor to provide the selected response to the presence of a nocent informon. The selected response includes inhibiting an operational fault corresponding to the nocent informon; operating the wireless mobile communication multiprocessor module in a predetermined operational state; or operating the wireless mobile communication multiprocessor module in a predetermined fallback state. The operational control unit also can include a bridge coupled between the application bus and the communication bus, and configured to selectively transmit a signal from one of the application bus and the communication bus to the other.","Embodiments of the invention also can provide a wireless mobile communication system, in which a local host exchanges a message with a remote host using wireless communication. The application system includes an applications bus coupled with the local host; and an applications processing unit coupled with the applications bus and executing applications operations. The system also includes a transceiver exchanging the message with the remote host using a wireless communication mode; a communications bus coupled with the transceiver; and a communications processing unit coupled with the communications bus and executing communications operations. In the system, a memory is coupled with the applications bus and the communications bus; and a portion of the memory is unified memory. The applications processing unit and the communications processing unit exchange the message using the unified memory. A fault inhibitor is employed to inhibit an operational fault state corresponding to a nocent informon, and is coupled with the memory, the applications processing unit, and the communications processing unit. The fault inhibitor can be coupled between the unified memory and one or both of the communications bus and the applications bus.","A memory controller controlling a memory location in the memory can be coupled with the memory, the fault inhibitor, and the applications and communications processing units. An interprocessor controller can be coupled between the applications bus and the communications bus, with the controller transferring a control signal between the applications processing unit and the communications processing unit, which facilitates the message exchange in unified memory. The applications processing unit, the communications processing unit, the applications bus, the communications bus, the interprocessor controller, the memory, the memory controller, and the fault inhibitor may be fabricated together as a monolithic integrated circuit.","The interprocessor controller of the wireless mobile communication system includes a bus management unit coupled between the applications bus and the communications bus, and coordinating communications therebetween; and a bridge coupled with the bus management unit, the applications bus, and the communications bus, the bridge configured to selectively transmit a signal from one of the applications and communications buses to the other, as a sender and a receiver, responsive to the bus management unit. In addition, the wireless mobile communication system includes an applications bus arbiter, coupled with the applications bus and the bus management unit; and a communications bus arbiter coupled with the communications bus and the bus management unit. The applications bus arbiter coordinates, with the bus management unit, a selective transmission of an applications bus signal between the sender and the receiver; and the communications bus arbiter coordinates, with the bus management unit, a selective transmission of a communications bus signal between the sender and the receiver. The wireless mobile communication system can include the transceiver being a functional constituent fabricated on the monolithic integrated circuit. The wireless communication mode can be selectable. The transceiver may include plural reconfigurable functional constituents controllable by the local host wherein the wireless communications mode is selectable thereby.","An embodiment of the invention also provides a method for communicating a message in a wireless mobile communication device configured to exchange the message as a local host with a remote host, where the device includes at least two processing units operating in association with informons, and a memory coupled with the processing units and through which the processing units communicate the message. The method includes identifying an informon to be examined; and determining whether the informon is a legitimate informon or a nocent informon. If the informon is the nocent informon then inhibiting storage of the nocent informon; inhibiting access to the nocent informon; or inhibiting execution of the nocent informon. If the informon is the nocent informon, the method also may include then providing a perceptible indication of nocent informon presence. Moreover, if the informon is the nocent informon, the method may inhibit an operational fault corresponding to the nocent informon. In the presence of a nocent informon, the method may include setting the wireless mobile communication device in a predetermined operational state, as well as setting the wireless mobile communication device in a predetermined fallback state. If the informon present is the nocent informon, then providing a perceptible indication of nocent informon presence.","It is advantageous to provide a mobile wireless device which offers manufacturers and vendors a versatile, energy-efficient, compact wireless platform, and which also may offer consumers a compact, flexible, and feature-filled mobile device capable of relatively inexpensive and simply implemented upgrades. Such a platform typically may be a highly-integrated combination of high-performance computing and communications systems. The present apparatus and methods are directed to a wireless mobile platform manufactured as a single and monolithic semiconductor chip, sometimes referred to as a \u201csystem on a chip.\u201d Modern monolithic semiconductor chips may be based on one or more selected core devices, which may be augmented prior to fabrication, by including one or more selected components. A core computing device, herein a \u201cprocessing unit,\u201d can be a general-purpose processor, a controller, a specialty real-time processor, a coprocessor, an accelerator, a special-purpose engine, a mixed-signal transceiver, a gate array device, state machine, or logic assembly. A general processing unit, such as an applications processing unit, generally can efficiently perform a variety of applications and support tasks, hence its name. General processing units frequently employ large, complex instruction sets to execute multitasking and multithreading operations, possibly while handling many concurrent application threads and support task interrupts. A special purpose processing unit, such as a communications processing unit, may be adapted for observing stringent time constraints and performing repetitive, computationally-oriented operations, in real time or in time-sensitive tasks. However, general processing units may benefit from augmentations and extensions, which may improve unit efficiency, for example, with time-sensitive tasks. Likewise, communications processing units may benefit from augmentations and extensions, which may improve unit efficiency, for example, with handling many interrupts or concurrent task threads during operations. Processing units can be construed by one skilled in the art to include plural cooperative processing units, including without limitation, a group, cluster, or array of processing units.","It may be desirable to augment and to extend the range and the nature of efficiently-executed functions offered by a particular type of processing unit core, by incorporating \u201cfunctional constituents.\u201d Such functional constituents may include, without limitation, general purpose processing functional constituents, such as operating system kernels, multithread process schedulers, memory controllers, interrupt controllers, energy and power controllers, hardware and software wrappers, logic blocks, memory arrays and registers; image and video functional constituents, such as JPEG and MPEG codecs, transform\/translate engines, and 2D\/3D image processors; security functional constituents, including biometric analysis and authentication processors, and encryption\/decryption engines and hash functions; speech and audio functional constituents, including companders, PCM-type codecs, and MP3 encoders; general digital signal processing functional constituents, including sensors, transcoders, synchronizers, multipliers, filters and transform processors; as well as administrative, operational, and special-purpose functional constituents including, application-specific instruction set extensions and operations, including multimedia extensions; high-performance networking, geolocation, and input\/output engines; application-specific blocks, components, and arrays; multiply-and-accumulate and other computational blocks; mixed signal interfaces, and the like. A functional constituent may be made an integral aspect of a processing unit or may be a separate coprocessor, accelerator, or core. A functional constituent may be a defined component providing a defined function, or derive its functionality from multiple functional constituents combined to perform a selected function or group of functions. Functional constituents may cooperate with a processing unit without being physically incorporated therein. It is contemplated, however, that processing units and functional components of the wireless mobile system herein be fabricated as a monolithic semiconductor chip.","An exemplary general or applications processing unit may be augmented by adding specialized computation, graphics, signal\/image processing, transform, encryption, signal mapping, and modem communication functional constituents. Likewise, an exemplary special purpose, or communications, processing unit may be augmented with text and data processing, interrupt controllers, multitasking and multithreaded operation controls and pipelines, operating system kernel subunits, data compression\/decompression units, and multimedia application functional constituents. Core devices and functional constituents may readily be found in appropriate intellectual property (IP) component libraries, and are well-known in the art. Thus, a base core platform according to the present apparatus and methods, may provide a consumer with a compact, easy-to-use, and relatively inexpensive mobile station, which may be capable of running popular, often sophisticated, application programs, within the context of a familiar operating system environment. Also the present apparatus and methods can offer a rich multimedia feature set, including, for example, high-quality streaming video and audio. Furthermore, the present apparatus and methods may offer consumers a mobile station, which may be upgraded readily, and which may be operable in different coverage areas using different communication formats. At the same time, the present apparatus and methods may offer manufacturers and vendors a powerful, modular, economic, and manufacturable mobile device, readily configurable to meet a wide range of applications, communication channels, communication modes, and communication services. As used herein, a communication channel is a band of one or more frequencies used to create a signal path between two communicating points. A communication channel may be characterized by operating frequencies at which signals traverse the path, and the format by which signals are transmitted. A communication mode, or mode, generally refers to a characteristic set of one or more features, content, synchronization, or functional capabilities, corresponding to a service. A mode may be categorized by one or more of the following: the physical nature of electromagnetic signal; the signal modulation technique; and the signal propagation method, which may be employed for message exchange between a mobile wireless device user and a wireless service provider. Also, a communication mode may refer to one or more protocols used to exchange a message, and may include multiple, hierarchical protocol layers. A communication service includes the delivery of messages, i.e., digital content or information, using a selected communication channel and mode.","Turning to , a simplified functional block diagram of communications system  is illustrated, in which mobile station (MS)  exchanges messages with remote host (REMHOST)  over communications network (NETWORK) . NETWORK  can be representative of a connected aggregate of communications networks, links, feeders, and subnets, with at least a portion of NETWORK  including, for example, a public, packet-switched network such as the Internet. REMHOST  may represent any type of remote communication endpoint with which MS  may be able to communicate. A portion of NETWORK  may include one or more mobile service provider (MSP)  facilities, managed by a service operator (not shown). MSP  may couple one or more base stations (BS)  to NETWORK  using mobile switching center (MSC) .","In general, MS  and BS  exchange messages using one or more predetermined communication protocols. A message can be described as one or more logical data units formed from physical signals transmitted by one or both of MS  and BS . Desirably, message exchange may be bidirectional, full-duplex, or both. These protocols may correspond to physical and logical conventions and access methods used to initiate and maintain a mode of communication between MS  and BS . As used herein, MS  may incorporate mobile modem (MM)  within a local mobile terminal, such as mobile personal host terminal (MPH) , to create a convenient, compact, portable configuration, which easily may fit in a pocket or a purse, or be wearable. Familiar examples of mobile stations, so configured, include a portable telephone handset, a wireless pocket computing device, and a personal digital assistant. Desirably, MPH  provides an interface for message exchange between MM  and a user of MS . MPH  may be adapted to permit a user of MS  to be, for example, a human, or a machine to which a human has delegated a suitable task. MM  can provide substantial data manipulation and signal processing services, such as a message exchange interface, having a data path between MPH  and BS , and facilitating communication between MS  and MSP . Where REMHOST  is coupled to MSP  by way of NETWORK , MPH  and MM  cooperate to facilitate message exchange between MS  and REMHOST , using a selected communication mode.","MS  can be configured as a personal, compact, wireless electronic device, which offers a user convenient access to available digital services, and to a host of applications. MS  may be configured to deliver basic services including, for example, paging, telephony, and personal digital assistant features. MS  may be configurable to deliver selected enhanced services as well, for example, by the manufacturer, by a vendor at the point of sale, or by the user. Non-limiting exemplary enhanced services may include touch-screen functionality, handwriting recognition, Internet access, speech recognition and synthesis, context awareness, streaming audiovisual capture and display, sophisticated transaction and security functions, networking services, instant messaging, interactive distributed gaming, geographical information systems (GIS) related services, text and data transfer, symbolic exchanges, and electronic and voice mail. The aforementioned services and related applications may include security functions, or these functions may be afforded, for example, by the operating system. Beneficially, MM  also may be configured to sense, and to adapt to, more than one communication mode, including more than one signal modulation technique, allowing a user to roam disparate and remote coverage areas, while using the same MS . An adaptive, reconfigurable MS  may be advantageous to a manufacturer, or vendor, seeking a platform by which to offer additional wireless product options to consumers.","MSP , and associated BS(s) , can be positioned and operate within a geographic region, called a coverage area. A coverage area typically is managed by an SO, who may provide wireless communication services within the coverage area, including, without limitation, one or more basic or enhanced services, using one or more telecommunication frequency bands. Additionally, a SO may cooperate with third party providers to augment services available to subscribers within one or more coverage areas. Thus, with MS  configured as a multimodal, multiband wireless handset, a subscriber\/user may receive multiple wireless communication services, in which messages are exchanged within one or more coverage areas, using a selected mode encompassing one or more communication frequency bands, signal propagation methods, communication protocols, message content, and the like.","Consumers increasingly demand affordable, versatile, feature-filled, energy-efficient, and compact mobile stations. Beneficially, MS  can be configured to perform sophisticated user applications, for example, communicating a high-quality real-time video stream. Applications of this nature can be computationally intensive from both application and communication standpoints. In addition to the computing demands arising from applications and communications, sophisticated system services, such as secure, multimodal, and adaptable message exchange, also may impose significant computing demands upon MM . On one hand, the variety of processing activities presented by a likely range of consumer application and communication programs tends to favor the use of a general purpose processing unit having a large, versatile instruction set, and possibly supporting parallelism, within MM . On the other hand, it may be beneficial for communication programs and system service operations to have a smaller set of instructions rapidly and repetitively executed on multiple data, while observing stringent time constraints. Therefore such communication programs and system services tend to invite the use of a special purpose processing unit, such as a digital signal processor (DSP). A single processing unit may be augmented to satisfy multithreaded, multitasking operation and interrupt support as well as compute-intensive application program, communication, and real-time operations. Nevertheless, a single processing unit capable of such general application and real-time diversity can occupy a relatively large device footprint and consume substantial power, despite attempts to power-down inactive circuits.","Thus, it is desirable to implement within MM , a multiprocessor module integrating at least two processing units, in which a first processing unit (GPU)  generally is adapted to perform application operations, possibly including interrupt-driven, multitasking and multithreading operations, and a second processing unit (RPU)  generally is adapted to perform communication operations, which may encompass signal-processing-intensive, time-constrained, time-sensitive, and real-time operations. First and second processing units, respectively GPU  and RPU , may be cooperatively coupled, and may share processing tasks, such that overall multiprocessor module throughput is increased. In instances where two or more processing units, such as GPU  and RPU , cooperate to provide a desired level of functionality and performance in MM , the architectural feature by which the processing units communicate may influence system efficiency, power consumption, upgradability, and the like.","MM  is beneficially configured to include an integrated multiprocessor module chip, having two or more processing units GPU  and RPU  communicating, using unified memory (UMM) . In general, UMM  may be a portion of memory available to one processing unit, e.g., GPU , which also may be available to another processing unit, e.g., RPU . Such access may be substantially synchronous access, substantially asynchronous access, substantially isochronous access, or a combination thereof. UMM  also may be configured to permit access to one or more functional constituents (not shown), which may be coupled with UMM . The memory devices used to form the unified memory space in UMM  may be commodity single-port memory devices, including for example, synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM), double data rate, synchronous DRAM (DDR SDRAM or, simply, DDR), Rambus\u00ae DRAM (RDRAM\u00ae memory), and so on, but may include other types of inexpensive, readily-obtainable memory devices. (Rambus and RDRAM are registered trademarks of Rambus Inc., Los Altos, Calif., USA).","MM  may be self-contained, in that MS  may provide desired functionality without using an additional memory device. However, MM  may also be configured such that the memory space represented by ADDMEM  can be augmented by coupling MM  with ADDMEM . Through augmentation, MM  may be configured, adapted, or programmed to provide additional functionality, such that MS  may be offered for use or sale as an enhanced-feature wireless mobile handset, or may be upgraded by the owner\/user of MS  to deliver enhanced services.","Communication devices, e.g., MS , which connect to public networks such as the Internet, may be exposed to noxious entities herein termed nocent informons. As used herein, an informon can be any logical entity including a message, datum, code, instruction, or signal, alone or in combination, which may be amenable to transmission, loading (read), storage (write), execution, processing, and the like, for example, in a processing unit, e.g., GPU , RPU , or in a functional constituent, such as memory, ADDMEM . Also as used herein, a nocent informon is an informon which may correspond to an operational fault state in all or any part of MM , MS , or communication system . A nocent informon may encompass any informon, which may degrade system confidentiality, integrity, or availability, as well as user authentication, authorization, or nonrepudiation. Degradation may be an intentional or unintentional effect of a nocent informon. Intentional degradation may result from a nocent informon being delivered to MS  in the form of a malicious code entity, such as a virus, a worm, a Trojan horse, a logic bomb, and the like. Unintentional degradation may result, for example, from an informon which, when read, written, or executed by a processing unit or functional constituent, degrades the operation of such processing unit or functional constituent. Unintentional degradation might result, for example, when an otherwise legitimate informon intended for execution by one processing unit is, in fact, executed by a second processing unit, leading to an operational fault. In the context of the second processing unit, the informon corresponding to the operational fault is a nocent informon.","In general, an operational fault state may describe any such deleterious or noxious effect, including, without limitation, informon corruption, destruction, diversion, misappropriation, or subversion; the induction or facilitation of intrusion, failure, degradation, or impairment of any component, functional constituent, processing unit, application, subroutine, process, device, or system. Thus, nocent informons may correspond to operational faults within MS  and, where expedient, fault inhibitor (FI)  can be integrated into MM  to inhibiting a nocent informon from causing or corresponding to an operational fault. It may be beneficial to couple FI  with selected unified memory ADDMEM  portions in MM , so that a nocent informon may be inhibited from corresponding to an operational fault state. FI  can be hardware, software, or an operable combination thereof, and may effectively be interposed between a processing unit e.g., GPU  or RPU , or functional constituent, and a portion of memory, e.g., ADDMEM , intended to interact with the processing unit or functional constituent. Processing units, such as GPU , RPU  may operate cooperatively, for example directed by a master processor such as RPU .","In , a functional block diagram illustrating communication system  is depicted. Similar to the manner shown in communication system  of , MS  can exchange messages over NETWORK  with REMHOST , by communicating signals with MSP . MS  may include MPH , capable of exchanging messages between MM  and a user of MPH ; and MM , capable of exchanging messages between MPH  and MSP  via BS . Similar to MSP  in , MSP  may couple one or more BS  to NETWORK  using MSC ; however, other configurations are possible. In an exemplary implementation of MS , MM  can include a first processing unit (GPU)  adapted for general applications, unified memory module (UMM) , and a second processing unit (RPU) , adapted for computationally applications including, for example, real-time, isochronous, and synchronous signal processing, signal transceiving, and tasks of a single instruction-multiple data type, and so on. Each of GPU  and RPU  may be representative of a processing unit possessing one or more processing subunits, coprocessors, or processor cores therein.","To augment the respective ranges of tasks efficiently performed, one or more of GPU , RPU  may be augmented with functional constituents providing enhanced processing capabilities. Such enhanced processing capabilities, may permit GPU , RPU , or both, to efficiently perform processing tasks typically performed by another type of processing unit, allowing for parallelism or complimentary task processing. GPU , RPU  may be coupled with, and may communicate using, UMM . UMM  data bus can be coupled with GPU , using GPU-to-UMM bus (G-U bus) ; and with RPU , using RPU-to-UMM data bus (R-U bus) . Operational control unit (OCU)  can include memory management and protection unit (MMPU)  and interprocessor communication manager (IPC) . MMPU  may be coupled with GPU , using GPU-to-MMPU bus (G-M bus) ; and with RPU , using RPU-to-MMPU (R-M bus) . IPC  may be coupled with GPU , using GPU signal bus (GBUS) ; and with RPU , using RPU signal bus (RBUS) . Also, MMPU  may be coupled with UMM , using memory control bus (MCB) . Some implementations of MM  may couple MMPU  and IPC , where such resource management and control communication is desirable. Communications may proceed bidirectionally on one or more of G-U BUS , R-U BUS , GBUS , G-M BUS , RBUS application-specific instruction set extensions and operations, including multimedia extensions, and R-M BUS . It also may be desirable that communication on MCB  be bidirectional.","MMPU  may implement memory management and allocation policies for UMM  to coordinate memory intercommunication between GPU  and RPU . MMPU  also may manage memory resources for predetermined functional constituents. In MM , the range of memory locations constituting UMM  may be represented by a unified memory map, in which memory locations may be accessible to the processing units and to predetermined functional constituents in MM , including GPU  and RPU . MMPU  may be configured to merge memory locations of ADDMEM  into the existing unified memory map, thereby facilitating MS  reconfiguration, feature expansion, feature upgrading, and so on. ADDMEM  can be inexpensive commodity memory devices having operational characteristics substantially compatible with those of UMM . Exemplary memory devices can include SDRAM, DDR, RDRAM\u00ae memory, and so on.","MMPU  also may be configured to provide a fault inhibition mechanism, by which a nocent informon may be identified and inhibited from at least one of storage, access, or execution by a processing unit or functional constituent, reducing the likelihood that such nocent informon may lead to an operational fault in MM . An exemplary technique to inhibit nocent informon access, execution, or both, can include identifying a nocent informon prior to storage in a memory location for a processing unit, or functional constituent, which may be affected deleteriously by the informon; and preventing the nocent informon from being stored in that memory location. In addition, it also may be desirable to provide a perceptible indication of nocent informon presence, for example, on a display which may be present on MPH . Also, it may be desirable to retain selected nocent information for analysis, tracking, and the like. Further, it may be advantageous for MMPU  to effect a predetermined fallback state in MS  responsive to a preselected nocent informon. Thus, it may be possible for MMPU  to partially inhibit a device fault in MM , allowing MS  to function, despite a deleterious response to a nocent informon.","IPC  may provide supervisory and support services such as task scheduling and priority setting, interrupt control and coordination, and resource allocation, thus facilitating multitasked, multithreaded operations executed by GPU . IPC also may include supervisory and support services for time-sensitive tasks executed by RPU , such as real-time, synchronous, and isochronous operations, as well as control and coordination of shared or cooperative tasks involving GPU , RPU , and functional constituents. IPC  can provide or supervise energy and power management functions, and selected reconfigurations of processing units and functional constituents where such processing units and functional constituents in MM  are configured to do so. IPC  may encompass operating system and application programming interface (API) kernels, microcode, and extensions, interpreters, and virtual machine functions, including those of a cross-platform nature, which may endow MS  with the ability to execute popular applications such as those found in desktop computers, entertainment devices and systems, information management, geospatial information services (GIS), context awareness, and the like. IPC  also may include one or more direct interfaces for input\/output connections and devices, including, without limitation, a wired link such as a USB\u2122 On-The-Go\u2122 link, or an IEEE Std. 1394 link; wireless links, such as an IEEE Std. 802.11 wireless LAN link, an IEEE 802.15 wireless personal area network (PAN) link, a BLUETOOTH\u00ae PAN link, and IEEE Std. 802.16 broadband wireless metropolitan area network link; and optical\/infrared wireless links, such as a wireless IrDA\u00ae infrared link. The direct interfaces also may be adapted for a digital camera and imaging device, as well as an advanced color LCD controller and display; a high-fidelity digital audio capture and playback device; a secure interface, such as Multimedia Card (MMC) interface or Secured Digital (SD) interface; and a device communicating with external storage devices and media. Interface functional constituents may be disposed in the MM  chip, other than with IPC .

In a homogeneous multiprocessing model, two or more processing units, each substantially similar in structure and function, may process messages being exchanged through MM . In a heterogeneous multiprocessing model, at least one of the processing units GPU , RPU  may be dissimilar in structure, function, or both. A hybrid multiprocessing model may have features of homogeneous and heterogeneous multiprocessing models. Conveniently, MM  can be adapted to be one of a homogeneous multiprocessing model, a heterogeneous multiprocessing model, and a hybrid multiprocessing model, which may foster the development of a flexible platform core for MS , based on a library of selectable configurations for multiprocessor module MM . In one example, each processing unit GPU , RPU  may possess a similar microprocessor core, but may be tailored with one or more different processing constituent(s). In general, exemplary GPU  can be configured to perform multithreaded, multitasked operations, and advantageously execute user-oriented application programs. Likewise, exemplary RPU  can be configured to perform real-time, deterministic, calculation-intensive operations, and advantageously execute communications and signal processing programs. GPU  and RPU  may be configured or augmented with application-specific logic, accelerators, engines, microcontrollers, or functional modules, such as those commonly found in intellectual property (IP) libraries, and also may include coprocessors to assist with common, processing intensive tasks.","One or both of GPU  and RPU , as well as processing subunits within, may be augmented with selected functional constituents. Thus, RPU  can be adapted with special purpose processor constituents including, without limitation, specialized computation, graphics, signal\/image processing, encryption, signal mapping, and modem constituents. Similarly, GPU  can be adapted with general application constituents such as text and data processing engines, multitasking and multithreading operation controls and pipelines, operating system kernel subunits compression\/decompression unit, and multimedia constituents. Beneficially, MS  can be configured to span a vast spectrum of potential consumer needs with application-oriented interfaces such as wideband stereo codecs, speech recognition and synthesis, whiteboarding, polyphonic synthesizers, JPEG and MPEG encoders\/decoders, browsers, and the like also may be integrated into MS , resulting in a rich consumer feature set. Popular browser capabilities, polyphonic synthesized music and tones, and hands-free interaction with MS  may be included in such a feature set initially, or may be added after manufacture or point-of-sale, at least in part, by software-based reconfiguration.","Beneficially, some functional constituents added to complement, or to extend, the processing capabilities of one core processing unit, may overlap processing capabilities of another processing unit within the multiprocessor module. Such an overlap may provide the multiprocessor module with advantages of parallel processing. For example, where exemplary core RPU  is capable of encryption\/decryption, it may be desirable to augment GPU  with a encryption\/decryption engine functional constituent. During a period of light use of GPU , and of heavy use of RPU , encryption\/decryption tasks can be shared or assumed by GPU . Similarly, RPU  can be augmented, for example, with image and video constituents so that, during a period when RPU  has spare processing capacity, a compute-intensive image or video task may be processed substantially in parallel by GPU  and RPU . Processing units, such as GPU , RPU  may operate cooperatively, for example directed by a master processor such as RPU .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","302","304","308","306","302","310","312","336","210","310","312","310","310","312","312","310","310","310","312","302","312","314","318","319","320","326","319","302"]},"In exemplary MM , RPU , GACC , and XCVR  may be operably coupled to RBUS . Advantageously, RBUS  may be adapted to process time-sensitive tasks, including those involving real-time, synchronous, near-real-time, isochronous, and related processing signals and messages. Similarly, MPH  and GPU  may be operably coupled to GBUS . GBUS  advantageously may be adapted to convey application-oriented signals and messages. Although GACC  is illustrated to be disposed on RBUS , GACC  also may be disposed on GBUS . This configuration may be desirable where GACC  is adapted to boost multimedia performance of GPU . Other couplings and configurations are possible, and it is desirable that GBUS  and RBUS  are cooperatively coupled to facilitate overall efficiency and performance by MM  and, by extension, MS . Interprocessor control signals and selected data transfer may be accomplished with IPC  using, for example, bus management unit (BMU) . BMU  may be configured to perform message and signal transaction initiation, bus resource tracking and allocation, interrupt management and IRQ support, bus master and bus control, power control, memory security control, DMA support, external peripheral and port access and control.","BMU  may employ RBUS arbiter (RBA)  and GBUS arbiter (GBA)  to communicate control and other signal and messages with RBUS  and GBUS , respectively. Bus-to-bus data transfer may be provided by BRIDGE . A bus-to-bus data transfer may be desirable, for example, to transmit data (signals or messages) to or from RPU , GACC , or XCVR , as well as other functional constituents coupled to RBUS , to MPH . Such a data transfer may or may not be accomplished with the intervention of GPU . Also, BRIDGE  may perform signal conditioning for signals being communicated between RBUS  and GBUS . Signal conditioning may include, without limitation, voltage level shifting, current level shifting, timing control, signal transcoding, signal format manipulation, and a combination thereof.","One or both of data transfer and signal conditioning may be managed by BMU  and further facilitated by one or both of arbiters RBA , GBA .

In addition, functional constituents such as GACC , XCVR , IPC , and the like, also may be permitted by MMU  to access the unified memory portion. In another example, a first portion of UMM # and a first portion of UMM # may form unified memory, with a second portion of UMM # being reserved for use by RPU  and a second portion of UMM # being reserved for use by GPU . In addition, MMU  may coordinate access to reserved and unified memory by functional constituents such as GACC , XCVR , IPC , and the like. MMU  and FI , FI may also cooperate to support one or more ADDMEM , thereby allowing unified memory to be extended beyond on-chip memory UMM # , UMM # into ADDMEM , as such may be warranted. MMU  may be configured to provide reserved portions of memory in ADDMEM  for selected processing units and functional constituents, as well.","In conjunction with MMU , memory protection units FI , FI , also may be configured to identify, to intercept, and to inhibit storage of a nocent informon in a memory location represented by one or more of UMM # , UMM # , and, if so configured, ADDMEM . Furthermore, units FI , FI may be adapted to identify nocent informons, which may lead to an operational fault state, if accessed or executed. Adaptation of units FI , FI also may prevent one or both of access and execution of a nocent informon, by a processing unit, such as GPU , RPU , or functional constituent, such as GACC , or XCVR .

The one or more direct interfaces also may be adapted for a digital camera and imaging device, as well as an advanced color LCD controller and display; a high-fidelity digital audio capture and playback device; a secure interface, such as Multimedia Card (MMC) interface or Secured Digital (SD) interface; and a device communicating with external storage devices and media. Although MM  and MPH  may be intergrated into a single physical unit, a selected interface may separably couple MM  with MPH . Also, MPH  may cooperate with an interface in MM  to provide the desired connectivity with an external device or service.","Desirably, MM  includes therein memory modules UMM # , UMM # , which may be used by GPU  and RPU , as well as by selected functional constituents. GPU  and memory modules UMM # , UMM # may be coupled with GM bus ; GPU  and memory modules UMM # , UMM # may be coupled with RM bus . Each or both of UMM # , and UMM # , may be configured to provide a unified memory, so that the unified memory portion may be a common memory resource for GPU  and RPU . Thus, although UMM # may appear in  to be an entity separate from GPU , and UMM # may appear to be a memory entity separate from RPU , such may not be the case. UMM # , UMM # may represent distinct, but coupled and cooperating, memory structures, or may represent a single memory structure. Typically, UMM # , UMM # may include inexpensive, high-performance memory structures, such as synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM), double data rate synchronous DRAM (DDR SDRAM or, simply, DDR), RAMBUS\u2122 DRAM (RDRAM), and so on.","In general, MMPU  can allocate and manage memory resources in UMM # , UMM # , or both, as such resources may be requested by processing units, e.g., GPU , RPU , or by functional constituents, e.g., IPC , XCVR , and MMPU . Desirably, MS  offers a flexible implementation that permits multiple configurations, upgrades, and so forth. To that end, MM  may be configured to receive inexpensive commodity memory ADDMEM , and MMPU  may be configured to allocate and manage the additional memory resources that may be provided by ADDMEM . ADDMEM  may be configured as an external module including commodity, high-performance memory components, which may be coupled and cooperate with MMPU  and UMM # and UMM # . Such components may include, for example, SDRAM, DDR SDRAM, RDRAM, and so on. UMM # , UMM # may be configured such that memory can be allocated as a unified memory resource, as a reserved or dedicated memory resource, or as a combination thereof.","As with UMM # and UMM # , MMPU  can configure a portion of ADDMEM  as unified memory, or as memory resources to be used differentially by one or more processing units or functional constituents. Thus, allocation and management of memory resources by MMPU  may include unified memory, as well as memory which may be reserved for one or more selected processing units and functional constituents.","As in  through , MS  may be exposed to an informon corresponding to an operational fault state, and it can be beneficial for MM  to be configured to inhibit such an operational fault state. MMPU  may beneficially be configured to identify, to intercept, and to inhibit storage of, or access to, a nocent informon in a memory location represented by one or more of UMM # , UMM # , and, if so configured, in ADDMEM . MMPU  alone may manage memory protection, including fault inhibition, for example, by communicating with UMM # , UMM # over MCB and with ADDMEM  over MCB , whereby nocent informon read\/write functions in the respective memory locations may be inhibited. MMPU  also may manage memory protection, including fault inhibition, in cooperation with processing units GPU , RPU , and with functional constituents, including IPC . Furthermore, MMPU  may be adapted to identify and inhibit nocent informons, which may lead to an operational fault state, before such nocent informons are accessed or executed by communicating with a processing unit or a functional constituent that otherwise may access or execute the nocent informon.

In addition, it may be desirable to provide a perceptible indication of nocent informon presence, for example, on a display, such as may be present on MPH . Also, it may be desirable to retain selected nocent information for analysis, tracking, and the like, to transmit the selected information to a service provider, such as MSP  or exemplary host DATA , for system-wide incident tracking, reporting, and so on. Further, it may be advantageous for MMPU  to effect, in the presence of selected nocent informons, a predetermined operational state in MS . The predetermined operational state may inhibit development of an operational fault state in MM , thus allowing MS  to function despite the presence of nocent informons. Moreover, it may be advantageous for MMPU  to effect a predetermined fallback state in MS  responsive to a preselected nocent informon. Thus, it may be possible for MMPU  to partially inhibit a device fault in MM , allowing MS  to function, despite a deleterious response to a nocent informon.","As with MM  in , MM  in , and MM  in , MM  in  can beneficially be disposed on a substrate such that GPU , GACC , RPU , DSP , and IPC  can be configured as a monolithic integrated circuit. It also may be advantageous for memory, including UMM # and UMM # , to be fabricated on the monolithic integrated circuit with GPU , and RPU .
