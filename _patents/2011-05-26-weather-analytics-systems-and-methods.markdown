{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Website providers often collect data that describes usage and visitation patterns for their websites. For example, website providers often collect information about how a visitor navigates through their website. This information is often referred to as web analytics data. Such information can be extremely valuable in developing usage statistics for various purposes, including, for example, estimating server load, determining advertising rates, identifying areas of websites that are in need of redesign, and the like.","Web analytics data is often collected via logfile analysis or page tagging. Logfile analysis includes reading logfiles that store a web server's transactions. Page tagging uses executable code (e.g., a \u201cweb-bug\u201d) embedded in the webpage to transmit information about the user and their website visit when the webpage is executed by the visitor's browser application. Web analytics data is often gathered and stored at a web analytics provider to generate a database of web analytics data. Web analytics data may be processed to generate various web analytics reports that can be used by a website administrator to assess and optimize their website. For example, a website provider may submit a query to a web analytics provider for a metric identifying what percentage of visitors to their website are making purchases on the website, and the web analytics provider may process the stored data to provide the corresponding metric.","A website provider will sometimes employ analytics data and associated metrics to provide content targeted to the anticipated audience. In some instances, a website provider will attempt to learn about profiles (e.g., demographics) of visitors, and provide corresponding content of that is expected to interest the visitor. For example, an advertisement for a sports drink may be provided on a webpage displayed to a user that has a history of visiting sports related websites. The more a site provider can learn and understands about a visitor's profile, the better the site provider can control the content delivered to website visitors, thereby improving the visitor's experience and improving the site's overall effectiveness. In some instances, site providers gather user profile information from the user directly (e.g., asking the user for profile information), from data gathered during user browser sessions (e.g., web analytics data), and so forth. Although these techniques provide information that can be useful in assessing user profiles and related decisions, certain limitations may still exist. For example, where the profile information is limited to a user's age and gender, decisions may be based on the limited information relating to the visitor's age and gender.","Accordingly, it may be useful to expand the techniques for gathering and correlating the information to increase the effectiveness of providing content to website visitors.","Various embodiments of methods and apparatus for correlating weather information with user activity and employing the correlations as a basis for providing content to users (e.g., website visitors) are provided. In some embodiments, provided is a method for providing content. The method includes receiving, from a client computer system, a request for content to be provided to a user, determining a geographic location of the user, obtaining weather information corresponding to the geographic location of the user, identifying content to be provide in response to the request based at least in part on the weather information corresponding to the geographic location of the user, and providing, to the client computer system, the identified content.","In some embodiments, provided is a non-transitory computer readable storage medium storing computer-executable program instructions that when executed by a computer are configured to cause: receiving a request for content to be provided to a user, determining a geographic location of the user, obtaining weather information corresponding to the geographic location of the user, identifying content to be provide in response to the request based at least in part on the weather information corresponding to the geographic location of the user, and providing the identified content.","In some embodiments, provided is a system including a processor and a weather processing module executable by the processor to: receive, from a client computer, a request for content to be provided to a user, determine a geographic location of the user, obtain weather information corresponding to the geographic location of the user, identify content to be provide in response to the request based at least in part on the weather information corresponding to the geographic location of the user, and provide, to the client computer system, the identified content.","In some embodiments, provided is a method of identifying a correlation of user activity to weather conditions. The method includes receiving, by an analytics server, analytics data indicative of a plurality of instances of user activity at a content site, identifying, for each of the plurality of instances of user activity at the content site: a location indicative of a location of a user at or near the time of the user activity, and a weather condition corresponding to the locations identified at or near a time of the instance of user activity at content site, identifying a weather correlation indicative of an impact of weather conditions on user activity based at least in part on the plurality of instances of user activity at a content site and corresponding weather conditions identified, and storing the weather correlation.","In some embodiments, provided is a method of influencing content site behavior. The method includes identifying a weather correlation indicative of an impact of weather conditions on user activity based at least in part on the plurality of instances of user activity at a content site and corresponding weather conditions identified, determining, based at least in part on the weather correlation, one or more actions to be employed to influence behavior of a content site, and storing a record indicative of the one or more actions.","While the invention is described herein by way of example for several embodiments and illustrative drawings, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention is not limited to the embodiments or drawings described. It should be understood, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not meant to be used to limit the scope of the description.","As described in more detail below, provided in some embodiments are systems and methods for obtaining weather information, correlating weather information with user behavior, and providing selected content to site visitors based on weather conditions and\/or the correlations. In some embodiments, web analytics data is accumulated that includes information regarding user activity (e.g., website visit information) and associated weather information. In certain embodiments, for example, web analytics data collected may include information regarding a user's interaction with a website (e.g., number of clicks, number of products ordered, total revenue generated, and so forth) and weather information corresponding to the website visit (e.g., weather conditions at the user's location at or near the time of the website). In some embodiments, the web analytics data regarding user activity and the corresponding weather (e.g., activity\/weather analytics data) may be used to assess and determine whether correlations exists between the weather and user activity and, if so, to what extent. In certain embodiments, for example, assessment of the activity\/weather data may reveal a correlation that certain user activities (e.g., movie rentals) are significantly higher during some weather conditions (e.g., \u201crainy\u201d and \u201csnowy\u201d weather conditions), and are significantly lower in other weather conditions (e.g., \u201csunny\u201d, \u201ccold\u201d and \u201ccloudy\u201d conditions). In some embodiments, however, assessment of the activity\/weather data may reveal no significant correlation between the sales of certain products (e.g., books) and the weather. In some embodiments, collecting and assessing data for weather and activity may reveal expected correlations (e.g., umbrella sales increase in rainy conditions), as well as unexpected correlations (e.g., sales of socks increase in high humidity conditions). In certain embodiments, the activity\/weather analytics data and\/or corresponding correlations may be used as a basis for serving selected content to users. For example, advertisements for movie rentals, warm weather vacations, and the like could be provided when it is identified that the user is experiencing rainy and\/or cold conditions. Similarly, advertisements for shade products could be provided when it is identified that the user is experiencing hot and\/or sunny conditions.","In some embodiments, content is provided to users based on user activity and\/or weather conditions. In certain embodiments, for example, in response to receiving a user request for content (e.g., a webpage request), a content provider (e.g., website provider) may obtain location information indicative of a geographical location of the user, obtain weather information corresponding to the geographic location of the user, identify content to be provide in response to the request based on the weather information corresponding to the geographic location of the user (e.g., based on a correlation of activity\/weather analytics data), and provide the identified content to the user. In some embodiments, for example, a particular version of a webpage and\/or a particular web page advertisement (e.g., promotion for a movie rental) may be provided that corresponds to the weather conditions (e.g., rainy conditions) at the geographic location of the user. In certain embodiments, the content provider may query a weather information service to obtain the weather information corresponding to the geographic location of the user. In some embodiments, weather information for a location may be stored (e.g., cached) for a given period of time such that future queries relating to weather at the location may be satisfied by simply retrieving the stored weather information.","In some embodiments, other decisions may be based on the obtained weather information. In certain embodiments, for example, bidding for keywords\/phrases offered by search engines may be manipulated based on the weather in certain locations. In some embodiments, bid amounts for a keyword\/phrase (e.g., \u201cmovie rental\u201d) in a geographic location may be increased when it is determined that the area is experiencing a given type of weather (e.g., \u201crainy\u201d weather), and may be decreased when it is determined that the area is experiencing another type of weather (e.g., \u201csunny\u201d weather).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","101","100"]},"In the illustrated embodiment, system  includes content providers and , a client device  and a web analytics provider .

Client device  may transmit corresponding analytics data  to web analytics provider  via network . Analytics data  may include activity information indicative of user behavior and\/or location information indicative of a geographic location of the user . Web analytics provider  and\/or content providers and\/or may assess the received analytics data  to obtain weather information corresponding to the weather at the geographic location. For example, the analytics provider  and\/or content providers and\/or may query a weather information provider for weather conditions at the geographic location at or near the time of the website visit and may correlate the weather information with the activity information. Overtime, web analytics provider  may collect an increasing amount of web analytics data, and may provide similar assessments of the received analytics data to correlate weather information with the activity information for a plurality of website visits. As described herein, with regard to at least method  of , tracking the relationship between weather and user behavior may enable a plurality of correlations to be identified. For example, correlations may indicate that movie rentals may increase on \u201crainy\u201d or \u201csnowy\u201d days and may decrease on \u201csunny\u201d days. As described herein with regard to at least method  of , weather data associated with a user request for content may enable a content provider to serve targeted content based at least on weather conditions at the geographic location of a user generating the request. In some embodiments, the determination of what content to serve may be based on correlations of past activity and weather information, such as that generated as a result of techniques describe with regard to at least method  of .","Content providers and\/or may include source of information\/content (e.g., a Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) file defining display information for a webpage) that is provided to client device .

For example, a full analytics dataset may include analytics data corresponding to visits to a plurality of different websites without limitation on the type of activity and\/or the location of the activity. In some embodiments, acquiring analytics data may include filtering an analytics dataset to generate a subset of analytic data. For example, where visits to a website that result in purchase of a given item (e.g., movie rentals and\/or book sales) are being tracked, a full analytics dataset or data subset may be filtered to generate a relevant subset of analytics data that corresponds to visits by a plurality of users to the website that result in purchase of the given item (e.g., movie rentals and\/or book sales).","Method  may include determining a location  associated with analytics data  obtained at block , as depicted at block . In some embodiments, determining a location may include assessing location data associated with analytics data  to determine a geographic location corresponding thereto. In some embodiments, the determined geographic location may include a location in a format\/type that can be used to query a weather information provider for weather data corresponding to the location. For example, where a weather information provider provides weather information that corresponds to a zip code, determining a location  may include determining a zip code based on the location data (e.g., geographic coordinates may be translated into a zip code, a reverse look-up of an IP address may be used to identify a corresponding zip code, and so forth).","Method  may include obtaining weather information  corresponding to a location , as depicted at block . In some embodiments, obtaining weather information corresponding to a location includes providing, to a weather information provider, a query for weather data corresponding to location  at or near a time of corresponding analytics data. For example, upon receiving analytics data , analytics provider  may extract location data, determine location  based on the extracted location data, submit to weather information provider  a corresponding query for weather conditions at location , and receive corresponding weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cold, cloudy, snowy, temperature, humidity, etc.) for location . The corresponding weather condition may be associated with activity data corresponding to location data from which location  was determined.","In some embodiments, queries for weather information may be executed at or near the time of receiving analytics data. For example, analytics provider  may submit a query for weather information in response to receiving analytics data . In some embodiments, queries for weather information may be executed at some time subsequent to the time of receiving analytics data. For example, analytics provider  may accumulate analytics data and, at a later time (e.g., in the early morning hours when network traffic is expected to be low), submit corresponding queries for weather information associated with analytics data .","In some embodiments, weather information may be retrieved from stored\/cached weather information. For example, weather information may be queried and received in association with a first set of analytics data corresponding to a location, the weather information may be stored\/cached, and upon receiving a second set of analytics data corresponding to the same location or a similar location, weather information for the second set of analytics data may be retrieved from the stored\/cached weather information (as opposed to generating a second query to weather information provider  for weather information corresponding to the second set of analytics data). In some embodiments, retrieving weather information for a set of analytics data from stored\/cached weather information for another set of analytics data may be done when the sets of analytics data are received within a short period of time such that the weather at the location is not expected to change significantly between receiving the set of analytics data.
