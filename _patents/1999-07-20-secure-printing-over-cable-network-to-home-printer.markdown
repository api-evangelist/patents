title: Secure printing over cable network to home printer
abstract: Secure printing of print data from a client application residing on a data network to a set top box which has a printer, the set top box residing on a digital cable network which has a cable head end for interfacing the digital cable network to the data network, wherein print data is generated in the client application after which it is determined whether a secure communication path exists between the client application and the set top box. If the secure communication path exists, the print data is transmitted from the client application to the set top box. The print data is then sent from the set top box to the printer for printing.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to the secure transmission of print data generated from an internet application over a cable network to one or more set top boxes for printing on printers attached to the set top boxes. More specifically, the present invention provides a mechanism for an internet client application to generate print data and to initiate transmission of the print data over a cable network to the set top box of a subscriber in a secure manner for subsequent printing on the printer attached to the set top box.","2. Description of the Related Art","Generally, the increasing use of the internet has resulted in the proliferation of web sites which provide various services for access by the home consumer. For example, many financial institutions, such as banks, provide the ability for a consumer to access a web page over the internet and to view financial information related to that specific consumer. It can be appreciated that such financial information is confidential and, therefore, access to such financial information is usually protected by some type of security mechanism at the internet client application maintained by the bank. For example, a consumer may be required to enter identification data, which may include a password in order to access the consumer's financial information. In addition, the internet client application maintained by the financial institution may implement a secure communication protocol for the transmission of confidential information to the requesting consumer. The financial institution example discussed above is merely one of many internet applications that a home consumer may access to obtain information related to that specific consumer. Other such internet applications include credit card services, utility billing, and other billing statements, and merchants which sell goods and services over the internet.","Typically, a home consumer can access these internet applications through the use of a home personal computer (PC) which is connected to the internet via a gateway such as an ISP (internet service provider). In many instances, an internet client application which is maintained by a financial institution, credit card service or merchant only allows the consumer to access confidential information related to that specific consumer, and may allow such information to be downloaded from the internet client application to the consumer's home PC. Once downloaded, the confidential information can be used by the consumer for printing on a printer attached to the consumer's home PC, for viewing by the consumer on the consumer's home PC, or for use with a PC-based application, such as a financial management application.","In addition to the widespread use of home PCs to access the internet, there has been a growing use of devices known as set top boxes for connecting a common television to a digital cable network. Typically, the digital cable network comprises a digital broadband network which incorporates digital and analog services such as analog and digital television signal broadcasts, analog and digital pay-per-view services, digital near video on demand, and one and two way real time data communication. Such digital cable networks also provide services such as web browsing and e-mail by providing access to the internet through a proxy between the internet and the digital cable network.","The typical digital cable network has a cable head end which collects value added services for distribution over the digital cable network, including television stations, pay-per-view television stations, near video on demand, web browsing and e-mail. The cable head end also implements network control systems which are required to manage the distribution and control of the aforementioned services over the digital cable network. The cable head end of a typical digital cable network has the capacity to provide services for as many as one-half to one million homes. Through the use of numerous hubs, each of which provides service to approximately 500 to 2,000 homes. The set top box within each home communicates with the cable head end through a client\/server relationship. The STB (set top box) hosts various applications that present the user with the functionality offered by the various cable services. The more familiar applications provided over such digital cable networks are a navigator, an interactive program guide, e-mail, and a web browser. In such applications, the STB hosts the client software and the cable head end hosts the server software. The set top box itself may be one of many currently available set top boxes, such as the Explorer 2000 by Scientific Atlanta, the DCT 5000+ by General Instrument, and the Streammaster by Motorola.","Thus, home consumers with set top boxes may access various internet services, such as financial institutions, credit card services and on-line merchants via the internet proxy provided by the cable head end of the digital cable network. The home consumer can browse the various web sites provided by such internet services and through the use of the consumer's television via the consumer's set top box. Although a consumer can access the consumer's banking institution through its internet service in this manner, the consumer that is using a set top box cannot print information from such internet services because set top boxes do not currently support printers.","In many instances, it would be preferable for an internet client application that is maintained by a bank, credit card service or on-line merchant to have the capability to provide consumer-related data to a consumer on a regular basis, such as a banking statement or utility bill, by initiating transmission of such consumer-related data over the digital cable network to the consumer's set top box. For example, it would be desirable to replace monthly banking statements which are sent by mail with monthly transmissions of such banking statements to the consumer's set top box in the consumer's home. It can be further appreciated that such regularly sent consumer-related data would preferably be automatically printed on a printer attached to the set top box so that the consumer does not need to be involved in the printing process. Due to the confidential nature of such consumer-oriented information, such printing which is initiated by the internet service would need to be handled in a secure manner such that no other subscriber to the digital cable network could access or intercept such information and to ensure that the information is delivered to the appropriate set top box. Currently, however, digital cable networks do not provide the capability to allow an internet application to initiate the secure transmission of confidential print data over the digital cable network to a set top box for printing on a printer which is locally attached to the set top box.","The present invention addresses the foregoing problems by providing an arrangement whereby an internet client application generates confidential information corresponding to a home subscriber connected to a digital cable network through a set top box, after which the internet client application establishes a secure communication path between the internet client application and the set top box corresponding to the home subscriber, whereupon the client application transmits the confidential print data over the secure communication path to the set top box for automatic printing directly by a printer that is locally attached to the set top box.","According to a first embodiment of the application, an internet client application, such as one maintained by a bank or other financial institution, generates confidential print data, such as that contained in a banking statement. The client application then determines whether a secure communication path exists between the client application and a set top box to which the print data is directed. Upon determining that a secure communication path exists, the internet client application transmits the confidential print data to the set top box. The print data is then sent to a printer attached to the set top box for printing.","In a preferred embodiment, the client application generates confidential print data corresponding to a consumer having a set top box with a locally attached printer in the consumer's home. The client application then determines whether it has a secure connection with the cable head end of the digital cable network. If there is a secure connection, the client application sends the print data to the cable head end which renders the print data to a rasterized format that corresponds to the printer attached to the set top box that will receive the print data. The cable head end then determines whether it has a secure connection with the set top box and, if it does, the cable head end sends the rasterized print data to the set top box for printing on the locally attached printer.","By virtue of this arrangement, an internet client application, such as one maintained by a banking institution, can generate and then initiate the transmission of print data containing confidential information relating to a particular subscriber having a set top box on a digital cable network, whereby the transmission of the confidential print data is done in a secure manner through a trusted environment. Therefore, a banking institution having an internet client application can generate monthly banking statements for its customers that have set top boxes in their homes, whereby the banking statements are generated on a regular schedule and then sent from the bank's internet client application through the cable head end of a digital cable network to the appropriate subscriber's set top box for automatic printing on a locally attached printer. In this manner, the home user of the set top box is not required to initiate printing of the bank statement and does not even need to be present when printing occurs.","In another embodiment of the invention, an internet client application, such as one maintained by a banking institution, generates confidential print data corresponding to a consumer having a set top box with a locally attached printer in the customer's home. In this embodiment, the cable head end of the digital cable network is not considered a trusted environment by the client application. Therefore, the internet client application transforms the confidential print data into rasterized print data corresponding to the printer attached to the set top box to which the data is being sent. The internet client application then sends the rasterized print data to the cable head end of the digital cable network for subsequent transmittal to the set top box in the home of the consumer. The set top box then sends the rasterized print data to the locally attached printer for printing.","In a preferred embodiment, the client application generates confidential print data corresponding to a consumer having a set top box with a locally attached printer in the consumer's home. The client application then rasterizes the print data in a format which corresponds to the printer. Preferably, the client application also encrypts the print data for additional security. The client application then sends the rasterized, encrypted print data to the cable head end which passes the print data on to the set top box. The set top box then decrypts the print data and sends it to the locally attached printer for printing.","By virtue of this arrangement, an internet client application, such as a bank, can transmit confidential print data to a consumer through an untrusted environment (cable head end) by sending the print data through the cable head end of the digital cable network in a rasterized format corresponding to the particular printer that is locally attached to the consumer's set top box. Therefore, the print data can be transmitted in a secure manner for printing by an internet client application even though the cable head end of the digital network is not considered a trusted environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"As shown in , the above-listed services may be delivered from service infrastructure  located at the cable head-end, the infrastructure including value-added service provider systems  and network control systems . Value-added service provider systems  include digital satellite distribution systems, applications executing on cable servers (such as special-purpose applications like subscriber service application, content gather applications, etc.), digital media servers outputting MPEG-2 datastreams, and an application data carousel defined by the DSM-CC specification. Network control systems , consisting of the Broadcast Control Suite and the PowerKey Control Suite, provide management and control for the services supported by the broadband network.","Alternatively, services may be delivered from World Wide Web (WWW)  through internet proxy , for example, from remote merchants like merchant . Examples of merchants include banking, retailing, utilities, and the like.","In either case, the services are delivered to Cable Head End (CHE) , which serves as an interface between the service providers and the rest of the broadband network.","In particular, CHE , which is responsible for providing services to 500,000 to 1,000,000 homes, is connected via fiber optic cabling to hubs , which are connected to CHE  or other hubs . Each hub  is, in turn, connected to at least one node , also using fiber optic cabling. Coaxial cable is then used to connect each node to Set Top Boxes  (STB's) of 500 to 2000 homes. Finally, each STB  is connected to television , printer  or both. Accordingly, services are delivered from a service provider to CHE , to one or more hubs , to node , to STB  and to television  or printer .","It should be noted that, by virtue of the foregoing arrangement, service infrastructure  may be distributed among CHE , hubs , or other facilities.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["1","6","10","6","5","14","14","6","6","5","14","14"]},"Each client module  includes client application , a Cable Printing Services Infrastructure (CPSI) client , and Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) client . Each client application  is preferably specific to services being performed at the client module, such as banking services, newspaper services, and the like. Other client-specific applications may also be executed at the client modules, such as applications that generate data or access databases for printout. Client application  communicates with CPSI client  using an application programming interface (API).","CPSI client  delivers print data received from client application  to CHE  through IPP client . Correspondingly, CHE  is provided with IPP server  to receive the print data. It should be noted that the print data travels over all three of IPP, HTTP, and TCP\/IP protocols between respective ones of IPP clients  and IPP server .","Although  is illustrated with an IPP client\/server communication between client modules  and CHE , other communication protocols, or layers of protocols, may also be used. For example, to facilitate printing that is secure, an SSL (secure socket layer) protocol may be utilized. In such an arrangement, a protocol stack is used, consisting of IPP client  over HTTP over SSL over TCP\/IP. A complementary arrangement is provided at CHE . Similarly, other protocols may be used, and multiple protocols can be used in parallel or in stacked arrangements.","Whatever client\/server arrangement is used, the client and servers communicate over a CPSI transport layer that facilitates communication from CPSI client . In general, data is pushed in one direction from CPSI client, with little or no data (other than acknowledgements and the like) returning in the other direction toward CPSI client . The actual CPSI transport may use TCP\/IP, SMTP, or the like. The sessions may be secure. The CPSI transport layer is configured to hide any differences in the actual transport from CPSI client , so that the actual transport is transparent from the viewpoint of CPSI client , thereby making CPSI client  transport-independent.","CHE  includes CPSI server , which is complementary in software structure to CPSI client , and acts to receive data transmitted from CPSI client . CHE  further includes spooler , which assigns print data received from IPP server  and CPSI server  to a logical printer corresponding logically to a printer , and queues print data for a physical device corresponding to the logical printer. CPSI spooler  assigns print data to a logical printer by retrieving a profile from preferences directory  which corresponds to a user ID or other address information received with the print data.","Besides address information, preference directory  also stores other information relating to subscriber preferences. Such information is set initially by the subscriber, during a registration process, and may thereafter be modified as desired. One such preference is a blocking feature, whereby a subscriber can block printing jobs that are received from particular merchants, or can accept print jobs only if they are received from particular merchants. Another such preference involves selection and configuration of an automatic data\/information delivery service. According to this delivery service, and based on subscriber preferences, CHE  periodically executes a data gathering application (like application ) that gathers information from internet sources (such as news, coupons, theater schedules and the like), packages the information into a print job, and sends the print job to the subscriber's set top box.","CPSI spooler  is also connected to cable-specific applications such as application  through CPSI server , IPP server , IPP client , and CPSI client . CPSI client  is similar to CPSI client . Moreover, application  is similar to client application , in that it provides an application executed to perform services specific to a client (here, the cable head end) and can deliver print data to CPSI spooler .","IPP client  is connected to CPSI spooler  via CPSI client  to allow CHE  to communicate with each STB . CPSI client  is similar to CPSI clients  and , and again provides for a complementary software architecture and data communications with a CPSI server at the set top box. In this regard, only two of many thousands of STB's are illustrated. Each STB  includes IPP server  for connection to IPP client . It should be noted that, to deliver data from CHE  to STB , a server is established in STB  and a corresponding client is established in CHE . In such a case, a preferred transport protocol is again the CPSI transport layer, which is usable regardless of the particular underlying transport (TCP\/IP, SMTP, QPSK, DOCSYS, broadband through IP gateway, etc.).","Although  illustrates an IPP client\/server communication between CHE  and STB , other protocols may also be used. For example, in a situation where the resources available in STB  are already strained, it is possible to use SMTP and POP mail protocols to deliver print jobs from CHE  to STB . Advantages of such an arrangement include the fact that many conventional STB's already include mail protocols, thereby avoiding a further increase in STB resource usage, firewalls that might exist in CHE  will allow mail to go through, multiple mailboxes can be defined in each household, and mail clients (at the client modules) can easily be configured to support print jobs. In the latter situation, CHE  and corresponding client modules  are also configured for communication via a mail protocol client\/server relation, such as an SMTP client\/server. Similarly, other protocols can be used between CHE  and respective STB 's, and multiple protocols can be used in parallel or in stacked arrangements.","STB  includes CPSI server , and further includes CPSI spooler , which controls a single queue for a single logical printer corresponding to printer . Otherwise, CPSI spooler  is nearly identical to CPSI spooler , as are CPSI server  and CPSI server . The limited functionalities of CPSI spooler  and CPSI server  are advantageous because STB  is likely to have limited computing resources. STB  also includes STB client application , which communicates to CPSI spooler  through CPSI client , using a subset of the API used by client application . This configuration allows an STB user to initiate local print jobs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["10","10","10","10","10","25"]},"Through the software architecture illustrated in , STB  hosts various applications that present to the home user functionality offered by various cable services. Typical applications are a navigator, an interactive program guide, electronic mail and a web browser. Most of these applications are client\/server implementations, where STB  hosts the client software, and CHE  hosts the server software. Communication between client and server over the cable network is facilitated by an operating system executed on STB , and is performed through published API's. Depending on the hardware platform and the operating system, those applications may be resident at STB , or can be downloaded from servers situated at CHE  for execution at STB .","Thus, as shown in , software architecture and STB  includes an interface  to hardware, an operating system , an HTML engine , resident applications , and other applications . The operating system  is usually vendor-specific for the STB, and may include operating systems such as PTV, WinCE, MicroWare or OpenTV. HTML engine  provides a group of independent handlers that can be plugged together in conformity to known plug-in specifications so as to provide ability to handle different types of media such as HTML, GIF, MPEG, HTTP, Java script, etc. The HTML engine  is used to allow STB  to render HTML documents to a windows manager for display on the local television receiver. HTML documents may be retrieved from local cache, from in-band and out-of-band broadcast carrousels, VBI streams, HTTP proxy servers located at CHE , or remote HTTP servers accessed by the STB user over the internet. In the latter case, documents retrieved from external web servers are filtered by a proxy according to predefined filtering criteria (such as surf watch), which also may convert requested documents into formats supported by the HTML engine .","Resident applications  include such applications as the aforementioned navigator, interactive program guide, and the like.","Applications  and  include a web browser, an e-mail program, a print driver for attached printer , and the like. Of particular note, these applications include the aforementioned applications from , namely IPP server , CPSI spooler , CPSI client , and STB client applications .","Because of limited resources available within STB , print data destined for printer  is not forwarded to STB  in a high level device-independent print language (such as a page description language like PCL5, PDF, PostScript or the like) for rasterization at STB . Such an arrangement, which requires STB  to rasterize print data based on a higher level printer language would often overwhelm the availability of resources at STB . Accordingly, and because a high speed data communication link exists between CHE  and STB , rasterization is performed at CHE , and rasterized data is sent from CHE  to STB  for printout by printer . This section describes a preferred implementation for achieving this effect.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["14","6","12","15","14","12","16","14","6","20","20","12","21","6","10","26","10","12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["6","6","10","10"]},"In more detail,  shows steps S through S that are performed at CHE , and steps S through S that are performed at STB . In step S, cable head end  receives a print job from a client application. The print job is preferably in a high level printer description language (PDL) which is printer independent. In addition, the print job includes one or more addresses identifying the destination or destinations for the print job. The addresses may be in any convenient format agreed to mutually between cable head end  and the client applications.","It is envisioned that the print jobs received by cable head end  are print jobs from merchants located remotely and connected to cable head end  via the internet. Examples of merchants and corresponding print jobs include a bank that prints out bank statements directly into a customer's home, utility companies that print out utility bills directly at a consumer's home, advertisers that printout advertisements and\/or coupons directly at a consumer's home, newsletter\/news clipping services that print out periodicals directly in a reader's home, and the like. It is also possible for the print job to be delivered from a client application executing at cable head end , for example, a client application  that generates a monthly cable guide for printout in a viewer's home, a news retrieval service which, based on automatic searches performed in accordance with user preferences over the internet, obtains news from a variety of internet sources, collates such news, and prints news out directly in a news reader's home, and the like. Multiple other arrangements are easily envisioned. What is preferable in the context of the invention, however, is that the print job is received by CPSI spooler  in cable head end  in a printer-independent format such as the aforementioned printer description languages.","In step S, and based on the printer addresses received with the print job, CHE  accesses preferences directory  so as to retrieve user profiles for the users corresponding to the printers to which the print job is ultimately destined. User profiles preferably include at least an identification of printer configuration and type of printer  connected to the user's set top box. Other information may also be included in the user preference. One such piece of information is a blocking filter, which specifies filtering applied to the print jobs, thereby to permit a user to exclude unwanted print jobs. For example, so as to avoid a proliferation of unwanted print jobs at his home printer, a user may specify preferences instructing cable head end  to block print jobs from specific sources, or to allow print jobs only from specific sources. Any such preferences are applied in step S in which CHE  determines whether or not to reject the print job. If the job is rejected, flow branches to step S so as to reject the job and, possibly, to inform client module  that the job has been rejected.","If the print job is accepted for printout, flow advances to step S in which the print job is scheduled and deposited in the subscriber's queue, and the step S in which the cable head end determines whether a print driver exists for the printer to which the print job is destined. A print driver might not exist for a variety of reasons. One such reason is that the cable head end does not have available a software module corresponding to the printer defined in the user profile. In such a circumstance, cable head end  simply accesses an internet provider of such a software driver, such as an internet site corresponding to the printer manufacturer. One more common situation in which a driver might not exist, however, is a situation in which the user profile does not contain any identification of printer configuration or type. Such a situation is addressed in steps S and S, to which CHE  branches in a situation where a driver does not exist for failure of the user profile to specify a printer.","Thus, in step S, CHE  communicates directly (via CPSI spooler , CPSI client , and IPP client\/server  and ) to the destination STB , with a request for STB  to provide an identification of configuration and type for printer  connected to STB . STB  responds with the needed information, which is obtained by CHE . In step S, CHE  loads the driver corresponding to the identification information provided from STB , and in addition updates the user profile in preferences directory , so that future print jobs can be performed more readily, without the need for communication with STB  for the purpose of determining printer identification.","In any event, once a driver exists, flow advances to steps S and S, in which CPSI spooler  in CHE  determines whether a logical printer corresponding to the print driver already exists, or if one needs to be created. A logical printer will already exist if a prior print job has already been processed. Using the logical printer, CPSI spooler feeds the print job in the printer-independent PDL format to the logical printer, such that the logical printer rasterizes the print job into a printer-specific rasterized bit map image (step S). It should be understood that the rasterized bit map image print job is not simply a fully bit map raster of the print job. Rather, the rasterized bit map print job is a bit-by-bit representation of the print job tailored specifically for the printer corresponding to the logical printer in CPSI spooler . As one example of printer-specific rasterization, many printers require print commands embedded in the print job, so as to enable control over the printer. Examples of such print commands include start-of-page, advance-down, eject-page, load-new-page, and the like. Such printer-specific commands are embedded in the rasterized print job. As a further example, some printers, such a bubble jet printers, print in bands, and embedded-commands are needed so as to define such bands. As yet a further example, some bubble jet printers that print in color require print data to be supplied out of sequence for each different color, so as to accommodate physical differences in location between printing jets for one color relative to printing jets for another color. Whatever the source of printer specificity, the rasterized bit map print job created by the logical printer in step S is printer-specific, tailored directly based on the identity of printer configuration and type of printer .","Step S transmits the rasterized bit map print job to STB . As described above, the transmission to STB  is from CPSI spooler , via CPSI client , IPP client\/server  and , to CPSI server  and spooler  in STB .","At the set top box, step S receives the rasterized bit map print job in CPSI server  and forwards it to CPSI spooler . If a logical printer does not already exist in CPSI spooler , then a logical printer is created based on the identity of printer type and configuration for attached printer  (steps S and S). In step S, CPSI spooler, using the logical printer, executes the rasterized bit map print job so as to send the print job to printer  where it is rendered into a visible printed image.","As described previously, the purpose of the CPSI architecture is to offer facilities that will enable applications running anywhere on the internet to print on printers attached to set top boxes. Such printing is referred to as \u201cpush printing\u201d in the sense that the remote applications push print data through the cable head end to the set top box for printout at an attached printer.","Of course, it is possible to provide the set top box with its own printing capability, so as to enable a user to print data as desired. Such printing is referred to as \u201cpull printing\u201d, in the sense that the user of the set top box pulls data for printout from sources remote from him. For example, a user may, as part of browsing the internet, come across a web page of interest, and may request printout of such a web page. Such printout is \u201cpull printing\u201d and is different from \u201cpush printing\u201d described hereafter.","General printing goals of the architecture described above and hereinafter include the ability to support attachment and software and driving of any supported printer, as well as the elimination of any need for a user to intervene in installation of a printer beyond physical connection to the set top box. Because of a uniform API, software maintenance costs are reduced. In addition, by virtue of the CPSI software architecture, printing does not interfere with other programs running on the set top box, such as web browsing applications or television viewing. In addition, the CPSI architecture is portable across a variety of platforms, and supports a variety of different operating systems, particularly those operating systems that maintain execution in the set top box itself.","Push printing in particular represents a model in which print action is initiated by an entity other than the set top box user. It is assumed that this entity, which actually may either be local to the cable head end or be an internet citizen, owns the document for which the print job is desired, or is able to reference it. Two different printing modes are contemplated:\n\n","Examples of print jobs subject to push printing include merchant-initiated print jobs from remote internet sites. Such merchant-initiated print jobs may include constant content print jobs, such as a flyer advertising particular items for sale. The flyer can be printed in a unicast or multicast mode, and is delivered in the appropriate unicast or multicast mode from the cable head end to the appropriate set top boxes. Merchant initiated print jobs can also include variable content print jobs such as personalized statements like retailing, a bank statement or a utility bill. Based on a client application running at the merchant's server, the print job is created, and submitted to the cable head end. Again, the cable head end delivers the print job in either unicast or multicast mode, as requested by the print job to the set top box or boxes in question.","Generalized goals of merchant initiated printout from remote internet sites include the following. First, the merchant is able to submit the print job at its own internet site, by means of a client application running on the merchant's CPU. The merchant is able to specify parameters for the print job, including destination address and whether or not the transmission is via secured or unsecured transmission. The destination address may specify unicast or multicast printing, meaning that the destination address might identify only a single recipient, or might represent multiple recipients or a group of recipients. The print job is generated in non-proprietary device independent format, by use of widely available client applications, or even customized print applications, that print through standardized and device independent format. This is achieved through separation of the print submission client and the content creation tool: the content creation tool is left to the merchant, whereas the print submission client is embodied in the CPSI client described above. At the cable head end, resident software maintains a directory of user profiles in preferences directory , the profiles including subscriber name, subscriber account number, address, printer model, set top box capabilities, any blocking filters, and policy data. The CPSI spooler at the cable head end discards print jobs that meet criteria specified by blocking filter data, or accepts only print jobs that meet other specified criteria. A system administrator at the cable head end is able to display a print queue, indicating global print jobs for all cable subscribers, or print jobs on a per user basis. Using such a print queue, the system administrator is able to examine the status of jobs in the queue, and the status of corresponding printers attached to set top boxes, and is further able to delete jobs in the queue and override any of user selectable print options. The cable head end spooler does not commence a print job until it has ascertained that the set top box is ready to accept print data, and that the attached printer is ready and on line. Preferably, the CPSI spooler in the set top box is able to commence a print operation before the entire print job has been downloaded from the cable head end, and is further able to confirm successful completion of print jobs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B"],"b":["6","6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 6C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIG. 7A","FIG. 2"],"b":["701","22","702","21","703","705","705"]},"On the other hand, if the job has not been rejected, flow advances to step S, in which, based on destination information included with the print job, the cable head end determines the destination address or addresses for the print job. Steps S and S create logical printers if they are needed. That is, if a corresponding logical printer or printers do not already exist in spooler , the needed logical printer or printers are created in CPSI spooler  (), with a separate logical printer being created for each different printer needed to accomplish the unicast or multicast printing. That is, in a unicast mode, since only a single printer is involved, then only a single logical printer corresponding to the printer in question is created. On the other hand, in a multicast or broadcast mode, multiple users and multiple printers are the destination for the print job. It is possible, however, for several of the multiple users to employ the exact same printer and printer configuration. As a consequence, although it is likely that multiple logical printers are created in the CPSI spooler at the cable head end, it is equally likely that a single logical printer will be able to support several users because each of the several users will have exactly the same printer type and configuration.","The print job is thereafter scheduled and deposited into the user's queue (step S), for rendering by the logical printers (or spooled for subsequent rendering just prior to delivery to the STB). It is possible to render the print jobs into a bit map rasterized format, as discussed above in connection with , but this is not ordinarily necessary. Rather, all that is necessary is for the logical printers to process the print job for subsequent use by the set top boxes.","In step S, the print job from each logical printer is unicast or broadcast to the destination address or addresses. Thereafter, in step S, the cable head end builds a notification server so as to await notification of printout from each of the set top boxes to which print data has been transmitted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 7B","FIG. 5"],"b":["720","721"]},"In step S, the set top box builds a notification client for communication with the corresponding confirmation server built at the cable head end in connection with step S. The notification client in the set top box then communicates with the notification server at the cable head end (step S) so as to notify the cable head end of ongoing print status. In particular, the notification client at the set top box notifies the cable head end as each sheet of the print job is commenced, as each sheet is concluded, and as the print job is concluded. In addition, the notification client permits interaction from the user at the set top box, whereby the user at the set top box can modify his print queue by canceling jobs or advancing jobs out of sequence from the queue.","At the cable head end, and based on information received from the notification client at the set top box, the cable head end can distribute print status information as appropriate. For example, it is possible for the cable head end to transmit print status back to the originating merchant at the remote internet site, so as to permit the merchant to confirm that the print job has been successfully completed. Alternatively, or in addition, it is possible for the cable head end to utilize the print status information so as to monitor, maintain and manage print queues for each and every one of the set top boxes connected to the digital cable network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 2","FIG. 8"],"b":["40","10","12","26","40","41","6","20","14","40","41","42","24","25"]},"By virtue of the foregoing arrangement, push printing from remote internet sites is facilitated at printers connected to set top boxes that are fed data from a cable head end and via a digital cable network. The push printing can be unicast or multicast. In addition, notification of print status is provided from the set top box back to the cable head end, thereby permitting confirmation of printout to the remote internet merchant, or maintenance and management of print queues from the cable head end.","The ability of the present invention to provide push-printing as discussed immediately above, allows a merchant having internet client application  to send print data through CHE  to a subscriber at the subscriber's STB . For instance, a merchant having an internet application, such as a bank or credit card services company, generates print data which corresponds to a particular subscriber, such as a banking statement or a credit card statement, for automatic printing on the printer which is locally attached to the set top box of the subscriber. It can be appreciated that such print data is of a confidential nature and that it would be preferable to have the print data sent to STB  in a secure manner. As such, the present invention provides the ability to allow client application  to push-print confidential print data to a subscriber at STB  via CHE  in a secure manner.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["15","14","10","6","12","6","10"]},"First, as illustrated in , secure printing is achieved by establishing a secure connection between client application  and CHE , and between CHE  and set top box . Specifically, the preferred embodiment utilizes a secure protocol between CPSI client  and CPSI server  to establish a secure connection between client application  and CHE . A secure protocol, such as secure sockets layer (SSL) protocol, is used in addition to the previously described protocols between client application  and CHE  in order to achieve secure push-printing.  depicts the protocol layers that are preferably utilized between client application  and cable head end for secure push-printing. The protocol layers, often referred to as a protocol stack, are described in  from the perspective of a communication path between CPSI client  and CPSI server . Specifically, it can be seen from  that CPSI protocol  is the top layer communication protocol between CPSI client  and CPSI server . Directly below CPSI protocol  is IPP protocol layer  which provides the printing specific protocol for communication between IPP client  and IPP server , which are in direct communication with CPSI client  and CPSI server , respectively. HTTP protocol  may also be utilized for communication between client application  and CHE  and is located directly below IPP protocol layer . SSL protocol layer  resides directly below HTTP protocol layer  so as to provide for a secure communication path between CPSI client  and CPSI server . Directly below SSL protocol layer  is the underlying transport layer  which may be comprised of TCP\/IP, or other such transport protocols. In this manner, secure transport of print data from client application  to CHE  is made possible. The present invention is not limited to the use of SSL, and any other secure protocol or secure transport mechanism may be utilized to accomplish the same result.","Returning to , the secure connection between client application  and CHE  is established through the use of the above-described protocols, therefore providing a path from client application  through CPSI client , and IPP client  to IPP server  and CPSI server , respectively. In the preferred embodiment, the connection is established upon the receipt by client application  of a certificate from CHE  via the SSL protocol . The certificate is preferably signed by a trusted third party and is used to verify that client application  is really communicating with CHE . In this manner, CHE  is authenticated by client application . Print data is then sent in a secure manner from client application  to CPSI spooler  in CHE  through the secure connection. It is also possible for client application  provide a signed certificate to CHE  so that CHE  can authenticate the identity of client application . In this manner, client application  and CHE  are mutually authenticated, thereby ensuring that client application  is sending the confidential data to the correct destination and ensuring that CHE  verifies the identity of the source of the confidential source. It can be appreciated that such mutual identification is preferable for print data comprising a bank statement or a utility bill.","In the embodiment illustrated in , the print data is provided to CPSI spooler  along with the identification information related to the subscriber to whom the print data is to be sent. The print data is provided from client application  to CPSI spooler  in a device-independent format. CPSI spooler  then refers to preferences directory  to obtain the necessary information corresponding to the subscriber, such as the print driver information for printer  connected to STB  corresponding to the subscriber. CPSI spooler then transforms the print data from the device-independent format into a rasterized format by using a printer driver which corresponds to printer . The rasterized print data is then spooled by CPSI spooler  of CHE  for transmission to STB .","The print data is then ready to be sent directly to CPSI spooler  of STB  for immediate printing on printer . This is accomplished by establishing a secure connection between CHE  and STB  in a similar manner to the secure connection between client application  and CHE  as described above. In the preferred embodiment, CHE  receives a certificate from STB  so that cable head end can verify the identity of STB , whereupon a secure connection is established between CHE  and STB . As discussed above, mutual authentication can also be implemented so that STB  can verify the identity of CHE . Once the secure connection is established between CHE  and STB , CHE  sends the rasterized print data to STB . CPSI spooler  in STB  then automatically passes the rasterized print data to printer  for printing, thereby providing the confidential data to the subscriber in a secure fashion. It should be noted that although the above description involves confidential print data being sent in a secure manner to only one subscriber, the same method may be utilized for providing confidential information from internet client application  to many subscribers, wherein the confidential print data is unique and customized for each single subscriber (unicast). In addition, the above method may also be utilized for secure push-printing of the same print data to many individual subscribers (broadcast\/multi-cast).","In addition to the embodiment for secure push-printing as described in , secure push-printing may also be achieved when CHE  is not a considered a trusted environment by client application . Secure push-printing can still be accomplished according to the embodiment described in . As can be seen by comparison between  and , this embodiment is nearly identical to that of  except that the connection between client application  and CHE , and the connection between CHE  and STB  are not necessarily secure and are treated as though they are not secure. Therefore, the print data is transformed from device-independent print data to rasterized print data in the client application  prior to being sent to CHE  for transmission to STB  over the digital cable network. Specifically, client application  has access to a printer driver which corresponds to printer  which is locally attached to the subscriber's STB . Client application  therefore renders the print data for printing on printer  by transforming it from a device-independent format to rasterized print data specific to printer  of the particular subscriber. The rendering of the print data is performed by client application  in client module  in this embodiment, as opposed to within CHE  in the embodiment of , because in this embodiment CHE  is not know considered a trusted environment by client application  and therefore cannot be trusted to render the print data for printing on printer . Preferably, client application  also encrypts the print data prior to sending it to CHE  for subsequent transmission to STB , thereby providing additional security to the print data.","Referring again to , the rasterized, encrypted print data is sent from client application  to CHE  over the normal connection utilizing CPSI client , IPP client , IPP server  and CPSI client , respectively. It should be noted that although a secure connection using SSL is not required in this embodiment, it may be used to provide additional security. CPSI spooler  of CHE  does not render the data because it is already rasterized but instead simply recognizes the destination information provided in a header section of the encrypted, rasterized data and then spools the rasterized data for transmission to the appropriate subscriber. The encrypted, rasterized data is then sent form CHE  to STB  via CPSI client , IPP client , IPP server  and IPP server  respectively. Similar to the connection between client application  and CHE , this connection does not need to be secure through the use of the SSL protocol, although it may be secure for additional protection. In this manner, CPSI spooler  of STB  receives the encrypted, rasterized data from CHE . CPSI spooler  then decrypts the rasterized print data and then automatically sends the rasterized print data directly to printer  for printing, therefore providing the subscriber with the confidential print data in a secure fashion. Unlike the embodiment described in , this is accomplished even though CHE  is not a trusted environment by sending the print data from client application  to STB  in an encrypted, rasterized format, whereby CHE  is used as an interim server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1201","15","6","1202","6","1203","15","6","15","6","1204","15","6","1205","15","6","6","1206","10"]},"In step S, it is determined if a secure connection can be established between CHE  and STB , as discussed above. If a secure connection cannot be established between CHE  and STB , the print job is rejected in step S. If a secure connection is established between CHE  and STB , control proceeds to step S in which the rasterized print data is sent from CHE  to STB . Then, in step S, STB  automatically passed the rasterized print data to printer , upon which printer  prints the rasterized print data (step S).","Returning to step S, if CHE  is not considered a trusted environment, control proceeds to step S in which client application  rasterizes the print data and also encrypts the print data so that is may be sent to STB  via CHE  in a secure fashion. Client application  sends the encrypted, rasterized print data to CHE  in step S with a header that indicates the destination information for the print data and which indicated that the print data has already been rasterized. In step S, CHE  obtains the destination information that was sent with the encrypted, rasterized print data, spools the encrypted, rasterized, print data for transmission to STB , and then transmits the encrypted, rasterized, print data to STB . STB  then decrypts the encrypted, rasterized print data in step S, after which STB  sends the decrypted, rasterized print data to printer  (step S). Printer  then prints the rasterized print data in step S.","Thus, whether or not cable head end  is considered a trusted environment, confidential print data from client application  on the internet, such as a bank, can be sent in a secure manner from client application  to set top box  on a digital cable network through the cable head end  for automatic printing on printer  that is locally attached to set top box . In this manner, a subscriber on a digital cable network can automatically receive monthly billing statements or bank statements from a corresponding internet application maintained by the billing service or bank in a secure manner, thereby preventing misuse or improper access by others of the information contained therein.","The configurations described above for the present invention are provided to allow printing from client module  to STB  via CHE , wherein the print data is formatted for printing on printer  either at CHE  by CPSI spooler  or at the client application  of client module . In those configurations, the print data is generally provided to STB  in a rasterized format required for printing directly to printer  without the need for utilizing a printer driver in STB . The utilization of a printer driver in STB  is necessary, however, when a user of STB  wishes to print locally, such as when printing a web page that the user is viewing on the television to which STB  is attached. A printer driver in STB  would also be necessary in instances when print data is provided from CHE  to STB  in a device-independent format. In such situations, and in others not discussed herein, an appropriate printer driver corresponding to printer  needs to be provided for use in STB .","Depending on the capabilities of STB , a printer driver could be loaded in a variety of ways. For example, if the set top box has sufficient memory capacity, a number of printer drivers could be pre-loaded into the memory of STB  for several different printers. In the alternative, STB  may allow a floppy disk drive or CDROM, or the like, to be interfaced to STB  such that printer drivers could be accessed from a floppy disk or CDROM.","In the set top box environment of the present invention, it is appreciated that a user may prefer to utilize the digital cable network in order to obtain and load a printer driver. Therefore, the present invention provides a manner in which to provide a remote plug-and-play service whereby CHE  locates and provides an appropriate printer driver to STB  upon request by STB , thereby supporting the attachment of a local printer to STB .","This feature of the present invention is described in , which depicts a sequence of steps for accomplishing a preferred embodiment of the remote plug-and-play feature for supporting a local printer attached to STB . In step S, the subscriber plugs printer  into STB  via the interface provided by STB  for printers. This interface may comprise a universal serial bus (USB), an RS-232 interface, or other printer connection. Next, in step S, STB  determines that a new printer has been plugged in and that STB does not have a printer driver corresponding to the new printer. This detection is achieved via hardware interface  and operating system  of STB . Client application  of STB  obtains an indication from operating system  that a printer driver is needed for printer . STB client application  then sends a request to CHE  to obtain a printer driver that corresponds to printer . The request is sent from STB  to CHE  via the digital cable network, but not necessarily through the IPP protocol, because print data is not involved in this transaction. Therefore, it can be appreciated that any of the underlying transport protocols such as TCP\/IP, may be utilized to send the request from STB client application  in STB  to CHE application  in CHE  (step S).","It should be noted that the request for printer driver from STB client application  preferably includes the information necessary to identify printer , such as the manufacturer and model of printer . Next, in step S, CHE application  receives the request for printer driver from STB . CHE application  then accesses preferences directory  to obtain hardware and operating system information which describes STB  (step S). This information is necessary to determine which type of printer driver should be obtained and sent to STB . For instance, the set top box may comprise one of several currently available set top boxes, such as the Explorer 2000 by Scientific Atlanta, the DCT 5000+ by General Instrument, and the Streammaster by Motorola. In addition, the appropriate printer driver must correspond to the operating system implemented in the set top box. For instance, the Explorer 2000 utilizes the Power TV operating system, the DCT 5000+ utilizes the WinCE operating system, and Streammaster utilizes either the MicroWare or the Open TV operating system.","In step S, CHE application  obtains a printer driver that is appropriate for the manufacturer and model of printer  and for the hardware type and operating system of STB . CHE application  may obtain this printer driver from one of many sources. For example, the needed printer driver may already be stored in a memory of CHE  and accessible via preferences directory  for another subscriber on the digital cable network. In the alternative, CHE  may have several printer drivers available in a memory device such as a hard drive, CDROM, or the like. In another alternative, CHE application  may utilize internet proxy  to access world wide web  so as to obtain the necessary printer driver for STB , such as from the printer manufacturer's web site. Once the appropriate printer driver is found by CHE application , CHE application  then sends the printer driver to STB  via the digital cable network (step S). As mentioned previously, any of the available transport protocols for communication between CHE  and STB  may be utilized to download the printer driver from CHE  to STB . Once STB  receives the printer driver, STB  loads the printer driver in local memory for subsequent use and registers the printer driver with operating system  of STB  for future reference (step S).","In step S, CHE  obtains another printer driver for use by CHE  to send print data to STB . CHE  determines which printer driver to obtain for its own use based upon the information describing printer  provided by STB  and based upon the type of hardware and operating system which comprise CHE . As described above, CHE  may obtain the printer driver from any one of several resources, such as world wide web . CHE application  updates preferences directory  so as to record the new printer driver that corresponds to printer  for use by CHE  (step S). In this manner, CHE  maintains a printer driver which corresponds to printer  so that CHE  may render print data appropriately the next time print data is provided from CHE  to STB  for printing on printer . In addition, this feature of the present invention also provides an easy and transparent plug-and-play mechanism for the user of STB  to connect and utilize printer  to STB .","It is emphasized that several changes and modifications may be applied to the above-described embodiments, without departing from the teaching of the invention.
