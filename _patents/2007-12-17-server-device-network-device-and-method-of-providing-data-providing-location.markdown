Technical Field","This disclosure generally relates to a server device, a network device, a method of providing a data providing location, a program for providing a data providing location, and a recording medium, and particularly relates to a server device, a network device, a method of providing a data providing location, a program for providing a data providing location, and a recording medium for use in a system in which a client device acquires a set of information about a dataset from a data storage location.","2. Description of the Related Art","In recent years, RSS (Rich Site Summary) has been used for publishing updated information of Web sites. RSS is an XML (Extensible Markup Language) based format for describing metadata such as title and summary of a Web site in a structured manner.","Updated information written in RSS can contain titles, addresses, headings, summaries, updated time, etc., of Web site pages. RSS makes it possible for RSS subscribers to efficiently handle the updated information on many Web sites in a uniform format.","Some conventional multifunction machines have functions for providing device management information, such as communication histories, in RSS (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2006-54732 (Patent Document 1), also published as U.S. Application Publication No. 2006\/0033950 A1). Patent Document 1 discloses an RSS reader that runs on a computer serving as a client device. The RSS reader periodically polls RSS feeds in plural multifunction machines and thus collectively manages plural sets of device management information of the plural multifunction machines.","The term \u201cRSS feed\u201d as used herein may indicate the URL of the RSS source. The RSS source is information described in RSS format.","However, according to Patent Document 1, a user of the RSS reader needs to register RSS feeds of the multifunction machines into the RSS reader. That is, the user needs to find out each of the URLs of the RSS feeds of the multifunction machines. This might be very troublesome if the user needs to register a number of RSS URLs.","Similarly, in the case where an administrator, such as an IT manager, manages a number of network devices and multifunction machines, the administrator needs to find out and register all the RSS feed URLs of the managed network devices and multifunction machines, which might be very troublesome.","In an aspect of this disclosure, there is provided view a server device capable of correctly and easily registering a data storage location indicating the location of a set of information about a dataset provided by a network device; the network device; and a method of providing a data providing location.","In another aspect, there is provided a server device that provides a client device with one or more data storage locations of one or more sets of information about one or more datasets. The one or more sets of information about the one or more datasets are provided by one or more network devices. Each of the sets of information about the datasets is described in a structured format. The server device comprises a data storage location acquiring unit that acquires the data storage locations of the sets of information about the datasets from the corresponding network devices; a data storage location management unit that manages the data storage locations of the sets of information about the datasets acquired from the network devices; and a data storage location providing unit that provides the client device with the acquired data storage locations of the sets of information about the datasets.","According to another aspect, there is provided a network device that provides a set of information about a dataset described in a structured format. The network device comprises a specifying unit that specifies a server device that provides a client device with a data storage location of the set of information about the dataset; and a providing unit that provides the server device specified by the specifying unit with the data storage location of the set of information about the dataset.","Embodiments of the present invention include a method, a device, a system, a computer program, a recording medium, and a data structure to which an element or an arbitrary combination of elements of the present invention is applied.","Embodiments of the present invention can provide a server device capable of correctly and easily registering a data storage location of a set of information about a dataset provided from a network device; the network device; and a method of providing a data providing location.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention are described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the examples illustrated in the following embodiments, an IT manager as an administrator of plural network devices, such as multifunction devices, which are capable of providing device management information as RSS feeds, registers URLs of the RSS feeds of the network devices. The following embodiments provide a technique for facilitating registration of the URLs of the RSS feeds provided by the plural network devices into an RSS reader of a client device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","2","3","4","3","3","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1","1","101","102","103","104","105"]},"The processor  controls the network device .
