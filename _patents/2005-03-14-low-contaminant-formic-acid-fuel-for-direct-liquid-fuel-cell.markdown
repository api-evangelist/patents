{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["PRIORITY CLAIM","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119 of application Ser. No. 60\/611,906 filed Sep. 21, 2004.","This invention was made with Government assistance under Department of Energy Grant No. DEGF-02-99ER14993. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The field of the invention is liquid organic fuels. A fuel of the invention is applicable, for example, to direct liquid feed electrochemical fuel cells.","Fuel cells are electrochemical cells in which a free energy change resulting from a fuel oxidation reaction is converted into electrical energy. End uses for fuel cells include battery replacement, mini- and microelectronics, automotive engines and other transportation power generators, power plants, and many others. One advantage of fuel cells is that they are substantially pollution-free.","In hydrogen\/oxygen fuel cells, hydrogen gas is oxidized to form water, with a useful electrical current produced as a byproduct of the oxidation reaction. A solid polymer membrane electrolyte layer can be employed to separate the hydrogen fuel from the oxygen. The anode and cathode are arranged on opposite faces of the membrane. Electron flow along the electrical connection between the anode and the cathode provides electrical power to load(s) interposed in circuit with the electrical connection between the anode and the cathode. Hydrogen fuel cells are impractical for many applications, however, because of difficulties related to storing and handling hydrogen gas.","Organic fuel cells may prove useful in many applications as an alternative to hydrogen fuel cells. In an organic fuel cell, an organic fuel such as methanol is oxidized to carbon dioxide at an anode, while air or oxygen is simultaneously reduced to water at a cathode. One advantage over hydrogen fuel cells is that organic\/air fuel cells can be operated with a liquid organic fuel. This diminishes or eliminates problems associated with hydrogen gas handling and storage. Some organic fuel cells require initial conversion of the organic fuel to hydrogen gas by a reformer. These are referred to as indirect fuel cells.","The presence of a reformer increases cell size, cost, complexity and start up time. Other types of organic fuel cells, called direct fuel cells, avoid these disadvantages by directly oxidizing the organic fuel without conversion to hydrogen gas. Until recently, methanol and other alcohols were the fuel of choice in the development of direct fuel cells, and most research focused on the use of these fuels.","An advance in the art is presented in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003\/0198852 (\u201cthe '852 publication\u201d) and 2004\/0115518 (\u201cthe '518 publication\u201d). Embodiments described in these applications disclose formic acid fuel cells with high power densities and current output. Exemplary power densities of 15 mW\/cmand much higher were achieved at low operating temperatures. Additionally, embodiments described in those applications provided for compact fuel cells.","While fuel cells will have different configurations for different applications, the compact fuel cells will be suitable for replacement in small portable electronics, e.g., cellular handsets and personal digital assistants (PDAs). As an example, cellular handsets typically require a certain amount of power (usually 3 watts) which should fit within a cavity of approximately 10 cc to 30 cc. In order for a fuel cell technology to accomplish this, it must have the capability of operating at a high power density. Direct formic acid fuel cells in accordance with embodiments of the '852 publication and the '518 publication have been demonstrated as suitable to deliver such power in the small form factor suited to small portable electronics.","Commercial bulk grades of formic acid are made by a number of processes. Processes for making formic acid are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,879,915, 5,869,739, 5,763,662, 5,633,402, 5,599,979, 5,393,922, 4,262,140, 4,126,748 and 2,407,157. Commercial bulk grades of formic acid are used in a variety of industries and processes. It is used, for example in animal feed additives, to dye clothing, and in the manufacture of vinyl resin plastics. It is also used to manufacture aspartame. There are also commercial purified grades of formic acid. The commercial purified grades have a smaller market. The commercial purified grades are used, for example, as a solvent in high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and as solvents for other measurement techniques.","A low contaminant formic acid fuel is especially suited toward use in a direct organic liquid fuel cell. A fuel of the invention provides high power output that is maintained for a substantial time and the fuel is substantially non-flammable. Specific contaminants and contaminant levels have been identified as being deleterious to the performance of a formic acid fuel in a fuel cell, and embodiments of the invention provide low contaminant fuels that have improved performance compared to known commercial bulk grade and commercial purified grade formic acid fuels. Preferred embodiment fuels (and fuel cells containing such fuels) including low levels of a combination of key contaminants, including acetic acid and methyl formate.","The invention concerns a low contaminant formic acid fuel, and is especially suited toward use in a direct organic liquid fuel cell. A fuel of the invention provides high power output that is maintained for a substantial time and the fuel is substantially non-flammable. Specific contaminants and contaminant levels have been identified as being deleterious to the performance of a formic acid fuel in a fuel cell, and embodiments of the invention provide low contaminant fuels that have improved performance compared to known commercial bulk grade and commercial purified grade formic acid fuels.","It has been discovered that commercial bulk mixtures show significant batch-to-batch variations in performance. This is true of bulk commercial bulk grades that were tested, as well as commercial purified grades of formic acid that were tested. Particular contaminants are present in commercial bulk grade and commercial purified grade formic acids at levels that negatively impact the current density over time performance in a direct formic acid fuel cell. It has also been discovered that commercial bulk grades and certain commercial purified grades of formic acid are either flammable or have too low of a power density to be useful and are provided in a form that is inconvenient for use in a fuel cell.","Particular embodiments of the invention include formic acid fuels having low levels of acetic acid and methyl formate. Formic acid fuels in accordance with embodiments of the invention exhibit high power outputs, and provide less current degradation over time when used in a direct liquid fuel cell than commercial bulk grades and commercial purified grades of formic acid that were tested. Embodiments of the invention include formic acid and water mixtures having negligible amounts of key catalyst contaminants that we have identified.","The invention also includes methods for making formic acid fuels. An embodiment of the invention includes starting with a commercially available formic acid and water mixture, and then treating the mixture to eliminate key impurities. In an embodiment of the invention, key impurities are removed by freezing a formic acid and water mixture to separate impurities and collecting the purified formic acid from the separated impurities.","The invention also includes fuel cells with low impurity formic acid fuels, as well as cartridges with low impurity formic acid fuel for fuel cells. An exemplary fuel cell assembly  of the invention is shown in . The fuel cell assembly includes an anode  and a cathode , with a solid polymer electrolyte  sandwiched therebetween. A preferred solid polymer electrolyte membrane  is a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and perfluorovinylether sulfonic acid, with an example being the membrane  available under the NAFION trade name from DuPont Chemical Co., Delaware. Other membrane materials can also be used, with examples including membranes of modified perfluorinated sulfonic acid polymer, polyhydrocarbon sulfonic acid, membranes containing other acidic ligands and composites of two or more kinds of proton exchange membranes.","The anode , cathode  and solid polymer electrolyte  can be formed as a unitary membrane electrode assembly (MEA). For example, an MEA can be formed when the anode  and cathode  are painted or otherwise deposited as a liquid ink or slurry form onto opposite surfaces of the membrane . Each of the anode  and the cathode  can include a catalyst layer with an example being finely comminuted platinum (Pt) and\/or palladium (Pd) particles either supported or unsupported and directly applied to opposite sides of the NAFION membrane. In preferred embodiments, the catalyst is Pd. When the catalyst ink dries, solid catalyst particles adhere to the membrane  to form the anode  and the cathode .","A cathode current collector  covers a surface  of the cathode . A plurality of slots  through a portion of the cathode current collector  provides access to the cathode . An insulator  covers a portion of the cathode current collector . In the example, the cathode  of the exemplary cell remains open to the atmosphere, although other cell configurations are contemplated in which oxygen can be supplied through other means. An anode current collector  covers a surface of the anode . Like the cathode current collector , the anode current collector  has a plurality of slots  that provide access to the anode  and increase the operative surface area.","A conducting sheet  can be interposed or sandwiched between the current collector  and the anode  to facilitate distribution of charge. Although not illustrated, a conducting sheet  can also be provided between the cathode current collector  and the cathode . The conducting sheet  can be gold mesh, carbon cloth, or the like. The conducting sheet  can also provide some mass transfer functionality to facilitate transfer of fuel to the anode . For example, a carbon cloth that has been modified to change its surface interactions with water is believed to offer useful benefits and advantages for operation of some cells of the invention. The anode  and the anode current collector  are attached to an anode enclosure  that includes a cover plate  and defines a chamber . When the fuel cell  is assembled, the chamber  is operative to contain an organic fuel solution. A fill passage  allows for communicating fluids to and from the chamber . The fill passage  can be sealed to provide a self-contained fuel cell that can be useful, for instance, as a miniature power source for small or microelectronics devices.","The anode and cathode current collectors  and , can be formed, for example, of tantalum foils electrochemically coated with gold. The anode enclosure , formed for example of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE; commercially available under the trade name Teflon\u00ae), includes the chamber , and the cover plate , also for example of PTFE, closes the chamber so that it can contain a formic acid fuel solution. Passages  define a gas remover .","Gas bubbles  formed on the anode  will travel through the fuel solution held in the chamber  to the passages , through which they can then exit the chamber  in the direction of the arrow. As gas bubbles  are formed, the pressure in the chamber  increases and creates a pressure differential across the passages . The driving force of the pressure differential directs the gas bubbles  out of the chamber .","The passages  are configured to substantially prevent passage of the fuel solution while allowing gas to pass therethrough. It has been discovered that providing passages  in a generally tubular shape and with a length to diameter ratio of at least 0.5 is beneficial to prevent liquid flow, as is use of a hydrophobic surface on the interior surface of the passages . Preferably, the passages  have a diameter of no more than 0.031 inch (0.079 cm), and more preferably no more than 0.01 in. (0.0254 cm), and a length of at least 0.125 in. (0.3175 cm). At least about five passages  are preferably provided, and more preferably they are provided in a ratio of about twenty passages  of no more than 0.031 inch (0.079 cm) diameter per square centimeter of useful anode area. An exemplary hydrophobic construction material for the passages  includes the fluorocarbon-based polymer commercially available from 3M Corporation, Minneapolis Minn. under their registered trademark KEL-F. It is contemplated that the passages  can be provided in more than one wall of the anode enclosure .","To promote circulation of the fuel solution, the gas remover  is preferably configured to cause the gas bubbles  to travel some minimum distance through the chamber . For example, the passages  are preferably placed a distance A of at least 0.1 inches (0.254 centimeters) from the anode current collector . Also, it has been discovered that providing a passage entrance  that is separated by a distance from the wall  of the anode enclosure  is also useful to promote useful circulation of the fuel solution. A distance of at least 0.01 in. (0.0254 cm) is preferred.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-3"],"b":["10","50","52","54","56","58","50","58","56","60","62","50"]},"The exemplary fuel cell embodiment of  includes a replaceable fuel cartridge . The replaceable cartridge  includes a fuel reservoir  for holding a supply of a low contaminant formic acid fuel solution. The replaceable cartridge  can be constructed of any suitable material, with an example being a PTFE such as TEFLON. The anode enclosure  is provided with a loading passage communicating with the chamber , with the loading tube  of  being an exemplary loading passage. The loading tube  is configured to mate with the replaceable cartridge . Preferably, the loading tube  includes a sealing mechanism such as a check valve . The check valve  is configured to provide one-way flow whereby flow is allowed into the chamber  from the cartridge reservoir  but reverse flow out of the chamber  is prevented. Other sealing mechanisms and configurations are also contemplated.","The replaceable cartridge  includes a recessed valve  that is located at the terminal end of a loading port . An exemplary loading port  comprises a generally tapered cavity configured to receive the loading tube  and guide it into engagement with the recessed valve . The valve  can comprise a spring-loaded or like configured valve that opens when the loading tube  engages it. Configurations like the exemplary recessed valve  and loading port  can be desirable to reduce the chances of exposure of a fuel solution to user contact during loading.","The replaceable cartridge  is useful to load fuel solution into the chamber  after depletion of existing fuel. It will be appreciated that the loading tube  can extend for any practical distance, so that a fuel cell of the invention can be within the body of an electronic device and yet remain accessible for re-fueling.","The fuel cells and cartridge in  include a low contaminant formic acid fuel that provides a sustained current performance. The low contaminant fuel is preferably substantially free from acetic acid and methyl formate. Exemplary embodiment fuels have been prepared and tested. Experiments and results will now be discussed. Various additional features of the invention and preferred embodiments of the invention will be illustrated by the following data, while artisans will appreciate that the invention is not limited to the particular example fuels and exemplary methods of making that are described with respect to the experiments.","A preferred fuel composition was made by starting with 99% Reidel Puriss formic acid purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St Louis, Mo.) stock #33015. About 122 cc of the fuel was placed in a 1 liter plastic bottle, 10 ml of deionized water was added, then the bottle was placed in a \u221220\u00b0 C. freezer for 5 hours. Formic acid crystals formed along the walls of the bottle, while liquid remained in the center. The liquid was poured out of the bottle. The crystals were then rinsed in deionized water and then the crystals were allowed to melt. 38 milliliters of the melted crystals was placed in a 50 ml graduated cylinder, 12 milliliters of deionized water was added, producing the \u201cpreferred formic acid composition 1\u201d listed in Table 1.","This method used to produce the \u201cpreferred formic acid composition 1\u201d works well with the purified commercial grades as a starting point. When commercial bulk grades are used as a starting point, the steps may need to be repeated to reduce methyl formate and acetic acid levels. Alternately, a preliminary distillation step can be conducted with a commercial bulk grade formic acid prior to freezing.","Tests on the \u201cpreferred formic acid composition 1\u201d were conducted commercial fuel cell test hardware from Fuel Cell Technologies. The MEA for these experiments was prepared as follows. Anode and cathode catalyst inks were prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of catalyst powders with 5% recast NAFION solution (1100 EW, Solution Technology, Inc., USA). Englehardt #s020284 palladium black or Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.) #20,582-4 were used as anode catalysts while Johnson Mathey highspec 6000 platinum black was used as a cathode catalyst. Both the anode and cathode inks were applied onto either side of a NAFION 117 membrane (Dupont), which was fixed on a vacuum table. Ink application was typically performed at 60\u00b0 C., after which the membrane was thermally cured at 80\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes. The anode catalysts employed had a loading of about 10 mg\/cm. The geometric surface area of the MEAs employed in this work was 5 cm. The cathode ink formulation was approximately 90% by weight Pt black and 10% by weight NAFION. The cathode catalyst employed had a standard loading of 8 mg\/cm. The experiments were conducted by feeding 1 cc\/min of 10 M formic acid to the anode, and 100 sccm (standard cubic centimeters) of dry air to the cathode. We ran the membrane for 1 hour at 0.53 volts and recorded the current as a function of time. Table 1 summarizes the results. Notice that the preferred fuel exhibits an energy density above 800 w-hr\/liter, shows less than 22% loss of current in 1 hour, and is not flammable. Table 1 summarizes the measured contaminants. The results for the preferred fuel composition are the worst measured result. In many cases the impurity concentrations (of methyl formate and acetic acid) were below our measurement limit (about 1 part per million (ppm)). By contrast, for each of the commercial grades, the best case test result is presented. While it is noted that there were batch to batch variations in the levels of contaminants noticed during testing, in each test case the impurity levels were no lower that shown. Further, higher levels of acetic acid and methyl formate produced worse results.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"343pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Results of experiments where various samples of formic acid were evaluated in commercial fuel cell test fixtures"},{"entry":"and by gas chromatography"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},"Theoretical",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"energy",{},{},{},"% methyl"]},{"entry":[{},"%",{},"density at","%","% acetic","% Acetic","formate,","Flammable?"]},{"entry":[{},"formic",{},"0.7 V, w-","current","acid, GC","Acid per","GC","(Flash point"]},{"entry":["Sample","acid","Molarity","hr\/lit","loss in 1 hr","analysis","spec","analysis","below 61 C.)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Preferred","84","22","810","21%","\u2003\u2002<1 ppm","N.A.","10 ppm","No"]},{"entry":"formic acid"},{"entry":"composition"},{"entry":["GFS -","89-91","23","880","48%","\u2009\u20091000 ppm","\u2003<0.4%","20 ppm","Yes"]},{"entry":"double"},{"entry":"distilled lot"},{"entry":"T1"},{"entry":["GFS -","89-91","23","880","27%","\u2009\u20093100 ppm","\u2003<0.4%","10 ppm","Yes"]},{"entry":"double"},{"entry":"distilled lot"},{"entry":"P457100"},{"entry":["Aldrich","89-91","23","880","50%","\u2009\u20093200 ppm","\u2003<0.4%","10 ppm","Yes"]},{"entry":"ACS grade"},{"entry":["Fluka HPLC","50","13","450","24%","\u2003\u2002<1 ppm","<10 ppm","30 ppm","No"]},{"entry":"grade"},{"entry":["BASF 90%","89-91","23","880","62%","\u2009\u20094700 ppm","N.A.","<10 ppm\u2009\u2009","Yes"]},{"entry":"D13456"},{"entry":["Orbiter","\u2002\u200999.9","26","990","43%","\u2009\u20093600 ppm","\u2003<0.4%","10 ppm","Yes"]},{"entry":"WABE18-2"},{"entry":["Reidel","99","26","980","28%","\u2009\u2009\u200350 ppm","<0.005%","30 ppm","Yes"]},{"entry":"Puriss grade"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"N.A. = Not Applicable,"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"left","id":"FOO-00002"},"sup":"1"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"left","id":"FOO-00003"},"sup":"2"}}]}}]}}},"Only the preferred fuel and the Fluka fuel were non-flammable.
