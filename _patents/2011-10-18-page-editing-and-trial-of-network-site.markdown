{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["In general, to create new layouts and user interfaces for an online retail environment, new web pages are manually designed, written, and deployed on a case by case basis.","The various embodiments described herein relate to systems and methods that facilitate design and testing of a layout to a network merchant site, such as a web site. Network pages within the web site include images, text elements, navigation controls, etc. Additionally, a network site designer uses a merchant site designer application to create or change a layout of page elements of the merchant site and to modify the properties of those elements. Accordingly, the designer may also configure parameters defining a trial environment under which the new layout may be tested and compared against an alternative layout for the web page. In the following discussion, a general description of the system and its components is provided, followed by a discussion of the operation of the same.","With reference to , shown is a networked environment  according to various embodiments. The networked environment  includes one or more computing devices  in data communication with one or more client devices  by way of a network . The network  includes, for example, the Internet, intranets, extranets, wide area networks (WANs), local area networks (LANs), wired networks, wireless networks, or other suitable networks, etc., or any combination of two or more such networks.","The computing device  may comprise, for example, a server computer or any other system providing computing capability. Alternatively, a plurality of computing devices  may be employed that are arranged, for example, in one or more server banks or computer banks or other arrangements. A plurality of computing devices  together may comprise, for example, a cloud computing resource, a grid computing resource, and\/or any other distributed computing arrangement. Such computing devices  may be located in a single installation or may be distributed among many different geographical locations. For purposes of convenience, the computing device  is referred to herein in the singular. Even though the computing device  is referred to in the singular, it is understood that a plurality of computing devices  may be employed in the various arrangements as described above.","Various applications and\/or other functionality may be executed in the computing device  according to various embodiments. Also, various data is stored in a data store  that is accessible to the computing device . The data store  may be representative of a plurality of data stores as can be appreciated. The data stored in the data store  includes data accessed by the components executing on the computing device , such as network pages , as well as potentially other data.","The components executed on the computing device  include, for example, a merchant site designer application , a trial experiment component , and a network page server application . The components executed on the computing device  may also include other applications, services, processes, systems, engines, or functionality not discussed in detail herein. These components may communicate with each other using various mechanisms, including but not limited to any type of middleware framework. Examples of such frameworks include remote procedure calls, simple object access protocol (SOAP), representational state transfer (REST), Windows Communication Foundation, and other frameworks. Though shown as logically separate components, the functionality of these components can be combined and\/or distributed in various ways, as can be appreciated.","In some embodiments, the functionality of the trial experiment component  may be included in the merchant site designer application . In other embodiments, the trial experiment component  may be executed as a sub-module of the merchant site designer application , or as a separate, standalone application, etc.","A set of network pages  is arranged in a hierarchy to form a network site . The computing device  acts as a web hosting provider to host network sites  for various customers. To this end, the network page server application  is executed to receive requests for network pages  associated with one of the hosted network sites . These network page requests are generated by a client device  and received over the network . The network page server application  is further executed to generate a network page  corresponding to the network page request, i.e., a network page  associated with one of the hosted network sites . The network page server application  is further executed to serve up the generated network pages  in response to the network page requests.","The network pages fetched by the network page server application  may be dynamically generated or may be static. To this end, the network page server application  uses network page data , which may include any type of data related to the generation of network pages. Such data may include, for example, templates, executable code, interpreted code, hypertext markup language (HTML), extensible markup language (XML), images, video, text, graphics, and any other type of data that may be used in network pages. The network page server application  may comprise a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) server such as Apache\u00ae HTTP Server, Apache\u00ae Tomcat\u00ae, Microsoft\u00ae Internet Information Services (IIS), and\/or any other type of network page server application.","The merchant site designer application  is executed to allow a user, such as a network site administrator or designer, to design or modify the network pages  that make up the network site . The merchant site designer application  makes use of the trial experiment component  which allows the network site designer to set up trial experimentation parameters on modifications made to page layout or content.","The client device  is representative of a plurality of client devices that may be coupled to the network . The client device  may comprise, for example, a processor-based system such as a computer system. Such a computer system may be embodied in the form of a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a personal digital assistant, a cellular telephone, a set-top box, a music player, a video player, a media player, a web pad, a tablet computer system, a game console, or other devices with like capability.","The client device  may be configured to execute various client applications  such as a browser and other applications. The browser may be executed in a client device , for example, to access and render network pages, such as web pages, or other network content served up by the computing device . For example, the browser may be used to interact with the merchant site designer application . The client device  may be configured to execute applications  beyond browser such as, for example, email applications, instant message applications, and\/or other applications.","Next, a general description of the operation of the various components of the networked environment  is provided. To begin, a user interacts with the merchant site designer application  to create new or modify preexisting network pages , where the pages may be part of a network site . A network page  can take the form of sections comprised of individual components, with each section capable of including a text element, an image or graphic element, or interface elements (such as buttons, menus, etc.). The user interacts with the merchant site designer application  to edit the text, image, hypertext link, and interface elements within a section or to make other modifications to the page or sections within the page. The user can also interact with the trial experiment component  to set up a trial experiment on modifications made to page layout or content for a newly modified page. As an example, the user can specify via trial experiment tools which elements are to be evaluated, which metrics are to be generated, and what visiting users or customers are to be subject to the experiment.","In some embodiments, the network site  operates as an electronic commerce marketplace. In such embodiments, a designer may design or modify network pages for customers to a retail environment or may design or modify network pages intended for sellers in the retail environment. In other embodiments, the network pages may be intended for a different environment and the merchant site designer application  may still be applicable.","In one embodiment, the merchant site designer application  presents a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) interface, so that changes to the layout of a network page  appear immediately within a layout view of the merchant site designer application . The merchant site designer application  generates layout code describing the network page . The layout code may include, for example, hypertext markup language (HTML), dynamic HTML, cascading style sheets (CSS), server side scripting, client side scripting, and other forms of layout code. The merchant site designer application  may validate the layout code to ensure that it conforms to one or more standards.","FIGS.  and - show user interface screens that can be generated by an embodiment of the merchant site designer application  (). In , the depicted user interface screen  can be rendered by a browser executing in a client device  () in the networked environment  () according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. Alternatively, the merchant site designer application  may be an installed application at the client  or may be installed at multiple computing devices including client  and computing device .","The user interface screen  includes a representation of a blank network page within the merchant site designer application  having a grid  of anchor points that can be selected and configured to add or edit page elements. The area to the bottom right of a selected anchor point is the area to which a page element may be added or modified. Accordingly,  shows anchor point A and the corresponding area AREA that is to the bottom right of the anchor point A. In this area, a page element may be added by configuring the anchor point A. Further, the area may be expanded to encompass surrounding areas by selecting an appropriate tool offered in the user interface, such as a resize option. Further, if a particular anchor point is configured to add a page element that requires more area than that immediately provided below and to the right of the anchor point, then the area may be automatically expanded to include surrounding areas not currently located with page elements, if possible. For example, in the figure, anchor point A is selected by a user (e.g., right clicking on the anchor point A using a mouse control) which causes a graphical menu  to be shown, whereby the user selects to add a widget interface from a list of possible choices. In this example, the user selects a management widget  from a list of possible widget choices.","Therefore, various embodiments of the merchant site designer application  allow for preloaded widgets to be used in designing a network page\/site, such as widgets to add text or scripts, create custom menu bars, to add an image, to add specific categories of products, embed Flash files, etc. Accordingly, widgets may be dragged and dropped onto a representation of a network page to quickly enhance the appearance of the page. Further, via the user interface of the merchant site designer application , changes may be previewed before being published to a visiting user. Also, the merchant site designer application  can validate updates and changes to ensure that a modification complies with a syntax specified by a page language and can be rendered, as desired.","In this fashion, a user may design a network page, such as the one shown in . In this network page , the management widget  has been added. In general, the network page , in this example, corresponds to a network page used by respective sellers to a retail environment to manage operation of their retail stores. While the network page  features individual page elements, such as E, E, E, controls may be provided within the merchant site designer application  () to select multiple elements and group them together as a single group of elements (e.g., Group A). Therefore, upon selecting an individual element in the group, the group of elements as a whole will be selected, and can be modified, moved, dragged, etc. collectively.","Referring now to , multiple groups of page elements can therefore be formed and represented in a user interface of the merchant site designer application  (). In this figure, the dashed boxes represent a group of elements that comprise one or more page elements. Accordingly, in the same way an anchor point can be selected, a group of page elements may be selected and a control may be executed to modify the group of page elements. Therefore, via the user interface, a selected group is configured to allow editing of page elements associated with the group. As an example, the order of elements can be rearranged in a group or the order of groups on the network page may be adjusted.","Therefore, using the merchant site designer application , a website or a network page can be modified inline. For example, a designer may click an anchor point or click on a preexisting page element and choose to add or replace the element with a predefined widget element or another page element, such as text block, image, link, etc.","Embodiments of the merchant site designer application  provide controls (e.g., by right clicking a mouse control or selecting from a tool area or bar in the user interface) to make changes to individual sections. For example, in one embodiment, the user can insert or change an image in a section or edit properties of an existing image. Similarly, in one embodiment, the user can insert or change text in a section or edit properties of existing text. Additionally, the user can insert or change a hyperlink in a section or edit the hyperlink, in one embodiment. Also, embodiments of the merchant site designer application  generate code which captures the layout of the network page  () as modified by the merchant site designer application . In one embodiment, the user may view this code and view the layout, respectively.","As stated above, the merchant site designer application  allows the designer to change a layout with an initial section configuration to another. Interface tools are also provided to select navigation or selection controls, in one embodiment. Referring now to , in a displayed network page, sections comprising an individual page element or group of page elements may be depicted. Therefore, a designer may select a particular section  (e.g., graphically clicking the particular section) which may cause an edit box  to popup for the section.","In one embodiment, the edit box  contains the page elements featured in the section, and selection of a particular page element causes a box  to be displayed with modifiable values or content for the element that can be edited or adjusted by the designer. Further, options may be provided for alternative representations of the element. For example, the present section of a network page may use a dropdown menu interface element and options may be provided to replace the dropdown menu element with another interface element, such as a list menu element or a combo box element. Also, ordering of tabs in a navigation control or toolbar may be capable of being changed or the designation of tabs may be capable of being modified. As an additional example, elements in one menu element may be moved to another menu element. The edit box may also provide a list of widgets that can be added, where a selected widget may be further configured in accordance with the designer's preferences. In general, a variety of graphical user interface elements may be offered to the designer via the merchant site designer application  (), such as buttons including check boxes and radio buttons, sliders, list boxes, spinners, drop-down lists, menus including context menus and pie menus, menu bars, toolbars, combo boxes (text boxes with attached menu or list box), icons, tree views, grid views, tab navigation controls, scrollbars, text boxes, labels, tooltips, balloons, status bars, progress bars, infobars, widgets, etc.","Various embodiments of the merchant site designer application  provide a capability (e.g., may have a button control) to split a screen into two (or more) panes where one pane shows a base or default view of a network page or site and the other pane shows an experiment view having a copy of the base\/default view with access to the anchor points and\/or sections that allow the designer to modify the layout of the page\/site. Referring back to , an exemplary representation of a split screen interface provided by an embodiment of the merchant site designer application  () is shown. The left side  of the screen depicts the base view of a network page and the right side  depicts an experiment view of the network page, where layout of the page may be changed by the designer under the experiment view. The experimental view provides for the designer to make alterations to the network page shown in the left pane and create a new version of the page in the right pane. This allows for the designer to see multiple user interfaces or network pages at the same time.","Consider the following illustrative example. Visiting users for a retail establishment may have multiple accounts, such as a seller account, a publisher account, a buyer account, etc. Accordingly, when the visiting user logs into a user interface using his or her seller account, then the visitor may be provided the seller portal referred here as \u201cSeller Central.\u201d Otherwise, the visitor may log into the user interface with his or her publisher account and then be provided a publisher interface such as a tool for specifying content for a book (that is for sale) to be accessible by other visiting users in a preview mode. Also, a visiting user may have an account to a retail establishment in a role as a buyer.","In the base view  provided on the left, a dropdown menu interface control  is provided to allow the visiting user to switch between user accounts. In the experiment view on the right, this page element has been selected or more particularly, the group  containing this page element has been selected and a menu  is provided as a result from which one of the page elements in the group  can be highlighted. In this particular illustration, the dropdown menu has been selected and a second box  is provided with the dropdown menu choice and other possible menu choices. Here, the list box option  is selected to replace the dropdown menu in the experiment view .","Accordingly,  shows a representation of the split screen with the base view  on the left (having the dropdown menu ) and the experiment view on the right  (having the list box ). With the list box , the multiple user accounts are visible at all time and in addition, text  has been added next to the box to \u201cSelect User Account.\u201d Whereas, on the base view , there is no explanatory text and it may not be readily apparent that the user can switch user accounts by clicking on the arrow that is part of the dropdown menu  causing a menu to drop down and allowing the user to toggle between user accounts. In this situation, it may be useful to implement a trial process to compare interactions with the two versions of the network page to see which one works better.","Embodiments of the merchant site designer application  () allow the designer to specify a trial experiment for a modified page section or for the entirety of the page. After a user has defined a page layout, the designer can set up the trial experiment for the entire page or set up one or more trial experiments for individual sections. Using the merchant site designer application , new website features may be activated for a statistical sample of users, in one embodiment.","Referring now to , exemplary user interface controls for setting up a trial experiment are shown. In , a menu  is provided that lists the option  to \u201cSet Up Experiment,\u201d where this option was not selected in . However, with respect to , this menu  is illustrated (apart from underlying the user interface) and the option to \u201cSet Up Experiment\u201d is selected. In response to selecting the option, another menu  is launched which allows the designer to specify whether a trial experiment is to be set up for an individual element or group of elements or for the entire network page. Here, the option  to specify a trial experiment for the entire network page is selected. In response to this option, a dialog or popup box  may be presented with additional options that can be configured for the experiment being set up, including defining an audience for the experiment, defining a metric for evaluating the experiment, setting a failsafe, and setting a duration for the trial experiment.","Therefore, a user may set up the experiment to be provided to a particular set of visiting users and for the base\/default view of the network page to be provided to a different set of visiting users. Thus, some people will get one version of the interface or page and other people will get a different version of the interface or page. As an example, an experiment view may be selected to be shown to 30% of visiting users in an interface box , whereby the remaining 70% can be selected to be shown the default network page, as demonstrated in interface box .","Also, in some embodiments, a user may specify nesting values for modified page elements. As an example, a user may specify that 10% of the total number of visiting users should view experimental page elements, whereby a new navigation control is set to be shown to 50% of the available visiting users and a new widget control is set to be shown to 60% of the available visiting users, where the available visiting users is 10% of the total visiting users. Embodiments of the merchant site designer application  () may therefore allow the designer to see two different versions of a web page side by side and then also let the designer to assign which bucket or group of users see the modified page versus which users are actually going to get to see the default page. Further, various embodiments provide for multiple experimental views to be provided to a sample of visiting users. Accordingly, a first modified user interface or page may be provided to a first sample of users and a second modified user interface or page may be provided to a second sample of users. Also, the baseline or unmodified user interface or page may be provided to a third sample of users. By considering the results from different metrics or tests for each of the samples, it may be possible to identify characteristics or particular elements which tend to produce the top results.","In one embodiment, a repeating visiting user is maintained in the same class as in an earlier visit if the same trial experiment is ongoing. However, there may be exceptions. For example, a rule may be implemented specifying that a visiting user that is part of the sample class for the test or modified interface is not succeeding in the trial experiment, then the visitor may be moved out of the test class in a subsequent visit. Similarly, a rule may also be implemented specifying that a visitor that is part of the sample class for the baseline is not succeeding in the trial experiment, then the visitor may be moved out of the baseline sample class into the test class in a subsequent visit. Such rules may be set up to be enforced only in unique circumstances, since moving of users in and out of sample classes affect the statistical significance of trial experiment being conducted (although it may alleviate user frustrations).","In designating which visiting users are to access a test page or interface, in addition to specifying a percentage, one may also designate specific user-IDs or designate user groups or classes. As an example, within a retail environment, sellers may be grouped into different classes (e.g., individual sellers, home-based sellers, medium-sized businesses, large corporations, etc.) and may have names such as silver, gold, platinum, etc. Accordingly, a network page may be modified and targeted towards a segment of the gold sellers and compared against how another segment of the gold sellers (or some other class\/group) performs with a default network page. Similarly, customers or buyers may be grouped into different classes of visiting users (e.g., casual users that buy a small amount of products, prime or preferred customers that buy a lot of products, select customers that buy a certain class of goods, such as groceries, etc.)","In addition to designating users for a trial experiment, the merchant site designer application  allows users to specify a metric to be used to track success of the experiment. For example, a uniform resource locator (URL) for a network page may be designated, whereby the merchant site designer application  can track how often the URL is requested responsive to visiting the default network page and the modified network page. Accordingly, a request for retrieval of a network page at the URL may signify a successful result. In one possible scenario, the network page may comprise an interface for a user to enter his or her shipping address. A successful completion of the shipping address will cause a confirmation page to be displayed at the user's web browser. An incomplete completion of the shipping address will cause an error notification message to be displayed. Therefore, the designer can configure the merchant site designer application  to track how often the confirmation page is served responsive to the network page comprising the interface being served.","Accordingly, the merchant site designer application  may provide an option to display a report or table of how the experiment is progressing or has progressed.  shows an exemplary illustration of such a report . For example, in a default or baseline layout of the interface, 82% of visiting users in a sample class may be found to have successfully completed the task. But on the other hand, for an experimental interface, the wording or other page element may have been changed and as a result, 90% of the visiting users in a sample class succeed in completing the task. Interestingly, both the experimental interface and the default interface may be implemented at the same time against a stream of users. Further, in some embodiments, more than one metric may be tracked. For example, the number of visiting users that cancel out of the interface and do not attempt to submit a shipping address could be tracked. Alternatively, as shown in the figure, a metric for visiting users that abandon the task is tracked. In the figure, 3% of visiting users of the default interface abandon the task and 1% of visiting users of the experimental interface abandon the task. The report interface  may show a current status of the experiment, such as an amount of time the experiment is set to run, and may include options to terminate the trial experiment upon command or to extend the timeline for the trial experiment.","In addition, one embodiment of the merchant site designer application  () allows for a designer to set up or define how long the trial experiment is to be active. A designer can click on a date and time to start the experiment, can specify a length of time to run the experiment, and\/or specify an end date for the trial experiment. Alternatively, a designer may specify that the experiment is to be deactivated after a total number of hits or visitors access the experiment. Therefore, an experiment may be set to end in accordance with a time limit or a quantity limit. Also, in some embodiments, a failsafe can be set to deactivate a trial experiment upon occurrence of a specified condition. For example, a designer may specify the condition to be a metric that tracks that the experiment falls below 20% of the default or baseline after a designated length of time. In this situation, the experiment is deactivated and all visiting users will be directed to the default network page. Conversely, in some embodiments, a rule can be set to continue a trial experiment passed a scheduled expiration date when a metric for the experiment succeeds or performs better than a designated threshold value.","In some embodiments, certain features of the merchant site designer application  may be exposed to classes of visiting users, such as sellers. Therefore, a seller may modify a layout of network pages representing the seller's store and set up a trial experiment to test the modified layout. Similarly, aspects of the merchant site designer application  may be exposed to other users in different environments besides the retail context.","Additionally, before publishing or exposing a modified layout to visiting users, embodiments of the merchant site designer application  integrate an approval system where another entity is to approve publication and\/or testing of a modified interface\/page by a respective designer. Therefore, a list of approvers for a particular interface\/page may be configured, where after a designer configures a trial experiment, one or more approvers from the list are needed to approve the trial experiment (via an interface of the merchant site designer application ) before the experiment is placed in production.","Referring next to , shown is a flowchart that provides one example of the operation of a portion of the merchant site designer application  () according to various embodiments. It is understood that the flowchart of  provides merely an example of the many different types of functional arrangements that may be employed to implement the operation of the portion of the merchant site designer application  as described herein. As an alternative, the flowchart of  may be viewed as depicting an example of steps of a method implemented in the computing device  () according to one or more embodiments.","Beginning with box , the merchant site designer application  presents a graphical interface to edit a layout of a network page and, in box , the merchant site designer application  receives a selection of parameters to a trial experiment of one or more modifications made to the layout of the network page in the graphical interface. Next, in box , the merchant site designer application  directs the network page designed in the graphical interface to be administered to a first target or sample class of users identified by a designer (e.g., a user operating the merchant site designer application ). Therefore, in box , the merchant site designer application  tracks at least one metric for the network page designed in the graphical interface based on interactions with the first target or sample class of users.","Turning now to , shown is another example of the operation of a portion of the merchant site designer application  () according to various embodiments. Beginning with box , the merchant site designer application  () presents, in conjunction with presentation of a network page in a first graphical pane, a graphical interface to edit a layout of the network page in at least one separate graphical pane. Next, in box , the merchant site designer application  receives a user selection of parameters to a trial experiment of one or more modifications made to the layout of the network page in the separate graphical pane(s). In particular, the trial experiment specifies that the network page designed in the separate graphical pane(s) is available to a first target or sample class of users. Therefore, in box , the merchant site designer application  causes a modified version of the network page to be administered to the first target class of users and tracks at least one metric for the network page designed in the separate graphical pane(s) based on interactions with the first target class of users. In box , the merchant site designer application  receives a user selection of parameters to the trial experiment with respect to a second version of the network page (e.g., an unmodified version or a different modified version) specifying that the second version of the network page is to be made available to a second target class of users (which is mutually exclusive from the first target class). As a result, the merchant site designer application  causes the second version of the network page to be administered to the second target class of users and tracks the metric(s) for the second version of the network page based on interactions with the second target class of users, in box . Then, in box , the merchant site designer application  generates a report on occurrences of the metric(s) with respect to the network page designed in the separate graphical pane(s) and with respect to the second version of the network page.","Moving on to , shown is a schematic block diagram of the computing device  according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The computing device  includes at least one processor circuit, for example, having a processor  and a memory , both of which are coupled to a local interface . To this end, the computing device  may comprise, for example, at least one server computer or like device. The local interface  may comprise, for example, a data bus with an accompanying address\/control bus or other bus structure as can be appreciated.","Stored in the memory  are both data and several components that are executable by the processor . In particular, stored in the memory  and executable by the processor  are the merchant site designer application , the trial experiment component , the network page server application , and potentially other applications. Also stored in the memory  may be a data store  and other data. In addition, an operating system may be stored in the memory  and executable by the processor . While not illustrated, the client device  also includes components like those shown in , whereby the browser  is stored in a memory and executable by a processor.","It is understood that there may be other applications that are stored in the memory  and are executable by the processor  as can be appreciated. Where any component discussed herein is implemented in the form of software, any one of a number of programming languages may be employed such as, for example, C, C++, C#, Objective C, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Visual Basic, Python, Ruby, Delphi, Flash, or other programming languages.","A number of software components are stored in the memory  and are executable by the processor . In this respect, the term \u201cexecutable\u201d means a program file that is in a form that can ultimately be run by the processor . Examples of executable programs may be, for example, a compiled program that can be translated into machine code in a format that can be loaded into a random access portion of the memory  and run by the processor , source code that may be expressed in proper format such as object code that is capable of being loaded into a random access portion of the memory  and executed by the processor , or source code that may be interpreted by another executable program to generate instructions in a random access portion of the memory  to be executed by the processor , etc. An executable program may be stored in any portion or component of the memory  including, for example, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), hard drive, solid-state drive, USB flash drive, memory card, optical disc such as compact disc (CD) or digital versatile disc (DVD), floppy disk, magnetic tape, or other memory components.","The memory  is defined herein as including both volatile and nonvolatile memory and data storage components. Volatile components are those that do not retain data values upon loss of power. Nonvolatile components are those that retain data upon a loss of power. Thus, the memory  may comprise, for example, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), hard disk drives, solid-state drives, USB flash drives, memory cards accessed via a memory card reader, floppy disks accessed via an associated floppy disk drive, optical discs accessed via an optical disc drive, magnetic tapes accessed via an appropriate tape drive, and\/or other memory components, or a combination of any two or more of these memory components. In addition, the RAM may comprise, for example, static random access memory (SRAM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), or magnetic random access memory (MRAM) and other such devices.

In such a case, the local interface  may be an appropriate network  () that facilitates communication between any two of the multiple processors , between any processor  and any of the memories , or between any two of the memories , etc. The local interface  may comprise additional systems designed to coordinate this communication, including, for example, performing load balancing. The processor  may be of electrical or of some other available construction.","Although the merchant site designer application  and other various systems described herein may be embodied in software or code executed by general purpose hardware as discussed above, as an alternative the same may also be embodied in dedicated hardware or a combination of software\/general purpose hardware and dedicated hardware. If embodied in dedicated hardware, each can be implemented as a circuit or state machine that employs any one of or a combination of a number of technologies.
