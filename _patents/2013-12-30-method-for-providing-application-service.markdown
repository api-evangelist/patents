A mobile phone application is application software running on the mobile phone. The application software implements various functions of the mobile phone through an API (Application Programming Interface, application programming interface) extended from an underlayer of the mobile phone. Usually, this mobile phone application has two ways: off-line application and online application. After application startup, the offline application does not need network support any longer and runs independently at a mobile phone terminal. The online application requires network interaction, and cannot run independently if departing from a network environment.","In the existing online applications, a user mobile phone is connected with a WAPGW (Wireless Application Protocol Gateway, wireless application protocol gateway) through a wireless network, and then is accessed into Internet through the wireless application protocol gateway. The wireless application protocol gateway can only perform simple management operations, for example: target service shielding. Moreover, some online applications can directly access the Internet through switching an access point, and bypassing the wireless application protocol gateway.","The prior art at least has the following problems: the wireless application protocol gateway only provides a network channel for accessing the application of the wireless terminal. During access, the security of an application server is very poor during accessing. The application server only uses a simple password authentication to authenticate the user mobile phone currently, which does not have strong security. Moreover, the user needs to enter a password for each access service, which is inconvenient to use, and causes poor user experience.","The embodiments of the present invention provide a method for providing application service, wireless application protocol gateway and system, which can reduce the workload of an application server, improve security and experience of users.","An embodiment of the present invention provides a method for providing application service, comprising:\n\n","An embodiment of the present invention provides a wireless application protocol gateway, comprising:\n\n","An embodiment of the present invention provides a network system, comprising:\n\n","the sending unit is configured to provide the application service obtained from the application server, to the user mobile phone.","According to the method for providing application service in the embodiments of the invention, a user is authenticated according to a received application service acquisition request from a user mobile phone, and when the user authentication is passed, the application service acquisition request is sent to an application server, so that the application server provides application service to the user mobile phone according to the application service acquisition request. The application server does not need to authenticate the user mobile phone by performing an authentication operation on the user mobile phone through a wireless application protocol gateway, thus being capable of reducing the workload of the application server. In addition, the user registers first fingerprint data to the wireless application protocol gateway. The wireless application protocol gateway acquires an encrypted fingerprint template of the user and an encryption key KEY corresponding to the encrypted fingerprint template. The wireless application protocol gateway generates security authentication data for the encryption key by using the first fingerprint data to conceal the encryption key, so that the encryption key is protected more rigorously. During authentication, the security authentication data is decrypted to obtain the encryption key by using second fingerprint data of the user, and the encrypted fingerprint template is decrypted to obtain a fingerprint template by using the encryption key, so that an authentication process is more secure and reliable. Moreover, the user is only required to input fingerprints on a touch screen of the mobile phone, which improves experience of the user.","To illustrate the advantages of the technical solutions of the invention more clearly, the following introduces the invention in details with reference to the attached drawings and embodiments.","The embodiment provides a method for providing an application service.
