title: Analysis of message service provider quality of service
abstract: A Short Message Service (“SMS”) provider's quality of service, such as SMS transmission latency and/or success rate, is measured based on collected event data. A notification service initiates SMS message transmissions which are sent through an SMS provider and a carrier before reaching a mobile service on a mobile device. Each SMS message includes a unique identifier. The notification service creates send events recording when each SMS message was sent. The mobile service creates receipt events recording when each received SMS message was received. By determining how many sent messages are received, and aggregated time differences between messages being sent and received, quality of service information can be determined. In some embodiments, quality of service information is determined on a per-SMS provider basis, and/or on a per-location basis.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Short Message Service (\u201cSMS\u201d) is a widespread standard for text-based communication. SMS communication uses text messages, each of up to 160 text characters in length, which are sent to a particular target address, such as a phone number associated with a mobile phone. Devices and services other than mobile phones are also capable of sending and receiving SMS messages. Additionally, SMS messages may be sent by broadcast to a number of recipients. SMS messages are used for a variety of purposes, including personal communication, social media, news, advertising and alerts.","SMS providers offer services for the delivery of SMS messages, such as to mobile devices connected to cellular networks. Examples SMS providers include MX Telecom and OpenMarket. For example, an SMS provider may provide services for bulk, recurring and\/or automated delivery of SMS messages. SMS providers may act as SMS gateways, allowing services and systems other than mobile phones to send SMS messages to mobile phones. For example, an SMS provider may allow its customers to communicate with it over an electronic network in order to submit requests for the delivery of SMS messages.","The final step in SMS delivery to some mobile phones involves the transmission of the SMS message from a cellular tower on a mobile network to which the mobile phone is connected. Therefore, the ability to send SMS messages to many different mobile phones may involve communication with each of the mobile phones' respective mobile carriers. An SMS provider may act an aggregator where the SMS provider has contracts with a number of mobile carriers. The SMS provider may have access to each contracted mobile carrier's SMS Center, which allows the SMS provider to send and\/or receive SMS traffic into and out of the mobile carrier's network. An SMS provider may then sell services which allow its customers to send SMS messages to mobile phones on a variety of networks through a single contract with the SMS provider.","Often, an SMS provider's involvement with SMS delivery ends at the SMS provider's interface with a mobile carrier. The SMS provider may be unable to track whether an SMS message that it sends to the mobile carrier is ultimately received by the intended mobile device recipient, and if so, what latency was associated with the SMS transmission. As this quality of service information may be unavailable to the SMS provider, the SMS provider may be unable to provide quality of service information to its customers. A customer may wish to know the quality of the service that it is paying an SMS provider for. For example, by comparing quality of service information for different SMS providers, customers may be able to make more informed decisions in their selection of SMS providers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","130","140","102","160","280","280"]},"The notification service  initiates the transmission of the SMS message  and creates a send event record  which includes a unique identifier  for that SMS message and the time at which the SMS message transmission began . The SMS message is ultimately received by the mobile service  running on the recipient's mobile phone. The mobile service  determines that the received SMS message  is related to the quality of service measurement by identifying an instruction  contained within the SMS message . The mobile service records the time at which it received the SMS message . This time is placed in a receipt event  which also includes the SMS message's unique identifier .","In the present embodiment, both the notification service's send events  and the mobile service's receipt events  are transmitted to a storage service  which stores the recorded events . This allows for a later analysis of the recorded events  in order to determine the SMS provider's quality of service. For example, by determining what percent of send events share a unique identifier with a receipt event, the SMS provider's success rate can be determined. As another example, a SMS transmission's latency can be determined by calculating the difference between a receipt event's  receipt time  and the send time  stored in a send event  having the same unique identifier  as the receipt event . By aggregating and analyzing a number of these send\/receipt pairs, more accurate latency data can be determined, such as mean and\/or median latency for the SMS provider.","As illustrated in , the process of transmitting an SMS message  from the notification service  to the intended recipient includes multiple steps. The notification service  issues an SMS command  to the SMS provider . The SMS command  may take the form of a software-based instruction, such as a function call to an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) of the SMS provider. As another example, the SMS command  may be a message sent to the SMS provider by any of a variety of protocols, standards, and\/or computer-based languages such as HTTP, XML, JavaScript, and others. It will be understood that all transmissions described herein may use one or more of these or other protocols, standards, or languages and that descriptions of specific embodiments are in no way limiting.","The SMS command  includes the contents of the SMS message , including the intended recipient , the SMS message's identifier , and an instruction . The recipient  may be specified by a phone number. The instruction  may be a specific string of characters indicating that the SMS message  corresponds to the measurement of quality of service. This may help to avoid mistaking other messages for quality of service messages, and vice versa. In other embodiments, one or more of these components may be omitted from the SMS message  and\/or the SMS command . For example, an instruction metric  may be omitted. The mobile service which receives the SMS message without an instruction metric may, for example, record all incoming SMS messages or may determine whether the received SMS message is associated with quality of service measurement through some other means.","In the embodiment of , the notification service  creates a send event  after sending the SMS command to the SMS provider . The send event  includes the unique identifier of the SMS message  and the time at which the notification service  transmitted the SMS command  containing the SMS message . As will be explained in further detail below, in other embodiments the send event  includes a time relating to some other event during the transmission of the SMS message . The send time  may be stored in any of a variety of formats. For example, it may be stored in YYYY:MM:DD:HH:MM:SS:micro second format, in epoc time in milliseconds, or in any of time format. Furthermore, it will be understood that storing an item may occur by storing data derived from that item, such as a hash value. For example, another embodiment may store a hash value of the identifier  rather than the identifier  in its initial format.","According to the present example, the notification service  transmits the send event  to the storage service . As has been described, such transmissions between components may use any of a variety of protocols, standards, and\/or languages. The storage service  receives the send event and stores it in a data store of recorded events . The data store  may use any of a variety of storage techniques and\/or standards, including a relational database such as SQL, a flat file, and\/or a table.","In the described embodiment, the SMS provider  receives the SMS command  sent from the notification service  and, in response, sends an SMS request  to a carrier . The carrier may be a cellular network carrier such as AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon, Orange, China Mobile, or SingTel. Carriers other than cellular network carriers are also envisioned, as the SMS standard is not restricted to cellular network uses. The SMS request  includes the information specific to the SMS message being transmitted , including the recipient , the instruction  and the identification . In the present example, the instruction  and identification  are included as contents of the maximum 160 text character SMS message while the recipient  is used to describe where the SMS message is to be sent. The SMS provider may interface with a plurality of carriers and may determine which carrier to send the SMS request  to based on the recipient included in the received SMS command . For example, the SMS provider may use a lookup service or table to determine which cellular network a particular phone number is associated with. In most circumstances, the carrier  should transmit the SMS message  to the recipient after receiving the SMS provider's  SMS request .","According to the embodiment of , the SMS message is received by a mobile service  on the recipient's mobile phone. In one embodiment, the mobile service  is an application running in the background of a mobile device's operating system, such as Google's Android, Apple's iOS, or Microsoft's Windows Phone OS. The mobile service  may act as a daemon listening for events and responding to them. When the mobile device receives a SMS message, the mobile service  may determine whether the message relates to quality of service measurement. For example, the mobile service  may look for an instruction  within the received SMS message . If the SMS message is determined to relate to SMS transmission quality analysis, the mobile service  creates a receipt event . The receipt event includes the unique identifier found in the received SMS message . The receipt event may also include the time  at which the mobile service  and\/or a device which the mobile service  is resident upon received the SMS message . As with time recorded for a send event , this receipt event time entry  may be of any of a variety of formats.","The mobile service  transmits the receipt event  to the storage service . The storage service  stores the receipt events  within a data store for recorded events . While the present embodiment illustrates both receipt events  and send events  being transmitted to and stored by the same storage service , in another embodiment the different types of events are transmitted to and stored by separate storage services. Additionally or alternatively, multiple storage services may be used to store one or both types of events. The storage service  or some other service may then make the recorded events  available for analysis.","Referring to , an embodiment of a system capable of performing the method described in  is shown.  shows one possible arrangement of many of the components discussed above in reference to . For example, messaging services and storage  are shown which include a notification service , a storage service  and a recorded events data store . In one embodiment these three components are contained on common computer hardware, such as a server. In another embodiment, these components are distributed across different hardware, and\/or are provided in a cloud-based manner.","The notification service  is shown in communication with the storage service , for example in order to send send events to the storage service . The storage service  communicates with the recorded events data store  in order to store events. The notification service is also in communication with a network , such as the Internet. The notification service  may communicate with the SMS provider  through the network . The SMS provider is in communication with a carrier . In one embodiment, this communication utilizes a network, such as the Internet, which may be the same network which the notification service  uses to communicate with the SMS provider . In another embodiment, another communication path is used between the SMS provider  and the carrier .","The carrier  is connected to a mobile network , for example the carrier may be a cellular telecommunications carrier which operates a mobile cellular phone network and uses that network to transmit SMS messages to mobile devices connected to the network. In another embodiment, the carrier  is able to transmit SMS messages to mobile devices on other mobile networks, for example through roaming agreements with other carriers. This allows a SMS message transmitted to the carrier by an SMS provider to reach its intended recipient even if that recipient is then connected to another carrier's mobile network. This situation may result in increased latency and\/or decreased success rate of the SMS transmission.","The present embodiment includes the mobile service  operating on a mobile device . The mobile service  may include software written in any of a number of computer languages, for example Java, JavaScript, C#, C++, and\/or HTML5. The mobile device  may comprise any of a variety of hardware elements, such as those found within modern smartphones such as the HTC EVO, the Samsung Galaxy, the Applie iPhone, the HTC Trophy, and the Nokia N97. Additionally or alternatively, mobile devices other than modern smartphones may be used. For example, a feature phone may include a version of the mobile service  designed to function on the feature phone's resources. In another embodiment, a tablet device or laptop computer is used as the mobile device  and an appropriate version of the mobile service  is used on that device. In another embodiment, the mobile service  is used in connection with the mobile device  but is not installed or running on the mobile device . For example, the mobile service  may be provided in a distributed, hosted, cloud-based, and\/or web-based manner.","In the illustrated embodiment, the mobile service  may operate, for example, as a background agent, daemon, application and\/or process on the mobile device and act upon SMS messages received by the mobile device . The mobile service  is in communication with a network  through which it is able to send receipt events to the storage service . Although  shows the mobile service  as connected directly to the network , in practice the mobile service may access the network  through the mobile network . In other situations and\/or embodiments, the mobile service uses other communications paths to communicate with the storage service . For example, the mobile device may use a 3G or 4G cellular data connection or an 802.11 Wi-Fi data connection in communicating with the storage service . In another example, the mobile service  may transmit the receipt event as an SMS message. The mobile service  may cache the receipt events before transmitting them. For example, the mobile device  may not always be connected to a network and the mobile service  may transmit stored receipt events once the opportunity arises to do so.","Although certain embodiments are described using terminology for particular types of devices, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to any of these specific embodiments. For example, a mobile service need not be on a mobile phone. It could alternatively or additionally be on a device such as a computer, tablet, or other personal electronic device capable of receiving SMS messages. Furthermore the disclosed methods are also applicable to other messaging standards, including Multimedia Message Service (\u201cMMS\u201d) and other messaging standards presently in existence and\/or which may be used in the future. The use of the term \u201cSMS\u201d in no way limits the applicability of the invention to determining quality of service for other messaging protocols.","Referring next to , another embodiment of a method for determining a SMS provider's quality of service is illustrated. Many of the components and steps are in common with those described in . The embodiment of  contains certain changes and additions to illustrate an alternate implementation. Many other implementations may be used within the scope of the invention. The SMS transmission process shown in  is initiated by a trigger service  which sends a trigger  to the notification service . In one embodiment, the trigger service  is software functioning on a cloud-based server system in order to send recurring trigger messages to the notification service . Such trigger events  may occur, for example, at regular or random intervals. The trigger event  may take the form of any message, such an API call to the notification service . In another embodiment, the trigger service alters the frequency of trigger events  in order to allow for the generation of SMS quality of service data representing a system under different load conditions.","As shown in , after the notification service  receives the trigger event , it transmits a SMS command  which is received by the SMS provider  (it will be understood that the term \u201cevent\u201d may be used either to describe an action or occurrence, or data representative of that action or occurrence). In the present embodiment, the SMS provider  transmits a command response to the notification service  in response to the SMS command . The command response  may indicate that the SMS provider  has transmitted an SMS request  to a carrier . The command response  may also include the time at which the SMS request was transmitted . The notification service  creates a send event which includes a time relating to the SMS provider's  transmission of the SMS request. In one embodiment, the send event time is contained in the command response . In another embodiment, the send event time is the time that the command response  was received by the notification service . In another embodiment, the carrier sends a confirmation to the SMS provider when the SMS has been transmitted and the SMS provider sends a command response which includes that time of transmission by the carrier . It will be appreciated that, even in such a circumstance where a carrier provides confirmation that an SMS message has been transmitted, it may still be helpful to confirm receipt of the SMS message through use of a mobile service  as this provides full end-to-end transmission confirmation.","The mobile service  of  includes time-synchronizing functionality. The mobile service  may update a clock which is internal to the mobile service  and\/or the mobile device upon which the mobile service  operates. In the present embodiment, the mobile service  communicates with a time service  in order to update this clock. The time service may be a Network Time Protocol (\u201cNTP\u201d) server, such as the public NTP server offered by the Untied States Naval Observatory. The mobile service  may request the time  from the time service , which in response should send the time  to the mobile service , for example using NTP. In one embodiment, the mobile service performs periodic time requests ,  in order to keep its time updated by receiving multiple time updates , . In some embodiments, the notification service  performs similar time updating functionality so that its associated clock or clocks are also accurate, for example by synching to the same time service  as the mobile service  syncs to. In some embodiments, the mobile service  and\/or notification service  may communicate with a pool of time services  representing different NTP servers. This may provide for increased time accuracy, for example by averaging the times reported from the different servers. Additionally or alternatively, the mobile service may update its time using a time request  and resulting time receipt  after receiving an SMS message . Time-synchronizing functionality, such as the embodiments described, may increase the accuracy of the determination of SMS transmission quality of service because small clock inaccuracies could skew resulting quality of service data. The mobile service  may use its relatively accurate, synchronized clock when it stores the receipt time in a receipt event. The notification service may perform similar functionality in providing for the accuracy of the send times stored in send events. Additionally or alternatively, clock accuracy may be provided by one or more of the systems upon which the notification service and\/or mobile service operate. For example, the notification service may refer to the clock of an operating system upon which it resides and that operating system may be responsible for keeping its clock accurate using NTP.","In the present embodiment, the mobile service  transmits receipt events as contents of transmitted SMS receipt instructions . An SMS receipt instruction may include an SMS receipt event and other information, such as instructions on where the receipt event is to be delivered or the time it is to be queued. After receiving an SMS message and creating a corresponding receipt event and an SMS receipt instruction related to that receipt event, the mobile service  transmits the SMS receipt instruction  to a queue service . The queue service  of the present embodiment is a cloud based hosted queue service to store messages as they travel between the mobile service and the notification service. This provides flexibility because the notification service does not need to retrieve the receipt events until it is ready to do so. At the same time, the mobile service  is able to transmit a receipt event in the form of an SMS receipt instructions whenever it is prepared to do so. In other embodiments, alternate queue services may be used.","Upon receiving the SMS receipt instruction  transmitted by the mobile service , the queue service  stores them in a queued instruction data store . In this example, the notification service  periodically polls the queue service  for queue instructions . The queue service  responds by transmitting queued instructions  to the notification service . The queue service  may cease to store instructions after they have been transmitted. Upon receiving the instructions  from the queue service , the notification service  sends the receipt events contained within those instructions  to the storage service  for storage. In other embodiments, a service other than the notification service  performs the tasks of polling the queue service for instructions , receiving the instructions  and transmitting the associated receipt events  to the storage service .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["107","103","230","102","231","107","107"]},"In the embodiment illustrated in , only one SMS provider is shown. The system may rely on a single SMS provider for all SMS transmission, and may therefore associate all determined quality of service information with that SMS provider. In another embodiment, multiple SMS providers may be used. In some of these embodiments, the system may store data indicating which SMS provider was responsible for which SMS transmission. For example, each send record could record the identity of the SMS provider which the corresponding SMS command was sent to. When performing its analysis of recorded events , the analysis service  may thus create SMS transmission quality of service information for individual SMS providers. Relative comparisons may be performed between and amongst SMS providers' quality of service.","In some embodiments, location-specific quality of service information is gathered and analyzed. For example, the mobile device housing the mobile service  may contain global positioning satellite (\u201cGPS\u201d) hardware capable of providing the mobile device's location at the time that the SMS message was received. Other sources of location information may also be used, such as cellular tower triangulation or the location of the cellular tower which transmitted the SMS message to the mobile device. The mobile service  may include location-specific information in receipt events. The analysis service, upon gathering those receipt events, may classify latency and success rates based on recipient location. This may reveal that one SMS provider is more reliable in some regions than in other regions. A customer considering a variety of SMS providers may choose to rely on different SMS providers for the delivery of SMS messages to recipients expected to be in different regions based on this location-specific information.","Referring to , a system is illustrated which represents one embodiment capable of performing the method described for . The system in  includes a set of service and storage components , including a notification service , a storage service , a trigger service , a queue service , an analysis service , a recorded events data store  and a queued instructions data store . In the described embodiment, these components correspond to their equally numbered items discussed in the context of . The trigger service  is in communication with the notification service  in order to transmit trigger events to the notification service . The analysis service  is in communication with the storage service  in order to retrieve events stored within the recorded events data store . In other embodiments, the analysis service uses other means of obtaining the recorded events. In the illustrated embodiment, the queue service  is connected to a network , through which it receives SMS receipt instructions  from the mobile service . The queue service communicates with the queued instructions data store  in order to store and retrieve those instructions. The notification service  is in communication with the queue service , allowing the notification service  to poll the queue service  for the instructions then stored. In other embodiments, other means are used by the notification service  or other service to obtain the queued instructions from the data store .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["121","120","120"]},"The present embodiment includes a number of SMS providers: SMS Provider , , SMS Provider , , and SMS Provider , . There are also a number of carriers: Carrier A , Carrier B  and Carrier C . SMS Providers  and  are each connected to all three carriers, Carriers A, B and C, while SMS Provider  is only connected to some of the Carriers B and C. This may occur, for example, because SMS Provider  does not have a contract permitting it to interface with Carrier A. Each of the illustrated carriers is connected with its respective mobile network: Carrier A connected to Mobile Network A, Carrier B connected to Mobile Network B, and Carrier C connected to Mobile Network C. Each mobile network has a plurality of mobile devices connected to it which are running mobile services -. Each mobile network may also have mobile devices connected to it which are not running a mobile service.","Referring to , an example user interface  for a mobile service is shown. The mobile service includes status elements  which may be provided by the underlying operating system on the mobile device. These may include the mobile service or mobile device's current time , which may be updated through synching as described above and may be used in storing SMS receipt times in receipt events. Other status elements  include cellular signal strength  which may affect whether the mobile device and\/or the mobile service are able to obtain SMS messages from a carrier at a particular time. In some embodiments, a mobile service may record data related to its signal strength and such data may be used by an analysis service in evaluating an SMS provider's quality of service. For example, long delays which are attributed to a mobile lacking sufficient signal may not be held against the SMS provider. The mobile device may also include one or more data connections   , such as EVDO, LTE WiMAX, 802.11, Bluetooth, 3G cellular, 4G cellular or other network connections. This connection may be used in transmitting data to and from the mobile service, such as the transmission of receipt events from the mobile service to a queue service or storage service.","The present embodiment also includes an indicator that it has an active location-aware measurement . In the present example, this is accomplished by use of GPS hardware on the mobile device. The mobile service user interface may display the current location  and store related location information in receipt events so that location-specific quality of service analyses may be performed. For example, an analysis service may perform location-specific quality of service analyses and may do so based on aggregated event data associated with many different users. Location may be determined by one or more of a variety of factors or identifiers, such as ZIP code, cell phone tower, GPS-based location, geographic zone, etc. A database of such location-based quality of service data may be used for a variety of purposes and analyses. For example, a service may be used which queries the database and selects an SMS provider based on the contents of the database.","The illustrated mobile service interface  includes interface options to register  and deregister  the mobile service and\/or its associated mobile device from the notification system. For example, an embodiment may employ a number of mobile devices in order to gather data concerning SMS quality of service. The notification service includes a recipient for the SMS messages which it transmits. In some examples, the notification service transmits one or more SMS messages to a plurality of recipients. The notification service accesses data indicating the addresses of recipient mobile devices associated with the ongoing SMS quality of service testing. In the present embodiment, this data is populated through mobile services being registered with the system. For example, the user of a mobile device containing a mobile service may select the register button  within the mobile service user interface in order to register that mobile device with the system. This could cause the notification service to transmit SMS messages targeted for that mobile device. The mobile service interface also provides an option to deregister  the device and\/or service from the system. For example, the user may wish to cease receiving test messages.","The user interface shown in  also provides output displays of received SMS test messages . In this example, fields included in a received SMS test message are an identification  of the message relative to the number of messages received and\/or stored by the mobile service; the phone number of the SMS message's sender , the phone number of the SMS message's recipient , an instruction identifying the SMS message as a metric related to SMS quality of service testing ; the operating system underlying the mobile service as Android ; the body of the SMS message as including the unique identifier for the SMS message ; the time stamp at which the SMS message was received by the mobile service ; and the time of receipt converted into epoc milliseconds format . The interface also provides the user with the ability to ping the notification system , for example to test whether it can successfully communicate with the queue service or storage service.","In certain embodiments, quality of service information may be determined according to one or more other metrics. For example, quality of service could be determined for the type of network connection (e.g., 3G cellular data, 4G cellular data, CDMA, GSM, 802.11g, etc.) which a mobile device is using at the time that it receives an SMS message. The mobile service may record this network metric information in receipt events and the analysis service may calculate quality of service information on a per-network basis. As another example, mobile device operating system may be a recorded metric and quality of service information may be determined on a per-OS basis. The mobile service would record the operating system of the mobile device that received the SMS message in the corresponding receipt event and the analysis service could differentiate events accordingly.","Referring to , an example method is shown for sending SMS messages and transmitting records associated with those SMS message transmissions. For example, this method may be performed by a notification service. The process begins with receiving a trigger from a trigger service . In response, an SMS is sent to an SMS provider , for example in the form of an SMS command. It is determined whether a response was received from the SMS provider . If a response was received, a send event is generated based at least in part on the response . If a response was not received within a certain period of time, the method restarts to waiting for another trigger. After a send event has been generated, the send event is transmitted to a storage service  and the method restarts to waiting for another trigger.","Referring to , an example method is shown for receiving SMS messages and transmitting records associated with those SMS message receipts. For example, this method may be performed by a mobile service. The process begins with receiving an SMS message from a carrier . It is determined whether the SMS message includes a quality of service identifier , such as a metric instruction. If such an identifier is found, a receipt instruction is generated based, at least in part, on the SMS message . If such an identifier is not found, the method restarts to waiting for another SMS message. After a receipt instruction has been generated, the receipt instruction is transmitted to a queue service  and the method restarts to waiting for another SMS message.","The system for analyzing a SMS provider's quality of service may be implemented as computing system that is programmed or configured to perform the various functions described herein. The computing system may include multiple distinct computers or computing devices (e.g., physical servers, workstations, storage arrays, etc.) that communicate and interoperate over a network to perform the described functions. Each such computing device typically includes a processor (or multiple processors) that executes program instructions or modules stored in a memory or other non-transitory computer-readable storage medium. The various functions disclosed herein may be embodied in such program instructions, although some or all of the disclosed functions may alternatively be implemented in application-specific circuitry (e.g., ASICs or FPGAs) of the computer system. Where the computing system includes multiple computing devices, these devices may, but need not, be co-located. The results of the disclosed methods and tasks may be persistently stored by transforming physical storage devices, such as solid state memory chips and\/or magnetic disks, into a different state.","Each of the services , , , ,  shown in  may be implemented in an appropriate combination of computer hardware and software, or in application-specific circuitry.
