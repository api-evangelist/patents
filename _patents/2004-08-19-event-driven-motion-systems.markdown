The motion enabled device performs motion operations based on motion commands. The event source generates motion messages upon the occurrence of events, where the motion messages correspond to motion operations.

The following discussion is arranged in four sections each containing a description of a number of similar embodiments of the invention.","The reference characters used herein employ a number prefix and, some cases, a letter suffix. When used without a suffix in the following description or in the drawing, the reference character indicates a function that is implemented in all of the embodiments in association with which that number prefix is used. When appropriate, a suffix is used to indicate a minor variation associated with a particular embodiment, and this minor variation will be discussed in the text.","I. Instant Messenger to Industrial Machine","This section describes a system used for and method of communicating with an Instant Messenger device or software to control, configure and monitor the physical motions that occur on an industrial machine such as a CNC machine or a General Motion machine.","In the present application, the term Instant Messenger (IM) refers to technology that uses a combination of hardware and software to allow a first device, such as a hand-held, cell phone, personal computer or other device, to instantly send messages to another such device. For example, Microsoft's Messenger Service allows one user to send a text message to another across a network, where the message is sent and received immediately, network latency notwithstanding. Typically, the messages are sent using plain text messages, but other message formats may be used.","This section describes the use of the instant messaging technology to activate, control, configure, and query motion operations on an industrial machine (ie CNC or General Motion machine). More specifically, this section contains a first sub-section that describes how the instant messenger technology is used to interact with an industrial machine and a second subsection that describes how human speech can be used to interact with an industrial machine.","Referring now generally to , depicted by reference character therein are a number of motion systems that use instant messaging technology to control the actions of an industrial machine . Instant message interactions are typically created on a first or instant message enabled device  (the message sender) and are transmitted to second or other instant message enabled device  (the message receiver ). IM messages are transmitted between the message sender  and the message receiver  using a network . In addition, the exemplary systems  also comprise a motion services module .","Referring initially to the format of the messages transmitted between the sender  and receiver , the message data is typically stored and transferred in ASCII text format, but other formats may be employed as well. For example, the message data may be in a binary format (such as raw voice data) or a formatted text format (such as XML), or a custom mix of binary and text data.","In any format, an IM message sent as described herein will typically include instructions and\/or parameters corresponding to a desired motion operation or sequence of desired motion operations to be performed by the industrial machine . The term \u201cdesired motion operation\u201d will thus be used herein to refer to both a single motion operation or to a plurality of such motion operations that combine to form a sequence of desired motion operations.","In addition or instead, the message may include instructions and\/or parameters that change the configuration of the industrial machine  and\/or query the industrial machine  to determine a current state of the toy or a portion thereof.","The message sender  can be an instant message enabled device such as a personal computer, a cell phone, a hand-held computing device, or a specific custom device, such as a game controller, having instant message technology built in. The message sender  is configured to operate using an instant messaging communication protocol compatible with that used by the message receiver .","The message receiver  is typically an instant message enabled device such as a personal computer, cell phone, hand-held computing device, or even a specific custom device, such as a toy or fantasy device, having instant message technology built into it.","The network  may be any Local Area (LAN) or Wide Area (WAN) network; examples of communications networks appropriate for use as the network  include an Ethernet based TCP\/IP network, a wireless network, a fiber optic network, the Internet, an intranet, a custom proprietary network, or a combination of these networks. The network  may also be formed by a BlueTooth network or may be a direct connection such as an Infra-Red connection, Firewire connection, USB connection, RS232 connection, parallel connection, or the like.","The motion services module  maps the message to motion commands corresponding to the desired motion operation. To perform this function, the motion services module  may incorporate several different technologies.","First, the motion services module  preferably includes an event services module such as is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/074,577 filed on Feb. 11, 2002, and claiming priority of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/267,645, filed on Feb. 9, 2001. The contents of the '577 application are incorporated herein by reference. The event services module described in the '577 application allows instructions and data contained in a message received by the message receiver  to be mapped to a set of motion commands appropriate for controlling the industrial machine .","Second, the motion services module  may be constructed to include a hardware-independent system for generating motion commands such as is as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,691,897. A hardware independent motion services module can generate motion commands appropriate for a particular industrial machine  based on remote events generate without knowledge of the particular industrial machine . However, other technologies that support a single target machine  in a hardware dependent manner may be used to the implement the motion services module .","A. Instant Message Interactions","Referring now to  of the drawing, depicted therein are several exemplary motion systems constructed in accordance with, and embodying, the principles of the present invention.","1. IM to IM to Motion to Industrial Machine","Referring now to , depicted therein is a first exemplary motion system of the present invention. The motion system operates in a peer-to-peer manner; that is, the message sender  sends an instant message to the message receiver , which in turn uses the motion services module  to determine what (if any) motions to carry out on the target toy .","More specifically, a message is first entered into the IM message sender . Once the message is entered, the message sender  sends the message across the network  to the message receiver . After receiving the message, the IM message receiver  uses the motion services module  to determine what (if any) motions are to be run.","The motion services module  next directs the industrial machine  to run the set of motion commands. Typically, the set of motion commands sent by the motion services module  to the industrial machine  causes the industrial machine  to perform the desired motion operation or sequence of operations.","Further, as described above the motion commands generated by the motion services module may also change configuration settings of the industrial machine , or data stored at the industrial machine  may be queried to determine the current state of the industrial machine  or a portion thereof. If the motion commands query the industrial machine  for data indicative of status, the data is typically sent back to the message sender  through the motion services module , message receiver , and network .","2. IM to IM\/Motion to Industrial Machine","Referring now to , depicted therein is a second motion system of the present invention. The motion system is similar to the motion system described above. The primary difference between the systems and is that, in the system , the functions of the motion services module are built into the IM message receiver . The combined message receiver and motion services module will be referred to as the receiver\/motion module and identified by reference character .","The second motion system operates basically as follows. First, a message is entered into the IM message sender . Once the message is entered, the message sender  sends the message across the network  to the message receiver ","After receiving the message, the IM message receiver uses the built-in motion services module to determine what (if any) motions are to be run. The built-in motion services module maps the message to the appropriate desired motion operation that is to take place on the industrial machine .","The motion services module then directs the industrial machine  to run the motion commands associated with the desired motion operation. The industrial machine  then runs the motion commands, which allows the industrial machine  to \u201ccome to life\u201d and perform the desired motion operation. In addition, configuration settings may be changed on the industrial machine  or data may be queried to determine the current state of the industrial machine  or a portion therein.","3. IM to IM to Industrial Machine","Referring now to , depicted therein is a third motion system of the present invention. The motion system is similar to the motion systems and described above. However, in the motion system the motion services module is built directly into the industrial machine . The message receiver  receives messages and simply reflects or redirects them to the industrial machine ","The industrial machine , using the built-in motion services module , directly processes and runs any messages that contain motion related instructions or messages that are associated with motions that the industrial machine will later perform. The combination of the industrial machine and the motion services module will be referred to as a toy\/motion module; the toy\/motion module is identified by reference character  in .","In the system , the following steps are performed. First, the message is entered in the IM message sender . Once the message is entered, the message sender  next sends the message across the network  to the message receiver .","After receiving the message, the IM message receiver  simply reflects or re-directs the message directly to the industrial machine without processing the message. The communication between the IM message receiver  and the industrial machine may occur over a network, a wireless link, a direct connection (i.e. Infra-red link, serial link, parallel link, or custom wiring), or even through sound where the industrial machine recognizes the sound and translates the sound message.","Upon receiving the request, the industrial machine first directs the message to the motion services module , which in-turn attempts to map the message to the appropriate motion commands to the desired motion operation that is to be performed by the industrial machine . The motion services module then directs the industrial machine to run motion commands, causing the industrial machine to \u201ccome to life\u201d and perform the desired motion operation.","Although the motion services module is a part of the industrial machine , the motion services module need not be organized as a specific subsystem within the industrial machine . Instead, the motion services module may be integrally performed by the collection of software, firmware, and\/or hardware used to cause the industrial machine to move in a controlled manner. In addition, as described above, the control commands may simply change configuration settings on the industrial machine or query data stored by the industrial machine to determine the current state of the industrial machine or a portion thereof.","4. IM to Industrial Machine\u2014First Embodiment","Referring now to , depicted therein is a fourth motion system of the present invention. The motion system is similar to the motion systems , , and described above but comprises an advanced industrial machine that directly supports an instant messenger communication protocol (i.e. a peer-to-peer communication).","In the motion system , the IM message receiver and the motion services module are built directly into the industrial machine . The industrial machine , using the built-in message receiver and motion services module , directly receives, processes, and runs any messages that contain motion related instructions or messages that are associated with motions that the industrial machine will later perform. The combination of the industrial machine , the message receiver , and the motion services module will be referred to as the enhanced industrial machine module; the enhanced industrial machine module is identified by reference character  in .","In the motion system , the following steps take place. First the message is entered into the IM message sender . Once the message is entered, the message sender  sends the message across the network  to the message receiver . The communication to the industrial machine may occur over any network, a wireless link, a direct connection (i.e. Infra-red link, serial link, parallel link, or custom wiring), or even through sound where the industrial machine  recognizes the sound and translates the sound message.","When receiving the message, the industrial machine uses its internal instant message technology (i.e. software, firmware or hardware used to interpret instant messenger protocol) to interpret the message. In particular, the industrial machine first uses the motion services module to attempt to map the message to the appropriate motion command corresponding to the desired motion operation that is to be performed by the industrial machine ","The motion services module  then directs the industrial machine to run the motion command or commands, causing the industrial machine to \u201ccome to life\u201d and perform the desired motion operation.","The motion services module is a part of the industrial machine but need not be organized as a specific subsystem of the industrial machine . Instead, the functions of the motion services module may be performed by the collection of software, firmware and\/or hardware used to run the motion commands (either pre-programmed or downloaded) on the industrial machine . In addition, the control commands may change configuration settings on the industrial machine or query data to determine the current state of the industrial machine or a portion therein.","5. IM to Industrial Machine\u2014Second Embodiment","Referring now to , depicted therein is a fifth motion system of the present invention. The motion system is similar to the motion systems , , , and described above; however, in the motion system the industrial machine comprises instant message technology that causes the industrial machine to perform non-motion functions. For example, instant message technology may be used to send messages to the industrial machine that cause the industrial machine to carry out other actions such as turning on\/off a digital or analog input or output that causes a light to flash on the industrial machine  or a sound (or sounds) to be emitted by the industrial machine .","The motion system thus comprises an advanced industrial machine that directly supports an instant messenger communication protocol (i.e. a peer-to-peer communication). The motion system contains a built-in IM message receiver and does not include a motion services module. The industrial machine , using the built-in message receiver directly receives, processes, and responds to any messages that contain instructions or messages that are associated with non-motion actions to be performed by the industrial machine . The combination of the industrial machine and the message receiver will be referred to as the non-motion industrial machine module; the non-motion industrial machine module is identified by reference character  in .","The motion system performs the following steps. First, the message is entered into the IM message sender . Once the message is entered, the message sender  sends the message across the network  to the message receiver . Again, the communication between message sender  and the industrial machine may occur over any network, a wireless link, a direct connection (i.e. Infra-red link, serial link, parallel link, or custom wiring), or even through sound where the industrial machine recognizes the sound and translates the sound message.","Upon receiving the message, the industrial machine uses its internal instant message technology (i.e. software, firmware or hardware used to interpret instant messenger protocol) to interpret the message. Depending on the message contents, the industrial machine performs some action such as turning on\/off a digital or analog input or output or emitting a sounds or sounds. In addition, the configuration settings may be changed on the industrial machine and\/or data stored by the industrial machine may be queried to determine the current state of the industrial machine or a portion thereof.","6. IM to Server to IM to Industrial Machine","Depicted at in  is yet another motion system of the present invention. The motion system is similar to the motion systems , , , , and described above; however, the motion system comprises an IM message sender , a first network , an optional second network , and a server . The exemplary motion system further comprises a plurality of toys , a plurality of message receivers , and a plurality of motion services modules , where one of the receivers and motion services modules is associated with each of the toys ","The first network  is connected to allow at least instant message communication between the IM message sender  and the server . The optional second network  is connected to allow data to be transferred between the server  and each of the plurality of receivers ","The second network  may be an Ethernet TCP\/IP network, the Internet, a wireless network, or a BlueTooth network or may be a direct connection such as an Infra-Red connection, Firewire connection, USB connection, RS232 connection, parallel connections, or the like. The second network  is optional in the sense that the receivers may be connected to the server  through one or both of the first and second networks  and . In use, the message sender  sends a message to the server  which in turn routes or broadcasts the message to one or more of the IM message receivers ","As shown in , the system works in the following manner. First, a message is entered at the IM message sender . Once the message has been entered, the message sender  sends the message across the first network  to the server . The server  then routes or broadcasts the message to one or more of message receivers ","After receiving the message, the server  routes or broadcasts the message to one or more instant messenger receivers over the second network  if used. Upon receiving the request, each of the IM message receivers uses the motion services module associated therewith to determine how or whether the motion commands are to run on the associated industrial machine ","The motion services modules map the message to the motion commands required to cause the industrial machine to perform the desired motion operation or sequence of operations. In addition, the motion commands may change the configuration settings on the industrial machine or query data stored by the industrial machine to determine the current state of the industrial machine or a portion thereof.","The topologies of the second through fourth motion systems , , and described above may applied to the motion system . In particular, the server may be configured to operate in a system in which: (a) the motion services module is built in to the message receiver ; (b) the motion services module is built in to the industrial machine , and the receiving messenger simply redirects the message to the industrial machine ; (c) the message receiver is built in to the industrial machine ; (d) one or both of the message receiver and motion services module are built into the server ; or (e) any combination of these topologies.","B. Speech Interactions","Referring now to , depicted therein are a number of motion systems  in which human speech is used as a remote event that invokes actions on an industrial machine  using instant messenger technology as a conduit for the message. A number of possible implementations of the use of human speech as a remote event to cause motion will be discussed in the following subsections.","The motion systems  each comprise a person  as a source of spoken words, a speech-to-text converter (speech converter) , an IM message sender , an IM message receiver , a network , and a motion services module .","The message sender  and receiver  have capabilities similar to the message sender  and message receiver  described above. The IM message sender is preferably an instant message protocol generator formed by an instant messenger sender  or a hidden module that generates a text message based on the output of the speech converter  using the appropriate instant messenger protocol.","The network  and motion services module  are similar to the network  and motion services module  described above.","The speech converter  may be formed by any combination of hardware and software that allows speech sounds to be translated into a text message in one of the message formats described above. Speech converters of this type are conventional and will not be described herein in detail. One example of an appropriate speech converter is provided in the Microsoft Speech SDK 5.0 available from Microsoft Corporation.","1. Speech to IM to Motion to Industrial Machine","Referring now to , depicted therein is a motion system of the present invention. The system operates as follows.","First the person speaks a message. For example, the person may say \u2018move left\u2019.

The message is sent by the instant messenger protocol generator  across the network .","After receiving the message, the IM message receiver , uses the motion services module  to determine what (if any) motions are to be run. Upon receiving the request, the motion services module  maps the message to the appropriate motion command corresponding to the motion operation corresponding to the words spoken by the person . The motion services module  then directs the industrial machine  to run a selected motion operation or set of operations such that the industrial machine  \u201ccomes to life\u201d and runs the desired motion operation (i.e., turn left). In addition, the motion commands may change the configuration settings on the industrial machine  or query data to determine the current state of the industrial machine  or a portion thereof.","2.

Gaming and Animation Event Driven Motion","This sub-section describes a number of motion systems  that employ an event system to drive physical motions based on events that occur in a number of non-motion systems. One such non-motion system is a gaming system such as a Nintendo or Xbox game. Another non-motion system that may be used by the motion systems  is a common animation system (such as a Shockwave animation) or movie system (analog or digital).","All of the motion systems  described below comprise a motion enabled device , an event source , and a motion services module . In the motion systems  described below, the motion enabled device  is typically a toy or other fantasy device, a consumer device, a full sized mechanical machine, or other consumer device that is capable of converting motion commands into movement.","The event source  differs somewhat in each of the motion systems , and the particulars of the different event sources  will be described in further detail below.","The motion services module  is or may be similar to the motion service modules  and  described above. In particular, the motion services module  maps remotely generated events to motion commands corresponding to the desired motion operation. To perform this function, the motion services module  may incorporate an event services module such as is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/074,577 cited above. The event services module described in the '577 application allows instructions and data contained in an event to be mapped to a set of motion commands appropriate for controlling the motion enabled device .","This section comprises two sub-sections. The first subsection describes four exemplary motion systems , , , and that employ an event source  such as common video game or computer game to drive physical motions on a motion enabled device . The second sub-section describes two exemplary motion systems and that employ an event source such as an animation, video, or movie to drive physical motions on a motion enabled device .","A. Game Driven Motion","Computer and video games conventionally maintain a set of states that manage how characters, objects, and the game \u2018world\u2019 interact with one another. For example, in a role-playing game the main character may maintain state information such as health, strength, weapons, etc. The car in a race-car game may maintain state information such as amount of gasoline, engine temperature, travel speed, etc. In addition, some games maintain an overall world state that describes the overall environment of the game.","The term \u201cevents\u201d will be used in this sub-section to refer user or computer similar actions that affect the states maintained by the game. More specifically, all of the states maintained by the game are affected by events that occur within the game either through the actions of the user (the player) or that occur through the computer simulation provided by the game itself. For example, the game may simulate the movements of a character or the decline of a character's health after a certain amount of time passes without eating food. Alternatively, the player may trigger events through their game play. For example, controlling a character to fire a gun or perform another action would be considered an event.","When events such as these occur, it is possible to capture the event and then trigger an associated physical motion (or motions) to occur on a physical device associated with the game. For example, when a character wins a fight in the computer game, an associated \u2018celebration dance\u2019 event may fire triggering a physical toy to perform a set of motions that cause it to sing and dance around physically.","Each event may be fired manually or automatically. When using manual events, the game environment itself (i.e. the game software, firmware or hardware) manually fires the events by calling the event manager software, firmware, or hardware. Automatic events occur when an event manager is used to detect certain events and, when detected, run associated motion operations.","The following sections describe each of these event management systems and how they are used to drive physical motion.","1. Manual Events","Referring initially to , depicted therein is a motion system comprising an event source , a motion services module , and a motion enabled device . The exemplary event source is a gaming system comprising a combination of software, firmware, and\/or hardware. As is conventional, the event source defines a plurality of \u201cstates\u201d, including one or more world states , one or more character states , and one or more object states .","Each of the exemplary states , , and  is programmed to generate or \u201cfire\u201d what will be referred to herein as \u201cmanual\u201d motion services events when predetermined state changes occur. For example, one of the character states  includes a numerically defined energy level, and the character state  is configured to fire a predetermined motion services event when the energy level falls below a predetermined level.

When the predetermined data item or trigger is detected, an animation motion event is triggered that causes physical motion on an associated physical device.","In a second scenario, a programmed animation (e.g., Flash or Shockwave) may itself be programmed to fire an event at certain times within the animation.

Music-To-Motion General Algorithm","This chapter describes the general algorithms used by the music-to-motion engine  to map sound-waves to physical motions.","1. Configuration","Before the systems or are used, the music-to-motion engine  is configured to map certain sounds or combinations of sounds or sound frequencies occur to desired motion operations. The exemplary music-to-motion engine  may be configured to map a set of motion operations (and the axes on which the operations will be performed) to predetermined frequency zones in the sound wave. For example, the low frequency sounds may be mapped to an up\/down motion operation on both first and second axes which corresponds to the left and right arm on a toy device. In addition or instead, the high frequency sounds be mapped to a certain motion program, where the motion program is only triggered to run when the frequency zone reaches a certain predetermined level.","Referring now to , graphically depicted at therein are the steps of one of exemplary method of configuring the systems and . In particular, the media player  and\/or the music-to-motion engine  itself opens up a user interface or supplies initialization data used to configure the music-to-motion engine .","In the exemplary system , the frequency ranges are mapped to motion operations. The frequency ranges may also be mapped to non-motion related operations such as turning on\/off digital or analog input\/output lines. Optionally, the music-to-motion engine  may query the motion services module  for the motion operations and\/or programs that are available for mapping.","2. Mapping Methods","The following types of mappings may be used when configuring the music-to-motion engine .","The first mapping method is frequency zone to motion operation. This method maps a frequency zone to a motion operation (or set of motion operations) and a set of axes. The current level of frequency is used to specify the intensity of the motion operation (i.e. the velocity or distance of a move) and the frequency rate of change (and change direction) are used to specify the direction of the move. For example, if the frequency level is high and moving higher, an associated axis of motion may be directed to move at a faster rate in the same direction that it is moving. If the frequency decreases below a certain threshold, the direction of the motor may change. Thresholds at the top and bottom of the frequency range may be used to change direction of the motor movement. For example, if the top frequency level threshold is hit, the motor direction would reverse. And again when the bottom frequency level was hit the direction would reverse again.","The second mapping technique is frequency zone to motion program. A motion program is a combination of discrete motion operations. As described above, the term \u201cmotion operation\u201d is generally used herein for simplicity to include both discrete motion operations and sequences of motion operations that form a motion program.","When this second mapping technique is used, a frequency zone is mapped to a specific motion program. In addition, a frequency threshold may be used to determine when to run the program. For example, if the frequency in the zone rises above a threshold level, the program would be directed to run. Or if the threshold drops below a certain level, any program running would be directed to stop, etc.","Once configured, the music-to-motion engine  is ready to run.","3. Music to Motion","When running the music-to-motion engine , the engine  may be programmed to convert sound waves to motion operations by breaking the sound wave into a histogram that represents the frequency zones previously specified when configuring the system. The level of each bar in the histogram can be determined in several ways such as taking the average of all frequencies in the zone (or using the minimum frequency, the maximum, the median value, etc). Once the histogram is constructed, the frequency zones are compared against any thresholds previously set for each zone. The motions associated with each zone are triggered depending on how they were configured.","For example, if thresholds are used for the specific zone, and those threshold are passed, the motion is triggered (i.e. the motion operation or program for the zone is run). Or if no threshold is used, any detected occurrence of sound of a particular frequency (including its rate of change and direction of change) may be used to trigger and\/or change the motion operation.","Referring now to , depicted therein is an exemplary motion system using a music-to-motion engine that generates a histogram of frequencies to map music events to motion. The following steps occur when running the exemplary music-to-motion engine ","First the media player  plays the media and produces a sound-wave. The sound-wave produced is sent to the music-to-motion engine . The music-to-motion engine  then constructs a histogram for the sound wave, where the histogram is constructed to match the frequency zones previously specified when configuring the system.","Next, the music-to-motion engine  compares the levels of each bar in the histogram to the rules specified when configuring the system; as discussed above, these rules may include crossing certain thresholds in the frequency zone level etc. In addition, the rules may specify to run the motion operation at all times yet use the histogram bar level as a ratio to the speed for the axes associated with the frequency zone.","When a rule or set of rules are triggered for one or more frequency zones represented by the histogram, an associated lookup table of motion operations and\/or programs is used to determine which of the group of available motion operations is the desired motion operation. Again, the term \u201cmotion operation\u201d includes both discrete motion operations and sequences of motion operations combined into a motion program.","Next, a motion message corresponding to the desired motion operation is sent to the motion services module , which maps the motion message to motion commands as necessary to control the target device  to perform the desired motion operation.","The target motion enabled device  then runs the motion commands to perform desired motion operation and\/or to perform related actions such as turning on\/off digital or analog inputs or outputs.","IV. Motion Proximity Sensors","This document describes a system and\/or method of using sensors or contact points to facilitate simple motion proximity sensors in a very low cost toy or other fantasy device. Typically within Industrial Applications very high priced, accurate sensors are used to control the homing position and the boundaries of motion taking place on an industrial machine. Because of the high prices (due to the high precision and robustness required by industrial machines) such sensors are not suitable for use on low-cost toys and\/or fantasy devices.","A. Basic Movements","Toy and fantasy devices can use linear motion, rotational motion, or a combination of the two. Regardless of the type of motion used, quite often it is very useful to control the boundaries of motion available on each axis of motion. Doing so allows software and hardware motion control to perform more repeatable motions. Repeatable motions are important when causing a toy or fantasy device to run a set of motions over and over again.","1. Linear Motion","Linear motion takes place in a straight direction. Simple motion proximity sensors are used to bound the area of motion into what is called a motion envelope where the axis is able to move the end-piece left and right, up and down, or the like.","Referring to , schematically depicted therein is a sensor system comprising first, second, and third sensor parts , , and . The first sensor part is mounted on a moving object, while the second and third sensor parts and are end limit sensor parts that define the ends of a travel path that in turn defines the motion envelope. The exemplary travel path is a straight line.","The sensor parts , , and  may be implemented using any sensor type that signals that the moving part has hit (or is in the proximity of) one motion limit location or another. Examples of sensors that may be used as the sensors  include electrical contact sensors, light sensors, and magnetic sensors.","An electrical contact sensor generates a signal when the moving sensor part comes into contact with one of the fixed end limit sensor parts and closes an electrical circuit. The signal signifies the location of the moving part.","With a light sensor, the moving sensor part emits a beam of light. The end or motion limit sensor parts comprises light sensors that detect the beam of light emitted by the moving sensor part. Upon detecting the beam of light, the motion limit sensor sends a signal indicating that a change of state that signifies the location of the moving object on which the moving sensor part is mounted. The sensor parts may be reversed such that the motion limit sensor parts each emit a beam of light and the moving target sensor part is a reflective material used to bounce the light back to the motion limit sensor which then in-turn detects the reflection.","With a magnetic sensor, a magnet forms the moving sensor part on the moving object. The motion limit sensor parts detect the magnetic charge as the magnet moves over a metal (or magnetic) material. When detected, the motion limit sensor sends a signal indicative of the location of the moving object.","2. Rotational Moves","Rotational motion occurs when a motor moves in a rotating manner. For example, a rotational move may be used to move the arm or head on an action figure, or turn the wheel of a car, or swing the boom of a crane, etc.","Referring to , schematically depicted therein is a sensor system comprising first, second, and third sensor parts , , and . The first sensor part is mounted on a moving object, while the second and third sensor parts and are end limit sensor parts that define the ends of a travel path that in turn defines the motion envelope. The exemplary travel path is a curved line.","The sensor parts , , and  may be implemented using any sensor type that signals that the moving part has hit (or is in the proximity of) one motion limit location or another. Examples of sensors that may be used as the sensors  include electrical contact sensors, light sensors, and magnetic sensors as described above.","B. Hard Wire Proximity Sensor","Motion limit sensors can be configured in many different ways. This sub-section describes a sensor system  that employs hard wired limit configurations using physical wires to complete an electrical circuit that indicates whether a physical motion limit is hit or not.","1. Simple Contact Limit","A simple contact limit configuration uses two sensors that may be as simple as two pieces of flat metal (or other conductive material). When the two materials touch, the electrical circuit is closed causing the signal that indicates the motion limit side is hit (or touched) by the moving part side.","Referring now to , depicted therein is an exemplary sensor system  using a simple contact limit system. The sensor system  employs a moving part contact point , a motion limit contact point , and an electronic or digital latch .","The moving part contact point  contains conductive material (for example a form of metal) that is connected to by moving part wires to the latch . The motion limit contact point  contains conductive material (for example a form of metal) that is also connected by motion limit wires to the latch .","The electrical or digital latch  stores the state of the electrical circuit. In particular, the electrical circuit is either closed or open, with the closed state indicating that the moving part contact point  and the motion limit contact point  are in physical contact. The latch  may be formed by any one of various existing latch technologies such as a D flip-flop, some other clock edge, one-shot latch, or a timer processor unit common in many Motorola chips capable of storing the state of the electrical circuit.","Referring now to , depicted therein is scenario map depicting how the system  operates. During use, the simple contact limit circuit is considered closed when the moving part contact point  touches the motion limit contact point . Upon contact, electricity travels between the contact points  and , thereby changing the electrical or digital latch  from an open to a closed state. The change of state of the latch  signifies that the limit is hit.","During operation of the system , the following steps occur. First, the moving object on which the contact point  is mounted must move toward the motion limit contact point . When these contact points  and  touch, an electrical circuit is formed, thereby allowing electricity to flow between the contact points  and . Electricity thus flows between the two contact points  and  to the electrical or digital latch  through the moving part and motion limit wires.","The electrical or digital latch  then detects the state change from the open state (where the two contact points are not touching) to the closed state (where the two contact points are touching). The latch stores this state.","At any time other hardware or software components may query the state of the electrical or digital latch to determine whether or not the motion limit has been hit or not. In addition a general purpose processor, special chip, special firmware, or software associated with the latch may optionally send an interrupt or other event when the latch is deemed as closed (i.e. signifying that the limit was hit). The motion limit sensor system  may thus form an event source of a motion system as generally described above.","A pair of such motion proximity sensor systems may be used to place boundaries around the movements of a certain axis of motion to create a motion envelope for the axis. In addition, a single proximity sensor may be used to specify a homing position used to initialize the axis by placing the axis at the known home location.","2. Dumb Moving Part Sensor Contact","Referring now to , depicted therein is another exemplary sensor circuit . The sensor circuit  comprises a moving contact point , first and second motion limit contact points and separated by a gap , and a latch . In the circuit , the positive and negative terminals of the latch  are connected to the motion limit contact points and . The sensor circuit  eliminates moving part wires to improve internal wiring and also potentially reduce costs. The moving part sensor system  thus acts as a dumb sensor requiring no direct wiring.","More specifically, the dumb moving part sensor contact point  is a simple piece of conductive material designed to close the gap  separating two contact points and . When closed, electrical current flows from one motion limit contact point through the moving part contact point  to the other motion limit contact point , thus closing the electrical circuit and signaling that the motion limit has been reached.","The moving part contact point  is attached to or an integral part of the moving object. The moving part contact point  contains a conductive material that allows the flow of electricity between the two contact points and when the contact point  touches both of the contact points and ","The motion limit contact points and comprise two conductive members that are preferably separated by a non-conductive material defining the gap . Each contact point  is connected to a separate wire that is in turn connected one side of the electrical or digital latch .","The latch component  is used to store the state of the electrical circuit (i.e. either open or closed) and is thus similar to the latch component  described above. The latch  can thus be queried by other hardware or software components to determine whether or not the latch is open or closed.

Light Sensors","In addition to using a physical contact to determine whether or not a moving part is within the proximity of a motion limit or not, a light beam and light detector may also be used to determine proximity.","Referring to , depicted at  therein is a light sensor circuit of the present invention.
