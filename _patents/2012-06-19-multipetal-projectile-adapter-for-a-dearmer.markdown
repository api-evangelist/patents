title: Multi-petal projectile adapter for a dearmer
abstract: A multi-petal adapter that enables projectiles of different sizes to be used in a single dearmer. The adapter includes a plurality of petals that are secured, in a detachable way, to a base. The main function of the base is to secure the petals until the projectile is fired from the dearmer. Whereupon, the adapter will start petalling until the petals become detached from the base, so that the adapter imparts minimal or no energy or damage to the intended target. The adapter fully regulates the energy imparted to the various projectiles, by allowing propellant gases to bleed through channels that are formed between the petals. As a result, the present adapter fully supports a proper projectile launch and ensures its proper orientation toward the target.

In particular, the present invention relates to an adapter that enables projectiles of different sizes to be used in a single dearmer.","One technique for rendering an explosive ordnance device safe is to de-arm that device by rendering its fuze mechanism inoperative. This can be accomplished by destroying or damaging that fuze mechanism so that its firing pin will not be able to contact the detonator device. In this manner, the detonator will not set off the warhead of the ordnance device. De-arming an explosive ordnance in this manner requires the propulsion of a fuze destroying device against the fuze, with enough power to sufficiently damage the fuze and render it inoperative.","This result is generally accomplished by firing a projectile (or a slug) from a dearmer aimed, for example, at the fuze of the target, with enough velocity to impact a portion of the fuze extending out over the ordnance case. This impact bends the whole fuze body rendering the firing pin movement impossible, or in some cases, actually decapitating a portion of the ordnance item.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIGS. 1","b":["2","3","10","12","14","16","12","18","12","14","16","12"]},"Currently available dearmers (de-armers or disrupters) are designed to be exclusively used with projectiles of predetermined sizes. As more clearly illustrated in , the projectile  fits into a matching bore in the dearmer body . This limitation poses a serious logistics concern to the soldiers in the field, in that they are currently forced to use several dearmers that are dimensioned for different projectiles.","What is therefore needed is an adapter that enables projectiles of different sizes to be used in a single dearmer. The adapter should allow the dearmer to impart the appropriate amount of energy to the various projectiles, in order to propel them along the properly orientation. Furthermore, the adapter should guide the projectile toward the target. However, the adapter itself should not impart significant energy or damage to the target. Prior to the advent of the present invention, the need for such an adapter has heretofore remained unsatisfied.","The present invention satisfies this need, and describes a multi-petal adapter for use in conjunction with a dearmer. The adapter enables projectiles of different sizes to be used in a single dearmer. The adapter includes a plurality of petals that are secured, in a detachable way, to a base.","The main function of the base is to secure the petals until the projectile is fired from the dearmer. Whereupon, the adapter will start petalling until the petals become detached from the base, so that the adapter imparts minimal or no energy or damage to the intended target.","The adapter fully regulates the energy imparted to the various projectiles, by allowing propellant gases to bleed through channels that are formed between the petals. As a result, the present adapter fully supports a proper projectile launch and ensures its proper orientation toward the target.","Similar numerals refer to similar elements in the drawings. It should be understood that the sizes of the different components in the figures are not necessarily in exact proportion or to scale, and are shown for visual clarity and for the purpose of explanation.","A dearmer  of the present invention and its methods of assembly and use will now be described with reference to .  shows the dearmer  as being generally comprised of a tubular body  that is open at both its forward end  and its aft end .","In this particular example, which is shown for illustration purpose only, it is desired to use a projectile (or slug)  having a \u215c-inch outer diameter, in a larger size body  with a 1-inch inner diameter forward bore . It is further desired to use a cartridge case  of a uniform caliber that can be used to propel projectiles  of different sizes, without compromising the efficiency of the dearmer .","The cartridge case  is inserted into a rearward bore  inside the body , through the aft end , and is then threadably locked in position with a breech . The projectile  is fitted into a multi-petal adapter , and the projectile ()\/adapter () assembly is then inserted into the body , through the forward end .","Considering now the adapter  in greater detail with respect to ,  illustrates the adapter  as being formed of a plurality of petals, wherefore the name \u201cmulti-petal adapter.\u201d In this particular illustration, the adapter  comprises three identical petals , , . It should however be understood that a different number of petals may be used, and that these petals may differ in shape, depending on the intended application.","The petals , , , are secured at their aft ends to a base . While in this particular example, the base  is shown as being cylindrically shaped, it should be clear that the dimensions and shape of the base  may vary. In the present illustration, the outer diameter of the base  is approximately 0.415 inch, and its height is approximately 0.125 inch.","The main function of the base  is to secure the three petals , , , until the projectile  is fired from the dearmer  or until the projectile  impacts a target  (). Upon firing, the adapter  will start petalling until at least some of (or all) the three petals , ,  become detached from the base , so that the adapter  imparts minimal or no energy (or effect) to the intended target  ().","An important feature of the adapter  is to allow some propellant gases to bleed (or escape) through the adapter , upon firing of the cartridge case , in order to control the energy imparted onto the projectile  (via the adapter ). To achieve this goal, the three petals , ,  are separated by three axial gas escape channels , , , so that the adjacent petals (e.g., , ) are separated by a channel (e.g., ). In the present illustration, the width of each channel is constant along its entire length and is approximately 0.125 inch.","Considering now an exemplary design of the representative petal , in connection with , B,  and . The petal  includes a flat, arcuate front edge  having a width of approximately 0.0625 inch. The outer arc of the arcuate front edge  defines, in combination with the corresponding arcuate front edges of the other two petals , , and the gas escape channels , , , the outer diameter of the adapter . In this respect, every two adjacent channels, e.g., , , form an angle of 120\u00b0, as represented by the central angle ACB ().","The petal  further includes two generally similar, flat external sides  and  that extend from the arcuate front edge  to a flat bottom edge  (, B). The external sides , , along with the corresponding external sides of the other two petals , , define the gas escape channels , , . In this illustration, the length of each external side , , is approximately 1.750 inches.","The arcuate front edge  extends internally, downwardly, toward the bottom edge , into a flared flange  that is defined by two sides , , and that terminates in an internal arcuate edge . The angle of inclination, a, between the arcuate front edge  and each side ,  is approximately 45\u00b0.","As further illustrated in , the flared flange , along with the corresponding flanges of the other two petals , , define a generally conical funnel . The funnel  assists in the petalling of the adapter , as it will be explained later in more detail.","The internal arcuate edge  defines, in combination with the corresponding internal arcuate edges of the other two petals , , and the gas escape channels , , , the inner diameter of the adapter . In this illustration, the inner diameter of the adapter  is approximately 0.375 inch, in order to accommodate the \u215c-inch outer diameter projectile .","The two external sides ,  and the flared flange  extend internally, into an arcuately shaped, bore section . The bore section  along with the bore sections of the other two petals , , form an inner chamber  () for receiving the projectile .","In a preferred embodiment, the adapter  is made of heat and pressure resistant material, such as polymers. It should however be understood that other suitable material may alternatively be used.","The adapter  may be made as an integral unit, by machining or molding. With reference to , the representative petal  is shown to be integrally made with the base , and forms a attachment section  therewith. This attachment section  provides a secure, but weakened connection between each petal and the base , in order to ensure the petalling and thus the destruction of the adapter , prior to the penetration of the projectile  through the target  ().","The assembly of the adapter  within the dearmer  will now be described in connection with . The dearmer  is assembled for use by inserting the projectile  within the bore  of the adapter . The adapter  that houses the projectile , is then inserted into a cavity (or bore)  that is formed in the forward end of the body , so that the arcuate front edge  of the adapter , is substantially flush with a forward tip  of the body .","In this position, and as illustrated in , the adapter  does not extend to the rear end  of the cavity , because the projectile  is smaller than a projectile for which the bore  was dimensioned (e.g., compared to the slug  which fills the entire cavity of the body  in ).","When the projectile ()\/adapter () assembly is secured within the body , the adapter  defines an internal energy release chamber  within the cavity . One of the functions of the energy release chamber , in combination with the channels , , , is to reduce the pressure behind the adapter , in order to further control the exit velocity of the adapter  and consequently that of the projectile .","By manually reducing or expanding the volume of the energy release chamber , the user is capable of regulating the amount of energy imparted to the projectile . As an example, if the projectile  has much smaller dimensions than the projectile for which the bore  was dimensioned, the energy required to propel the projectile  would need to be minimized. The volume of the energy release chamber  is controlled by the seating position of the adapter  in the body . As a result, the user has the option to either expand or reduce the volume of the energy release chamber  by changing the seating position of the adapter . This provides a controllable degree of adjustment of the chamber volume which affects the exit velocity of the projectile ()\/adapter () assembly.","The operation or use of the dearmer  of the present invention, will now be described with further reference to , , and .  illustrates the dearmer  as being assembled and positioned for firing toward the target .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"],"b":["100","511","512","513","160","111"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 9"],"b":["111","501","502","503","160","111","888"]},"In a preferred embodiment, when the air contacts the funnel , the petals , ,  start to pivot outwardly, about the , until the time of impact of the projectile  with the target .
