title: Navigational soundscaping
abstract: A navigational system generates audio cues that are perceived in a three-dimensional space, allowing users to aurally perceive the locations of mapped objects such as landmarks. The audio cues can be produced alone, or in some applications, produced in conjunction with a visual navigational map display to improve the overall efficacy of the system. The audio navigation system includes a positioning system to determine the location of a user, a memory to store hierarchically-organized information about one or more objects, and a processor to render an audio signal based on the hierarchically-organized information. The audio signal is rendered into an audio space corresponding to the user, so as to allow user perception of the location of at least one of the objects relative to the location of the user. The objects may be landmarks in the vicinity of the user.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field","The present disclosure relates generally to navigational systems, and more specifically, to navigational systems incorporating audio cues.","2. Background","In human-computer interfaces, a frequent issue is information overflow or overload. People have a limited capacity to sense information being presented to them, and with computers and other informational devices, the amount of data that can be simultaneously presented may overwhelm a typical user. More importantly, being presented with too much information can sometimes compromise safety, in certain circumstances.","When it comes to perception of our surroundings, seeing (vision) and hearing (auditory) are the two most important senses. Individuals often rely on vision for accurate and specific information, and on auditory senses for less precise information. Hearing frequently supplements vision to benefit a situation.","An example of a contemporary situation where a person uses both audio and visually senses is driving while using global positioning system (GPS) navigation. For a typical driver in this situation, the eyes are generally busy watching the road. With an onboard GPS navigation system turned on, the driver can become distracted if information from the navigational system is visual: maps, directions, routes, neighboring objects, and the like. To reduce this potential distraction, some automotive navigational systems provide audible turn-by-turn instructions, delivered to the driver by audio commands.","Other than maps and directions, additional auxiliary data are also available on some navigational systems, such as locations of particular landmarks, such as banks, schools, gas stations, hospitals, boat ramps, airports, restaurants, schools, points of interest and the like. However, in some navigational systems, these additional data can present information overload to users.","Described herein are techniques that can reduce information overload by presenting spatial audio cues and intuitive hierarchical audio content to indicate geographic information in navigational systems. Such techniques can deliver more information to a user, while offloading at least some of the visual burden of using a navigational system. One possible application is automobile navigational systems.","Through the use of spatial sound, i.e., sound that is perceived as emanating from different, specific locations, the disclosed techniques can use intuitive audio content to symbolize objects (e.g., landmarks) on a map, and then auditorily present them so that they are perceived around a user, for example, inside a car. Many audio cues can coexist in three-dimensional (3D) auditory space without being perceived as overcrowded. The human ear has a natural capacity to perceive many audio events simultaneously. In addition, the audio content that represents each object can be hierarchical-organized and intuitive. Hierarchical auditory content provides another level of distinction for each type of object.","According to an aspect, an apparatus includes a positioning system, a memory and a processor. The positioning system determines the location of a user, and the memory stores hierarchically-organized information about one or more geographic objects, for example, landmarks. The processor is configured to produce an audio signal based on the hierarchically-organized information. The audio signal can be output as sound in audio space about the user so as to allow user perception of the location of at least one of the geographic objects relative to the location of the user.","According to another aspect, a method of presenting audio information to a user includes determining a user location using a positioning system, retrieving hierarchically-organized information about a landmark based on the user location, and producing an auditory sound based on the hierarchically-organized information through one or more transducers. The auditory sound is produced so as to allow user perception of the location of the landmark relative to the user location.","According to another aspect, an apparatus includes means for determining a user location using a positioning system, means for retrieving hierarchically-organized information about a landmark based on the user location, and means for producing an auditory sound based on the hierarchically-organized information. The auditory sound is produced so as to allow user perception of the location of the landmark relative to the user location.","According to a further aspect, a computer-readable medium embodying a set of instructions executable by one or more processors is provided. The instructions include programming code for determining a user location using a positioning system, programming code for retrieving hierarchically-organized information about a landmark based on the user location, and programming code for producing an auditory sound based on the hierarchically-organized information. The auditory sound is produced so as to allow user perception of the location of the landmark relative to the user location.","Other aspects, features, and advantages will be or will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional features, aspects, and advantages be included within this description and be protected by the accompanying claims.","The following detailed description, which references to and incorporates the drawings, describes and illustrates one or more specific embodiments. These embodiments, offered not to limit but only to exemplify and teach, are shown and described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice what is claimed. Thus, for the sake of brevity, the description may omit certain information known to those of skill in the art.","The word \u201cexemplary\u201d is used throughout this disclosure to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Anything described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other approaches or features. Unless expressly limited by its context, the term \u201csignal\u201d is used herein to indicate any of its ordinary meanings, including a state of a memory location (or set of memory locations) as expressed on a wire, bus, or other transmission medium.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","16","14","18","20","22","24"]},"The processor  includes a landmark extraction block , an audio content synthesis\/association block , an audio content modification block , and a spatialization block . The processor  can be a microprocessor, such as an ARM7, or digital signal processor (DSP) executing software, one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), discrete logic, or any suitable combination thereof.","The memory  stores landmark information  and an audio source library . The audio source library includes hierarchically-organized audio content . The memory  may be a separate device from the processor , or may be integrated with the processor  on the same chip.","From the GPS , the user location and speed can be obtained by the landmark extraction block . Using the user coordinates, the landmark extraction block  accesses relevant landmark information from the memory . The relevant landmarks are usually within the vicinity of the user, that is, they can be determined as being located within a predefined distance from the user's present location. Based on the user's location GPS coordinates, the landmark extraction block  determines a range of coordinates about the user's coordinates and then searches the landmark information , retrieving information for landmarks within the range, which represents the vicinity of the user. For each identified landmark in the user vicinity, the system  can process and generate an audio icon, as follows.","The content synthesis\/association block  synthesizes or associates short excerpts of audio (also called audio icons) with each landmark, according to intuitive rules and local cultural background. The audio icons can be non-speech audio. Thus, whenever the user hears the audio icon sound, he\/she can picture the type of landmark in his\/her mind. For example, banks can be associated with the sound of coins dropping, gas stations with a roaring engine, seaports with ship bells, restaurants with fork-and-knife sounds, and so forth.","The audio content for each audio icon can be selected from the hierarchically-organized audio content library  or synthesized by the audio content association\/synthesis block of the processor . The synthesis function can be performed by any suitable device configured to generate real-time audio using the processor . This can include circuitry and\/or software executable by the processor  for performing MIDI synthesis, or any other electronic design to render audio with oscillators, noise generators, wavetables, filters, envelop followers, and\/or the like. The synthesis function can be configured so that the synthetic audio content generated by the block  is hierarchically-organized in a manner similar to that of the hierarchically-organized audio content  stored in the audio source library .","In some configurations of the system , the audio content can be entirely synthesized by the block , and the audio source library  and audio content association function can be omitted from the system . In other configurations of the system , the audio content synthesis function is omitted from the block , and the audio content association function and audio source library  are solely used to generate the audio content of the audio icons.","The content association method employed by the block  may vary depending upon the application of the system . The method can use predetermined landmark-to-sound mappings stored in a lookup table. The mappings point to audio icons stored in the audio source library as hierarchically-organized audio content ; thus, when a landmark is detected by the landmark extraction block , the content association\/synthesis block  can use the landmark coordinates or identifier to retrieve a corresponding stored audio icon from the audio source library  for playback. The mappings can be factory designated or user-configurable through the UI , and\/or they can also be associated with a learning algorithm, so they adapt during use for better performance based on user habit. Irrespective of what specific association method is used, the method should serve the end result that once a landmark is identified and needs to be presented to the user, the corresponding sound (audio icon) intuitively represents the landmark to the listener. Intuitive auditory icons can provide information while not being intrusive. For example, the auditory space surrounding one or more listeners may be a 3D soundscape of natural sounds that can be configured to be pleasant and enjoyable to the listeners.","Not only are high-level characteristics (e.g., type) of landmarks associated with particular sounds, but the scale and other details of landmarks may be hierarchically represented within different sub-categories of sounds. For example, a stand-alone bank automatic teller machine (ATM) can be depicted by the sound of a single or few dropping coins, while a major bank branch can be represented by with a larger number of coins pouring down; a Chinese restaurant can be represented with fork-and-knife sound followed by a pentatonic tune, and a Persian restaurant can be represented with fork-and-knife sound followed by a measure of belly dance music. These latter examples of audio icons are concatenated audio designs, meaning multiple audio sounds are concatenated together to make a single audio icon. The audio icon designs can vary, and may be customizable by the user through the UI .","The audio content modification block  modifies the audio icon content before the content is transformed into a spatial audio signal. Through the UI , the user can assign importance levels, or define and associate custom actions according to time of day, weather condition or the like. The user can also set special sound effects for user-selected landmarks by using the UI .","The UI  can include a visual display, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), and user input means, such as one or more buttons, dials, and\/or touch screen inputs. Software executable by the processor  can be used to control and implement the display and user input means. The display can present a setup menu, where each category of landmark is listed, with one or more accompanying drop-down menus to select audio content files, synthesis methods or patches to associate with the landmarks. The UI  can also be configured to permit selection and configuration of individual landmarks. The selections for each landmark can include a default setting.","User-selected audio processing such as filtering, modulation, level control, reverb and the like can be selected through the UI  and used to modify and add effects to the 3D sound produced by the system  for particular landmarks selected by the user through the UI . For example, sound effects like chorus\/phaser or modulation techniques like amplitude modulation can cause a particular sound to stand out from a mixture of sounds. These methods can be applied on important landmarks when needed; level control algorithms such as the dynamic range control (DRC) modules can help giving existing sound extra boost in loudness, which helps important landmarks to sound even louder given limited headroom in the whole sound mix.","The spatialization block  renders each sound source (the audio content corresponding to the virtualized landmark in the audio space) into 3D audio space, according to the direction and distance relative to the user. Landmarks that are farther away may sound more distance, and their direction of perception in the audio space matches their location relative to the user.","3D audio rendering techniques are known in state-of-art software architectures and APIs (application programming interfaces). Methods for spatializing sounds include vector based amplitude panning (VBAP), Ambisonics, and binaural rendering techniques, such as head-related transfer function (HRTF) filtering, virtual 3D audio and the like. Standards like OpenSL, OpenAL, DirectX, all have dedicated sections elaborating on 3D audio APIs, and some with rendering methods. Depending on the presentation devices, various core algorithms can be used to render the 3D effects, such as binaural filters on headphones, and panning methods on speakers. Low-pass, high-pass filters and environmental reverberation effects are often integral parts of the 3D audio software.","After processing each sound source by the spatialization block , the mixer  mixes the audio signals from the spatialization block  together and delivers the mixed audio signals to the audio post-processing circuit . The audio post-processing circuit can perform functions such as amplification, impedance matching and the like. The audio signal is output from the audio post-processing circuit  to the audio transducers , where it is converted into sound energy. The transducers  can be any suitable devices for producing sound in response to electronic audio signals, such as speakers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","38"]},"Referring to the data structure , at the top level (level-1) , the category or type of landmark is defined. In the example shown, several different types of landmarks are illustrated, for example, a bank category , a gas station category , and a restaurant category . Other categories are possible. At the next level down, sub-categories or sub-types (level-2) -are defined for at least some of the level-1 categories. These sub-categories further refine the types of landmarks. As shown in the example, the bank category  is broken down into three level-2 sub-categories of different types of banking locations: automatic teller machine (ATM) , office , and major, full-service branch office . The restaurant category  is further broken down into level-2 sub-types of French restaurants , Italian restaurants  and Chinese restaurants .","As described above in connection with , the audio content association takes multi-levels and may use different methods. By way of example, as shown in , two different categories for two-level indexing are illustrated. For bank sounds, it is further detailed by intuitively associating the quantity of money sound with the size of the bank office. For the restaurants, the cuisine style can be indicated by concatenating a general restaurant sound with more detailed cultural sounds associated with the nationality of the cuisine.","As also shown in , the level-2 sub-categories can be even further broken down in level-3 sub-categories .","Although the example hierarchy of landmark icons is shown as having only three levels, any suitable number of levels, categories and sub-categories can be defined and used within the systems and methods described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","10","200","203","206","208","202","203","208","208","203","206","203","208","24"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 4"],"b":["248","10","248","250","252","252","24","10","252","250","248","248"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","10","300","300","300","300","300","300","300","24"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["400","402","404"]},"In step , audio content is associated with or synthesized for one or more of the landmarks based on the extracted landmark information. After the positioning system extracts each landmark, a hierarchical-indexing method can associate each landmark with certain categories of sound (e.g., audio icons) from a source library. Alternatively\/additionally, the audio icon can be synthesized by a processor, as discussed above in connection with . As mentioned above with reference to , the association or indexing may be accomplished with a lookup table of the landmark-to-sound mappings.","As part of the association process, audio content for one or more audio icons is retrieved from the hierarchically-indexed audio source library (step ). If the audio icon is instead entirely synthesized by the processor, step  is bypassed.","In step , a check is made to determine whether the landmark has been designated by the user for association with a user-configured audio icon. If the landmark is not user designated for special treatment, the navigation system produces an audio signal using the audio content retrieved from the source library (step ) and\/or synthesized by the processor. However, if the landmark has been designated, user-defined audio content is substituted for or otherwise replaces the synthesized icon or retrieved audio content from the hierarchically-indexed portion of the content library (step ). The user-defined audio content is then processed to produce the audio signal (step ).","In step , any optional user modifications to the audio signal, such as added sound effects, filtering, reverberation and the like are performed on the audio signal. Apart from the audio icons mapped to the landmarks by the association block, users can also specify certain landmarks to trigger special alert tones instead of the hierarchically-indexed sounds from the source library. For example, when driving in a vehicle that is nearly out of fuel, a user or automobile itself can set the system to designate gas stations as a special landmark. Instead of outputting a gas station audio icon, the system will instead emit a high level alert buzz once the vehicle is within the vicinity of a gas station.","The audio signal is then spatialized into 3D space (step ). As previously described herein, software is commercially available for spatializing sound and methods for spatializing sounds may include vector based amplitude panning (VBAP), Ambisonics, binaural rendering techniques, such as head-related transfer function (HRTF) filtering, virtual 3D audio and the like.","In step , the spatialized 3D audio signal is transduced into 3D sound so that it may be heard by the user.
