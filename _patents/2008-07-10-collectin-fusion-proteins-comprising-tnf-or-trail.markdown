{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a National Stage of International Application PCT\/EP2008\/005644, filed Jul. 8, 2008, published Jan. 15, 2009, under PCT Article 21(2) in English; which claims the priority of Application No. EP07013506.6, filed Jul. 10, 2007.","This application includes a sequence listing submitted electronically herewith as an ASCII text file named \u201csequence.txt\u201d, which is 120 kB in size and was created Jan. 7, 2010; the electronic sequence listing is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention refers to a fusion protein comprising a TNF-superfamily (TNFSF) cytokine or a receptor binding domain thereof fused to a collectin trimerization domain, to a nucleic acid molecule encoding the fusion protein, and to a cell comprising the nucleic acid molecule. The fusion protein is present as a trimeric complex or as an oligomer thereof. The fusion protein, the nucleic acid, and the cell is suitable as pharmaceutical composition or for therapeutic, diagnostic and\/or research applications as described herein.","Ligands of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family fulfill crucial roles in the immune system, but have also been implicated in the development of epithelial and endothelial structures.TNF family ligands are primarily expressed as trimeric type II transmembrane proteins and are often processed into soluble variants that are also organized as trimers.While shedding of some TNF ligands does not interfere with their capability to activate their corresponding receptors and might be even important for their physiological function, other TNF ligands become inactivated by proteolytic processing.Soluble TNF ligands that are not or only poorly active still interact with their cognate receptors. For example, the soluble forms of TNF, CD95L, TRAIL and CD40L interact with TNFR2, CD95, TRAILR2 and CD40, respectively, but do not or only poorly activate signaling by these receptors.Notably, inactive or poorly active soluble TNF ligands can be converted into highly active molecules by artificially increasing their avidity. For example, soluble Flag-tagged variants of TNF, CD95L, TRAIL and CD40L stimulate robust signaling by TNFR2, CD95, TRAILR2 and CD40, respectively, provided they were crosslinked with the Flag-specific mAb M2. Likewise, hexameric and dodecameric fusion proteins of soluble CD95L and soluble CD40L as well as non-specifically aggregated preparations of TNF ligands produced in display high activity.","The structural hall mark of the ligands of the TNF family is the carboxy-terminal \u201cTNF 2 homology domain\u201d (THD) or \u201creceptor binding domain\u201d (RBD), both terms are equally used herein, which is part of both the transmembrane and soluble forms of TNF ligands.The THDs of the various TNF ligands are composed of a framework of aromatic and hydrophobic residues that adopt an almost identical tertiary fold and cause self association into trimers.The THD also mediates receptor binding. In general, trimeric ligands of the TNF family bind to three molecules of their corresponding receptor(s). This interaction alone is not necessarily sufficient to activate receptor-associated intracellular signaling pathways. Several lines of evidence suggest that the initial formation of trimeric signaling competent ligand receptor complexes is followed by secondary multimerization into supramolecular clusters.These two steps in TNF receptor activation (1. ligand binding; 2. secondary aggregation of receptor ligand complexes) depend to a varying extent on several factors including lipid raft localization, cytoskeleton support, receptor autoaggregation, receptor associated adapter proteins, but also on affinity and avidity of the ligand receptor interaction and the way how the ligand is presented to the receptor (membrane ligand or immobilized ligand versus soluble ligand, trimers versus higher aggregates).","It is known that trimeric complexes of TNF superfamily cytokines are difficult to prepare from recombinant monomeric units.","For example, WO 01\/49866 discloses recombinant, fusion proteins comprising a TNF cytokine and a multimerization component. A disadvantage of these fusion proteins is, however, that the trimerization domain usually has a large molecular weight and\/or that the trimerization is rather inefficient.","Schneider et al. (J Exp Med 187 (1989), 1205-1213) describes that trimers of TNF cytokines are stabilized by N-terminally positioned stabilization motifs. In CD95L, the stabilization of the CD95L-receptor binding domain trimer is presumably caused by N-terminal amino acid domains which are located near the cytoplasmic membrane.","Shiraishi et al. (Biochem Biophys Res Commun 322 (2004), 197-202) describes that the receptor binding domain of CD95L may be stabilized by N-terminally positioned artificial \u03b1-helical coiled-coil (leucine zipper) motifs. It was found, however, that the orientation of the polypeptide chains to each other, e.g. parallel or antiparallel orientation, can hardly be predicted. Further, the optimal number of hepta-d-repeats in the coiled-coil zipper motif are difficult to determine. In addition, coiled-coil structures have the tendency to form macromolecular aggregates after alteration of pH and\/or ionic strength.","Mc Alinden et al. (J of Biol Chem, 2002, 277(43):41274-41281) discloses the preparation of a fusion protein between a human type IIA procollagen amino acid sequence and a 14 amino acid sequence corresponding to the first two heptad repeats of the rat surfactant protein's (SP-D) neck domain.","WO 01\/42298 discloses the preparation of a fusion protein between surfactant protein-D comprising the signal sequence, the collagen domain and the neck domain and CD40L. The disadvantage of those fusion proteins is that they lead to multimeric aggregates that are highly immunogenic and that they do not produce functionally defined trimeric ligands.","It was an object of the present invention to provide fusion proteins comprising a TNF cytokine or a receptor binding domain, which allow efficient recombinant manufacture combined with good trimerization properties and improved pharmaceutical properties.","The present invention relates to a fusion protein comprising","(i) a TNF-superfamily cytokine or a receptor binding domain thereof, and","(ii) a collectin trimerization domain.","The invention further relates to a nucleic acid molecule encoding a fusion protein as described herein and to a cell or a non-human organism transformed or transfected with a nucleic acid molecule as described herein.","The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical or diagnostic composition comprising as an active agent a fusion protein, a nucleic acid molecule, or a cell as described herein.","The invention also relates to a fusion protein, a nucleic acid molecule, or a cell as described herein for use in therapy, e.g., the use of a fusion protein, a nucleic acid molecule, or a cell as described herein for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition in the prophylaxis and\/or treatment of proliferative disorders, particularly disorders caused by, associated with and\/or accompanied by dysfunction of TNF cytokines, such as tumors, e.g. solid or lymphatic tumors, infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases, metabolic diseases, autoimmune disorders, e.g. rheumatoid and\/or arthritic diseases, degenerative diseases, e.g. neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, apoptosis-associated diseases and transplant rejections.","The fusion protein may be a monomeric protein or a multimeric protein. Preferably, the fusion protein is present as a trimeric complex consisting of three monomeric units which may be identical or different. Preferably, a trimeric complex consists of three identical fusion proteins. In a further preferred embodiment, the complex is formed by covalent linkage between three of the fusion proteins described herein, e.g., a covalent linkage of disulfide bridges between cysteines of the collectin trimerization domain (ii) as described herein. The trimeric complex as such shows biological activity. It was found, however, that oligomers of the trimeric complex, e.g. defined complexes wherein the basic trimeric structure is present 2, 3 or 4 times, also have biological activity. Thus, also preferred is an oligomer of the trimeric complex.","One component (i) of the fusion protein is a cytokine of the TNF superfamily or a receptor binding domain thereof. Preferably, component (i) is a mammalian, particularly human cytokine or a receptor binding domain thereof including allelic variants and\/or derivatives thereof.

Cell culture supernatant containing recombinant proteins were harvested three days post transfection and clarified by centrifugation at 300\u00d7g followed by filtration through a 0.22 \u03bcm sterile filter. For affinity purification, 4 ml of 50% Streptactin Sepharose (IBA GmbH, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) were packed to a 2 ml column and equilibrated with 30 ml phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS; Invitrogen Cat. 10010) or buffer W (100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl pH 8.0). The cell culture supernatant was applied to the column at 4\u00b0 C. with a flow rate of 2 ml\/min. Subsequently, the column was washed with PBS or buffer W and specifically bound proteins were eluted stepwise by addition of 5\u00d72 ml buffer E (PBS or buffer W with 2.5 mM Desthiobiotin, pH 7.4). The protein content of the eluate fractions was analysed by absorption spectroscopy and by silver-stained SDS-PAGE.

The elution of was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. The apparent molecular weight of purified proteins were determined based on calibration of the Superdex 200 column with gel filtration standard proteins (Bio-Rad GmbH, M\u00fcnchen, Germany).","1.4. Cell Death Assays","To analyze caspase activation, a cellular assay with the Jurkat A3 permanent human T-cell line (cat. no. CRL2570, ATCC) was used. Jurkat cells were grown in flasks with RPMI 1640-medium+GlutaMAX (GibCo) supplemented with 10% FBS (Biochrom), 100 units\/ml Penicillin and 100 \u03bcg\/ml Streptomycin (GibCo). Prior to the assay, 100,000 cells were seeded per well into a 96-well microtiterplate. The addition of different solutions containing the protein with or without a crosslinking antibody to the wells (final volume: 200 \u03bcl) was followed by a 3 hour incubation at 37\u00b0 C. Cells were lysed by adding 20 \u03bcl lysis buffer (250 mM HEPES, 50 mM MgCl, 10 mM EGTA, 5% Triton-X-100, 100 mM DTT, 10 mM AEBSF, pH 7.5) and plates were incubated on ice for 30 minutes to 2 hours. Apoptosis is paralleled by an increased activity of Caspases. Hence, cleavage of the specific Caspase substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC (Biomol) was used to determine the extent of apoptosis. For the Caspase activity assay, 20 \u03bcl cell lysate was transferred to a black 96-well microtiterplate. After the addition of 80 \u03bcl buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, 1% Sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 50 \u03bcM Ac-DEVD-AFC, and 25 mM DTT, pH 7.5, the plate was transferred to a Tecan Infinite F500 microtiterplate reader and the increase in fluorescence intensity was monitored (excitation wavelength 400 nm, emission wavelength 505 nm).","For the determination of cell death in HT1080 fibrosarcoma, HeLa cervix carcinoma and WM35 melanoma cells, 15,000 cells were plated in 96-well plates over night in RPMI 1640-medium+GlutaMAX (GibCo) supplemented with 10% FBS (Biochrom). For Colo205 cells, 50,000 cells were plated over night. Cells were stimulated the following day with indicated ligand and incubated for an additional 18 hours. For HeLa and HT1080 cells, cycloheximide (Sigma) at a final concentration of 2.5 \u03bcg\/ml was used during stimulation with ligands. Cell death of HT1080, HeLa and WM35 was quantified by staining with buffer KV (0.5% crystal violet, 20% methanol). After staining, the wells were washed with water and air-dried. The dye was eluted with methanol and optical density at 595 nm was measured with an ELISA reader. Viability of Colo205 cells was quantified by MTS assay (Promega).","1.5 Hepatocellular Cytotoxicity Assay","To determine the effect of TRAIL fusion proteins, primary human hepatocytes were prepared from healthy donors and cultured in Williams E medium using 25,000 cells per well in 96-well plates. At day two, medium was changed to DMEM-F12 supplemented with 10% FCS, human insulin, Pen\/Strep, minimum essential medium (MEM), sodium pyruvate and 10 mM Hepes and cultured for another day. Cells were stimulated at day three with varying concentrations of indicated proteins in presence or absence of cross-linking antibodies (StrepMablmmo, IBA GmbH). To evaluate the potential hepatotoxic effect of a cotreatment of ligands with chemotherapeutic agents, TRAIL-ASPD_F335D was coincubated at varying concentrations together with 5 mM of doxorubicin or 5 mM gemcitabine. Cells were incubated for 5 or 24 hours at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% COand were then lysed for determination of caspase activity as described in section \u201cCell death assays\u201d.","1.6 Streptactin-ELISA","To determine the binding of receptors to constructed ligands, streptactin-coated 96-well microplates were used. Therefore, supernatants from transiently transfected HEK293 cells, mouse sera or purified proteins were immobilized on streptactin-plates (IBA GmbH) for 1-3 hours in PBS. Samples were diluted in ELISA binding\/blocking buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween-20, 20% SuperBlock T20-PBS (Pierce)). Plates were washed with PBS+0.1% Tween-20 and incubated with mouse-anti-TRAIL antibody (Pharmingen, clone RIK-2), TRAIL-Receptor 1-Fc (R&D Systems), TRAIL-Receptor 2-Fc (R&D Systems), TACI-Fc (R&D Systems) or HVEM-Fc (R&D Systems) for one hour at room temperature. Plates were again washed and Fc-proteins were detected with anti-human- or anti-mouse-Fc-specific peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Sigma). Colour reaction was done by addition of 100 \u03bcl per well of TMB substrate (Kem-En-Tec Diagnostics) and the absorbance at 450 nm and 630 nm was determined with an ELISA reader after addition of 25 \u03bcl of 25% HSOas stop-solution. Values were calculated as 450 nm-630 nm with MS Excel.","1.7 Mannan-Binding Assay","ELISA plates (Nunc Maxisorp) were incubated over night at 4\u00b0 C. with 10 \u03bcg\/well of yeast mannan (Sigma) in sterile coating buffer (15 mM NaCO, 35 mM NaHCO, 0.025% NaN, pH 9.6). Plates were first incubated for one hour at room temperature with buffer BB (20 mM Tris, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl, 0.1% BSA and 20% SuperBlock T20-PBS (Pierce)) and secondly for additional 90 minutes with varying concentrations of indicated ligands in buffer BB. Plates were washed with buffer WB (20 mM Tris, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) and detection was done by using streptactin-HRP (IBA GmbH) in buffer BB. Plates were washed and developed with TMB substrate (Kem-En-Tec Diagnostics). The absorption at 450 nm and 630 nm was determined with an ELISA reader after addition of 25 \u03bcl of 25% HSOas stop-solution. Values were calculated as 450 nm-630 nm with MS Excel.","1.8 Pharmacokinetics of TRAIL-SPD Fusion Proteins","Male CD1 mice (Charles River) were intravenously injected with 10 \u03bcg protein dissolved in 300 \u03bcl PBS (Invitrogen). Blood was collected after 0 min (predose), 5 min, 30 min, 2 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours. For each time point, two samples were collected. Blood samples were processed to obtain serum and were stored at \u221215\u00b0 C. The concentration of TRAIL-fusion proteins was determined using an ELISA as described below (chapter 1.9) and half-lives were calculated (GraphPad Prism v4.0).","1.9 ELISA for the Quantitation of TRAIL-Constructs in Mouse Sera","To quantitate the concentration of TRAIL proteins in mouse sera (originating from pharmacokinetic studies), an ELISA method employing 96-well microplates was used.","ELISA plates were coated for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C. with 2 \u03bcg\/ml mouse-anti-TRAIL (clone RIK-2; Pharmingen). After washing with PBS+0.1% Tween-20 and blocking the plate for 30 min at 37\u00b0 C. with StartingBlock\u2122 (Pierce), serum samples at a concentration of 0.2% and 5%, calibration samples and control samples were added and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C. Calibration and control samples were prepared from the respective TRAIL batch (TRAIL-ASPD or TRAIL-ASPD-F335A or TRAIL-ASPD-F335D) and were supplemented with 0.2% or 5% non-treated pooled CD1-mouse serum to account for potential matrix effects. Control samples (high, medium and low concentration of the TRAIL-construct) were added as quality controls to ensure precision and accuracy of the TRAIL-quantitation in the given assay window. Plates were again washed and the StrepTag-containing TRAIL-constructs were detected with 1:1000 diluted StrepTactin-POD (IBA). All samples and proteins were diluted with ELISA buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween-20, 5% StartingBlock (Pierce)). The colour reaction started after addition of 100 \u03bcl per well TMB substrate (Kem-En-Tec Diagnostics). the absorbance at 450 nm and 630 nm was determined with an ELISA reader after addition of 25 \u03bcl of 25% H2SO4 as stop-solution. Values were calculated as 450 nm-630 nm with MS Excel.","2. Results","2.1 Characterization of CD95L Fusion Protein (CD95L-ASPD)","From the Streptactin-affinity purified CD95L-ASPD 0.5 ml (0.86 mg protein) were loaded with a flow rate of 0.5 ml\/min onto a Superdex200 column using PBS as running buffer. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected (A1 to A11 are indicated). The retention volume of the major peak at 11.92 ml corresponded to 170 kDa as determined from size exclusion standard. This indicated that the protein is a trimer composed of glycosylated monomers. The calculated molecular weight of the monomeric polypeptide is 38 kDa. An aliquot of fractions A1 to A11 was used for SDS-PAGE and caspase activity. Only the defined trimeric peak (fractions A7 to A10) was used for final analyses. The results are shown in .","An aliquot from size exclusion chromatography of affinity purified CD95L-ASPD was used for reducing SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. The band detected at approximately 40-45 kDa (indicated by an arrow) corresponded to CD95L-ASPD. The trimeric species was present in fractions A7 to A10. The results are shown in .","Jurkat cells were incubated with aliquots at a final 8-fold dilution from fractions A1 to A15 from SEC with affinity purified CD95L-ASPD. Cells were lysed after 3 h incubation and the caspase activity was determined with a fluorogenic assay. The fractions corresponding to the trimeric peak (fractions A7-A10) induced clear but weak caspase activity in Jurkat as these cells are known to require extensively cross-linked ligand. The aggregated and undefined species in fractions A1-A6 is therefore a potent inducer of caspase activation (not used further). Importantly, only the defined trimeric species (A7 to A10) was collected and used for final analyses. The results are shown in .","The human cancer cell lines HT1080 (A), HeLa (B) or WM35 (C) were incubated with indicated concentrations of purified, trimeric CD95L-ASPD in the presence or absence of cross-linking antibody (2.5 microgram\/ml of anti-Strep-tag II).

As negative control, cell supernatant from untransfected cells was used. Jurkat cells were lysed and analyzed for caspase activity with a fluorogenic assay.","As a result, the caspase activity decreased with the type of linker element employed (A>B>C>D) and on the Fold-On employed.

This indicated that TRAIL-ASPD is a homotrimer, as the calculated molecular weight of the monomeric polypeptide is 40 kDa. Importantly, for all fusion proteins analyzed by SEC consisting of the wild-type TRAIL-RBD sequence, an additional peak at around 8 ml corresponding to aggregated and non-active TRAIL-fusion protein was observed. From the collected fractions A1-A14 only the trimeric peak (A8-A10) was used for further analyses.

Cell death was quantified by crystal violet staining (HeLa, WM35 and HT1080) or by MTS assay (Colo205). The rise in the viability of Colo205 cells at high ligand concentration is likely due to limitation of cross-linking antibody.

were collected three days post-transfection and an aliquot was used for SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting employing an antibody specifc for Strep-tag II. Specific bands were detected at around 38 kDa (SPD-fusion proteins) and 28 kDa (coiled-coil-SPD fusion proteins). The amount of expressed protein depended on the ligand itself (TRAILR1mutein>TRAILR2mutein>TRAIL), secondly the linker length used (A>D) and third the trimerization motif used (SPD>CCSPD). Apparent molecular weights were as expected from the calculated sizes (40 kDa and 27 kDa for SPD and CCSPD fusion proteins, respectively). The results are shown in .","The selectivity of TRAIL-Receptor 1 or TRAIL-Receptor 2 towards fusion proteins of SPD\/ccSPD and TRAIL, TRAILR1mut and TRAILR2mut was shown by Streptactin-ELISA. Therefore, TRAIL-SPD-fusion proteins in supernatants from transiently transfected HEK293 cells were immobilized on Streptactin coated microplates. Cell supernatant from untransfected cells served as negative control. The results are shown in . Specifically bound proteins were detected with constant (A, B) or varying (C, D) concentrations of either TRAIL-Receptor 1-Fc or TRAIL-Receptor 2-Fc. As shown in (A), the ligand TRAILR1mut fused to SPD variants is deteced by TRAIL-Receptor 1, whereas the ligand TRAILR2mut is not. As shown in (B), the ligand TRAILR2mut is preferentially detected by TRAIL-Receptor 2, whereas TRAILR1mut- and TRAIL wild-type constructs are equally well detected. As shown in C, TRAIL-Receptor 1-Fc bound to TRAIL-R1mut-ASPD and TRAIL-ASPD equally well over the whole receptor titration range, whereas TRAIL-R2mut-ASPD is not detected. As shown in D, TRAIL-Receptor 2-Fc bound to TRAIL-R2mut-ASPD and TRAIL-ASPD equally well over the receptor titration range analyzed, whereas the signal for TRAIL-R1 mut-ASPD decreased rapidely with decreasing concentrations of receptor.","One microgram\/ml of affinity purified, trimeric TRAIL-ASPD, TRAILR1mut-ASPD or TRAILR2mut-ASPD in 100 microliter of PBS were used for immobilization via the Strep-tag II on Streptactin-coated microplates. Bound ligands were detected in a ELISA set-up using Fc-fusion proteins of TRAIL-Receptor 1 (A) or TRAIL-Receptor 2 (B). As shown in (A), TRAIL-Receptor 1 bound preferentially to the receptor-selective TRAILR1mut-ASPD as compared to TRAILR2mut-ASPD. As shown in (B), TRAIL-Receptor 2 preferentially bound to TRAILR2mut-ASPD as compared to TRAILR1mut-ASPD. In conclusion, the constructed TRAIL variants fused to SPD are receptor selective. The results are shown in .","Affinity purified TRAILR1mut-ASPD was subjected to SEC by loading 0.5 ml (0.95 mg protein) on a Superdex200 column. The results are shown in . Proteins were resolved at 0.5 ml\/minute with PBS as running buffer and 0.5 ml fractions were collected (fractions A1 to A14 are indicated). The retention volume of 12.46 ml corresponded to 140-145 kDa as determined by size exclusion standard. A minor peak at 10.83 ml indicated some aggregated species, importantly however, no peak was detected at the running front (8 ml) indicating that this molecule is much more soluble as compared to proteins containing parts of the wild-type TRAIL amino acid sequence.","An aliquot from size exclusion chromatography of affinity purified TRAILR1mut-ASPD was used for non-reducing (A) or reducing (B) SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining as shown in . Under non-reducing conditions, two bands were detected at 35 and 70 kDa, whereas a single band of 40 kDa (indicated by an arrow) was detected under reducing conditions. This indicated the formation of disulphide bridged molecules. The trimeric species was present in fractions A8 to A11 and was used for later analyses.","Jurkat cells were incubated in the absence (open bars) or presence (filled bars) of 2.5 microgram\/ml of cross-linking antibody with aliquots at a final 80-fold dilution from fractions A1 to A14 from SEC of affinity purified TRAILR1mut-ASPD. The results are shown in . As negative control, Jurkat cells were incubated with medium only. Jurkat cells were lysed after 3 h incubation and the caspase activity was determined with a fluorogenic assay. As Jurkat cells have been shown to mainly express TRAIL-Receptor 2, no fraction induced significant caspase activity, even when TRAILR1mit-ASPD was cross-linked by Strep-tag II specific antibody. This indicated that TRAILR1mut-ASPD does not bind to TRAIL-Receptor 2.","Affinity purified TRAILR2mut-ASPD was subjected to size exclusion chromatography by loading 0.5 ml (0.5 mg protein) to a Superdex 200 column as shown in . Proteins were resolved at 0.5 ml\/minute with PBS as running buffer and 0.5 ml fractions were collected (fractions A1 to A14 are indicated). The retention volume of 12.60 ml corresponds to 130-135 kDa as determined from size exclusion standard. This indicated that TRAILR2mut-ASPD is a homotrimer as calulated from the expected monomeric weight of 40 kDa. Importantly, more than 95% was present in the trimeric peak fraction and no aggregates were detected. The trimeric peak was used for later analyses.","An aliquot from size exclusion chromatography of affinity purified TRAILR2mut-ASPD was used for non-reducing (A) or reducing (B) SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining as shown in . Under non-reducing conditions, two bands were detected at 35 and 70 kDa, whereas a single band of approximately 40 kDa (indicated by an arrow) was detected under reducing conditions. This indicated the formation of disulphide bridged molecules. The trimeric species was present in fractions A9 to A11 and was used for later analyses.","The results from a Jurkat cell kill assay with TRAILR2-mut-ASPD are shown in . Jurkat cells were incubated in the absence (clear bars) or presence (filled bars) of cross-linking antibodies (2.5 microgram\/ml anti-Strep-tag II) with aliquots from fractions A1 to A14 from SEC of affinity purified TRAILR2mut-ASPD. Samples were used at at final 640-fold dilution. Cells were lysed after 3 h of incubation and the caspase activity was determined with a fluorogenic assay. As Jurkat cells have been shown to mainly express TRAIL-Receptor 2 that requires multimerized ligand forms for efficient signalling, TRAILR2mut-ASPD induced caspase activity when cross-linked. This indicated that TRAILR2mut-ASPD is a functional molecule.","The cytotoxic activity of TRAIL-ASPD, TRAILR1mut-ASPD and TRAILR2mut-ASPD on different human cancer cells is shown in . The indicated cell lines HT1080 (A and B), Hela (C and D) or Colo205 (E and F) were treated with varying concentrations of purified and trimeric TRAIL-ASPD, TRAILR1mut-ASPD or TRAILR2mut-ASPD in the absence (A, C and E) or presence (B, D and F) of cross-linking antibody (anti-Strep-tag II). Cells were incubated for 18 hours with indicated concentrations of ligands and cell death was quantified by crystal violet staining (HT1080 and HeLa) or MTS assay (Colo205). As a result, the ligand TRAIL-ASPD induced cell death on the three cell lines tested and TRAILR2mut-ASPD showed superior cell killing activity. In contrast, TRAIL-Receptor 1 selective TRAILR1mut-ASPD was not active on any cell line tested.","Affinity purified TRAILR2mut-ASPD was concentrated 20-fold in PBS by centrifugation through a 10 kDa membrane to give a solution of 2.5 mg\/ml. From the concentrate, 0.1 ml were subjected to size exclusion chromatography. As a result, only the trimeric peak and no aggregates were detected, indicating that this composition has improved production capabilities (). Similar results were achieved for TRAILR1mut-ASPD, where a concentrated solution of even 5.4 mg\/ml showed no signs of aggregation (not shown). In contrast, all fusion proteins tested containing the receptor binding domain composed of the wild type TRAIL sequence showed aggregation with 40% aggregates at concentrations as low as 0.4 mg\/ml.","The amino acid sequences of receptor-selective TRAIL mutein fusion polypeptides are shown in the

The data show that TRAIL-ASPD_F335D is capable of inducing cell death in exemplified cancer cell lines (). The rise of Colo205 cell viability at high concentrations of ligand is likely due to limitation of cross-linking antibody.","2.6 Analysis of Carbohydrate Binding Characteristics of the SPD Trimerization Motif Variants","It has been shown that wild-type, full length and oligomeric SP-D protein from several species, as well as the trimeric neck+CRD of human SP-D bind to several different carbohydrates. In addition, the neck+CRD of human SP-D also has been shown to excert immunomodulatory effects by serving as a chemotactic factor for immuno cells such as neutrophils (Cai et al., 1999276:131-136). Other cells may also be recruited by SP-D. The chemotactic effect of neck+CRD of human SP-D has been shown to depend on the glycobinding function, as the addition of maltose inhibited the chemotactic function. Thus, a ligand of the TNFSF with a SP-D-mediated chemotactic function may be of superior activity as compared to ligands or constructs thereof with natural amino acid sequences. For instance, in a scenario where cellular effects are desirable such as in cancer treatment such a described ligand may be desirable.","In addition, a ligand where SP-D has no carbohydrate function may be desirable in other settings. For human SP-D a mutant has been described in which amino acid phenylalanine 335 (corresponding to amino acid 355 of SEQ ID NO:21) has been mutated to alanine (SPD_F335A, Crouch et al., 281: 18008-18014). This mutant showed very weak carbohydrate binding. However, introducing a charged amino acid (e.g. an acidic amino acid) may be even better as compared to F335A if no carbohydrate binding is desired. Therefore the mutant SPD_F335D may be superior towards F335A mutant.","To analyze the binding of TRAIL-fusion proteins to carbohydrates, mannan from yeast was immobilized on microplates and the binding of TRAIL-SPD, TRAIL-SPD_F335A or TRAIL-SPD_F335D was detected, by ELISA. The results are shown in . As expected, the ELISA signal increased with increasing concentrations of TRAIL-ASPD. In contrast, the carbohydrate-mutant form TRAIL-ASPD_F335A showed a very low ELISA signal. In addition, the new constructed variant TRAIL-ASPD_F335D displayed the lowest ELISA signal (see inset and arrow). This indicated that the mutant F335D has a lower mannan-binding affinity as compared to the previously described SP-D mutant form F335A.","2.7 Pharmacokinetics of TRAIL-SPD Fusion Proteins","To determine the half-lifes of TRAIL-SPD fusion protein, ten micrograms of TRAIL-ASPD (A) or TRAIL-ASPD_F335D (B) were injected intraveneously into male CD1 mice and serum samples were collected after several time points (predose, 5 min., 30 min., 2 h, 6 h and 24 h). TRAIL proteins in sera of mice were quantified by an ELISA and the data was used to calculate halflifes. The results are shown in . For the two proteins analyzed, a halflife of 7 to 14 hours for TRAIL-ASPD (A) and TRAIL-ASPD_F335D (B) were calculated. No animal died or showed signs of intolerance during the period observed. The data indicate an at least 80-fold improvement of the serum halftime as compared to wild type TRAIL that was reported to have a half time in the range of three to five minutes in rodents (Kelley et. al 2001).","2.8 Cytotoxicity of TRAIL-ASPD Fusion Proteins","To analyze potential hepatotoxic effects of TRAIL-ASPD, TRAIL-ASPD_F335A or TRAIL-ASPD_F335D, primary human hepatocytes (PHH) were incubated with varying concentrations of indicated TRAIL-SPD-fusion proteins, with or without cross-linking antibodies (anti-Strep-tag II). As a control, a stabilized variant of CD95L, CD95L-T4 (described in WO2008\/025516) was used. The results are shown in .","In addition, the effect of a simultaneous incubation of PHH with 5 mM of chemotherapeutic drugs was analyzed for TRAIL-ASPD_F335D. After 5 h (A, B and E) or 24 h (C, D and F) of incubation, cells were lysed and caspase activity was assessed with a fluorogenic assay.","As a result, all analyzed TRAIL-SPD fusion proteins induced no hepatotoxic effects, even if ligands were secondarily cross-linked by antibodies. In contrast, CD95L-T4 is hepatotoxic as indicated by an increase of active caspase (A to D). Five hours of co-incubation of primary human hepatocytes with trimeric TRAIL-ASPD335D together with chemotherapeutic drugs induced no caspase activity (E). However, after 24 h of co-incubation with doxorubicin, soluble TRAIL-ASPD_F335D induced a strong caspase activity signal (F).","This indicates that TRAIL fusion proteins of the present invention may not show undesired hepatotoxicity in medical use. Thus, TRAIL fusion proteins are preferably administered in combination with drugs, which are apoptosis sensitizers and\/or apoptosis inducers, e.g. a chemotherapeutic drug such as oxaliplatin, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, etoposide, gemcitabine, irinotecan and others, or Bcl2 binding molecules, e.g. small molecules or peptidic compounds, which bind to polypeptides of the Bcl2 family, particularly Bcl2 or Bclxl.","2.9 Characterization of APRIL Fusion Proteins","HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding for APRIL-A69 (WO2008025516), APRIL-ASPD, APRIL-ACCSPD or APRIL-ACol11. After three days supernatants were analyzed for secreted proteins by Western Blotting. The results are shown in . For the detection of APRIL-fusion proteins an antibody specifc for Strep-tag II was used. Arrows indicate specific bands that were detected around 40 kDa (APRIL-ASPD and APRIL-ACol11, respectively), as well as at around 25 kDa (APRIL-A69 and APRIL-ACCSPD, respectively). Thus APRIL expression cassettes are functional and the secretion of protein indicated that the proteins are properly folded. As for other TNFSF proteins analyzed, the highest secreted protein levels were found for APRIL fused to the trimerization motif composed of coiled coil \u201cneck\u201d+CRD of human SP-D (APRIL-ASPD, lane No. 2). APRIL-ASPD was used to analyze the binding to the receptor TACI.","To show that the constructed APRIL-ASPD fusion protein is functional, the binding to a known receptor of APRIL, namely TACI, was assessed (). Therefore, APRIL-ASPD in supernatant from transiently transfected HEK293 cells was immobilized on Streptactin coated microplates. Cell supernatant from untransfected HEK293 cells served as negative control. Specifically bound proteins were detected with varying concentrations of TACI-Fc followed by incubation with an anti-human, Fc-specific antibody conjugated with peroxidase. As a result, the ELISA signal increased with increasing concentrations of TACI-Fc, indicating that APRIL-ASPD is a functional molecule.","The amino acid sequence of an APRIL fusion protein is shown below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0183","num":"0182"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00019","num":"00019"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["SEQID\u200351:\u2003Sp-APRIL-ASPD",{}]},{"entry":"Total\u2003amino\u2003acid\u2003number:\u2003344,\u2003MW\u2003= 37120"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"231pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["ORIGIN",{},{}]},{"entry":["1",{"u":"METDTLLLWV\u2003LLLWVPAGNG"},{}]},{"entry":[{},"RRGRGLQAQG"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["61","YGVRIQDAGV\u2003YLLYSQVLFQ\u2003DVTFTMGQVV\u2003SREGQGRQET\u2003LFRCIRSMPS"]},{"entry":[{},"HPDRAYNSCY"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["121","SAGVFHLHQG\u2003DILSVIIPRA\u2003RAKLNLSPHG\u2003TFLGFVKLGS\u2003SGSSGSSGSG"]},{"entry":[{},"LPDVASLRQQ"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["181","VEALQGQVQH\u2003LQAAFSQYKK\u2003VELFPNGQSV\u2003GEKIFKTAGF\u2003VKPFTEAQLL"]},{"entry":[{},"CTQAGGQLAS"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["241","PRSAAENAAL\u2003QQLVVAKNEA\u2003AFLSMTDSKT\u2003EGKFTYPTGE\u2003SLVYSNWAPG"]},{"entry":[{},"EPNDDGGSED"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["301","CVEIFTNGKW\u2003NDRACGEKRL\u2003VVCEFGGSPS\u2003SSSSSAWSHP\u2003QFEK"]},{"entry":{}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["\u20031-20:","Signal\u2003secretion\u2003peptide\u2003(underlined)",{}]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["\u200321-158:","APRIL-RBD"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["159-169:","Flexible\u2003linker\u2003element\u2003(A-linker;\u2003GSS\u2003GSS"]},{"entry":[{},"GSS\u2003GS\u2003italic)"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["170-207:","Coiled\u2003coil\u2003\u201cneck\u201d region\u2003of\u2003human\u2003SP-D"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["208-325:","C-type\u2003lectin\u2003domain\u2003of\u2003human\u2003SP-D"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["326-336:","Linker\u2003element\u2003(GGSPSSSSSSA)"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["337-344:","Strep-tag\u2003II\u2003(WSHPQFEK)"]}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0184","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.
