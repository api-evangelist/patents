title: Banded paper, smoking article and method
abstract: A cigarette wrapper includes transversely extending banded regions applied by a printing technique, such as gravure printing. The banded regions are applied in a single application of an aqueous starch solution also containing an anti-wrinkling agent such as propylene glycol, and calcium carbonate. The pattern of banded regions may be bands or stripes and the like along and/or around the tobacco rod. The banded regions may be solid or contain any number of cross-web and/or longitudinal discontinuities. The pattern may be configured so that when a smoking article is placed on a substrate, at least two longitudinal locations along the length of the tobacco rod have film-forming compound located only on sides of the smoking article not in contact with the substrate.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","SUMMARY","BACKGROUND DEFINITIONS","Examples","Examples","Single Pass Printing Example"],"p":["This disclosure relates generally to a smoking article and, more particularly, a banded wrapper for use in cigarette manufacturing, related materials, processes, and methods for making them. Anti-wrinkling agents, specially formulated oxidized starch material, smoking articles and wrappers which exhibit a low ignition propensity and\/or low self-extinguishment characteristics, and patterns for banded regions are disclosed.","Working Environment","As part of efforts to reduce the incidence of accidental fires resulting from untended smoking articles, various jurisdictions have imposed, are imposing, and may impose in the future limitations on the burning characteristics of smoking articles. One measure of the tendency of a smoking article to cause ignition of an underlying substrate is the Ignition Propensity value. To satisfy those increasingly common governmental requirements, the Ignition Propensity value, or IP value, for a smoking article should preferably be no greater than about 25%. Accordingly, efforts to meet such limits are undertaken by various manufacturers of smoking articles.","Reduced IP values typically are associated with a tendency for the smoking article to self-extinguish during smoldering between puffs. Generally speaking, consumers do not like to re-light a cigarette during their smoking experience. A measure of the tendency for a smoking article to self-extinguish during free burn has been developed and is known as the Self-Extinction value. The Self-Extinction or SE value has been found to be a useful indicia to evaluate the likelihood of consumer satisfaction for a smoking article where various techniques for IP reduction have been employed. The average Self-Extinction Average value for a smoking article should preferably be no greater than about 80% and\/or the Self-Extinction at 0\u00b0 value should be no greater than about 50%, and more preferably no greater than about 25%.","Ignition Propensity (\u201cIP\u201d)","Ignition Propensity or IP is a standard test conducted as set forth in ASTM E 2187-04, \u201cStandard Test Method for Measuring the Ignition Strength of Smoking articles\u201d, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference thereto. Ignition propensity measures the probability that a smoking article, when smoldering and placed on a substrate, will generate sufficient heat to maintain smoldering of the tobacco rod. Low values for IP are desirable as such values correlate with a reduced likelihood that a smoldering smoking article, when inadvertently left unattended upon a substrate, will cause combustion in the substrate.","Self-Extinguishment (\u201cSE\u201d)","Self-Extinguishment or SE herein is a reference to smoldering characteristics of a smoking article under free burn conditions. To evaluate SE, a laboratory test is conducted at a temperature of 23\u00b0 C.\u00b13\u00b0 C. and relative humidity of 55%\u00b15%, both of which should be monitored by a recording hygrothermograph. Exhaust hood(s) remove combustion products formed during testing. Prior to testing, smoking articles to be tested are conditioned at 55%\u00b15% relative humidity and 23\u00b0 C.\u00b13\u00b0 C. for 24 hours. Just prior to testing, the smoking articles are placed in glass beakers to assure free air access.","SE testing takes place within an enclosure or test box. A single port smoking machine or an electric lighter is used to ignite the smoking articles for the test. During testing, an apparatus or \u201cangle holder\u201d holds the smoking articles to be tested by holding an end at angles of 0\u00b0 (horizontal), 45\u00b0, and\/or 90\u00b0 (vertical). Preferably, twenty (20) smoking articles are tested at each of the 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 90\u00b0 positions. If more than one apparatus is used, the apparatuses are preferably positioned such that the smoking articles face away from each other to avoid cross interference. If a smoking article goes out before the front line of the smoldering coal reaches the tipping paper, the outcome is scored as \u201cself-extinguishment\u201d; on the other hand, if the smoking article continues smoldering until the front line of the smoldering coal reaches the tipping paper, then the outcome is scored as \u201cnon-extinguishment\u201d. Thus, for example, an SE value of 95% indicates that 95% of the smoking articles tested exhibited self-extinguishment under free burn conditions; while an SE value of 20% indicates that only 20% of the smoking articles tested exhibited self-extinguishment under such free burn conditions.","The SE value may be referred to in terms of \u201cSelf-Extinction at 0\u00b0 value\u201d, \u201cSelf-Extinction at 45\u00b0 value\u201d, or \u201cSelf-Extinction at 90\u00b0 value\u201d, each of which refers to the value of SE at the specified tested angle. In addition, the SE value may be referred to in terms of \u201cSelf-Extinction Average value\u201d, which refers to an average of the three angular positions: namely, an average of (i) the \u201cSelf-Extinction at 0\u00b0 value\u201d, (ii) the \u201cSelf-Extinction at 45\u00b0 value\u201d, and (iii) the \u201cSelf-Extinction at 90\u00b0 value\u201d. A reference to \u201cSelf-Extinction value\u201d or \u201cSE value\u201d does not distinguish between SE at 0\u00b0, SE at 45\u00b0, SE at 90\u00b0, or SE average values and may refer to any one of them.","Embodiments herein disclosed include banded papers and smoking articles constructed from such papers, wherein the add-on material comprises an aqueous starch solution (or system) that includes an anti-wrinkling agent as disclosed herein, as well as chalk as disclosed herein, such that the following are achievable:\n\n","In addition there are teachings herein of embodiments that include banded papers and smoking articles constructed from such papers, wherein the add-on material comprises an aqueous, preferably starch solution that includes a chalk content sufficient to abate the tendency of the banded paper to cause self-extinguishments and to enhance appearance of the product to a consumer.","Furthermore, there are teachings herein of embodiments that include banded papers and smoking articles constructed from such papers, wherein the bands are established according to patterns which help abate the statistical occurrences of self-extinguishments (SE) while maintaining desired IP performance.","In accordance with one aspect, this disclosure involves a method of making or preparing a patterned wrapper paper by establishing a supply of an aqueous starch solution incorporating an anti-wrinkling agent and chalk to a printing station through which a base web is passed so that the pattern can be applied in a single step using the aqueous starch solution.","In another aspect of this disclosure, a wrapper paper for a smoking article may have a base web to which add-on material is applied in a pattern using an aqueous starch solution that includes an anti-wrinkling agent and chalk. The aqueous starch solution may include starch at at least about 25% by weight, an anti-wrinkling agent between an effective amount and less than about 35% by weight of starch, and chalk or calcium carbonate between about 30% to about 80% by weight of starch.","In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, a smoking article may include tobacco and a wrapper paper where the wrapper paper includes a pattern of add-on material applied as an aqueous starch solution containing an anti-wrinkling agent and chalk.","Further aspects of this disclosure involve, without limitation, patterns for the add-on material, characteristics of the constituents of the add-on material. Further, the disclosure relates to resulting features of the smoking article including without limitation ignition propensity and self-extinction characteristics.","Referring to , this disclosure concerns a smoking article , such as a cigarette, which preferably comprises a tobacco rod  and a filter  attached to one end of the tobacco rod  with tipping paper . Preferably, the tobacco rod  comprises a column of shredded tobacco (\u201ccut filler\u201d) and a wrapper  disposed about the column of tobacco, which wrapper  is constructed in accordance with teachings which follow. The tobacco rod  has a lightable or lit end  and a tipped end  (which in the case of non-filtered cigarettes, is referenced as the mouth end  of the cigarette ). Cut filler tobacco is an industry-standard designation. Further, the tobacco rod  typically has a generally circular cross section, although other oval cross section and other non-circular shapes are within the scope of this disclosure. The wrapper is sealed along a longitudinal seam to form the tobacco rod .","The tobacco rod has a nominal length measured from the edge  of the tipping paper to the free end of the tobacco rod along a longitudinal axis of smoking article. By way of example, that nominal length may lie in the range of about 60 to about 100 mm.","The \u201cwrapper\u201d paper  (see ) typically includes a \u201cbase web\u201d  that may be made from flax, wood pulp, cellulose fiber, or the like, and may have a plurality of banded regions  applied to one or both sides. Preferably, the banded region  is applied to the inside of the wrapper  in the sense of how the wrapper  surrounds a column of tobacco in the tobacco rod .","In the manufacture of base web suited for the construction of the various embodiments of print banded paper disclosed herein, such manufacture usually will include the production of a roll of base web of several feet across (usually about 3 feet across or in transverse dimension), which is then slit into bobbins. Printing operations are preferably conducted on the rolls, but could be conducted after slitting. Preferably, the bobbins themselves will have a transverse dimension equivalent to the width needed to make tobacco rods  or an integral number of such widths (e.g., 1, 2, or 4 of such widths). The bobbins are adapted for use with typical cigarette making machines. The wrapper preferably has a dimension in cross-direction that takes into account the nominal circumference of the tobacco rod and an overlapping seam. As a result, when the wrapper is slit, the smoking article formed therefrom always has a longitudinal seam with an exact overlap.","For purposes of this disclosure, \u201clongitudinal\u201d refers to the direction along the length of a tobacco rod (e.g., along the axis  in ), or along the length of a base web  (e.g., arrow  in ) used in the preparation of wrapper that, in turn, may be used to fabricate a tobacco rod.","For purposes of this disclosure, \u201ctransverse\u201d refers to the direction circumferentially around a tobacco rod  (see ), or transversely of a base web  (e.g., arrow  in ) used in the preparation of wrapper that, in turn, may be used to fabricate a tobacco rod.","For purposes of this disclosure, a \u201cbanded region\u201d or \u201czone\u201d is an area  (see ) on an underlying base web  to which an add-on material has been applied. The banded region typically exhibits a two-dimensional pattern or array on the base web . More specifically, the pattern or array may comprise repeating units in the longitudinal direction  of the base web , repeating units in the transverse direction  of the base web , and or units which repeat in both the transverse  and longitudinal  directions of the base web . The regions  of add-on material are applied to the wrapper  to obtain satisfactory or improved Ignition Propensity (\u201cIP\u201d) characteristics and may also obtain improved Self-Extinguishment (\u201cSE\u201d) characteristics.","The regions  of add-on material are spaced along the base web  such that at least one region of add-on material  is positioned between the first and second ends ,  of the tobacco rod  in each finished smoking article, but more preferably at least two regions of add-on material may appear on the tobacco rod . The region  of add-on material preferably extends in the circumferential direction at one or more spaced locations along the axis , extending around the tobacco rod  of the smoking article . While the region  of add-on material is depicted in this disclosure as containing discontinuities in its circumferential direction, other configurations for the add-on material are within the spirit and scope of this disclosure, including, but not limited to, configurations where the add-on material is substantially continuous.","It is noted for sake of convention that, in describing dimensions of various embodiments herein, that band or zone \u201cwidth\u201d extends in a longitudinal direction  (see ) of the tobacco rod , whereas a dimension in the circumferential direction will be expressed as \u201ccircumferential\u201d or \u201ctransverse\u201d or \u201cin cross-direction.\u201d","Where the banded region  extends transversely of the base web  (or circumferentially around a tobacco rod), the \u201cwidth\u201d of the banded region  is measured in the longitudinal direction  from the leading edge  to the trailing edge  and is preferably lies in the range of from about 5 to about 9 mm (from the leading edge  to the trailing edge ), more preferably from about 5.5 to about 7.5 mm, and even more preferably from about 6 to about 7 mm. Further, banded regions may have a 27 mm \u201cphase\u201d (i.e., the spacing from the leading edge  of one banded region  to the leading edge  of the next adjacent banded region ). Preferably, the banded regions of add-on material reduce permeability of the wrapper to the range of from about 0 to about 12 CORESTA.","For purposes of this disclosure, \u201cband spacing\u201d refers to the distance between the trailing edge  of one banded region  and the leading edge  of an adjacent banded region  on the base web  from which a wrapper is fashioned.","As used herein, the phrase \u201cleading edge\u201d refers to the edge  (see ) of a banded region  that is closest to an approaching coal during smoldering of a smoking article  whose wrapper  contains the banded region , while the phrase \u201ctrailing edge\u201d refers to the edge  of a banded region  that is farthest from an approaching coal during smoldering of a smoking article  whose wrapper  contains the banded region .","For purposes of this disclosure, \u201clayer\u201d refers to a quantity of add-on material applied to a base web from which a wrapper is fabricated. Each banded region  may be formed by applying a \u201clayer\u201d  of an aqueous film-forming composition to the base web  of the wrapper to reduce the permeability of the paper in the corresponding banded region.","Where a film-forming composition is used, that \u201cfilm-forming composition\u201d preferably may include water and a high concentration of an occluding agent, e.g., 14% to about 50% by weight. The film-forming compound can include one or more occluding agents such as starch, alginate, cellulose or gum and may also include calcium carbonate as a filler. Further, the film-forming composition preferably includes an anti-wrinkling agent. Where starch is the film-forming compound, a concentration of at least about 25% may be particularly advantageous, and a concentration of about 30% is presently most preferred.","An \u201canti-wrinkling agent\u201d is a material which inhibits transverse shrinkage of the base web  (see ) during printing or other conversion operations. A suitable anti-wrinkling agent may be selected from the group consisting of 1,2 propylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerin, and starch plasticizing agents.","The film-forming composition may be applied to the base web of the wrapper  using conversion technologies such as gravure printing, digital printing, coating or spraying using a template, or any other suitable technique.","When discussing application rates for add-on material applied using gravure printing techniques, often use values with \u201cX\u201d as a suffix to refer to a volumetric application rate. The table below sets out the volumetric equivalents for \u201cX\u201d in terms of billion cubic microns, or \u201cBCM\u201d:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0056"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Volume","BCM"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"0.5X","3.4"]},{"entry":[{},"1.0X","4.6"]},{"entry":[{},"1.5X","6.8"]},{"entry":[{},"2.0X","10"]},{"entry":[{},"2.5X","10.7"]},{"entry":[{},"3.0X","12.3"]},{"entry":[{},"3.5X","13.6"]},{"entry":[{},"4.0X","17.8"]},{"entry":[{},"4.5X","19.9"]},{"entry":[{},"5.0X","22.4"]},{"entry":[{},"5.5X","24.7"]},{"entry":[{},"6.0X","27.8"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"In this specification, the unit of measurement for basis weight, gram(s) per square meter, is abbreviated as \u201cgsm\u201d.","When the phrase \u201cweight ratio\u201d is used herein with respect to the starch component of a starch solution, the \u201cweight ratio\u201d is the ratio of the weight of the additional material compared to the weight of starch used to prepare the starch solution. Moreover, for purposes of this disclosure, references to an \u201cX % starch solution\u201d refer to an aqueous starch solution in which the starch weight is X % of the solution weight (e.g., weight of starch divided by the sum of starch weight and aqueous component weight).","The wrapper includes a base web which typically is permeable to air. Permeability of wrapper is typically identified in CORESTA units. A CORESTA unit measures paper permeability in terms of volumetric flow rate (i.e., cm\/sec) per unit area (i.e., cm) per unit pressure drop (i.e., cm of water).

Most preferably, the wrapper has a permeability greater than about 30 CORESTA, such as common base webs having nominal permeabilities of about 33 and about 46 CORESTA with a basis weight of about 25 gsm. For some applications, the base web may have a permeability of greater than about 60 CORESTA, or greater than about 80 CORESTA, or even higher permeability values.","Schematic vs. Actual Depictions","Depictions of cross sections taken through a banded paper, such as , are believed to be useful schematic representations of a paper web having banded regions fashioned from a single application, and of the application processes by which such banded papers are fabricated. However, such schematic representations do not accurately depict the reality of the cross-section base web structures, or the reality of the cross-section of base web structures to which a layer of add-on material has been applied, or the reality of the cross-section of the layer of add-on material, in the final banded paper product.","More particularly,  is a mosaic of photomicrographs taken of a cross-section of a banded wrapper of the type discussed above and elsewhere in this disclosure. The photomicrographs of  cover an actual length of wrapper measuring about 2.1 mm in length, to which add-on material has been applied in two layers\u2014one layer containing starch and calcium carbonate, and one layer having starch but no calcium carbonate. Match lines are applied to the different sheets of the  mosaic so that the relationship between different portions of  are readily apparent.","The individual photomicrographs of  enlarge the actual paper sample 2500 times. Procedurally, actual banded paper was cut into sections several millimeters long and embedded into Spurr\u2122 epoxy. The embedded paper was then cut into 5 \u03bcm (micrometers) thick cross sections using a Leica Ultracut UCT Ultramicrotome equipped with a glass knife. The sample was mounted on a carbon adhesive disk attached to an aluminum stub, and sputter coated with 15 nm (nanometers) of Au\u2014Pd using a Cressington 208HR Sputter Coater operating in argon. The sample was imaged in adjacent overlapping portions using an FEI XL30 Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) operating at 15 kV in Hi-Vac mode.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A","b":["4","140","140","160","140","162","140","161","163","140"]},"When the first portion or layer of add-on material  is applied (see ), the add-on material shows on the surface of the base web  due principally to the presence of chalk (or calcium carbonate) in the material. In the sample which has been magnified in , the second portion or layer of add-on material  is applied (see ) on the surface of the base web  and is positioned on the first layer . The second layer  begins at about the location  (). While it appears that the second layer  is not aligned so as to start at the same location as the first layer , the tolerances involved in application techniques such as printing effectively do not allow the layers to be controlled within a tolerance of any less than about 0.3 mm. From the scale of magnification shown on the images of the  mosaic, the distance between the beginning of the first layer and the beginning of the second layer is about 0.12 mm\u2014a distance well within the minimum tolerance noted above.","Examining the first layer as it extends across , several observations can be made about the first layer  containing starch and calcium carbonate:","(i) the layer  is not continuous in the direction of the base web ;","(ii) the layer  does not have uniform thickness;","(iii) the layer  has non-uniform thickness;","(iv) the layer  does not have a smooth surface; and","(v) the actual thickness of the first layer  can be greater than the actual thickness of the second layer , even though the second layer is usually thicker than the first layer.","A similar examination of the second layer , which does not include starch, as that layer extends across  permits several similar observations:","(i) the second layer  is not continuous in the direction of the base web ;","(ii) the second layer  does not have a uniform thickness;","(iii) the second layer  has a non-uniform thickness;","(iv) the second layer  tends to have a smooth surface, but the base web (paper) has areas\u2014e.g.,  (), ,  (), and  (FIG. F)\u2014which are devoid of the add-on material constituting the second layer .","Differences such as those discussed above demonstrate that the schematic descriptions of paper with one or more layers of add-on material are at significant variance with the real world results of applying one or more layers of add-on material to a base web . Accordingly, while the schematic representations of add-on layers fairly show the process application rates, and might be used as a guide to etch application zones of a gravure print cylinder or the like, those schematic representations do not accurately represent the structure of the finished wrapper prepared by applying one layer of add-on material to a base web.","An Illustrative Embodiment\u2014Solid Band Pattern","Referring now to , a wrapper for a smoking article is prepared by applying a pattern  of add-on material to a base web . The add-on material preferably comprises an aqueous starch solution having a starch in the range of about 25% to about 35% by weight. In addition, the add-on material preferably includes chalk (i.e., calcium carbonate) in the range of about 60% to about 80% as well as an anti-wrinkling agent in the range of about 10% to about 20%, where the percentages of chalk and the anti-wrinkling agent are percentages of the weight of starch used in the aqueous solution.","In a presently preferred embodiment the add-on material is applied to the base web  in a substantially continuous, transversely extending, solid band  by a single printing step and dried to remove moisture from the add-on material. The resulting wrapper is then used to construct a smoking article  (see ). The smoking article  typically includes a tobacco rod  having a wrapper  surrounding a quantity of cut filler tobacco . A suitable filter  may be provided at one end of the tobacco rod . Using wrapper as described above, the tobacco rod  (and thus the smoking article ) exhibits a substantially solid banded arrangement of add-on material where the band  extends circumferentially around the tobacco rod  and has a band width (measured in the direction of the axis ) in the range of about 6 to about 7 mm.","With inclusion of the anti-wrinkling agent, such as 1,2 propylene glycol, in this embodiment as described, one may achieve the associated advantages summarized above (in the Summary) and detailed further in the description which follows.","With inclusion of the chalk in this embodiment as described, one may abate the tendency of the banded paper cigarettes to self-extinguish, enhance appearance of the product to a consumer and achieve these and other associated advantages summarized above (in the Summary) and detailed further in the description which follows.","It is also to be appreciated that with the solid band construction as described in reference to  one obtains a wrapper which is capable of contributing a desirable IP performance to the smoking article i.e., no greater than 25%, and which may include in various applications, an IP performance of less than 25%.","Difficulties Encountered with Applying Aqueous, Preferably Starch, Add-On Solutions","There are advantages with the concept of using aqueous starch solutions as add-on material for making banded wrapper to control IP characteristics of smoking articles manufactured using such banded wrapper. However, the application of aqueous starch solutions to a base web creates difficulties For example, aqueous starch solutions have a tendency to penetrate the irregular, rough, and porous surface of the base web  (see ), and a tendency to cause transverse shrinking of the base web in the vicinity of the banded regions. As to the last point, it has been observed that when applying an aqueous starch solution to a base web about 36 inch in transverse dimension, the web may shrink about from 0.50 inch to 0.75 inch or more upon drying. This degree of shrinking would frustrate maintaining proper registration through printing and other conversion operations.","Since shrinkage is localized to the banded regions, the transverse width of the base web in the space between adjacent banded regions is greater than the transverse width of the base web in the banded regions. That disparity in transverse width gives rise to transverse waviness in the base web in those spaces between banded regions.","Such waviness in the wrapper adversely affects both the subsequent handling of the wrapper and the manufacture of smoking articles from the wrapper. For example, when wrapper with waviness is wound on a spool, or slit and wound on bobbins, the winding process flattens the waviness causing creases in the wrapper. When the creased wrapper is used to manufacture smoking articles, those creases in the wrapper are carried into the smoking articles resulting in visually unacceptable smoking articles.","Anti-Wrinkling Agent","The inclusion of an anti-wrinkling agent (preferably, such a propylene glycol) in an aqueous starch solution used to make banded wrapper in a manner consistent with the teaching herein can reduce transverse shrinkage to operationally manageable levels, alleviate pronounced wrinkling and essentially eliminate creasing problems that first presented themselves. Inclusion of an anti-wrinkling agent has been found to have additional benefits, too. For example, when an anti-wrinkling agent is incorporated into the aqueous starch solution, the anti-wrinkling agent functions as a plasticizer so that the starch is more elastic during the drying process and in the finished paper. Cracking and flaking at banded regions was alleviated. In addition, the presence of the anti-wrinkling agent appears to cause the starch solution to reside more on the surface of the base web with less penetration into that material, and thus enhance film formation. Shrinkage of the wrapper in the vicinity of banded regions formed from an aqueous starch solution that includes an anti-wrinkling agent has been observed to be in the range of about 0.0625 to 0.125 inch for a 36 inch wide base web\u2014a range which does not result in creasing or excessive waviness. Further, inclusion of an anti-wrinkling agent in the aqueous starch solution has been found to make possible the application of add-on material to be applied to the base web in a single application, printing pass, or the like, provided that sufficient drying capability is established with such practices. Moreover, the inclusion of an anti-wrinkling agent in the aqueous starch solution to be applied in patterns may exhibit more intricacy than solid band regions, because print registration can be more precisely maintained if multiple print stations are used. In addition, the pot life of the aqueous starch solution is materially improved by the inclusion of an anti-wrinkling agent as disclosed herein.","The foregoing advantages will be better understood by those skilled in the art from the following teachings. Referring now to , the regions  of add-on material determine and regulate the IP and SE characteristics of the smoking article. Those regions  of add-on material are applied to a base web  (see ) of the wrapper  and then formed into a tobacco rod in conventional cigarette making equipment. Nominal permeability of the base web  may be in the range of about 25 to about 100 CORESTA. Currently, the preferred nominal permeability of the base web lies in the range of about 33 to about 65 CORESTA, with the most preferred nominal permeabilities being about 33 and about 60. The base web  has a longitudinal direction  extending along the length of the wrapper  and a transverse direction  extending transversely across of the wrapper  so as to be generally perpendicular or transverse to the longitudinal direction .","Those regions  of add-on material may be applied to the base web  preferably by a printing technique. While one or more printing technique (selected from the group consisting of direct printing, offset printing, inkjet printing, gravure printing, and the like) may be used to apply the region , preferably a gravure printing process will be used. Gravure printing provides ample control over deposition rates, deposition patterns, and the like, and is suitable for high-speed printing on the base web . For purposes of this disclosure, \u201chigh-speed\u201d printing refers to printing processes where the base web  advances through the printing process at a linear speed greater than about 300 feet\/min. For cigarette manufacturing purposes, base web printing speeds greater than 450 feet\/min. are preferred, and speeds greater than 500 feet\/minute or more are even more preferred. In this regard, the rates of deposition for add-on material, as well as the quality of the pattern of deposited add-on material, can vary considerably when wrapper prepared by high-speed printing processes is compared with wrapper prepared by low-speed printing processes. Higher-speed printing operations can achieve both desirable IP values (performance) and desired SE values (performance).","Remarkably, it has been found that a base web may be converted (printed) to include bands in accordance with the embodiment described with reference to  at 1000 feet per minute, with acceptable paper appearance (i.e., without quality defects) and without elevated or unacceptable statistical occurrences of creases or wrinkles.","One object of this description is to provide wrappers  (see ) produced at commercial-scale high-speed which, when formed into a tobacco rod, exhibit IP values no greater than 25%. Accordingly, deposit rates and characteristics of the resulting printed regions are important features of high-speed printing here. While that IP value is considered to be adequate at this time, even more preferred is an IP value for the resulting smoking article no greater than about 15%; and the most preferred IP value for the resulting smoking article is no greater than about 10%. Lower SE values are also desired. In this connection, while an SE value no greater than 50% is desirable, a more preferred SE value is less than about 25%; and the most preferred SE value is less than about 10%.","The materials used for the regions of add-on material can be important in the IP and SE performance of a smoking article manufactured using the wrapper discussed herein. In one embodiment, the regions of add-on material may be printed with a solution comprising a mixture of calcium carbonate (or chalk) particles, starch, and an anti-wrinkling agent. As with the starch and anti-wrinkling agent solution, the solution comprising a mixture of calcium carbonate (or chalk) particles, starch, and an anti-wrinkling agent preferably is applied as an aqueous solution, but a non-aqueous solution also falls within the spirit and scope of this disclosure.","This disclosure contemplates that various anti-wrinkling agents are suitable to attain the desired characteristics described herein. For example, the anti-wrinkling agent can be selected from the group consisting of glycerin, 1,2 propylene glycol, propylene glycol, and the like. In particular, the anti-wrinkling agent propylene glycol is most preferred.","Generally speaking, this disclosure contemplates that a combination of anti-wrinkling agent and calcium carbonate will be added to a nominal aqueous starch solution to obtain the add-on solution to be used for printing. For the nominal aqueous starch solutions used in this description, the starch may comprise from about 25% to about 35%, by weight, of the nominal solution. Preferably, the starch may comprise from about 28% to about 32%, by weight of the nominal solution. Most preferably, starch may comprise about 30%, by weight, of the nominal solution.","An anti-wrinkling agent is preferably added to the nominal starch solution, with the weight of the anti-wrinkling agent being in the range of about 10% of the weight of the starch in the nominal starch solution to an upper value established by the capacity of drying equipment to adequately dry the propylene-glycol containing solution. Quantitatively, that upper value is about 20% for conventional gravure printing apparatus. Preferably, the weight of the anti-wrinkling agent will be in the range of about 20% to about 30%. Most preferably, the weight of the anti-wrinkling agent will be about 25% of the weight of the starch in the nominal starch solution.","The following illustrative, non-limiting examples are intended to provide further explanation. The results provided in Tables I and II compare the initial viscosity and time stability of a printing solution without an anti-wrinkling agent additive and to the initial viscosity and time stability of a printing solution with an anti-wrinkling agent additive. The observations recorded in Table I (for 1,2 propylene glycol) and Table II (for glycerin) show that a printing solution containing an anti-wrinkling agent such as 1,2 propylene glycol or glycerin is less viscous initially and more stable in that it has a lower viscosity for a much longer period of time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0097"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE I"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},"Viscosity of 24% starch"]},{"entry":[{},"Viscosity of 24% starch","solution + 80% CaCO+ 100%"]},{"entry":[{},"solution + 80% CaCO","1,2 propylene glycol"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Day 1","65 centipoises (cp)","50"]},{"entry":["Day 2","71","51"]},{"entry":["Day 3","77","50"]},{"entry":["Day 4","88","\u2014"]},{"entry":["Day 6","\u2014","52"]},{"entry":["Day 7","147\u2002","58"]},{"entry":["Day 8","\u2014","61"]},{"entry":["Day 9","\u2014","66"]},{"entry":["Day 10","225\u2002","70"]},{"entry":["Day 16","\u2014","114\u2002"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"left","id":"FOO-00001"},"sup":"1","sub":["3 ","3 "]}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"left","id":"FOO-00002"},"sup":"2","sub":["3 ","3 "]}}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0098"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE II"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},"Viscosity of 20% starch","Viscosity of 20% starch"]},{"entry":[{},{},"solution + CaCO","solution + CaCO+ glycerin"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Day 1","51 centipoises (cp)","41 cp"]},{"entry":[{},"Day 2","\u200250 cp","\u2014"]},{"entry":[{},"Day 5","\u200266 cp","52 cp"]},{"entry":[{},"Day 6","\u200278 cp","\u2014"]},{"entry":[{},"Day 7","102 cp","\u2014"]},{"entry":[{},"Day 8","\u2014","55 cp"]},{"entry":[{},"Day 12","\u2014","62 cp"]},{"entry":[{},"Day 14","\u2014","72 cp"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00003"},"sup":"1","sub":["3 ","3 "]}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00004"},"sup":"2","sub":["3 ","3 "]}}]}}}},"br":{}},"When the add-on material is applied with a printing technique, viscosity of the applied material is important.

More particularly, an anti-wrinkling agent has been found to increase flexibility of add-on material when dried on the wrapper (i.e., it acts as a plasticizer). As a result, bands of add-on material are less prone to separate from the base web during handling and use than bands on wrapper where an anti-wrinkling agent is not used in the formulation. Furthermore, as noted above, incorporation of an anti-wrinkling agent in the add-on material gives rise to improved SE performance in a smoking article fabricated from wrapper having bands of add-on material including an anti-wrinkling agent\u2014but without degradation of IP performance.","While the operation of the anti-wrinkling agent in the starch solution is not fully understood, it appears that the anti-wrinkling agent also functions as a plasticizer in the starch solution. A starch solution without an anti-wrinkling agent capable of also functioning as a plasticizer tends to infiltrate the top surface of the paper structure. Moreover, without the agent, a starch solution tends shrink or contract when it dries. That shrinkage and\/or contraction causes the underlying web to also shrink or contract, i.e., in the area underlying the banded region. By way of example, observations have shown that the width of a 36 inch wide paper web may shrink by as much as about 0.5 to about 0.75 inches in the banded region\u2014in other words by over 1 to about 2%.","Since the underlying web, between banded regions, does not experience the shrinkage, the region between the banded regions exhibits waviness, where the waves extend in the longitudinal direction of the underlying web and the undulations of the waves occur in the cross-web or transverse direction of the underlying web. After the underlying web is slit longitudinally into portions sized to manufacture cigarettes, each of those longitudinal portions of the paper web is wound tightly on a corresponding bobbin. Accordingly, the undulations described above sometimes result in creases in the unbanded regions where the paper folds on itself to adjust to the width reduction caused by shrinkage in the banded regions. Such creases in the wrapper are generally unacceptable for tobacco rod production. The effect of that shrinkage can be easily seen in , B, C. Those figures are optical microscope images of the wrinkled region between print banded regions where a single application of film-forming material is applied at 5.5X. The film-forming material used contained 22% starch and 40% chalk or calcium carbonate.","Thus, the shrinkage of the banded regions appears to be a cause of wrinkling in the unbanded, or unprinted, area of the wrapper. Again, the mechanisms are not fully understood, but the addition of an anti-wrinkling agent to the starch solution appears to cause the printed layer or banded region to be more flexible. That flexibility may result from the printed starch layer being more elastic. That flexibility may also result from the printed layer having reduced infiltration into the paper structure such that the printed layer lies more on the surface of the paper web. Regardless of whether those mechanisms, a combination of those mechanisms, or some other mechanism is active, observations indicate that, when the wrapper flexes, the enhanced elasticity of the layer or banded region reduces the likelihood that the layer or banded region will separate from the wrapper. Moreover, the elasticity of the layer or banded region appears to allow the layer or banded region to dimensionally conform to the underlying paper as the applied solution dries\u2014hence shrinkage in the banded region is reduced and, simultaneously, wrinkling and\/or puckering between the banded regions is also reduced. Accordingly, incorporating the anti-wrinkling agent in the starch solution counteracts the wrinkling described above.","The effect of adding an anti-wrinkling agent to a film-forming material may be easily seen in , E, F, G, H, I, which are photographs taken through an optical microscope of the region between print banded regions under the same conditions as . In , glycerin was used as an anti-wrinkling agent. The film-forming material was applied at 5.5X, and contained 22% starch, 40% chalk, and 20% glycerin. In , 1,2 propylene glycol was used as an anti-wrinkling agent. In these figures, the film-forming material was applied at 5X, and container 22% starch, 40% chalk, and 100% propylene glycol.  demonstrates the surprising impact on print banded paper obtained by adding an anti-wrinkling agent to the film-forming material.","A further advantage of the anti-wrinkling agent herein disclosed concerns the film-forming attributes of the solution. More particularly, inclusion of the anti-wrinkling agent in the add-on material seems to enhance the film-forming characteristic of the add-on material with respect to the surface of the base web to which the add-on material is applied. That improved film-forming characteristic is believed to enhance the IP performance of banded wrappers constructed from the add-on material.","With the addition of an anti-wrinkling agent to the starch solution, permeability of the banded region is improved, i.e., the permeability is more uniform and is lower than permeability for a band that does not use plasticizer. This phenomenon is significant because it permits the required quantity of starch solution to be applied or printed in a single printing step. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that, in the past, multiple printing steps were typically needed to effect the necessary permeability reduction in the banded regions.","Calcium Carbonate","Calcium carbonate, or chalk, is preferably added to the nominal starch solution in addition to the anti-wrinkling agent, the weight of chalk may lie in the range of about 30% to about 80% of the weight of starch in the nominal solution. Where 33 CORESTA paper is used, addition of about 60% calcium carbonate is presently preferred. When 46 or 60 CORESTA paper is used, addition of about 80% calcium carbonate is presently preferred. Chalk may be added to the nominal starch solution to adjust the reflectance of the resulting add-on material so as to be comparable to the reflectance of the uncoated base web material. With such reflectance, banded regions constructed from the add-on material are less visible to the casual observer.","The CaCO-to-starch ratio may also be a significant factor in determining IP and SE performance of a smoking article fashioned from the wrapper of this disclosure, when prepared by high-speed printing. The CaCO-to-starch ratio is determined as the ratio, by weight, of calcium carbonate to starch for the region of add-on material. More specifically, a CaCO-to-starch ratio of less than about 0.8 is preferred to obtain desired IP performance together with improved SE (at 0\u00b0) performance less than about 25%. CaCOis included in the make-up of the embodiment described with reference to  to enhance its SE performance, among the other reasons set forth herein.","The foregoing description and the attached drawings will aid those skilled in the art to understand a method of manufacturing a banded wrapper for smoking articles. In that process, banded regions  (see ) of add-on material are established as spaced locations on one surface of the base web . Spacing of those banded regions  may be selected so as to be substantially greater than the width of those banded regions  in the longitudinal direction  of the base web . The width of the banded regions  may be selected to lie in the range of about 5 to about 10 mm (millimeters); and the spacing between those banded regions  (that spacing being measured as the distance from the trailing edge of one banded region to the leading edge of the next adjacent banded region) may be in the range of about 12 to about 40 mm.","Preferred Starch Compositions and Their Preparation","Banded regions of this disclosure preferably comprise an aqueous solution containing starch, chalk or CaCO, and an anti-wrinkling agent. While many types of starch are contemplated, tapioca starch is presently preferred for the starch component of the layer  (). A suitable commercially available starch is FLO-MAX8 available from National Starch & Chemical Co.","It has been found that certain characteristics of the starch material give rise to predetermined patterns that yield very low Ignition Propensity values when the patterned base paper is formed into smoking articles. Even more surprising has been the realization that within the standard specifications for some well-known starch materials, batch-to-batch variations in material properties can affect the Ignition Propensity of the resulting smoking articles. By way of example, the specifications of an oxidized tapioca starch commercially offered by National Starch & Chemical Co. as Flo-Max 8 indicate a pH in a 1% solution lying in the range of 4.5 to 6.5, with particles having molecular weights in excess of 10,000. Surprisingly, when a predetermined pattern was applied to a base web with a batch of Flo-Max 8 having a pH in the range of about 6 to about 6.5, IP has been found to be much improved when compared to other batches of Flo-Max 8 for which the pH was less than about 6 but still within the manufacturer's specifications.","Various balances or trade-offs need to be made in selection of starch parameters for use in applying films to wrapper. For example, while high molecular weight starch may give rise to effective permeability reduction, such high molecular weight starches must be used in low concentrations, resulting in a solution having a very high water content. But high-water-content films are much more difficult to effectively dry on porous wrapper. Moreover, it has been found that surface tension of the starch solution affects the retention of small bubbles of air\u2014low surface tension allows smaller bubbles to remain in the solution, whereas high surface tension causes bubbles to agglomerate and separate out of the solution giving a more uniform and consistent material for application to the wrapper.","Although not fully understood, the preferred pH range of the oxidized starch is believed to reflect a lower degree\u2014or less complete\u2014oxidation of the starch polymer chains giving more, longer polymer chains than the more acidic (i.e., lower pH) starches.","Furthermore, longer polymer chains yield a solution having a higher viscosity. Higher viscosity for the starch solution translates to better control when applied to a wrapper in a printing process.","Based on these understandings, it has been found that marked improvement in the IP of patterned wrapper results for starch solutions having particular, and improved, characteristics. Those characteristics for an aqueous solution including oxidized starch include a pH in the range of about 6 to about 6.5; a surface tension of at least about 65 dynes\/centimeter; a room temperature viscosity of no greater than about 50 centipoises; and a particle size distribution in the range of about 4 to about 40 microns for dry particles, with about 90% also being in the range of about 10 to about 100 microns when wet. Furthermore, the particles preferably have a molecular weight such that the solution can have starch concentrations in the range of about 25% to about 35%. Preferably, the starch comprises an oxidized tapioca starch.","The aqueous starch solutions used for application to the base web or wrapper are typically prepared by making a starch\/water mixture by first mixing the desired weight of dry starch powder with the desired weight of room temperature water (i.e., at about 15\u00b0 C. to about 25\u00b0 C.) to obtain a starch\/water mixture having the preselected concentration. For example, to prepare a starch\/water solution with a preselected concentration of 20%, 20 parts by weight of starch are mixed with 80 parts by weight of water. The starch\/water solution is then heated to an elevated sub-boiling temperature in the range of about 90\u00b0 C. to about 95\u00b0 C.\u2014i.e., below the boiling temperature. The starch\/water solution is held at the elevated temperature for about 20 to about 30 minutes for thermal soaking. Then, the starch\/water solution is cooled to room temperature. That cooling step can occur by passively, such as by naturally occurring heat transfer processes; or the cooling step can be active (or forced) such as by immersion in a cooling bath or by use of a conventional mechanical cooling system. Throughout the mixing step, the heating step, the thermal soaking step, and the cooling step, the starch\/water mixture is stirred. The stirring can be continuous or substantially continuous. If additional constituents, such as calcium carbonate, are to be incorporated into the starch\/water solution, those constituents should be added after the starch\/water solution returns to room temperature following the thermal soaking step.","Aqueous starch solutions having the characteristics specified above and prepared in the manner described above can be applied to a base web using any of a multitude of printing techniques including, by way of example and without limitation, the group consisting of gravure printing, offset printing, inkjet printing, spraying, and die printing. Other printing processes may also be suitable and are intended to lie within the teachings of this specification. Preferably, however, gravure printing may be used to apply the starch solution to a base web to obtain a patterned wrapper.","Surprisingly, it has been found that the CaCO\/starch ratio is a significant factor in determining IP and SE performance of a smoking article fashioned from the wrapper of this disclosure prepared by high-speed printing. The CaCO\/starch ratio is determined as the ratio, by weight, of calcium carbonate to starch for the region  of add-on material. More specifically, a CaCO\/starch ratio of at least about 60% is preferred to obtain IP and SE(0) performance less than about 25%. Even more preferred is a CaCO\/starch ratio of at least about 70% to obtain IP and SE(0) performance less than about 20%.","Many types of calcium carbonate particles are contemplated as falling within the spirit and scope of this disclosure. Presently, however, calcium carbonate available from Solvay Chemicals, Inc., as SOCAL 31 is a suitable commercially available calcium carbonate. SOCAL 31 is an ultrafine, precipitated form of calcium carbonate having an average particle size of about 70 nm (nanometers). Larger particles of calcium carbonate have been observed to not function as well in this application when compared to the ultrafine, precipitated form of calcium carbonate, due at least in part to the tendency of larger particles to precipitate from solution more quickly and due at least in part to the need for greater quantities to attain the beneficial characteristics discussed herein.","The materials used for the regions of add-on material can be important in the IP and SE performance of a smoking article manufactured using the wrapper discussed herein. In one embodiment, the regions of add-on material may be printed with a starch solution that includes an anti-wrinkling agent and calcium carbonate (or chalk). While an aqueous starch solution is presently preferred as the aqueous component is readily dried, use of a non-aqueous starch solution is also within the spirit and scope of this disclosure.","As discussed in more detail above, incorporation of an anti-wrinkling agent in the starch solution permits the aqueous starch solution to be applied in a single printing step or layer to the underlying paper web.","From the discussion above, it will now be apparent to those skilled in the art that many different patterns for the banded regions of wrapper fall within the spirit and scope of this disclosure. For example, a pattern comprising a plurality of solid transversely extending bands has been described (see ). Solid bands might also contain a discontinuity (see ) or several repeating discontinuities (see ). The description as being solid meaning, for purposes of this disclosure, that the regions of add-on material are applied in a single step.","Improved SE Performance While Maintaining IP Performance","As noted above, it is desirable to achieve IP performance that meets and exceeds governmental requirements. Such is achievable with a solid band configuration such as that described with reference to . Moreover, as also previously noted, that desired IP performance often adversely impacts the SE performance of the smoking article. Stated differently, while the IP performance may meet or exceed the governmental requirements, that IP performance is typically associated with a smoking article that will self extinguish when hand held by a smoker\u2014an SE of 100%. Since smokers ordinarily prefer not to need to relight a smoking article, improvement of SE performance while maintaining IP performance constitutes a highly desirable feature for improved wrappers. Applicants have discovered arrangements of the banded regions on wrapper that provide such improved SE performance while maintaining the IP performance. For example, the inclusion of chalk content in the embodiment described with reference to  contributes enhancement of SE performance amongst other attributes.","In addition to or in lieu of applying chalk to improve SE performance, certain band configurations and patterns disclosed herein are useful in constructing smoking articles having both improved SE performance and desired IP performance. For example, a slit band configuration such as shown in  and others is capable of better sustaining smoldering during free burns, yet when placed adjacent a substrate, does not sustain smoldering.","Referring to Table V, wrapper A comprises a slit band arrangement, having three regions of about 2 mm each, for a total width of 6 mm for the printed banded region with add-on rates in the various regions ranging from about 3.5X to about 5.5x. An add-on rate of 5.5X results in about 8 g\/mto about 9 g\/mof add-on material on a dry weight basis, where the wrapper has a nominal basis weight of about 26.5 g\/m. Lower add-on rates would be expected to provide proportionally adjusted values for the weight of the add-on material, measured on a dry weight basis.

in a single pass printing operation with the application rates indicated in those tables. In each of wrappers A through D, the add-on material preferably included an aqueous solution containing starch, chalk or calcium carbonate, and propylene glycol. A presently preferred mixture for that aqueous solution includes starch, chalk, and propylene glycol in a weight ratio of about 100 (for starch), to about 30% to about 80% (for chalk), to about 20% to about 30% (for propylene glycol), where the chalk and propylene glycol components are expressed as percentages of the weight of starch in the solution. The starch alone may be in the range of about 25% to about 35% in the aqueous solution.","Some changes in the relative proportions of constituents of the add-on material may change when the aqueous solution is applied to a base web and dried. For example, observations indicate that when 1,2 propylene glycol is used as the anti-wrinkling agent, about 50% to about 60% of the propylene glycol added to the solution remains in the add-on material when it has dried on the paper web. Some weight loss may also occur in other anti-wrinkling agents during the drying process. However, such weight loss has not been observed with respect to the starch and calcium carbonate constituents of the add-on material during the drying process.","The region  of add-on material may be substantially continuous transversely of the paper web, as shown (see ), or may have one or more longitudinally extending separations so as to define a C-shaped region when formed into a wrapper for a tobacco rod (see ), or may have several separations that result in multiple portions of material \u2032 (see ) generally symmetrically positioned around the tobacco rod when viewed in cross section transverse to the longitudinal axis  of the tobacco rod .","In addition, the region  of add-on material on the wrapper  may be divided into two or more substantially ring-shaped portions (see ) that are spaced from one another along the axis  by a distance, w, that typically does not exceed the width of the rings , when measured in a direction generally parallel to the axis  of the tobacco rod . Such a spacing feature provides a \u201cslit\u201d in the band structure.","It is also within the contemplation of this disclosure that the region  on the wrapper  may comprise a plurality of patches  (see ) that may ultimately be disposed circumferentially around the tobacco rod , with patches \u2032 of an adjacent region  being circumferentially displaced from patches of other adjacent regions . In addition, the patches , \u2032 may be arranged according to a predetermined pattern such as taught in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/924,666 and U.S. Patent Application Publication 2008\/0295854, the entire contents of both documents are incorporated herein by this reference thereto.","The regions of add-on material are preferably applied in a single layer  (see ). It should be noted that the representation of the base web cross section in  is schematic. As discussed above, the actual cross section of a base web is a slice through the myriad of fibers which form the base web. In the case of cigarette wrapper, that thickness may be on the order of about 30 microns (i.e., 30\u00d710meters or 30 \u03bcm). Actual thickness of the add-on material\u22662 \u03bcm, and the add-on material tends to infiltrate and conform to the surface presented by the fibers of the base web. As a result, material build-up in the regions of add-on material can be schematically shown as boxes (as in ), but actually are nearly imperceptible to the unaided eye.","The application rate of the material in the preferred single layer (see ) may be in the range of about 4X to about 6X. For these purposes, the \u201cX\u201d has been described above. Where the base web has a nominal CORESTA value of about 33, a presently preferred application rate of about 5X is believed to be appropriate. Where the base web has a nominal CORESTA value of about 60, a presently preferred application rate of about 5.5X is believed to be appropriate.","The smoking article  (see ) may include one or more banded regions  that are axially spaced from one another along the axis of the smoking article . Each banded region  may include add-on material applied such that at least one longitudinally extending gap  exists between end portions  of the banded region . The embodiment of  shows a single gap  in each of the banded regions ; however, two or more gaps  may be provided around the circumference of the smoking article . Where more than one gap  is provided, the gaps are preferably generally parallel to one another and preferably are also substantially equally spaced from one another around the circumference of the smoking article . An embodiment of the smoking article having a pair of substantially diametrically opposed areas of add-on material may be seen in . As shown, the circumferential extent of the areas of add-on material , \u2032 may be substantially the same as the circumferential extent of the spaces or gaps  between those areas of add-on material , \u2032.","With the foregoing arrangement, when the smoking article  exists in free-burn condition (see ), the regions of add-on material , \u2032 obstruct airflow to the burning coal of the tobacco rod  by virtue of their reduced permeability. On the other hand, with the smoking article held in a substantially horizontal position, the bottom gap  of the wrapper  freely permits air to enter the side of the tobacco rod  to support combustion of the coal. A vastly different situation occurs when the smoking article  is placed on a substrate  (see ). Under these conditions, the substrate  blocks the flow of air upwardly to the bottom portion or bottom gap  of the tobacco rod . The regions of add-on material , \u2032 and the substrate  cooperate to define much smaller areas ,  through which air can be drawn through the base web  of the wrapper. More specifically, the vertical area  between the bottom of the region  and the substrate  and the vertical area  between the bottom of the region \u2032 and the substrate  present a substantial reduction in the area through which air can pass to reach the smoldering coal of the tobacco rod . As a result of deprivation of oxygen in the air, the smoldering coal of the smoking article  self-extinguishes when the burn line reaches opposed regions of add-on material positioned as depicted in . The condition of substantially reduced area for air to support burning of the coal also exists for rotational positions of the tobacco rod  between that position illustrated in  and other positions of the smoking article when rotated about its longitudinal axis.","However, when the smoking article  is placed on the substrate  such that one of the add-on regions , \u2032 contacts the substrate , the add-on regions still may sufficiently restrict the area through which air can pass to and through the base web , and there is a lesser degree of material cooperation between the substrate  and the add-on regions to effect a reduction in that area, in comparison to what occurs at the snuffer region . For purposes of this description, a snuffer region  is an area on the tobacco rod  which is operable to cause extinguishment of the burning coal when placed on a substrate .","In the foregoing example, the reduction in IP value is also associated with a reduction in SE value, and improved free-burn quality of a smoking article  having a wrapper with regions of add-on material such as those of . It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the SE improvement of  occurs with the smoking article in a horizontal position (i.e., 0\u00b0). Similar SE improvements are also observed at other SE evaluation positions of 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. Where the smoking article  happens to be placed on a substrate  at one of three specific orientations, the orientations being spaced (off-set) 45\u00b0 apart from each other around the axis of the smoking article, the self-extinguishing characteristics and desirable IP are also achieved. Naturally, the discussion proceeded in this manner for the sake of brevity. It will be readily understood that a pattern according to this description can extinguish the smoking article, regardless of which side portion rests against a substrate  and without a need for applying film-forming compound to the paper to such an extent that a desirable free-burn quality in the smoking article is lost or such that carbon monoxide levels in the mainstream smoke become elevated. This may be understood by recognizing that opposing regions of film-forming compound need not appear at locations exactly 90\u00b0 from the side portion in contact with the substrate . Those regions may be centered at a location that is closer to or farther from the side portion in contact with the substrate , for example, between about 60\u00b0 and 120\u00b0 from the side portion in contact with the substrate .","Additionally, for a particular chosen pattern, the ability to extinguish the smoking article may depend more on providing minimum lengthwise extent of add-on material (e.g., a film-forming compound), rather than a particular weight per area of film-forming compound at longitudinal locations. The length of a rectangular region, for example, may be no less than about 5.5 mm for a particular design, base web, and film-forming compound used. The amount of film-forming compound used may be increased to improve IP performance, usually without losing a free-burn quality and SE performance, and if desired, a burn accelerator may be applied to the paper to support even higher add-on levels.","Previously, it was thought that a permeability ratio of 3:1 between the base web and regions of add-on material was insufficient to extinguish the smoking article because there is an insufficient reduction in the permeability of the paper at the longitudinal position of the snuffer region. However, that permeability ratio, over a portion of the circumference of the smoking article, may be sufficient to extinguish the smoking article when there is an underlying substrate  and when the add-on material is located at sides of the smoking article  not in contact with the substrate .","In the embodiments described above, the smoking article has a generally circular cross section. Therefore, it is possible for any side portion of the smoking article to rest against the substrate . However, a pattern as taught herein can be such that the burn characteristics described above (IP values no greater than 25% and SE values no greater than 50%) in relation to  can be realized, regardless of which side portion of the smoking article happens to rest against the substrate . Preferably, the pattern is selected so that when the base web is wrapped around a tobacco rod , zones of film-forming compound appear at opposing sides not in contact with the substrate  at one or more (preferably at least two) longitudinal locations along the tobacco rod .","Slit Banded Regions","Other patterns for the regions of add-on material are also, of course, within the scope of this disclosure. Moreover, the inclusion of an anti-wrinkling agent in the aqueous solutions used to form the banded regions allows intricate patterns to be effected.","For example, in another embodiment, the banded region can comprise first, second and third zones of add-on material, which may be applied by any of the methods disclosed herein, wherein the second zone includes perforations which preferably are filled with an occluding material which melts or is evaporated when the burning coal approaches the banded region to thereby provide the second zone with increased permeability.","Thus, a wrapper of a smoking article is disclosed comprising a base web and at least one transverse banded region with first, second and third zones. The first and third zones comprise add-on material, which reduces permeability of the wrapper. The first and third zones each have a width such that if either of said first or third zone were applied separately to wrappers of smoking articles, the smoking articles would exhibit statistically significant occurrences of total burn through and statistically few or no occurrences of self-extinguishment under free burn conditions (e.g., after testing a batch of 20 to 50 cigarettes). The sum of the widths of the first and third zones is such that if the zones were applied to wrappers of smoking articles as a single continuous band (without a slit or other longitudinal or transverse discontinuity), the smoking articles would exhibit statistically few or no occurrences of total burn through and statistically significant occurrences of self-extinguishment under free burn conditions. The first and third zones are separated by the second zone. The wrapper has greater permeability along the second zone than along the first and third zones. The second zone has a width less than either width of the first and third zones (which can have equal or unequal widths), so that lit smoking articles comprising the first, second and third zones exhibit statistically reduced occurrences of self-extinguishment under free burn conditions, as compared to smoking articles comprising wrappers whereon the first and third zones are applied as a single continuous band, while maintaining statistically few or no occurrences of total burn through. Preferably, the first and third zones are of uniform add-on material across the first and third zones. Optionally, the second zone may have a width essentially equal to the first and third zones.","Total weight of add-on material for the banded region preferably lies in the range of 0.5 to 15 grams per square meter (\u201cgsm\u201d). Conventional cigarette paper is permeable, with the permeability commonly designated in CORESTA, which measures paper permeability in terms of volumetric flow rate (i.e., cm\/sec) per unit area (i.e., cm) per unit pressure drop (i.e., cm of water). Permeability of the cigarette paper normally exceeds 20 CORESTA and preferably, the cigarette paper has a permeability of about 33 to about 60 CORESTA and a basis weight of about 22-30 gsm. However, permeability through the banded regions and the underlying cigarette paper preferably lies in the range of 0 to 15 CORESTA. The reduction in permeability preferably restricts air flow needed to support combustion of the cigarette coal in the vicinity of the banded region.","The first and third zones preferably have a greater basis weight in grams per square meter than the intermediate second zone; for example, the basis weight in grams per square meter of the first and third zones may be at least twice the basis weight in grams per square meter of the second zone. The second zone may comprise a gap. As used herein, the term \u201cgap\u201d refers to a discrete area of a banded region, between the first and third zones, lacking any permeability reducing add-on material (i.e., containing no layers of permeability reducing add-on material). In order to aid combustion in the second zone, the wrapper may comprise iron oxide at the location of the second zone. The second zone preferably has a greater permeability than the first and third zones.","Non-banded areas of the base web preferably do not comprise permeability reducing add-on material. As described below with reference to , the transverse banded region may comprise greater than three zones. For example, the transverse banded region may comprise, for example, five zones, with the second and fourth zones separating the first, third and fifth zones and the wrapper having greater permeability along the second and fourth zones than along the first, third and fifth zones.","Also provided is a wrapper of a smoking article comprising a base web and a transverse banded region of add-on material. The transverse banded region is designed to cause extinguishment of smoking articles comprising the transverse banded region when left upon a substrate. The wrapper further comprises a more permeable, intermediate zone along the transverse banded region such that the occurrences of self-extinguishments of smoking articles comprising the wrapper is statistically reduced over those without the intermediate zone.","In a further embodiment, a wrapper of a smoking article comprises a base web and at least one transverse banded region comprising first, second and third zones on the base web. The at least one transverse banded region can be free of fillers and optionally at least one of the zones is formed at least in part from an add-on material which includes a filler. The add-on material is preferably uniform across the first and third zones. The first and third zones are outward of the second zone, and the overall wrapper structure at the second zone has a greater permeability compared to the overall wrapper structure at the first and third zones.","Additionally provided is a wrapper of a smoking article comprising a base web and at least one transverse banded region comprising first, second and third zones on the base web. The first and third zones are outward of the second zone, the second zone has a greater permeability compared to the first and third zones, and the second zone and the first and third zones comprise add-on material.","Moreover, provided is a method of making a banded wrapper of a smoking article comprising supplying a base web and forming at least one transverse banded region comprising first, second and third zones on the base web. The first and third zones are outward of the second zone, the second zone has a greater permeability compared to the first and third zones, and at least the first and third zones are formed from an add-on material free of fillers. Optionally at least one of the zones is formed at least in part from an add-on material which includes a filler. The add-on material is preferably uniform across the first and third zones.","Furthermore, provided is a method of making a banded wrapper of a smoking article comprising supplying a base web and forming at least one transverse banded region comprising first, second and third zones on the base web. The first and third zones are outward of the second zone, the second zone has a greater permeability compared to the first and third zones, and the second zone and the first and third zones are formed from an add-on material.

For example, it was found that a tobacco rod comprising paper having a permeability of 33 CORESTA and a CO (FTC) delivery of 11 mg would produce 15 mg of CO (FTC) if previous versions of bands were applied without further change. In order to counteract his increase, the permeability of the wrapper would have to be raised to about 46 CORESTA. Such changes create a multitude of consequence in cigarette design, such as, for example, impacting puff count, possibly lessening machineability of the paper, and the like. In contrast, the slit banded paper having a permeability of 33 CORESTA provided 12 mg CO (FTC). Thus, the slit banded technology described herein facilitates application of bands with a lesser impact on CO levels (FTC).","The following examples are intended to be non-limiting and merely illustrative. Cigarettes with five different wrappers (i.e., wrappers with five different banded region configurations), were tested for ignition propensity (\u201cIP\u201d) and self-extinguishment (\u201cSE\u201d) at 0\u00b0 (horizontal).

desired reduction in SE while maintaining IP (i.e., without significantly increasing IP). In particular, wrapper B exhibited an improvement over control wrapper A, as evidenced by the decrease in SE average from 95 to 60%. Further, comparing wrappers B and D, it can be seen that by increasing the width of the second zone from 1 mm to 2 mm, the SE average decreased from 60% to 25% (while approximately maintaining the IP value). Thus, the width of the second zone is preferably greater than 1 mm, preferably about 1.5 mm or about 2 mm. While good results were also shown by wrapper c, which exhibited an SE average of 45%, the best results were shown by wrapper E, which exhibited an SE average of 20%.","It should be noted that wrapper E, having a banded region comprising first, second, third, fourth and fifth zones and which showed the best results, had 1 mm second and fourth zones of greater permeability. In contrast, wrapper B, having a banded region comprising just first, second and third zones, with a 1 mm second zone of a greater permeability, did not perform as well.

For example, the opposed longitudinally banded regions  (see ) may be located at the edges of the major axis of a substantially elliptical smoking article A, where the major axis of the substantially elliptical smoking article A naturally rests in a position substantially parallel to the substrate  on which the smoking article is placed. Such a smoking article A is also known as an oval smoking article.","Due to the nature of an ellipse, it can be appreciated that regardless of how an oval smoking article is placed on the substrate , the smoking article A will eventually rest in one of two stable positions, with either the upper or lower side resting against the substrate. Therefore, if longitudinally banded regions of add-on material are formed only along the side portions of the generally elliptical article where there is a maximum curvature, film-forming compound will always be present on those side portions of the smoking article A that do not contact the substrate . Moreover, cooperation between those longitudinally banded regions and the substrate  in the stable positions appears to function to restrict airflow into the tobacco rod and leads to self-extinction and a low IP value, regardless of how the smoking article  is initially placed on the substrate .","The predetermined pattern of add-on material is typically applied to a base web having a permeability lying in the range of about 20 to about 80 CORESTA units. When dry, the add-on material often forms a film on the base web that is effective to locally reduce permeability to values lying in the range of 0 to about 12 CORESTA units, more preferably, 0 to about 10 CORESTA units. The add-on material is preferably applied as an aqueous solution including starch.","Printing Processes","Preferably, the banded region is applied to the wrapper using a gravure printing process. The gravure printing process can be used immediately following paper manufacture, i.e., at a printing station at a location near the end of the paper making machine. Alternatively, the gravure printing process can be used in connection with reels carrying the wrapper onto which the banded regions are to be printed. For example, a reel of wrapper having a selected permeability and a selected basis weight is mounted so that the wrapper can be unspooled from the reel as a continuous base web.","The base web advances or passes through a gravure printing station where the layer of each banded region is printed on the paper. The printing process may be applied to the felt side or the wire side of the paper, or both.","At the gravure printing station, the apparatus includes a gravure cylinder or roller generally mounted for rotation around a horizontal axis. The generally cylindrical surface of the roller is patterned (i.e., with dots, lines, cells, etc.) in a suitable process to define a negative of the first layer of banded regions. Conventional engraving (etching), chemical engraving, electronic engraving, and photo etching can be used to pattern the surface of the gravure cylinder. The circumference of the roller is determined such that it is an integral multiple of the sum of the nominal distance between banded regions plus the banded region width. Thus, for each revolution of the roller, that integral number of first layers of the banded regions is printed on the wrapper.","With gravure printing, while the layer of add-on material may be applied uniformly, the layer of add-on material need not be applied uniformly. For example, a layer of add-on material may be applied such that discrete portions of the layer have differing gsm weights compared to other areas of the layer. This may be accomplished, for example, by a layer of add-on material being applied such that discrete portions of the layer have differing depths than other areas of the layer. This may be accomplished, for example, by patterning the gravure cylinder or roller so as to provide a discrete portion of the layer having a differing depth than other areas of the layer.","The multiple zones, for example, first, second and third zones, of the banded regions described herein may be applied in a single printing stage. When applied in a single printing stage, the zones containing add-on material are applied using an appropriately patterned gravure cylinder or roller. For example, for a banded region containing first, second and third zones, wherein only the first and third zones contain add-on material, the gravure cylinder or roller is patterned so as to apply add-on material only in the first and third zones.","An impression cylinder is mounted for counter-rotation on an axis parallel to the axis of the roller. In some applications, the impression cylinder includes a nonmetallic resilient surface. The impression cylinder is positioned between the roller and a backing roller, which is also mounted for rotation on an axis parallel to the axis of the roller and which counter-rotates relative to the impression cylinder. One of the functions provided by the backing roller is stiffening the central portions of the impression cylinder so that the uniform printing pressure is attained between the roller and the impression cylinder. The gravure cylinder or roller and the impression cylinder cooperate to define a nip through which the base web advances during the printing process. That nip is sized to pinch the base web as it moves between the gravure cylinder and the impression cylinder. The nip pressure on the base web ensures the correct transfer of the composition from the cylinder to the paper.","A reservoir contains the composition discussed above for forming banded regions on the wrapper. The reservoir communicates with a suitable pump which is capable of handling the viscous composition. The composition may then flow to a suitable heat exchanger where the temperature of the composition is elevated so that it lies in the range of about 100\u00b0 to about 140\u00b0 C. so that the viscosity of the composition is adjusted to a level which is suitable for gravure printing. As discussed above, viscosity for gravure printing usually needs to be less than about 200 cP. Preferably, the temperature of the composition is selected so that the viscosity is less than about 100 cP.","While a separate heat exchanger is disclosed, it may be desirable to provide thermal conditioning of the composition in the reservoir itself. For example, heating elements and stirring apparatus may be included in the reservoir to maintain the elevated temperature for the composition. Placement of the thermal conditioning in the reservoir has the advantage of making pump selection and operating requirements simpler since the pump need not handle the composition at the higher viscosity associated with lower temperatures because the composition would already be heated and, therefore, at the lower viscosity. Whether thermal conditioning occurs in the reservoir or in a separate heat exchanger, it is important that the thermal conditioning step occur at a temperature selected to avoid scorching the composition. Scorching can cause discoloration of the composition, and can affect the characteristics of the composition. Thus, scorching is to be avoided while the composition is subjected to thermal conditioning.","Regardless of where the thermal conditioning step occurs, the heated composition is delivered to a suitable applicator that spreads the composition along the length of the gravure cylinder. That spreading step may be effected by pouring or spraying the composition onto the gravure cylinder, or simply by delivering the liquid composition to a bath of composition that collects at the bottom of the gravure cylinder, between the gravure cylinder and a collector. The cylinder may be heated to prevent premature cooling of the composition.","Generally, the collector extends vertically around the gravure roller to a height sufficient to collect the bath, but to a height well below the top of the gravure cylinder. When the bath reaches the top of the collector, composition can flow through a drain at the bottom of the apparatus back into the reservoir. Thus, the composition circulates through the printing station and can be maintained at suitable printing viscosity by the thermal conditioning apparatus discussed above.","As the gravure cylinder rotates through the applicator and\/or the bath, the composition adheres to the surface of the gravure cylinder, including in the impressions provided therein to define the banded regions. Further rotation of the gravure cylinder toward the nip moves the cylinder surface past a suitable doctor blade. The doctor blade extends along the length of the gravure cylinder and is positioned so that is wipes the surface of the gravure cylinder. In this way, those portions of the gravure cylinder that define the nominal spacing between adjacent banded regions is essentially wiped clean of the composition, while engraved portions of the gravure cylinder that define the banded regions themselves advance toward the nip full of the composition.","As the wrapper and the surface of the gravure cylinder move through the nip, the composition is transferred to the surface of the wrapper. The linear speed or velocity of the wrapper matches the tangential surface speed of both the gravure cylinder and the impression cylinder as the wrapper passes through the nip. In that way, slippage and\/or smearing of the composition on the wrapper are avoided.","The thickness of the banded regions preferably is less than about 20% of the thickness of the base web, and may be less than 5% of the thickness of the base web. Thus, it is seen that the thickness of the printed layer is small in relation to the thickness of the underlying base web.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0192","num":"0194"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":["600","602","634","608","635","635","602","610","626","630","140","616","610","612"]},"The add-on material is delivered from a reservoir  to the applicator  by a suitable pump . Add-on material discharged from the pump  preferably passes through a heat exchanger  where the temperature of the add-on material is elevated to the range of about 100\u00b0 F. to about 140\u00b0 F. The heated add-on material then flows to the applicator  where it is spread on the gravure roller . Excess add-on material accumulates in the bath  from which excess add-on material returns to the reservoir . The add-on material preferably has the characteristics described more fully above so that the appropriate amount of add-on material can be applied to the base web  during a single printing application.","The following example of a solution used for single-pass printing of a patterned region on cigarette wrapper provides further foundation and background to explain the significance of the results now obtainable.","An aqueous starch solution was prepared by mixing Flow-Max 8, a tapioca-based oxidized starch available from National Starch and Chemical, with sufficient water to make an aqueous solution having an initial composition of 30% starch, by weight of solution. Then 1,2 propylene glycol and calcium carbonate were mixed or incorporated into the starch solution as additives. The weight of propylene glycol introduced was 25.7% of the weight of the starch used for the solution. The weight of the calcium carbonate introduced was 68.6% of the weight of the starch used for the solution.","The resulting printing solution was heated to a temperature in the range of about 100\u00b0 F. to about 140\u00b0 F. The final printing solution was applied as a pattern to a base web of cigarette wrapper having a nominal width of about 36 inches (i.e., about 920 mm) in a gravure printing press. The base web had a permeability of 60 CORESTA. The final printing solution was applied to the base web at a target rate of 33 to 41 BCM (billion cubic microns per square inch). The pattern for this example produced a plurality of parallel, solid bands extending across the nominal width of the base web, with each band having a width measured in the longitudinal direction of the base web of about 7 mm. Thereafter the base web was dried so that the printing solution dried.","Next, the base web was advanced under tension to a slitter where the nominal width of the base web was longitudinally cut into a plurality of strips, each strip having a width of about 27 mm\u2014the width required to surround a conventional tobacco rod and have a longitudinal glue seam. While the base web was still under tension, the plurality of strips were simultaneously wound as individual bobbins.","Wrapper from the bobbins was used to manufacture a plurality of cigarettes using conventional cigarette-making machinery.","The resulting cigarettes were tested for IP performance using the standard technique discussed above. Using the standard complement of cigarettes, cigarettes manufactured in this example gave IP performance of 0 in each of several IP tests.","Based on this example, as well as other studies, a better understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to manufacturability of print banded paper using aqueous starch printing solutions continues to evolve. Certain background information is helpful to place the significance of the present invention in context. Initially, it should be noted that aqueous starch solutions for patterned regions appear to overcome reported seam bursting problems that have been associated with use of, e.g., alginate-based solutions, in part because starch-based adhesives typically have been used for the longitudinal seam of a tobacco rod.","Potential wrinkling in the base web when aqueous-based printing solutions were used has been an area of concern. The wrinkling situation seems to result from use of aqueous printing solution having a low solids content. A low solids content appears to result in large amounts of water being available to interfere with the hydrogen bonding between fibers in the base web. When the base web is dried after printing, shrinkage occurs. Because the base web is under continual longitudinal tension, shrinkage in the longitudinal direction does not appear to be significant or troublesome, but shrinkage in the cross-web direction is both significant and troublesome. It is well known and documented that wetting and drying paper after its production gives rise to shrinkage. Thus, some shrinkage is to be expected from this process.","Without the use of an anti-wrinkling agent, the cross-web shrinkage has been observed to be as much as one inch in a 36 inch wide web\u2014i.e., on the order of 2.8%. Tension in the base web as the base web moves from the printing apparatus to the slitter and the bobbin winder, in the presence of cross-web shrinkage, gives rise to longitudinally extending waves in the base web between printed regions. As the base web passes over rollers between the printing apparatus and the bobbin winder, those waves can be pressed down to form creases. Once a crease forms, experience shows that it tends to continue for significant distances along the web.","At the slitter, the waves and creases cause a lack of precise location for the cut in the longitudinal direction with the result that, at the bobbin winder, paper edges of one bobbin can get wound into an adjacent bobbin so that subsequent separation of the adjacent bobbins becomes difficult or impossible.","The use of multiple printing stations to apply a sequence of registered applications of an aqueous printing solution has been observed to make the shrinkage, waviness, creasing, and slitting issues more pronounced.","While not wishing to be bound by these theories, shrinkage seems to result when unbounded or free water penetrates the base web, causing fibers to swell, breaking hydrogen bonds between fibers, allowing fiber movement, and shrinking during the drying process. For purposes of this discussion, bounded water refers to the quantity of water needed to associate with additives. For example, water is needed to dissolve starch, so there is bound water in an equivalent weight to the weight of starch. Similarly, propylene glycol is soluble in water, so it is assumed that there is bound water in an equivalent weight to the weight of propylene glycol. However, calcium carbonate is not meaningfully soluble in water, so no bound water is associated with calcium carbonate. Unbound, or free, water refers to the quantity or portion of water in excess of that needed for solubility of additives. It is believed that this unbounded or free water is operable to penetrate the base web and affect the fibers therein; while the bound water does not have that effect.","Existing multi-pass printing processes using aqueous solutions have low starch concentrations, e.g., about 15% to 25% starch. Such aqueous starch solutions have 85% to 75% water, respectively, with 15 to 25% being water bound to the starch, and 70% to 50%, respectively, being unbounded or free water. In contrast, a solution having the constituency described in the foregoing example at the time of printing has total water of about 52%, bounded water of about 31%, and unbounded water of about 21%. Thus, the solution of the preceding example, when compared to an equivalent amount of an aqueous starch solution, exhibits a reduction in unbounded water of more than about 50% (i.e., 21% compared to 50 to 70%).","Certainly, the application rate of printing solution to the underlying web can also have an effect on the penetration of free water into the base web. As noted, the single-pass printing process described in the preceding example applies the final printing solution at a target rate of 33 to 41 BCM. By contrast, a multiple pass printing operation may, for example, deposit layers at 3X, 3.5X, and 5X. From the table of equivalents set out above, those application rates correspond to 12.3 BCM, 13.6 BCM, and 22.4 BCM, respectively, or a total of about 48.3 BCM. Thus, a single printing pass process reduces the amount of printing solution used in comparison to a typical multiple-pass system\u2014even though the application rate for a single pass is greater than the application rate for any of the component passes of a typical multiple-pass system.","To briefly summarize, the single-pass printing process appears to reduce the free water available to penetrate the base web when compared to a typical multiple-pass process as the result of two phenomena: the single-pass process tends to use less total water in the applied printing solution than does the multiple-pass process; and the composition of the printing solution in single-pass system presents much less free water to penetrate the base web than does the typical multiple-pass process. There is an advantage in both reducing the amount of unbounded water and counteracting the unbounded water with an anti-wrinkling agent.","It should also be noted that the single-pass process with the printing compositions described herein provides a high solids content deposition that not only reduces the free water available for disruption of the underlying paper web but also provides the solid content appropriate for the observed IP performance.","It has also been found that while some shrinkage can be accommodated, a critical value for acceptable shrinkage in the printing process exists. Above that critical value, creasing of the base web occurs downstream of the printing operation as discussed above in more detail; however, below that critical value, the single-pass process of this invention results in wrinkle-free, crease-free paper that can be slit and wound on bobbins. The critical value for acceptable shrinkage has been found to be 1.04% of the nominal width of the base web. Using the printing solution described in the preceding example, the web shrinkage was found to be about 0.54% of the nominal width of the base web.","Based on the present understanding, the aqueous printing solution for the single-pass process, preferably includes 25% or more starch mixed in water with about 30 to about 80% chalk or calcium carbonate being added, where chalk content is expressed as a percentage of starch weight, and further including an effective amount of an anti-wrinkling agent, such as 1,2 propylene glycol. The effective amount of the anti-wrinkling agent corresponds to the amount needed to reduce the shrinkage at the printed pattern on the web to less than 1.04% of the nominal width of the web. Stated differently, with the effective amount of the anti-wrinkling agent, the nominal width of the base web is reduced by less than 1.04% at the pattern location. Alternatively, the printing solution includes an anti-wrinkling agent between about 20% and about 35% of the starch weight.","The presently preferred composition of the aqueous printing solution can also be expressed in weight percentages. More specifically, the aqueous solution preferably includes 25% (by weight) or more starch, calcium carbonate in the range of about 5% to about 30%, by weight, and an anti-wrinkling agent such as 1,2 propylene glycol in amount less than about 30%, by weight. Further, the calcium carbonate is more preferably present in the range of about 5% to about 20% by weight.","With respect to the composition of the printing solution, the increased starch concentration in the aqueous solution, as contrasted with prior aqueous solutions, appears to enhance the film-forming capabilities of the printing solution when applied to a base web. Having better film-forming functionality, less calcium carbonate is needed since there are fewer pin-holes in the base web that need to be filled or plugged.","The single-pass capability reduces registration requirements and promotes other efficiencies during printing.","When the word \u201cabout\u201d is used in this specification in connection with a numerical value, it is intended that the associated numerical value include a tolerance of \u00b110% around the stated numerical value.
