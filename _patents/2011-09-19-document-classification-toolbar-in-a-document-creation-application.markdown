title: Document classification toolbar in a document creation application
abstract: A toolbar in a document creation application provides the ability to classify documents based on specific properties such as security classification. The toolbar through dropdown selections allows users to select the appropriate classification and properties based upon the content of the document and have appropriate classifiers added to the document. Document classification properties are generated that are associated with the document in the document properties and by inserting visual markings that allow users to quickly identify the security, sensitivity, intended distribution or retention. By utilizing the classification toolbar a user can classify an document by one or more classification levels and be ensured that the classification will be visible to any person viewing the document.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11,877,616 filed Oct. 23, 2007, now issued U.S. Pat. No. 8,024,304, which claims priority from U.S. provisional application No. 60\/863,067 filed Oct. 26, 2006 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The present disclosure relates to computer systems and software, and in particular to electronic document management and security using a document classification toolbar.","Electronic documents commonly used in the corporate and government environments are generated being word processing applications, spreadsheets, slide presentations, the most common being Microsoft Office\u2122 application suite. With today's pervasive networking systems such as local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs) and the Internet, and software tools such as e-mail, it is very easy for individuals to move these documents around to different computers, computer systems and other individuals without little or no thought as to the sensitivity of the content contained therein. As a matter of security in the electronic workplace there is therefore a need to classify, manage and control the creation and flow of documents, e-mail correspondence and the like.","Some document management solutions allow the user to associate classifications to a document when a document is added to a document management repository governed by document management systems. These classification properties are stored in the document library database and are not actually attached to the document itself and are dependent on the document management system for identification and enforcement.","When a document is removed from the document management repository and sent to or shared with someone, it loses the associated properties because the properties are not part of the document. The classification may not also be visible on any printed copies of the document itself. As a result, the person receiving the document has no easy way to identify the classification of the document, and they therefore do not know what limitations should be placed on the handling and distribution of the document. In addition, compliance systems verifying the handling or distribution of the document have no way to decide what to do with the document as there are no properties attached to the document and potential contained in the document itself.","There is therefore a need for an improved classification and management system for electronic documents.","In an aspect there is provided a method for document classification in a document creation application comprising providing a security classification toolbar within an extendable mark-up language (XML) based word processing document in the document creation application, the classification toolbar providing a first classification selection input; populating the first security classification selection input in the classification toolbar with a plurality of security classification selections based upon pre-defined security classification criteria, the pre-defined classification criteria defining the plurality of security classification selections available to a user of the document creation application; receiving a first security classification selection input from the plurality of security classification selections, selected by the user, from the first security classification selections populated in the toolbar; applying visual cues associated with the selected first security classification input, the visual cues presented within editable text portions of the document in the document creation application to provide visual indication within the text of the document to identify that the document has been security classified based upon the selected first security classification; and assigning XML security classification properties to the document metadata embedded in the XML based word processing document identifying the first selected security classification input.","In accordance with another aspect there is provided a method for document classification in a document creation application comprising the steps: providing a classification toolbar within the document, the classification toolbar providing at least a first classification selection input; populating classification selections in the classification toolbar based upon pre-defined classification criteria; receiving identification of a selected text portion of the document from a user; receiving a portion classification selection input, selected by the user, from the classification selections populated in the toolbar; determining if portion classification input is valid based upon administrator defined classification policy; applying visual cues to the document to identify a portion of the document has been classified; applying visual markers identifying the selected classification at the beginning and end of the portion that has been classified; and applying XML properties within the document representing the classification of the portions.","In accordance with yet another aspect there is provided a non-transitory computer readable medium containing instructions for providing document classification in a document creation application, the instructions which when executed by a processor for performing providing a security classification toolbar within an extendable mark-up language (XML) based word processing document in the document creation application, the classification toolbar providing a first classification selection input; populating the first security classification selection input in the classification toolbar with a plurality of security classification selections based upon pre-defined security classification criteria, the pre-defined classification criteria defining the plurality of security classification selections available to a user of the document creation application; receiving a first security classification selection input from the plurality of security classification selections, selected by the user, from the first security classification selections populated in the toolbar; applying visual cues associated with the selected first security classification input, the visual cues presented within editable text portions of the document in the document creation application to provide visual indication within the text of the document to identify that the document has been security classified based upon the selected first security classification; and assigning XML security classification properties to the document metadata embedded in the XML based word processing document identifying the first selected security classification input.","Other aspects and features will become apparent to those ordinarily skilled in the art upon review of the following description of specific embodiment of the invention in conjunction with the accompanying figures.","It will be noted that throughout the appended drawings, like features are identified by like reference numerals.","Embodiments are described below, by way of example only, with reference to .","Due to compliance legislation such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States (or more precisely, the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002), policies such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), or other legal or corporate guidelines there is a need for greater security of information. Companies need to be able to determine the classification of documents so that their employees will handle information correctly in terms of privacy, security, distribution and retention. The best way to do this is to generate recognizable classification properties and visual markers in the documents when they are being created so that everyone will know the level of sensitivity of the documents and how to handle them.","By creating classification criteria metadata properties inserted in a document travel with the document and also allow automatic processes to check the handling of the document. For example, a messaging gateway or content scanner can verify the classification of documents being sent out of the company via e-mail for any violations of policy. In addition classification criteria can allow the automatic insertion of to visual cues to identify the associated classification in a standard manner. Heretofore, this cannot be done with productivity suites such as Microsoft\u2122 Office software, Adobe\u2122 Acrobat, OpenOffice\u2122, Corel\u2122 WordPerfect\u2122 Office and Microsoft Visio\u2122. Most document creation applications allow users to add optional properties to the document such as Title, Author, Subject, but cannot force the user to enter any properties before a document is saved or enforce classification standards. The document classification system described herein can force the user to select classification properties to be associated with the document, or portions therein, in addition to providing visual cues inserted within the document in standard format to ensure classification properties are appropriately identified and transmitted. Automatic insertion of visual markings in document including headers and footers in addition to advanced formatting capabilities which allow the user to apply the classification markings to specific areas of the header and footer (left justified, center, right justified etc.) to provide a consistent level of visibility not previously available. Custom properties that are associated with the document travel with the document and reflect the classification of the document can be integrated with rights management systems to limit access and distribution of document based upon the associated classification.","Event driven logic is utilized to force user to classify a documents before saving, sending or printing as described in more detail below. In addition to providing overall document classification, portions of the document can be classified at a different level than the document classification with unique classification markings associated to clearly identify the selected portion. All SAVE, PRINT and SEND events are interpreted within the document productivity software and ensure that classification selections have been made before these actions. Prevention or warning can be displayed when the user attempts to downgrade a classification of a document. In the downgrade prevent mode, if the user tries to downgrade the classification, for example from SECRET to UNCLASSIFIED, they can be prevented based upon the existing properties associated with it. Alternatively the document can be automatically classified based on the users profile. For example, all users in the finance department could be configured to automatically apply a classification of FINANCIAL INFO to all their documents. Visual markings within the document such as header, footer or watermarks can be automatically inserted based upon the selected classification.","Context sensitive classification selections which change based on user selection can also be provided by the toolbar. For example, if the user selects CONFIDENTIAL as a classification they can then be prompted to indicate which department generated the confidential information and how long the information should be retained as a corporate record.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["114","108","110","112","114","116","118","108","110","112","104","102","104","106","106","108","110","112","108","110","112"]},"Classification selection enables the automatic creation of properties that will travel with the document and may be enforced by document classification software either residing on the computer , , or , or by a central server . Trusted label support provides verification that classification of the document has not been modified (tampered with) which can be done by calculating a hash of the document properties on saving and recalculating the hash on re-opening of the document by the software operating on the client. In addition, the classification policy allows users to search a network or PC for documents with specific classifications. Automatic logging may be provided for all classification actions by the user can be provided which can be used to audit user compliance. For example all classification warnings, classification errors, or all classification events (who classified, when classification properties were assigned, name of document etc) can be logged and reviewed by an administrator. Digital rights management policies such as Windows No Print or No Change can also be applied and controlled.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","204","206","208","208","210","212","214","216"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","302","306","302","304","306","308"]},"The collection of classification properties can be context sensitive and the selections are configurable. For example, if the user selects Confidential as the security classification, they could then be prompted for a retention property or a distribution property. On the other hand, if the user selects Unclassified as the document type, there would be no need to collect any other classification properties.

The toolbar is built dynamically based on the user selections. As an example of a possible configuration, if the user selected a sensitivity of PERSONAL, no other selections are necessary. If the user selects a sensitivity of COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL the toolbar is dynamically configured to further prompt the user for the allowed distribution of the document (e.g. LEGAL DEPT ONLY). In this way the toolbar can expand as the user is entering the classification information. Only subsequent classification criteria associated with the first selection is dynamically presented in the toolbar as will be discussed in connection with .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","404"]},"It should be understood that although on two classification criteria are shown each in , a toolbar may present multiple classification criteria for selection by the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 3 & 4"],"b":["500","520","502","502","504","506","508","510","520","522","524"]},"Context sensitive text such as disclaimers can be added within the document body or within the header of footer portions. These disclaimers can be intelligently added to be tailored to the classification of the document and the associated content. For example, if UNCLASSIFIED was the selected classification the following text could be appended \u201cThis document is the property of XXX Corp. If you are not the intended recipient of the document please notify the originator\u201d, whereas a different postfix such as \u201cThis document has been marked as Confidential to XXX Corp. Unauthorized reproduction or transmission of the document is prohibited\u201d if the classification selected was CONFIDENTIAL. Visual cues such as font characteristics can also be used in the added text for instance color, special fonts, font size, or formatting (table etc) can all be applied to text.","Portions of the document content may also be classified independently of the overall document, however when a portion classification is selected which is higher then the document selection, the document properties may be upgraded to match the selection, such as for example a security or sensitivity related criteria. In document , paragraph  is selected by the user for individual classification. By making selections using toolbar , visual cues  and  can be added within the document to clearly identify the associate classification criteria. In this example a classification of SECRET has been selected and a caveat RelToUSA_CAN which is not the same as the current selected document caveat RelToNATO. The classification markings for portions are represented within the document as Extensible Markup Language (XML) properties of the document as shown in . In the case or Microsoft Word, for example, the base XML version of the document is modified with custom classification properties which represent the classification portion markings and the overall document classification. The markings may be custom to the application or organization or may be defined as per the Intelligence Community Classification and Control Markings Manual also known as the CAPCO Guide.","High level functions are available to the user when composing a document through operation of the toolbar. These functions are also available if the user wants to apply classification information to an opened document that currently has no classification properties, or an opened document that already has assigned classifications. Classification selection can be forced on Save, Exit or Print from a pop-up dialog rather than presenting a classification toolbar. In addition a downgrade warning for preventing downgrades when Saving or Printing can also be provided. Although a word processing document is shown should be understood that the application of the classification criteria is equally applicable to any form of document, including but not limited to Microsoft Word\u2122, Excel\u2122 and PowerPoint\u2122 formats.

Administrators can define associated RMS permissions such as Read, Full Control, Printing, Copy and Paste, and document expiration based on the classification label chosen. The RMS permissions or templates are defined within the Microsoft RMS Administration tool. Once these RMS permissions are defined they can be associated with classification criteria. This is done via Windows registry settings that indicate to the document classification toolbar if RMS protection should be automatically assigned based on a classification selection by the user. If RMS protection is to be applied, then another Windows registry would be used to indicate what protection should be assigned for each classification. As an example, a presentation assigned an HR ONLY label could be automatically assigned RMS permissions that would not allow anyone outside the HR department to view the presentation. The Document Classification Administration tool sets the correct Windows Registry settings based on the configuration selected by the administrator. These settings can then be applied to user desktops using scripts or Microsoft Group Policy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","802","804","806","808"]},"Administrator defined settings are captured in the configuration file which is the central source of configuration information.
