{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS Overview","Detailed Description"],"p":["The present disclosure generally relates to moderation by a content provider of media content items (e.g., image files, audio clips, video clips, text files, etc.) that are supplied by users of the content provider. An example content provider can be a website service that enables registered users to upload media content items via a wide area network such as the Internet.","A content provider in a wide area network such as the Internet can permit registered users to upload media content items for distribution to other registered users accessing the content provider. Example content providers can include social network websites (e.g., YouTube\u2122, Facebook\u2122, etc.), or bulletin board websites that enable registered users to post online messages. Content providers, however, can establish policies that prohibit posting \u201cinappropriate content\u201d, defined in the policies for example based on copyright permissions, age-appropriate content (e.g., no pornographic material), no hateful or offensive material, etc. Hence, any media content item that is deemed inappropriate by the content provider can be deleted by one or more persons assigned as \u201cmoderators\u201d by the content provider. Inappropriate content can be detected via different techniques: manual inspection of a media content item by a moderator prior to distribution suffers from the disadvantage of not being scaleable because the amount of uploaded content can quickly overwhelm moderator capacity; collaborative moderation enables users of a website to collectively determine whether content is inappropriate based on a prescribed minimum number of users rating or \u201cflagging\u201d content as inappropriate.","Content providers also can delegate their moderation responsibilities to a moderation firm: the moderation firm retains sole and exclusive responsibility for moderating content on behalf of these content providers. Example moderation firms include Caleris, Inc. (available at the website address \u201ccaleris.com\u201d) and eModeration, Inc. (available at the website address \u201cemoderation.com\u201d).","In one embodiment, a method comprises registering content providers, each content provider having a corresponding independent moderation policy configured for selectively providing network access to a media content item supplied by a user; receiving, from a first of the content providers, a first notification that a first media content item has been moderated by the first content provider; and sending a second notification to at least a second of the content providers, the second notification identifying that the first content provider has moderated the first media content item, the second notification enabling the second content provider to moderate the first media content item based on the second notification and according to the corresponding independent moderation policy of the second content provider.","In another embodiment, an apparatus comprises a processor circuit and a network interface circuit. The processor circuit is configured for registering content providers into a database. Each content provider has a corresponding independent moderation policy configured for selectively providing network access to a media content item supplied by a user. The network interface circuit is configured for receiving, from a first of the content providers via an Internet Protocol (IP) network, a first notification that a first media content item has been moderated by the first content provider. The processor circuit also is configured for generating a second notification for transmission by the network interface circuit to at least a second of the content providers. The second notification identifies that the first content provider has moderated the first media content item. The second notification enables the second content provider to moderate the first media content item based on the second notification and according to the corresponding independent moderation policy of the second content provider.","Particular embodiments enable content providers (e.g., web site services) to share moderation decisions regarding the same or similar media content items. The moderation decisions can be shared based on a notification from a first of the content providers having moderated a given media content item (also referred to herein as an \u201coriginating content provider\u201d), based on the originating content provider having executed a moderation decision according to a corresponding independent moderation policy. The independent moderation policy can include manual action by an administrator, or collaborative moderation by authorized users of the originating content provider. The moderation of a given media content item can include any one of blocking access (i.e, removing access) to a media content item, restricting access of the media content item to authorized users (e.g., based on age verification or agreement to view content considered offensive, etc.), or granting approval for unlimited access to the media content item.","The notification from the originating content provider can be received by a moderation server. The moderation server can output to at least a second content provider (also referred to herein as a \u201cdestination content provider\u201d) a notification identifying that the originating content provider has moderated the given media content item. The moderation server also can specify within the notification to the second content provider a recommendation as to how the given media content item should be moderated, based on the respective independent moderation policies of the originating content provider and the destination content provider.","Hence, a content provider can moderate access to a given media content item according to its independent moderation policy, and based on notification that another content provider has already moderated the same or similar media content item. Hence, a content provider can utilize the moderation decisions of other content providers, enabling the same content to be automatically moderated by the content provider. The example embodiments illustrated herein can be particularly effective for blocking or restricting the attempted distribution of the media content item by the same user at the different content providers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","10","14","16","14","12","18","14","14","18"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["12","12","12","12","12","12","30","30"],"i":["a","b","c","d","e","f"]},"The term \u201ccontent provider\u201d as used herein refers to a Internet Protocol (IP) network-based entity (e.g., website service, messaging service, etc.) that has its own corresponding set of registered users, and that has its own independent moderation policy for selectively providing network access to a media content item supplied by one of the registered users. Hence, if an individual user (A) of one of the user devices  wants to subscribe to the services of the separate and distinct content providers and , the individual user must complete separate and distinct registrations with each of the content providers and . Since the content providers and are distinct from each other, the individual user (A) could use either the same user name (e.g., user A subscribes to the content provider as \u201cJohn\u201d and content provider as \u201cJohn\u201d) or a different user name, depending on the user name availability of the content providers and ","The moderation server  includes a network interface circuit , a processor circuit , and a memory circuit . Any of the disclosed circuits , , and  of the moderation server  can be implemented in multiple forms. Example implementations of the disclosed circuits include hardware logic that is implemented in a logic array such as a programmable logic array (PLA), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), or by mask programming of integrated circuits such as an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). The processor circuit  can be implemented using a multi-processor system (e.g., having multiple central processing units (CPUs) operating in parallel within a single computer system), or a single CPU. Any of these circuits also can be implemented using a software-based executable resource that is executed by a corresponding internal processor circuit such as a microprocessor circuit (not shown), where execution of executable code stored in an internal memory circuit (e.g., within the memory circuit ) causes the processor circuit to store application state variables in processor memory, creating an executable application resource (e.g., an application instance) that performs the operations of the circuit as described herein. Hence, use of the term \u201ccircuit\u201d in this specification refers to both a hardware-based circuit that includes logic for performing the described operations, or a software-based circuit that includes a reserved portion of processor memory for storage of application state data and application variables that are modified by execution of the executable code by a processor circuit. The memory circuit  can be implemented, for example, using a non-volatile memory such as a programmable read only memory (PROM) or an EPROM, and\/or a volatile memory such as a DRAM, etc.","Further, any reference to \u201coutputting a message\u201d (or the like) can be implemented based on creating the message in the form of a data structure and storing that data structure in a tangible memory medium in the disclosed apparatus (e.g., in a transmit buffer). Any reference to \u201coutputting a message\u201d (or the like) also can include electrically transmitting (e.g., via wired electric current or wireless electric field, as appropriate) the message stored in the tangible memory medium to another network node via a communications medium (e.g., a wired or wireless link, as appropriate) (optical transmission also can be used, as appropriate). Similarly, any reference to \u201creceiving a message\u201d (or the like) can be implemented based on the disclosed apparatus detecting the electrical (or optical) transmission of the message on the communications medium, and storing the detected transmission as a data structure in a tangible memory medium in the disclosed apparatus (e.g., in a receive buffer). Also note that the memory circuit  can be implemented dynamically by the processor circuit , for example based on memory address assignment and partitioning executed by the processor circuit .","The network interface circuit  is configured for establishing a physical communication link  with the wide-area network  using associated network machines (e.g., link layer switches such as Ethernet switches, network layer routers such as Internet Protocol (IP) routers, firewall devices, etc.). Hence, the network interface circuit  can be configured for receiving, via the wide area network , a notification message  or a query message  from a content provider (e.g., ). The notification message  from an originating content provider (e.g., ) also can be referred to as a provider-initiated notification message.","Each content provider  can be configured, according to its corresponding independent moderation policy, to output a notification message  and\/or a query message  in response to a corresponding registered user having supplied the media content item. For example, a content provider  can be configured for sending a notification message  to the moderation server  only if the media content item supplied by the registered user is blocked (i.e., access is removed) by the content provider ; alternately, the content provider  can be configured for sending a notification message  for each moderation decision (e.g., a favorable decision granting unlimited access, an unfavorable decision restricting or blocking access) related to the media content item. Each content provider  also can be configured for sending a query  to determine whether a media content item has been previously moderated, and also for sending a notification message  in response to subsequent moderation, for example based on a recommendation specified in a notification message  from the moderation server, the notification message  specifying whether the recommendation was followed or whether an alternate moderation decision was executed. The content provider also can be configured for outputting update notifications  if the moderation status of a given media content item has changed.","The network interface circuit  of the moderation server  also can be configured for outputting a moderation server-initiated notification message. The network interface circuit  also is configured for providing a data connection  to the moderation database . The processor circuit  also can be configured for generating the moderation server-initiated notification message  based on the provider-initiated notification message  and content provider attribute records  stored in the moderation database : the moderation server-initiated notification message  can be generated for example in response to detecting that another content provider (e.g., ) has subscribed to monitor moderation activities of the originating content provider , described in further detail below with respect to  and ; the moderation server-initiated notification message  also can be generated for example in response to receiving a query message  from one of the content providers (e.g., ), described in further detail below with respect to  and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 1","FIGS. 2A and 2B"],"b":["14","14","12"]},"Referring to , the processor circuit  of the moderation server  can be configured for registering in step  each of the content providers  based on storing a content provider attribute record  for each content provider  into the moderation database . For example, the processor circuit  and the content providers  can be configured for executing selected operations of the above-identified Cisco Eos\u2122 platform, enabling the moderation server  to communicate with each of the content providers  according to a prescribed messaging protocol (e.g., a \u201cpublic services layer\u201d or Application Programming Interface (API)), where either the moderation server  or the corresponding content provider  can initiate the registration process. The processor circuit  also can be configured for storing the corresponding content provider attribute record  in the moderation database  according to a prescribed database record storage protocol, for example the commercially available MySQL, PHP, Java Tomcat, or Oracle Database. The content provider attribute record  stored for the corresponding content provider  also can describe the corresponding independent moderation policy  for the corresponding content provider , described below with respect to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A and 3B","b":["36","36","36","36","44","12","44","46","48","50","52"],"i":["a ","b"]},"The internal moderation policy implementation attribute  can specify the manner in which moderation decisions are executed with respect to new media content items, supplied by any registered users of the corresponding content provider , for which there is no prior moderation decision. For example, the internal moderation policy implementation attribute  for the content provider attribute record of  specifies that the content provider can execute moderation decisions based on any one of collaborative moderation among registered users, or based on manual control by an authorized administrator (e.g., a moderator). In contrast, the internal moderation policy implementation attribute  for the content provider attribute record of  specifies that the content provider requires an authorized administrator (e.g., a moderator) to moderate all new media content items supplied by registered users of the corresponding content provider . Hence, the internal moderation policy implementation attribute  illustrates that the content provider implements a more flexible independent moderation policy that permits collaborative moderation between registered users, whereas the content provider implements a more restrictive independent moderation policy.","The moderation sensitivity attribute  can identify the relative sensitivity of the targeted registered users with respect to media content items. For example, the content provider of  may establish a relatively low sensitivity  based on providing adult-related content for adult entertainment: such a relatively low sensitivity  may be deemed appropriate by the administrator of the content provider based on the content provider requiring substantially restrictive requirements for user registration (e.g., user must verify he or she is over 21 years old, user must provide credit card authorization and verification, etc.). In contrast, the content provider may establish a relatively high level of sensitivity  (illustrated in  as \u201cVery Sensitive\u201d) based on providing media content items that must be appropriate for children ages 6-12 having registered with parental permission, where the content provider has guaranteed that only age-appropriate content will be supplied to the registered users. The content provider may establish a moderate level of sensitivity  (illustrated in  as \u201cMedium Sensitivity\u201d) for a broader consumer market based on requiring users during registration to confirm that they are at least 16 years of age. As described in further detail below, the processor circuit  can generate recommendations for the content providers  based on comparing the moderation sensitivity  of different content providers .","The trusted site list  can specify other content providers  that are trusted by the administrator of the corresponding content provider . For example, the independent operation policy  for the content provider specifies in the corresponding trusted site list  that the content providers , , and are trusted by the administrator of the content provider ; the independent moderation policy  for the content provider specifies in the corresponding trusted site list  another children-targeted content provider (\u201cNeopets\u2122\u201d) is trusted by the administrator of the content provider . Hence, the processor circuit  can generate automatic recommendations for content providers , enabling a content provider (e.g., ) to automatically moderate a media content item based on the moderation decision of another content provider listed in the corresponding trusted site list . Other attributes can be specified within the independent moderation policy , for example accepted media types (e.g., audio, video, photos, etc.), permissible or impermissible subject matter or bias in order to further limit content to media content items that are relevant or desirable by the registered users.","The notification-recommendation rules  can specify rules that are established by the administrator of the corresponding content provider , enabling the processor circuit  determine the type of notification that should be sent to the corresponding content provider. For example, one of the notification-recommendation rules  for the content provider can specify that the processor circuit  should generate and send to the content provider a moderation server-initiated notification message  specifying a moderation recommendation for the content provider , namely block access (i.e., remove access) to a specified media content item if one trusted site blocks the identified media content item, enabling the corresponding administrator to moderate the specified media content item based on following the moderation decision of the trusted site. Another of the notification-recommendation rules  can specify the processor circuit  should specify within the message  a recommendation for automatic moderation, enabling the content provider to automatically moderate (i.e., without the necessity of any involvement by the corresponding administrator) the specified media content item. As illustrated in  with respect to the notification-recommendation rules  of the content provider , the processor circuit  can generate different moderation recommendations, for example a recommendation notification to block, or an automatic moderation notification to block, based on the number and\/or the respective moderation sensitivities of content providers  having previously generated the moderation decision, and based on whether those content providers  are trusted sites. Since the content provider has a relatively high level of sensitivity  due to the registered users being children ages 6-12, the corresponding notification-recommendation rules  illustrated in  can cause the processor circuit  to send a notification  recommending automatic moderation by blocking the identified media content item if any medium or non-sensitive site blocks the identified media content item; similarly, the notification-recommendation rules  for the content provider can cause the processor circuit  to specify in the notification  a moderation recommendation for the administrator of the content provider to allow (i.e., approve) access to the specified media content item if one trusted site (identified in the corresponding trusted site list ) approves the identified content.","Hence, the moderation recommendation generated by the processor circuit  and specified in the moderation server-initiated notification message  destined for a given content provider (e.g., ) can be based on the respective independent moderation policies executed by other content providers (e.g., , , and ) for the same or similar media content item.","Although a content provider (e.g., ) can automatically execute moderation decisions based on moderation decisions of other content providers  (e.g., based on corresponding notification rules  following moderation decisions of content providers  specified in a trusted site list ), the corresponding moderation policy for each content provider  is \u201cindependent\u201d because the moderation policy cannot be controlled by any other content provider  or the moderation server . Hence, each content provider  maintains final control over its own independent moderation policy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 4A"],"b":["38","38","38","22","28","12","38","38","38","12","36","12","38","38","38","38","1","38","2","38","62","64","38","66"],"i":["a ","b","a ","b","a","a","b"]},"Referring again to , assume in step  that one of the content providers \u201cA\u201d (e.g., ) receives a media content item that is supplied (i.e., uploaded) by a registered user via one of the user devices  of . In response to the content provider receiving the media content item from the registered user, the content provider can send a message  or  the moderation server , via the wide-area network , which is received by the network interface circuit  via the corresponding data link  in step  and forwarded to the processor circuit .","The processor circuit  determines in step  whether the received message is a provider-initiated moderation notification message  from an originating content provider , or a query message . If the processor circuit  determines in step  that the received message is a provider-initiated moderation notification message  from the originating content provider (e.g., ) specifying that a specific media content item (e.g., \u201cX\u201d) has been moderated, the processor circuit  can create in step  a moderation log entry  specifying that the content provider \u201cA\u201d has moderated an identified media content item. The processor circuit stores in step  the corresponding moderation log entry  in the moderation database .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["28","12","66","66","28","16","22"],"i":"c "},"The provider-initiated notification message  can include media content metadata  describing the media content item , and moderation metadata  describing the corresponding moderation action executed by the originating content provider . For example, the provider-initiated notification message  can specify an originating moderator field identifying the moderator having moderated the corresponding media content item , illustrated as the collaborative moderation element of the originating content provider (\u201cYouTube\u2122 Collaborative Moderation\u201d). The moderation metadata  also includes an action field specifying the moderation decision that was executed by the moderator specified in the originating moderator field , for example blocking, restricting, or allowing access to the corresponding media content item . The moderation metadata  also can specify a moderation reason field specifying the reason that the moderation decision was executed, for example the corresponding media content item  was deemed offensive or violent.","Additional information may be specified in the moderation metadata  that enables the processor circuit  to determine whether a destination content provider  should receive a notification message  regarding the media content item , and\/or determine the type of moderation recommendation that should be specified in the notification message  for the destination content provider. In addition, multi-tiered moderation decisions can be employed by each of the content providers  and the moderation server , for example, restricting content based on multi-tiered user classification, e.g., children tier, teenager tier, general public tier, adult tier, restricted adult tier, etc.","The media content metadata  can specify multiple fields that enable the processor circuit  to compare the moderated media content item  with other media content items to determine whether there is a match indicating the same or similar media content item. For example, the media content metadata  can include a media content identifier field specifying a unique identifier (e.g., \u201cID1\u201d) that uniquely identifies the moderated media content item  within the system . For example, the originating content provider can be configured for choosing the unique identifier from a prescribed range of identifiers assigned to the originating content provider . The media content metadata  also can include: a media type field specifying the media type (e.g., audio, video, image, etc.); a media title field specifying a title assigned to the media content item ; a location field identifying an addressable location of the media content item ; a thumbnail location field specifying one or more addressable locations of sample portions of the media content item  (e.g., thumbnail images for video files, short-duration audio or video clips for audio or video files, etc.); a length field specifying the relative length or size of the media content item  (e.g., duration in seconds for audio or video files, x-y pixel dimensions for image files, etc.); a data size field specifying the data size of the media content item ; and a filename field  specifying the original filename of the media content item  as uploaded from the user device .","The media content metadata  also can include information about the registered user that supplied the moderated media content item , for example a user name field specifying the user name of the registered user having supplied the moderated media content item ; and a user device address field specifying the device address (e.g., Media Access Control (MAC) address) and\/or network address (e.g., IP address) of the user device  used to supply the moderated media content item  to the originating content provider ","Hence, the processor circuit  can utilize the media content metadata  to determine whether the moderated media content item  matches another media content item, described in further detail below. Use of the user name can be applicable in the event that a user tends to use the same registered user name for different content providers ; use of the user device address field can be applicable if the same user device  (or same network location) is used to upload the same or similar media content items  different content providers: hence, the processor circuit  can identify if the same user, the same user device, and\/or the same network location is used to supply media content items to different content providers .","Referring to , the processor circuit  creates in step  the moderation log entry  in response to receiving the moderation notification message . As illustrated in , the moderation log entry  (e.g., , , or ) can specify the media content item metadata , the moderation metadata , and optionally a copy of the media content item  supplied in the provider-initiated notification message .","The processor circuit  determines in step  whether any of the content providers  have enabled auto-notification, for example based on the processor circuit  parsing the content provider attribute records , or based on a separate data structure identifying content providers  that have requested auto notification. Assuming the processor circuit  determines in step  that the moderation database  includes at least one data structure identifying one or more of the content providers  have requested auto-notification, the processor circuit  generates and sends in step  a notification message  to the content providers  (e.g., \u201cB\u201d, \u201cC\u201d) having subscribed to monitor the moderation decisions of the originating content provider (e.g., \u201cA\u201d).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2A"],"b":["32","22","22","32","66","22","32","74","66","22","76","28","14","38","56","58","60"],"i":["a ","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":["32","72","74","76","64","38","12","66","62","22","72","74","76","44","12","44","12","44","22","72","74","76","48","12","52","50","64"]},"As illustrated in , the content providers \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d receive respective moderation notifications and , where the moderation notification can include a moderation recommendation  for the administrator of the content provider \u201cB\u201d to restrict access to the media content item \u201cX\u201d, and the moderation notification recommends an automatic moderation (e.g., automatically block access)  for the media content item \u201cX\u201d.","Hence, the example of  enables the subscribed destination content providers \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d  to be automatically notified of moderated content, even before a user has uploaded the same or similar media content item to the content provider. The automatic notification enables the destination content provider (e.g., \u201cB\u201d or \u201cC\u201d)  to moderate in step  of  the same media content item, based on the notification or , and according to the corresponding moderation policy of the destination content provider, in order to proactively moderate the media content item as it is supplied by the user to the destination content provider.","The processor circuit  of the moderation server  also can be configured for responding to queries  from a content provider  regarding a specified media content item  received by the content provider . If in step  the message received by the network interface circuit  of the moderation server  is not a moderation notification message , the processor circuit  determines in step  that the received message is a query  as to whether a specified media content item \u201cY\u201d has been moderated (e.g., restricted, block, or approved) by another content provider .","The processor circuit  is configured for comparing in step  the specified media content item \u201cY\u201d with the moderation log entries  to determine whether there is a match with the same or a similar media content item identified in the moderation database .

The processor circuit  generates and outputs in step  a response  that the media content item is a new media content item that has not been moderated (favorably or unfavorably). As illustrated in , the originating content provider \u201cA\u201d also can send in step  a provider-initiated notification message  if the media content item \u201cY\u201d is later moderated (e.g., restricted), causing the processor circuit  to create in step  a moderation log entry .","Assuming in step  of  that the processor circuit  identifies a match between the media content item \u201cY\u201d specified in the query  and a media content item \u201cZ\u201d identified in a moderation log entry , the processor circuit  can generate and output in step , via the network interface circuit , a notification .
