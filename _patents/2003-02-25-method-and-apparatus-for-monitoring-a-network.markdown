When content is replicated via the system throughout the country, or throughout the world, users can have quicker access to it than if it resides on one Web site. CDNs can be provided, for example, by content delivery organizations such as Akamai, by large Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or by large enterprises. A CDN can be implemented as an overlay to a traditional internet protocol (IP) network, and functions or operates based on layers 4-7 of the IP protocol stack. Layers 1-7 are defined in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) model. A discussion of computer network protocols and layers of the ISO model is discussed, for example, in \u201cInterconnections, Second Edition,\u201d by Radia Perlman (Addison-Wesley, 2000), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","As referenced herein, a \u201ccontent device\u201d is a networking device that plays a role in a CDN, by a) storing or manipulating content, or b) processing requests for content, in the CDN. As referenced in this document, \u201ccontent distribution path\u201d represents a logical path between a source and a destination, as defined by a logical relationship existing at layers 4-7 of the overlay network of the CDN. Caches store content, and process or respond to requests for content. In the context of a CDN, a content device called a \u201crouter\u201d processes requests for content but does not deliver or receive the content. Generally, devices that handle IP packets in a traditional fashion are not \u201ccontent devices\u201d. Thus, layer 1-3 devices, for example those beneath the CDN overlay network, are not \u201ccontent devices\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"300"},"The site tier can also show or display site level statistics and reports, other broad-based displays or views, and customer focused displays or views.","Referring to , a service tier  appears below the site tier . The service tier  includes a map containing content-based relationships between devices in the network. For example, in accordance with exemplary embodiments the service tier  includes information  regarding content resolution within the network, information  regarding streaming media within the network, and information regarding content distribution within the network.","Content distribution information  can be mapped or shown as in , content resolution information  can be mapped or shown as in , and streaming media information , such as streaming media paths or activities within the network can be shown as in .","The map or display  of content distribution information  shown in  illustrates cache deployment in a CDN, or in other words, distribution of electronic content or data to caches in the CDN. As shown in , the CDN includes a management computer such as the content manager  (CM-1). The CDN can include a plurality of management computers, as demonstrated for example by the content manager  (CM-2). As shown in , electronic data is distributed from an origin , and specifically from the content manager . Content switches in the CDN, such as the content switch , process requests for content but do not receive or transmit the content. A content switch can act as a load-balancer. For example, the content switch  (CS-5) in  can receive a content request from a user and can relay the request to the cache  (Also labeled as \u201cCache-10\u201d), the web server , or the web server  for fulfillment.","As shown in , the content manager  provides data directly to caches , , , , and . The content manager  also provides data to clusters ,  or caches. The cluster  contains caches ,  and the cluster  contains caches , . The Internet Data Center (IDC)  references a physical site with physical equipment, and includes a cache , web servers ,  and a content switch .","There can be multiple origins of data within the network. For example,  also shows a second origin , including a second content manager  that also distributes data to caches in the network, and a content switch  (CS-6). The second origin  also includes web servers ,  and a cache . The content manager  provides the data directly to the caches , , , , and . A cache can receive data from different origins or content managers. For example, the caches , ,  receive data from both of the content managers , .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","206"]},"In the parent-child type link, when a child cache receives a request for content that it does not have, the child cache contacts a cache that has a parent relationship to the child cache and requests the content from the parent cache. This relationship is represented in  as a solid line segment with a single arrowhead at one end, with the arrow pointing from a child to a parent. See, for example, the link connecting the cache  (also labeled as \u201cCache 13\u201d) and the cache  (also labeled as \u201cCache 4\u201d), which indicates that the cache  is a parent to the cache , and the cache  is a child to the cache . In an exemplary embodiment, a child cache can have multiple parent caches, as shown for example in  where the child cache  has two parent caches , .","In the sibling-sibling type link, either cache can request content from the other cache. This link is represented in  as a solid line segment with two arrowheads, one at each end of the line segment. For example,  shows that the caches ,  are sibling caches so that the cache  can request content from the cache , and vice versa.","The multicast link is represented in  as a line segment formed by two parallel solid lines spaced apart and bounded with an arrowhead at each end. For example, the cache  has multicast links to each of the caches , , and . A cache can \u201cmulticast\u201d by simultaneously requesting content from all caches that are connected to it with a multicast link. In an exemplary embodiment, each direct multicast link is a two-way link (as indicated by an arrowhead on each end of line segment), so that either cache on each end of the link can send a content request to the other cache. For example, the cache  can simultaneously request content from the caches , , and . However, the cache  has only one multicast link, to the cache , and thus when it multicasts a content request, the request would go only to the cache . In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, a multicast link can be unidirectional instead of bidirectional.","If a first cache receives a request from a second cache for content that the first cache does not have, the first cache can request the content from other caches, and convey the content back to the second cache after obtaining the content. For example, the cache  can request content from the cache . If the cache  does not have the content, then it can multicast a request for the content to the caches ,  (and ). After receiving the content, the cache  can then transfer the content to the cache .","In the event that a first cache requests content from another cache or from other caches and does not receive the requested content, the first cache can contact an origin or content manager directly to request the content. In the event the first cache is unable to obtain the content and the first cache is attempting to obtain the content at the request of another entity (for example, a user or another cache), the first cache can generate a message indicating the content has not been obtained, and send the message to the entity (for example, a user or another cache) that requested the content from the first cache.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["206","503","102","505","505","507","507","511","509","513","515","511","515","102"]},"The media stream flowing along the path between the router  and the stream server  can be the same as the media stream flowing along the path between the router  and the router , so that the media stream flowing from the stream server  to the router  is split when it departs the router . Alternatively, media streams flowing to the stream servers ,  can also be different, for example so that two different media streams both flow from the stream server  to the router , but take different communication paths after departing the router . This principle or possibility applies in the same way to other communication paths shown in , wherever paths fork.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["503","521","523","523","517","519","529","531"]},"In addition,  shows a communication path beginning from a stream server  in the origin . This communication path flows from the stream server  to a router , and from the router  two communication paths are shown. A first communication path extends from the router  sequentially through a router  and the stream server  to the network . The second communication path flows or extends from the router  to the router . From the router  two communication paths are shown, A first communication path flowing from the router  through the stream server  to the network , and the second communication path flowing or extending from the router  through the stream server  to the network .","The streaming media paths shown in  can be discovered using an exemplary technique shown in . This technique uses an IP (Internet Protocol) Record Route option at the Layer 3 of a network complying with the ISO model, or a similar mechanism available via other communication protocols in use within the network, in combination with a series of listeners and some management station processing. Specifically, the Record Route option is invoked to cause IP packets in a media stream to record the IP addresses of routers and gateways they pass through or transit. Then, listeners located near an outer boundary of the network collect the recorded IP addresses from IP packets leaving the network. A packet's list of recorded IP addresses indicates the path it took through the network, and in this way the streaming media pathways through the network are discerned.","As an alternative, or in addition to invoking the Record Route option where appropriate, the listeners can also look for packets that originated at one or more particular sources within the network and that contain streaming media. If these packets do not have the Record Route option set, then path information would include the origins of the packets and the locations of the listeners that detected them, in essence the endpoints of the paths the packets took through the network. These features and principles are described in greater detail in U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/372,450.","The Record Route can be enabled by the sending application, for example by the streaming servers ,  in the origins ,  shown in , or by the streaming servers ,  shown in . Once this option is enabled, each data packet will record the IP address of each router or gateway it passes through, in its packet header.","Thus, packets flowing along the  streaming media path  extending from the stream server  through the router , the router  and the router , will record the addresses of these routers. Packets flowing along the streaming media path  extending from the stream server  through the router , and the router  will record the addresses of these routers , . Packets flowing along the streaming media path  extending from the stream server  through the router  and the router  will record the addresses of these routers , . A router  connected between the router  and an edge system  having an IP listener  are also shown in , as well as other networks ,  and  connected respectively to edge systems ,  and  through an outer boundary  of the network containing the communication paths , , .","In accordance with exemplary embodiments, an \u201cIP Listener\u201d , , , which can be a software agent located in an edge system or edge device such as the edge systems , ,  within the network and near an outer boundary  of the network as shown in , observes packets flowing through it and detects packets having both a) the Record Route option set, and b) a Streaming Protocol designated as the IP ULP (Upper Layer Protocol). From each such detected packet, the listener , ,  collects the recorded list of IP addresses, and then adds a) the source IP address to the front of the list, and b) its own IP address to the end of the list, to form a list indicating a stream or communication path beginning at the origin and ending at the listener , . The listener , ,  can gather data from packets it detects and then at the end of a periodic time interval or when it has gathered a specific amount of data, the listener , ,  can send the collected data to a central monitoring system. For example,  shows collection paths ,  from the listeners ,  respectively to the central monitoring system , via which the listeners forward the collected data. Since a communication path or stream is not present through the edge system , a collection path from the listener  is not shown.","The central monitoring system  (or any other designated device and\/or software) processes the collected data and then maps, or provides refined information with which to map, the streaming media paths in the network in a map display, as for example in . The system  can include a processor  and a display . The system  together with the IP Listeners , ,  can for example perform the method shown in , for example consistent with .","The central monitoring system can be the system or agent that forms and presents the map displays, or can be a system or agent that cooperates with the system or agent responsible for the map display. Each listener can be a dedicated unit, or can be implemented in software on an existing system hardware resource. In addition, the listener can assign an identifier or label to each unique path, track the frequency or the number of times each unique path is used during the periodic time interval, and provide this information along with the collected data to the central monitoring system. Thus at the end of the periodic time interval, each listener can provide data to the central monitoring system including paths as defined by strings or lists of addresses such as IP addresses, path identifiers, and path counts. The listeners can be organized to report to the central monitoring system at the same time, or to report at staggered times. The listeners can also be organized into groups, where each group reports to the central monitoring system at a different time.","The service level tier can provide or show statistics and reports, other broad-based displays or views, and\/or customer-focused displays or views.","Referring to , an operations tier  appears below the service tier .

accordance with exemplary embodiments, the status (for example, Critical, Warning, Normal) on CDN nodes\/site icon in the CDN Map and Device Table can be updated in a variety of ways. For example, in accordance with exemplary embodiments status updates can be a) be operations-based only (OVO), or b) IP-based only (for example, Hewlett Packard Openview Network Node Manager), or based on both OVO operations status and NNM IP status. In accordance with exemplary embodiments, OVO node status can be correlated with NNM (Network Node Manager) node status.","In accordance with exemplary embodiments, if the status in CDN Site Map and Device Table is NNM-based only, then a) CDN objects are made into NNM objects; and\/or b) CDN objects are correlated with NNM objects so that when NNM objects obtain updates, the CDN objects get updated too; and\/or c) CDN objects and NNM objects are independent objects and NNM APIs are used to verify if the IP device (for the CDN device) is stored in the NNM top db (if yes, then APIs are used to obtain the status of the device); and\/or d) a SNMP trap is employed.","In accordance with exemplary embodiments, if the status in CDN Site Map and Device Table is OVO-based only, then an OVO API can be used to obtain the OVO object or node status. For example, MSI (Message Stream Interface) can be used to intercept OVO messages, and status can then be determined from the OVO messages. Users can use an MSI API to register applications to receive messages on a management server (for example, a server in the CDN Manager ). MSI allows users to plug in event correlation engines and statistical analysis tools to establish a link to other network and system management applications. Thus MSI can be used to intercept OVO messages, filter the intercepted messages, and send CDN-related messages to a CDN application (or GUI). As an alternative or in addition to using MSI, in exemplary embodiments the CDN map\/device objects are tied to a Service Navigator object, and Service Engine or Service Navigator APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are used to obtain the status information. In accordance with exemplary embodiments, a poll, for example a status poll, is used to synchronize Service Navigator objects with the CDN objects.","In summary, in accordance with exemplary embodiments there can be an automatic action which sets the status of the matching node in a CDN map, and\/or the MSI can intercept the OVO message and update status from that message, and\/or status can be obtained from the Service Navigator using Service Navigator APIs. In accordance with exemplary embodiments, the IP status can be obtained by activating the SNMP Trap templates which are designed to accept SNMP traps created by NNM by default. With these templates, it is possible to intercept OV_NODE_DOWN, OV_NODE_UP traps from the NNM to determine status. This can be implemented using MSI and\/or automatic action techniques.","In accordance with exemplary embodiments where the CDN status is OVO-based, a CDN status-update action is defined and associated with critical messages for CDN nodes. When a critical event happens for a CDN node, the CDN status-update action is kicked off to send a status update to the GUI Integrator . In accordance with exemplary embodiments, the GUI Integrator  has a (status) server running to receive the updates for the Map.","In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, Service Engine APIs are used to obtain status updates, the CDN maps the CDN Sitemaps and device objects to an OVO Service Map, and the OVO Service Engine maintains the status. In this configuration no status synchronization is provided between CDN objects and service map objects since both types of status information will come from the Service Engine. A status propagation rule can be specified in an OVO Service Map and can also be maintained in the Service Engine. In CDN SiteMap and Device Table, OVO Service Navigator API is used to obtain the status of the service, and\/or \u201cServiceStatusListener\u201d Class is used to obtain status update notification(s). In this embodiment, CDN provides a standard default CDN SiteMap for the CDN Service Map. In a version of this embodiment, the rules defined in the CDN SiteMap are only modified by a System Integrator (e.g., a person who administers and sets up OpenView products) and are not modified by the operators. Also, operators do not add or modify the CDN Site Tree via the Service Navigator. The Site tree is modified using a CDN Configuration GUI to add new CDN objects. When new CDN objects are added to CDN map or table through the CDN Configuration GUI, synchronization with the Service Engine can be done to automatically update the CDN Site Map.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0126"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1202","1204","1206","1208","1122","1210","1212","1214","1124","1214"]},"In accordance with exemplary embodiments, the GUI Integrator  (which can be the same as the  GUI Integrator ) retrieves the status from the CDN Service Adaptor . In exemplary embodiments, the GUI Integrator  is integrated with the CDN Manager  and\/or the CDN Service Adaptor  to obtain status updates. In exemplary embodiments, the GUI Integrator  is integrated into an OVO framework and infrastructure, to establish context-sensitive connection with OVO and NNM.","In accordance with exemplary embodiments, the status is retrieved using a parking mechanism, for example as implemented in the Hewlett Packard (HP) OpenView Network Node Manager (NNM), wherein the GUI Integrator  opens an HTTP connection and does a \u201cGet\u201d and waits for status updates. The GUI Integrator  keeps the connection until status comes. For example, the CDN GUIs ,  and the GUI Integrator  can be remotely located in different systems. The CDN GUIs ,  can show status of CDN devices, for example Critical, Normal, Warning or Major. The device updated status can be retrieved from the OVO Service Engine  to show the real-time status of devices in the GUI (e.g., , ). The parking mechanism can effectively communicate the status update to the CDN GUIs , . For example, the GUI Integrator  can initially have a Normal status for a device. In order to show the real-time status for the device, the GUI Integrator  can open an HTTP connection to the Service Adaptor  and can send a HTTP request to CDN Service Adaptor to get device status updates. If there is no status change for the device, the Service Adaptor  can refrain from sending any responses back to the GUI Integrator , while keeping the connection open until it receives the status change from the Service Engine . The Service Adaptor  can then send the status updates to the GUI Integrator . Thus, a parking mechanism can enable status updates to be retrieved in a timely manner. In exemplary embodiments, in combination with or as alternative to the parking mechanism, a) updates can be pulled from the Service Engine , for example at a scheduled interval, and\/or b) status updates can be pushed to the  Service Adaptor from the Service Engine .","The parking mechanism can be implemented, for example, using HPAS (HP Application Server) or BBC (Black-Box Communication). HPAS is an HP Middleware product that is a server configured to support J2EE (Java 2 Enterprise Edition) standards, and can support other technologies. BBC can be implemented as an HTTP 1.1-based communications interface for OpenView client and server applications. BBC can provide an API (Application Programming Interface) that allows applications to send and retrieve data between heterogeneous systems. In accordance with exemplary embodiments, a thread server hosts a status-updated thread.","When status gets updated, the Service Adaptor  sends the updated states to all waiting connections. For example, the site objects are logic nodes; each site note contains a group of CDN devices or applications. The sites can be discovered automatically through configuration or deployment information, or can be manually added using a CDN Configuration GUI. Users can drill into a site object to see a table of CDN devices for the site, or can select other options for the selected site (for example by right-clicking on an icon of the site object to expose a menu of options). Connection lines among the displayed objects can represent content distribution relationships.","In accordance with exemplary embodiments, OpenView Foundation NetGraph APIs and the Java Swing package are used to implement the Site Map, but other GUI building tools can be used to create the maps and information displays consistent with the exemplary embodiments. The CDN GUI client receives the complete CDN XML data, parses the data and store the data in its in-memory data structure to provide quick access for drill-down information, for example via double-click and pop-up menu mechanisms. In accordance with exemplary embodiments, a CDN NetGraph stylesheet forms the base for the map graphical implementation and is part of the CDN Java GUI . The CDN NetGraph stylesheet is independent of the CDN data. The CDN NetGraph stylesheet enables use of NetGraph APIs to dynamically create the nodes and connections based on the CDN data that the Java GUI  received from CDN Manager. In accordance with exemplary embodiments, the following stylesheet for the nodes and connection style, can be used and is called
