Different types of multimedia devices are frequently used to configure a network and communicate multimedia data, or control each other.","Multimedia devices that are physically far apart from each other are remotely controlled via a remote user interface (RUI). A UI server provides a UI for controlling a UI client and the UI client controls the UI server through the provided UI. For example, in providing\/receiving a UI according to the CEA-2014 standard, the UI server provides the UI for remote control to the UI client in a web page format and the UI client displays the web page to a user using a web browser. Then, the user of the client uses the displayed UI and controls the UI server.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a method and apparatus for displaying a user interface (UI) provided from a remote server, wherein the displaying is performed by a client, and a computer readable recording medium having recorded thereto a program causing a computer to execute the method.","According to an aspect of embodiments of the present invention, there is provided a method of displaying a user interface (UI), wherein the displaying is performed by a client, the method including receiving UI data from a server, generating the UI to be displayed based on the received UI data and characteristics of the client, and displaying the generated UI.","The UI data may be encoded in a multimedia data format using a scene-description technology based on a Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) standard.","The UI data may include information about a dynamic configuration of the UI.","The generating of the UI to be displayed may include comparing the characteristics of the client against the information about the dynamic configuration of the UI.","The UI data may include data for a plurality of UI objects.","Each one of the plurality of UI objects may be a minimum unit of the UI in which a predetermined event is generated from interaction with a user.","The information about the dynamic configuration of the UI may be used in the generating of the UI by changing at least one of a color, a form, a background image, and a font of the UI.","The information about the dynamic configuration of the UI may include representation information indicating how the UI objects are to be arranged in the UI.","The generating of the UI to be displayed may include selecting at least one of the plurality of UI objects based on the characteristics of the client.","The characteristics of the client may comprise at least one of a performance of the client, a user profile of the client, a network type to which the client is connected, and external information.","The external information may be information received from external servers including weather information servers.","According to another aspect of embodiments of the present invention, there is provided a method of providing a user interface (UI) from a server to a client, the method including generating UI data comprising information about a dynamic configuration of the UI, and transmitting the generated UI data to the client, wherein the client generates the UI based on the information about the dynamic configuration of the UI and characteristics of the client.","According to another aspect of embodiments of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for displaying a user interface (UI) of a client, the apparatus including a connection unit receiving UI data from a server, a UI generation unit generating the UI to be displayed based on the received UI data and a characteristics of the client, and a display unit displaying the generated UI.","The UI data may be based on a use pattern of UI objects by a user, indicating preferences of the user regarding the UI objects.","According to another aspect of embodiments of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for providing a user interface (UI) to a client of a server, the apparatus including a UI data generation unit generating UI data comprising information about a dynamic configuration of the UI, and a connection unit transmitting the generated UI data to the client, wherein the client generates the UI based on the information about the dynamic configuration of the UI and characteristics of the client.","According to another aspect of embodiments of the present invention, there is provided a computer readable recording medium having embodied thereon a computer program causing a computer to execute the method of displaying a UI and the method of providing a UI from a server to a client.","Additional aspects and\/or advantages will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.","Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Referring to , a client  is a UI client which receives UI data from a server , that is a remote UI server, and displays the UI .","In operation , the server  transmits the UI data to the client .","The UI data provided from the server  to the client  may be encoded in a multimedia data format according to the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) standard. The MPEG standard is an international standard regarding a method of compression encoding video and audio and may include various versions such as MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, MPEG-7, and MPEG-21. The server  encodes the UI data using the MPEG standard. Most devices that are currently developed include a MPEG decoder for reproducing compressed moving picture files. Thus, when the UI is encoded based on the MPEG standard, most devices may display the UI  without separate applications for displaying the UI.","In particular, an object-based image encoding method such as MPEG-4 Binary Format for Scene (BIFS) or Lightweight Applications Scene Representation (LASeR) for mobile devices is used so as to encode the UI. UI objects may be image objects encoded by BIFS or LASeR and thus, a BIFS or LASeR scene-description technology is used to represent a spatio-temporal arrangement of the UI objects and the UI objects are encoded. The UI object is denoted as a minimum unit of a UI in which a predetermined event is generated according to interaction with a user and a predetermined function is called based on the generated event.","BIFS or LASeR includes information about a scene-description technology which can display the spatio-temporal arrangement of the objects included in an image. Thus, BIFS or LASeR is used to display the spatio-temporal arrangement of the UI objects such as buttons and menus.","When an image codec such as BIFS or LASeR is used to encode the UI and an MPEG-stream including the image for the UI is generated, the client  receives the MPEG-stream including the image for the UI encoded according to BIFS or LASeR and decodes the received MPEG-stream by using the MPEG decoder, thereby displaying the UI  only by reproducing the MPEG-stream. Since the UI may be displayed  by only reproducing the MPEG-stream, various devices including the MPEG decoder may display the UI  provided from the server .","When the UI is configured by representing the object-based arrangement using the object-based scene-description technology such as BIFS or LASeR, the client , which receives the UI data, may generate a dynamically personalized UI  by selecting and re-arranging the objects.","In encoding the UI data using the MPEG scene-description technology by the server , the UI data including information about the dynamic configuration of the UI may be included. The information about the dynamic configuration of the UI is information for changing at least one of a color, a form, a background image, and a font of the UI, by personalizing the UI. This is described in more detail with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Referring to , the UI data may be encoded by a UI package . The UI package  includes a plurality of UI elements, including a UI Element # , UI Element #, UI Element #, etc.","The plurality of UI elements may include information about the UIs based on characteristics of each different client. For example, with respect to the same AV control UI, UI element #  may include information about a UI used by users aged in their twenties and UI element # may include information about a UI used by users aged in their thirties. Here, information needed to select one of the plurality of UI elements is included in each of the UI elements, as information to dynamically configure the UI. A UI element #  will now be described.","The UI element #  includes presentation information  for representing objects included in the UI, event information  about events generated by the objects, and function information  about functions called for processing the events. Information about representation, events, and function are classified into layered information and are included in UI elements so that the UI may be dynamically expanded.","The information  for representing the objects included in the UI indicates how the UI objects are arranged in the UI and what media is used to represent the UI objects.","A scene description  is information for describing a scene configuration of the UI. The scene description  is information about a location in which the objects are arranged in the UI and may include information for describing a layout, form, theme, and template of the scene. Information about a way of representing the UI may be also included. When the UI objects are represented using a special effect such as fade-out or fade-in, information about such a special effect may be also included. The scene description  may be dynamically configured according to an adaptation utility , which will be described later.","An object description  is information about a way of representing the objects included in the UI and includes information indicating what media from among an image, a picture, and audio is used to represent each of the UI objects. In addition, information about the representing time and representing ways for the objects may be also included. For example, when the objects are represented in the scene at different times, information about the time for timing control may be included. In addition, as in the scene description , when the UI objects are represented in the scene by using a special effect such as fade-out or fade-in, information about the way the representing is performed may be also included. When the UI objects are not fixed and instead, are applied by using a moving animation effect, such information may also be included.","The adaptation utility  includes information for dynamically configuring the UI based on characteristics of the client . The client  compares the characteristics of the client  with the information included in the adaptation utility  and dynamically configures the UI. Also, information for selecting UI elements based on an age of the user, for example users in their twenties, thirties, and forties, may be included. In other words, the adaptation utility  may include information indicating that the UI element #  includes information about the UI used by users in their twenties and allows the client of the users in their twenties to display the UI according to the UI element # .","In addition, the scene description  may be dynamically changed according to the adaptation utility . According to the characteristics of the client  (), for example, a size, a font of the UI, a color of the UI object, etc. may be changed. The server  () pre-determines how the UI is changed according to the characteristics of the client  () and information about the determination is included in the adaptation utility .","In addition, information for selecting some of the objects from among the plurality of UI objects included in the UI element # , in consideration of the characteristics of the client  (), may be included in the adaptation utility .","For example, information about object selection for displaying all UI objects A, B, C, and D in the client used by users aged in their twenties, displaying the UI objects A, B, and C in the client used by users aged in their thirties, and displaying UI objects A and B in the client used by users aged in their forties, may be included in the adaptation utility .","For dynamic configuration of the UI, the adaptation utility  may include information about a scene tree which is described in more detail with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"A UI  for controlling the same AV may include UIs , , and  for users aged in their twenties, thirties, and forties, respectively. The server  () includes the information about the scene tree to the adaptation utility  () and generates UI data. The client  () refers to the scene tree so as to select one of the plurality of UI elements, dynamically change the scene description  (), or select some of the plurality of UI objects.","Referring back to FIG., a resource  includes sources for representing UI objects, for example, multimedia data such as images, moving picture files, and audio.","The event information  includes information about the events generated by the objects included in the UI scene. Information about the events generated as a result of interaction between the UI objects and the user, such as objects selection by the user, is included.","An event description  includes information about the events generated by the objects. A kind of user interaction, which can be performed through UI objects such as click, touch, and rotation, will now be described.","An event handle  includes information about a way of processing the generated events. For example, when the event called click is defined in the event description , the event handle  includes information indicating how the event called click is processed. If the clicked UI object is an object for controlling volume, information for processing the event called click by interpreting the event as volume up or volume down is included.","A binding interface  includes information about mapping between the defined events and device application programming interfaces (API) called to process the events, that is, information about mapping between the events and called device API, in order to make a connection between the events generated by UI objects and functions called by the events.","The function information  about functions called for processing the events includes detailed information about the device APIs called to perform the functions.","A function description  includes information about the detailed operation of the device APIs called by the events, in other words, the functions realized by the user through the device API. For example, when the device API for a vibration function is called, information about a detailed function such as controlling intensity and time of vibration is included.","A function call  includes information about parameters of functions called by the UI objects. For example, if it is described in the function description  that the device APIs for the vibration function control vibration intensity and the vibration time at levels  to , the function call  includes specific parameters indicating in what level the function should be called from among five levels of the vibration intensity and the vibration time, when a predetermined event is generated. In other words, when the vibration function is called by a UI object A at the vibration intensity of level  and at the vibration time of level  from among five levels of vibration intensity and vibration time, specific parameters for calling such a function may be included in the function call .","Referring back to , in operation , the client  generates a personalized UI. In other words, the personalized UI to be displayed to the user is generated based on the UI received in operation  and the characteristics of the client .","The client  may compare the characteristics of the client  and information about the dynamic configuration of the UI and generate the personalized UI .","The client  may analyze information about the dynamic configuration of the UI and obtain information about the configuration of the UI which corresponds to the characteristics of the client . The characteristics of the client  and the adaptation utility  () are compared to each other so as to select the UI element suitable for the characteristics of the client  or to change the scene description  () to be suitable for the characteristics of the client .","The objects to be included in the UI that is to be displayed may be selected according to the characteristics of the client . Here, the objects may be selected with reference to the adaptation utility  () or the client  may voluntarily select the UI objects only in consideration of the characteristics of the client .","The characteristics of the client  may include at least one of performance qualities of the client , a user profile of the client , a network type to which the client  is connected, and external information.","Performance qualities of the client  may include hardware performance of the client  such as a CPU of the client , a memory, a display resolution, and battery power remaining. A hardware resource which can be allocated by the client  for displaying a UI, for example, allocable CPU processing capacity and allocable spare memory, may also be included in the performance qualities of the client .","The user profile of the client  includes user preferences. The user preferences which may be different in each client may be reflected in the displaying of the UI. A standard for determining such preferences includes age, gender, and language of the user. The user preference may be represented by a standard such as MPEG-21 UED (Usage Environment Description) or W3C CC\/PP (Composite Capabilities\/Preference Profile).","The network type, to which the client  is connected, includes ADSL, VDSL, WLAN, and Wi-Fi. According to the network type, to which the client  is connected, bandwidth used in displaying the UI by the client  may vary and thus, the network type may be the base for generating a personalized UI.","The external information is used to generate a personalized UI and may include information relating to weather, stock, time, and season. According to the information relating to weather, stock, time, and season, the UI needed for the user may vary and thus, the UI may be dynamically displayed. When the client  has a function of operating the UI by using motion sensing, such a function is also included in the external information. The external information may be received from an external server, instead of the client , for example, servers for providing weather information or stock information.","In operation , the client  displays the personalized UI generated in operation  to the user.","In operation , the client  controls the server  using the displayed UI. According to the user input based on the displayed UI, a predetermined event is called to the server  or a predetermined control message is transmitted to the server .","The client  may generate the personalized UI according to the characteristics of the client  in operations  through  so that use of the client  by the user may be improved. Also, the server  may be controlled more efficiently by using the personalized UI.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"Similarly to , a client  in  is a UI client which displays the UI, the UI receiving UI data from a server , which is a remote UI server. A difference between  and  is that the external information is received from a separate context server  and the received external information is reflected in the generation of the UI.","Operation  may correspond to operation  in . In operation , the server  transmits the UI data to the client .","The UI data provided from the server  to the client  may be data encoded in a multimedia data format according to a Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) standard, in particular, a scene-description technology according to the MPEG standard. Also, the UI data may be data encoded in a UI package format using a scene-description technology according to the MPEG standard as illustrated in , for example.","In operation , the context server  transmits the external information to the client . For example, information about weather and stock is provided to the client . Based on not only a use environment of the client  such as weather, season, and temperature but also the external information such as stock fluctuations, the UI may be personalized.","Thus, in order to generate the UI by reflecting the external information, the context server  provides predetermined external information to the client , in operation .","In operation , the client  generates the personalized UI. In other words, the UI personalized based on the external information received in operation  is generated. As described with reference to , the external information and the adaptation utility  may be compared to each other so as to select a predetermined UI element or the scene description  may be changed according to the external information. The objects to be included in the UI that is to be displayed may be selected according to the external information.","For example, in cloudy weather, the UI element formed of a color and font suitable for the cloudy weather is selected or the scene description  is changed to a color and font suitable for the cloudy weather, thereby generating the UI.","In operation , the client  displays the UI generated in operation  to the user.","In operation , the client  controls the server  by using the displayed UI.","In , generating of the personalized UI based on the UI data received from the server  is illustrated. However, generating of the personalized UI based on the external information is not limited thereto and the UI previously displayed by the client  may be changed based on the external information and displayed to the user, in addition to the UI received from the server . For example, a color and font of the UI displayed by the client  may be changed based on the information about weather or stock and displayed to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"Similarly to , a client  in  is a UI client which displays the UI, the UI receiving UI data from a server , which is a remote UI server.

As described above, the user profile may include a user preference. A standard for determining such a preference includes age, gender, and language of the user. The user preference may be represented by a standard such as the MPEG-21 UED (Usage Environment Description) or the W3C CC\/PP (Composite Capabilities\/Preference Profile).","In operation , the sever  generates the UI data based on the user profile received in operation . In other words, the UI is generated based on user preferences of the client  received in operation . According to the MPEG standard, the UI may be encoded in a multimedia data format and the UI data may be generated.","In operation , the UI data is transmitted to the client . A MPEG-stream generated according to the MPEG standard is streamed to the client .","In operation , the client  displays the UI received in operation  to the user. The MPEG-stream is decoded and displayed to the user in real-time.","In operation , the client  controls the server  using the displayed UI.","In operation , the client  transmits a use pattern to the server . In other words, the client  analyzes a pattern of controlling the UI performed by the user, in operation , and transmits the analyzed information to the server . There may be a particular type of UI object preferred by the user. In addition, there may be a particular type of content preferred by the user. Thus, if the user pattern of the UI is analyzed, the user preference may be known. The client  transmits the information about the use pattern to the server  and allows the server  to update the UI by considering the preference of the client .","In operation , the server  generates new UI data based on the use pattern of the UI received in operation .","In operation , the server  transmits the UI data generated in operation  to the client .
