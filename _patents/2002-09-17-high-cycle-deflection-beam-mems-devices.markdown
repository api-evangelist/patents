title: High cycle deflection beam MEMS devices
abstract: A high life cycle MEMS device is provided by the invention. The inventors have recognized that the deflection beam or deflection beams of an MEMS shunt switch are a failure point in need of improvement. In an aspect of the invention, at least a portion of the signals in the grounded state of an MEMS shunt switch are bypassed to ground on a path that avoids the deflection beam(s) supporting the movable pad. In a preferred embodiment, ground posts are disposed to contact the movable pad in an actuated position and establish a signal path from a signal line to ground. The inventors have also recognized that a shape of deflection beams near their anchor point contributes to failures. In another preferred aspect of the invention, an anchoring portion of the deflection beam or deflection beams is generally coplanar with the remaining portion of the deflection beam(s). An additional post beneath the anchoring portion of the deflection beam(s) permits deflection beam(s) lacking any turns that form a weak structural point.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This invention was made with United States Government support under Contract Number F33615-99-C-1519 awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA). The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The field of the invention is micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS).","MEMS devices are macroscale devices including a pad that is movable in response to electrical signaling. The movable pad, such as a membrane or cantilevered conductive arm, moves in response to an electrical signal to cause an electrical or mechanical effect. A particularly useful MEMS device is the MEMS shunt switch. A MEMS shunt switch grounds a signal line in one state and permits signal flow in another state. A particular switch, the RF MEMS shunt switch is an RF (radio frequency) ohmic switch. In an RF MEMS shunt switch, application of an electrical signal causes a cantilevered conductive switch pad to ground or remove from ground state a signal line by completing or breaking ohmic contact with the signal line.","MEMS lifetimes continue to be shorter than would make their use widespread. Successes in the range of 1-3 billion \u201ccold\u201d switching cycles have been reported. High frequency applications are especially suited to MEMS devices, and can exceed reported switching cycles in ordinary usage. Also, there is typically a difference between \u201chot\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d switching lifetimes. Hot switching, i.e., a switching test conducted with signals present, is a different measure of operational conditions that usually shows a shorter lifetime than cold switching tests would indicate. Both types of tests are used in the art. Comparisons between the same tests are valid. However, the hot switching tests are more representative of actual operating conditions.","A common cause of failure identified by the present inventors is the deformation and breakdown of the deflection beams used to support the movable pad. Spring force supplied by the deflection beams is necessary for the operation of the switch. The deflection beams are formed from thin material, having the thinness of the movable switch pad. A loss of resiliency or breakdown of the deflection beams causes a breakdown of the switch.","The inventors have recognized that the deflection beam or deflection beams of an MEMS shunt switch are a failure point in need of improvement. The inventors have specifically identified that the signal path to ground contributes to failure at the deflection beams and results in a hot switching time that is substantially shorter than the cold switching lifetime. The path of signals through the deflection beam(s) to ground weakens the deflection beam(s). According to the invention, at least a portion of the signals in the grounded state of an MEMS shunt switch are bypassed to ground on a path that avoids the deflection beam(s) supporting the movable pad. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, ground posts are disposed to contact the movable pad in an actuated position and establish a signal path from a signal line to ground. The inventors have also recognized that the shape of deflection beams near their anchor point contributes to failures. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, an anchoring portion of the deflection beam or deflection beams is generally coplanar with the remaining portion of the deflection beam(s). An anchor post beneath the anchoring portion of the deflection beam(s) permits deflection beam(s) lacking any out-of-plane turns that form a weak structural point.","The invention is directed toward reducing the failure rate attributable to deflection beams of MEMS shunt switches, especially under \u201chot\u201d switching conditions that more closely approximate real life operation. An aspect of the invention concerns the signal routing in an MEMS shunt switch. A ground signal path is established that avoids the deflection beam or deflection beams suspending the movable switch pad. In another aspect of the invention, a post supports the anchor point of a deflection beam or deflection beams in a MEMS switch to permit a generally flat coplanar deflection beam. The invention will now be illustrated with respect to the preferred embodiments but is not limited to the preferred embodiments. For example, while a preferred embodiment is a balanced RF MEMS shunt switch including multiple deflection beams, the invention is applicable to any type of shunt switch including one or more deflection beams. Embodiments of the invention may be formed in a Group III-V material system. In addition, a silicon based integration is possible. Use of silicon requires a deposition of a polymer upon the silicon substrate prior to formation of the MEMS device.","The preferred embodiment of  may be formed on a suitable substrate and is a balanced RF MEMS shunt switch , including symmetrically disposed deflection beams , which are preferably serpentine in shape, supporting a movable switch pad  above a signal line  and ground, realized in  by ground pads and . The switch  may form part of a large-scale integration, where the signal line  is part of a circuit interconnect pattern, for example. In a relaxed state, the switch pad  permits signals to flow through the signal line . Application of a suitable voltage to actuation pads  through electrodes  creates an electrostatic force that pulls the switch pad in to make ohmic contact with both the signal line  and the ground , through preferred contact bumps  disposed on the signal line  and the ground , . Electrode  would be omitted in an integration where a lead to an actuation pad  is part of a circuit interconnect. The switch pad  may also preferably include one or more depressions or dimples  to aid the ohmic contact with bumps  of either or both of the signal line  and ground. Arrows  indicate primary paths of current flow when the signal line  is grounded.","The overall geometry of the switch  is advantageous for integration and provides a symmetry aiding efficient operation of the switch. The two ground pads and are disposed on opposite sides of the signal line . Actuation pads  are also disposed on opposite sides of the signal line, and are encompassed by the ground pads and , but electrically separate from the ground pads and . A symmetry is provided by this arrangement to exhibit an even attraction force on the switch pad , which is supported by the deflection beams , which are also preferably symmetrically disposed around the switch pad .","Current flows in from an input side  of the switch  into the signal line . In a relaxed position of the switch with the switch pad  away from the signal line , the current is allowed to pass through the signal line  to an opposite output side  of the switch. In an activated position, the switch pad is pulled into ohmic contact with bumps  on the signal line  and ground. The bumps  are preferably used to prevent the switch pad  from touching the actuation pads , which may include a nitride or other dielectric layer, or may be exposed conductive material by virtue of the bumps  that prevent touching of the switch pad  to the actuation pad . There is a trade-off between the size of the bumps  and the area of the actuation pads that can be modified and optimized to suit particular switches according to the  embodiment. Forming bumps  that have larger surface area will reduce the actuation area of the actuation pads . The bumps  on the ground pads , may be conductive to provide part of the path to ground, while those on signal line  must be conductive. In addition, the switch pad  contacts ground posts . The ground posts  establish a primary path from the input side  of the switch to the ground . The ground posts  create a path from the input side  to ground that is lower resistance than the path to ground through the deflection beams . In this regard, it is preferable to shape the ground posts  to maximize the surface area of the ground posts that will make ohmic contact to the switch pad . The trade-off is again a competition with the surface area of the acutation pads . Overall cross-section of the posts  also should be generous, to the extent permitted by the configuration of a particular switch. The material used for the ground posts  and other conductive elements of the switch is preferably any conducting metal, e.g., Ti, Au, Cu, Ni, Pt, but other conductive materials, e.g., poly-silicon, tungsten-silicide, may also be used. Typically, a common metal will be used for the switch pad , deflection beams  and ground posts . Because the deflection beams  are conductive and connected to ground, there will be some current flow to ground through the deflection beams . A preferred goal in implementing the current bypass aspect of the invention is to minimize the current flow through the deflection beams  by maximizing current flow to ground through the ground posts  (and bumps ). Factors affecting the bypass effect of the ground posts  will include all material and physical properties that determine the resistance of the respective paths to ground through the deflection beams  and the ground posts .","Exemplary embodiment ground posts each present a contact area (for contact with the switch pad) of at least 100 \u03bcm. This is a minimum area to direct the majority of current passing to the ground in an exemplary prototype embodiment switch according to  where the switch pad and deflection beams are approximately 1 \u03bcm thick and the deflection beams have a cross-sectional area of approximately 4 to 6 \u03bcm. In the exemplary embodiment, the contact area of the ground posts is selected to direct a majority of the current to ground through the ground posts. The minimum surface area required to direct a majority of the current through the ground posts will depend primarily upon the contact area of the ground posts, the resistivity of the material of the ground posts (if it is different than the material of the switch pad\/deflection beams), and the cross section of the deflection beams.","The common material of the switch pad  and deflection beams  is a result of a single deposition used to form these elements. The deflection beams  are a shaped extension of the switch pad having the same thinness of the switch pad, typically 0.5 \u03bcm to 5 \u03bcm. The deflection beams  extend to anchor portions  that bond to the ground pads , . In the  embodiment, this is achieved by turns  (best seen in ) in the anchor portions  of the deflection beams . The turns  permit the remaining portions of the deflection beams  and the switch pad  to maintain a relaxed state in a plane away from the ground , and signal line .","The bypass of ground current flow in the  embodiment through the ground posts  extends hot switching lifetime compared to an identical device lacking the ground posts.  shows a further preferred embodiment having a generally flat deflection beam including an anchor portion  that is generally coplanar with the remaining portions of the deflection beam . This is a variation of the  embodiment. An anchor post  is formed on the ground pad , to support each of the anchor portions . The anchor post  can completely eliminate the need for the turns  in the anchor portion  of the  embodiment and permit a generally flat, coplanar deflection beams . The flat, coplanar embodiment is preferred. Alternatively, the amount or severity of the turn can be reduced by use of the anchor posts . The coplanar embodiment illustrated in  is the most structurally sound. An SEM image of a prototype deflection beam portion with anchor posts is shown in FIG. B.","An additional advantage of the anchor posts  is a reduction of the gap between the switch pad  and the signal line . Referring to , the deflection beams with a turn limit the minimum gap because the turn  requires a minimum vertical distance. The  design not only strengthens the deflection beam but also reduces the gap between the switch pad  and signal line . For low voltage applications, a typical gap for a deflection beam without an anchor post is 4 to 5 mm and the gap lessened to about 2 to 3 mm with use of the anchor posts. Gap reduction lowers the actuation voltage of the switch.","When the anchor posts  are used in combination with the ground posts , the anchor posts may be made or coated with dielectric material. Any material that forms a suitable bond with the ground pads , and the anchor portions  of the deflection beams may be used. In this preferred embodiment, the resistance of the path to ground through the deflection beams  becomes very high compared to the path presented by the ground posts. This may be especially useful in applications where geometry or integration limits the size of ground posts.","Modifications of switch shapes may include optimizations that decrease resistance of the bypass path to ground of the invention. Examples of modified embodiments having more complexly shaped dimples are shown in . The  embodiments enhance contact to the bumps  that are present on ground pads , and the signal line .","While various embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it should be understood that other modifications, substitutions and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications, substitutions and alternatives can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which should be determined from the appended claims.","Various features of the invention are set forth in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
