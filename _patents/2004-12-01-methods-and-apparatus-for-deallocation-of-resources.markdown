title: Methods and apparatus for deallocation of resources
abstract: Initially, a processing device receives a selection of one or more resources to be deallocated from a storage area network. The processing device applies a traversal function to a repository of managed objects representing the resources in the storage area network to identify other resources (e.g., resources related to the selected one or more resources) in the storage area network that at least partially rely on existence of the selected one or more resources for accessing data stored in the storage area network. The processing device graphically presents the selected one or more resources for deallocation in relation to identified other related resources by highlighting the related resources in the storage area network environment that would not be inherently deleted altogether but whose ability to access data would at least be partially impaired if the selected one or more resources were deallocated from the storage area network environment.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a Continuation-In-Part (CIP) of earlier filed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/750,336 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,401,137 entitled \u201cMETHODS AND APPARATUS FOR APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT ACTIONS TO RESOURCES SHARING RELATIONSHIPS,\u201d filed on Dec. 31, 2003, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by this reference.","The rapid expansion of information service and data processing industries has resulted in a need for computer systems to manage and store large amounts of data. As an example, financial service companies such as banks, mutual fund companies and the like now, more than ever before, require access to many hundreds of gigabytes or even terabytes of data and files stored in high capacity data storage systems. Data storage system developers have responded to these types of data storage requirements by integrating high capacity data storage systems, data communications devices (e.g., switches), and computer systems (e.g., host computers or servers) into networks called \u201cstorage networks\u201d or \u201cStorage Area Networks\u201d (SANs.)","In general, a storage area network is a collection of data storage systems that are networked via a switching fabric to a number of host computer systems operating as servers. The host computers access data stored in the data storage systems on behalf of client computers that request data from the data storage systems. For example, according to conventional applications, upon receiving a storage access request, a respective host computer accesses a large repository of storage through the switching fabric on behalf of the requesting client. Thus, a client has access to the shared storage system through the host computer. In many applications, storage area networks support hi-speed acquisitions of data so that the host servers are able to promptly retrieve and store data from the data storage system.","Conventional storage area network management applications typically include a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables a network manager to graphically manage, control, and configure various types of hardware and software resources associated with a corresponding managed storage area network. For example, one conventional network management storage application generates a graphical user interface utilized by a network manager to graphically select, interact with, and manage local or remote devices and associated software processes associated with the storage area network. Based on use of the graphical user interface in combination with an input device such as a hand operated mouse and corresponding pointer displayed on a viewing screen, a network manager is able to manage hardware and software entities such as file systems, databases, storage devices, peripherals, network data communications devices, etc., associated with the storage area network. In some storage area networks, a network management station and associated management software allows a network administrator or systems manager (a person responsible for managing the storage network) to allocate and deallocate resources (e.g., hardware and software resources) in a storage area network. Consequently, the network manager can reconfigure a SAN.","The infrastructure required to support access to data in a storage area network can be quite complex. As an example, consider the number of hardware and software components that must work in harmony in order for a user's software application executing on a host computer system to successfully access data stored in a storage array of a SAN. To access such data, the user application provides file system calls or requests (e.g., open, read, write and so forth) to a file system resource presented to the user application by an operating system executing on the host computer system. The file system receives the file system calls and operates to map such file system calls to a series of I\/O requests. The operating system on the host computer system then transmits the I\/O requests through a host interface device resource, such as an interface card ((e.g., SCSI or FibreChannel adapter) having one or more I\/O port resources, across an interface cable or networking medium (e.g., in a storage area network implementation) to a front-end adapter interface card resource operating within a high-capacity data storage array of the SAN. The front-end adapter interface card receives the I\/O requests and interprets them to identify appropriate data locations within specific storage device resources contained in the storage array. After the requested data is accessed via the storage devices, I\/O responses are returned to the user application along an information or data flow path that includes operations and processing functionality provided by each of the aforementioned components and resources in a reverse direction back to the application on the host computer running the client application. In this way, access to data in a conventional storage area network involves reliance on a proper operation and coordination of a multitude of software and hardware resources in a SAN.","Conventional network management applications that support management of network resources in a SAN suffer from a variety of deficiencies. For example, deallocating resources from a SAN can be quite a complex process because deallocation of a particular resource can impact a chain of other resources in the SAN unbeknownst to the user deleting the particular resource. For example, in a SAN environment including many host computers and storage arrays, logical objects on a host computer (e.g., host objects) can include one or more storage devices on storage arrays to which the host is connected through a SAN. Host objects may consist of file systems, databases, logical volumes and volume groups of a logical volume manager, multipath devices, and host devices. Each host device typically maps to one or more storage devices. It is useful for a user to be informed of what other host objects (other than the specific resource being deleted or deallocated) would be affected as a result of executing a deallocation action on a selected set of storage devices. Thus, when a user attempts to deallocate a resource in the SAN, a user can be informed of other related resources in the chain of resources in the SAN that will be inherently deallocated as a result of deallocating the selected resource as well as other related resources that will be only partially affected by deallocating the selected resource. For example, if a network administrator deallocates an interface card from the SAN and fails to be informed that a particular host resource such as a software application still requires access to data stored within a storage device through the interface card selected for deallocation, the software application relying on use of the interface card will likely experience execution problems due to the inability of the software application to access the data using the deallocated interface card.","Embodiments of the invention significantly overcome the aforementioned and other deficiencies of conventional network management applications. In particular, embodiments of the invention include a method to identify and display which resources in a SAN will be impacted by execution of a management action such as deallocation of resources in the SAN.","For example, one embodiment of the invention includes a technique of utilizing a processing device (or processing code, etc.) to facilitate deallocation of resources in a storage area network environment. Initially, the processing device receives a selection of one or more resources to be deallocated from the storage area network environment. The processing device then applies a traversal function to a repository of managed objects representing the resources in the storage area network environment to identify other resources (e.g., resources related to the selected one or more resources) in the storage area network environment that at least partially rely on existence of the selected one or more resources for accessing data stored in the storage area network environment. Prior to deallocating the selected one or more resources from the storage area network environment, the processing device graphically presents the selected at least one resource in relation to the identified other related resources to illustrate i) respective managed objects that will be partially deallocated and ii) respective managed objects that will be completely deallocated as a result of deallocating the selected one or more resources. Based on this technique, a network manager can utilize a graphical user interface generated by the processing device to identify how deallocation of a particular selected resource in a SAN will impact other related resources not being specifically deallocated. For example, in one embodiment, the processing device graphically presents the selected one or more resources for deallocation in relation to identified other related resources by highlighting the related resources in the storage area network environment that would not be inherently deleted altogether but whose ability to access data would at least be partially impaired if the selected at least one resource were deallocated from the storage area network environment.","As an example, a SAN manager may elect to delete a first storage device in the SAN. A single logical volume may be the only resource that uses the first storage device to store data in the SAN. In this instance, the network manager may decide to deallocate the storage device. Such an action would result in inherent deallocation of the logical volume as well.","According to another scenario, a SAN manager may elect to deallocate a second storage device in the SAN. In this latter case, however, a logical volume may use this second storage device as well as other storage devices in the SAN to access data. In other words, the logical volume does not rely solely on the second storage device to store data in the SAN. Deallocation of only the second storage device would impact this logical volume but would not cause the logical volume to be deallocated completely or inherently because the second storage device makes up only a portion of the logical volume. As discussed, embodiments of the invention include highlighting these affected resources in a SAN so that a network manager can make an informed decision whether to proceed with a deallocation request.","Accordingly, a graphical user interface of the present application can provide 3 things about an object such as i) that an object will be fully deallocated, ii) that an object will be partially deallocated (and hence will be corrupted), and iii) that an object will lose some of its paths but not all of them (and will suffer reliability or performance when accessed) if a user confirms deallocation of the selected set of resources. It may be useful to note that case (i) is actually a special circumstance of case (iii) in which an object loses *all* its paths. In other words, an object that loses all its paths is considered fully deallocated.","Techniques described herein are well suited for use in applications in which a network manager manages allocation and deallocation of resources in a SAN environment. However, it should be noted that techniques herein are not limited to use in such applications and thus embodiments of the invention are well suited for other applications as well.","Other embodiments herein include a computerized device (e.g., a host computer, workstation, etc.) configured to support the aforementioned method operations. In such embodiments, the computerized device includes a display, a memory system, a processor (e.g., a processing device), and an interconnect. The interconnect supports communications among the display, the processor and the memory system. The memory system is encoded with a resource management application that, when executed on the processor, produces a resource management process that includes a graphical user interface produced on the display of the computerized device. The graphical user interface allows the resource management process to perform any of the method embodiments and operations explained herein.","Yet other techniques of the present application include software programs to perform the method embodiment and operations summarized above and disclosed in detail below under the heading Detailed Description section of this application. More particularly, a computer program product (e.g., a computer-readable medium) including computer program logic encoded thereon may be executed on a computerized device to facilitate deallocation of resources in a storage area network as explained herein. The computer program logic, when executed on at least one processor with a computing system, causes the processor to perform the operations (e.g., the methods) indicated herein. Such arrangements of the invention are typically provided as software, code and\/or other data structures arranged or encoded on a computer readable medium such as an optical medium (e.g., CD-ROM), floppy or hard disk or other a medium such as firmware or microcode in one or more ROM or RAM or PROM chips or as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or as downloadable software images in one or more modules, shared libraries, etc. The software or firmware or other such configurations can be installed onto a computerized device to cause one or more processors in the computerized device to perform the techniques explained herein.","Another embodiment herein is directed to a computer program product that includes a computer readable medium having instructions stored thereon for facilitating execution of management commands. The instructions, when carried out by a processor of a respective computer device, cause the processor to perform the steps of: i) receiving a selected at least one resource to be deallocated from the storage area network environment; ii) applying a traversal function to a repository of managed objects representing the resources in the storage area network environment to identify other resources in the storage area network environment that at least partially rely on existence of the selected at least one resource for accessing data stored in the storage area network environment; and iii) prior to deallocating the selected at least one resource from the storage area network environment, graphically presenting the selected at least one resource in relation to the identified other resources to illustrate a) respective managed objects that will be partially deallocated and b) respective managed objects that will be completely deallocated as a result of deallocating the selected at least one resource. It should be understood that the system herein can be embodied as a software program or as a software program operating in conjunction with corresponding hardware. Example embodiments herein also may be implemented within EMC's Control Center (ECC) software application that provides graphical management functionality for storage area network resources and in computerized devices that operate the Control Center (ECC) software. Control Center software is manufactured by EMC Corporation of Hopkinton, Mass., USA.","In a storage area network environment, resources or objects in a host computer system (e.g., host objects or host resources) typically have a predefined relationship with respect to one or more storage device resources on the storage arrays to which the host computer system is connected through the storage area network. For example, logical resources such as file systems, databases, logical volumes and volume groups of a logical volume manager, multipath devices, and host interface devices, etc. in the storage area network typically map to storage devices (e.g., disk drives) in the storage arrays of the storage area network for storage of data. Management actions or commands applied to a selected set of host resources can affect operation of the other resources (e.g., those resources not explicitly being deleted) in unexpected ways without first knowing how those host resources are mapped via relationships to their corresponding storage device resources. For example, application of management operations or actions (e.g., commands) on a host resource, such as deallocation of storage space (e.g., removing storage space assigned to a file system or database or volume group), disabling paths, establishing zoning, changing protection levels associated with that host resource and so forth may affect operation of those and possibly other host or even non-host resources in sometimes unpredictable manners. In conventional management applications, an administrator performs or applies such management actions by selecting a graphical set of objects that represent the resources and applying a corresponding management action to those selected objects or resources.","In one example case, assume that a host resource such as a volume or file system is fully represented by a selected set of storage devices to be deallocated. For example, assume that host resource does not use any storage device resources other than the ones to which the action is to be applied. In this case, the actions on the storage device resources are in effect actions on the host resource itself because deallocation of a resource does not only partially impact another resource in the storage area network. In other words, if a network manager deallocates a storage device in the storage area network used only by the volume or file system (assuming also that the volume or file system uses only the storage device and no others), deallocation of the storage device results in \u201ccomplete\u201d deallocation of the corresponding volume or file system.","In another example case, assume that a host resource is only partially represented by the set of storage device resources to which an action is to be applied. For example, assume that logical volume uses both a storage device that has been selected to be deallocated and another storage device that has not selected to be deallocated from the storage area network. In this case, deallocation of only one storage device used by the logical volume rather than both storage devices results in an incomplete action on the host resource (e.g., the logical volume), possibly corrupting that host resource. In this latter case, the administrator may want to insure that the action on the affected host resource is \u201ccomplete\u201d (i.e., like the first case above) before applying a deallocation command. To this end, techniques herein enable a user to view other storage device resource that the host resource \u201cuses\u201d (i.e., that share an operational or functional relationship with the host resource, either directly or indirectly via other resources), but which are not part of the originally selected set of resources. The user is thus able to preview a relationship topology prior to carrying out the action on those other storage device resources as well. Accordingly, a network manager may prevent accidentally deallocating a resource that, if deleted, would impair other resources in a storage area network environment that were not originally intended to be affected by deallocation of the resource.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","101","102","1","102","2","102","103","1","103","103","104","1","104","2","104","105","1","105","2","105","110","120","150"]},"In the example shown, computer system  is configured as a storage area network management station operated by network manager or user  (e.g., a user responsible for managing resources associated with storage area network ). Computer system  executes a resource manager application  (e.g., a software graphical user interface application more particularly shown in ) that generates and displays information in accordance with embodiments explained herein. The resource manager  in this example may be any type of network management software application that executes, performs or otherwise operates within the management station computerized system . It should be noted that computer system  may include certain other components such as one or more internal devices as well as software applications or processes that operate within or in conjunction with the illustrated components and devices in .","As shown towards the top of , the management station computer system  (e.g., a computer device) includes a corresponding display  (e.g., a monitor or other visual display device) that resource manager  controls to display a graphical user interface  as explained herein. In general, user  provides input commands to control what information (e.g., tables, pop-up screens, etc.) is displayed on display . For example, a user first makes a selection of one or more resources for potential deallocation from network system . In response to the selection, computer  generates a graphical user interface  including a display of the selected one or more resources as well as other related resources in the network system .","The resource manager  generally operates as explained herein to receive a management action or command from the user  (e.g., via a graphical user interface action on the display ), which is to be applied to a user selection of resource representations, presented by a management application as graphical icons on the display  of the management station computer system . After receiving a selection of resources by the user , the resource manager  identifies operational relationships between the selected resources and other resources within the storage area network  that may be affected by the application of the management action to the selected resource.","As a brief example, suppose the user , using the resource management application  graphically selects a representation of a file system resource associated with one of the host devices . Further suppose that the user  decides to apply a management action such as deallocation to a selected file system resource in order to deallocate storage space from the file system. According to techniques herein, the resource manager  identifies other resources that are operationally related to the file system resource to which the management action (e.g., deallocation) is to be applied. These other resources may be, for example, a logical volume resource, a host device resource, one or more storage device resources (operating within one or more of the storage systems ), and so forth. Once identified, the resource manager  graphically presents this collective set of \u201caction-affected resources\u201d to the user  to inform the user  of a set of resources within the storage area network environment that will be affected by the deallocation action if it is to be applied to the selected file system. Based on this information, the user  is able to make an informed decision if a given deallocation action will be properly carried out as intended so as not to adversely affect the integrity of other resources that will be impacted by the deallocation action.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["110","110","110","111","112","113","114","115","116","113","114","108","150","125","210","104","102","100","115","110","108","100"]},"As shown, memory system  is encoded with resource manager application - supporting generation, display, and implementation of functional operations of graphical user interface .

During operation, processor  accesses memory system  via the interconnect  in order to launch, run, execute, interpret or otherwise perform the logic instructions of the resource manager application -. Execution of resource manager application - produces processing functionality in resource manager process -. In other words, the resource manager process - represents one or more portions of the resource manager application - (or the entire application -) performing within or upon the processor  in the computerized device .","It should be noted that the resource manager  executed in computer system  is represented in  by either one or both of the resource manager application - and\/or the resource manager process -.

The resource manager application - may also be stored in a memory system  such as in firmware, read only memory (ROM), or, as in this example, as executable code in, for example, Random Access Memory (RAM). In addition to these embodiments, it should also be noted that other embodiments herein include the execution of resource manager application - in processor  as the resource manager process -. Thus, those skilled in the art will understand that the computer system  may include other processes and\/or software and hardware components, such as an operating system that controls allocation and use of hardware resources.","Display  need not be coupled directly to computer system . For example, the resource manager  can be executed on a remotely accessible computerized device. In this instance, the graphical user interface  may be displayed locally to the user , while the resource manager process  is executed remotely.","To generate displayed information in graphical user interface , the host computer system  (e.g., the resource manager process -) extracts information from database .

As an example, host entity - couples to network  via adapter - and corresponding ports . Ports  couple to respective ports  and  on switch devices  via a link such as a fiber cable. In turn, ports  and  of switch devices  couple to ports  and  (e.g., via a fiber cable) of corresponding storage system resources .

For example, in one embodiment, switch ports  and  of switches  are assigned to create a particular zone in network . In general, a zone set defines a group of resources in the network providing a logical path between a host resource and a storage array resource. As will be discussed in more detail, the resource manager  enables selection of a resource in the storage area network environment  and traverses a database  of managed objects to identify an interrelationship of the selected resources and other resources in the storage area network environment .

Likewise, the relationship indicator - indicates that the host interface device resource - is in use by the logical volume resource -. Continuing this example, the relationship indicator - that extends out of the host computer system  across the storage area network  (e.g., through one of the switches  as in ) and joins storage device resource - (which may be, for example, a disk drive or logical portion thereof in the data storage system ) and indicates that the storage device resource - is in use by the host device resource -.","The resource indicators  in  may further illustrate data flow, relationship paths, or information flows between resources within the storage area network . As discussed in the above example, the continuous path of resource indicators - through - represent data flow, or information flow, or in use paths from the database resource - to the storage device resource -. Data flow path - through - indicates that a portion of the data associated with the database resource  (e.g., a database instance available for access to client computer systems  from the host computer system ) is stored in the storage device resource - (i.e., is stored within a disk drive represented by this storage device resource). Note that only a portion of the data from the database resource - is stored within the storage device resource - because other relationship paths extend from the database resource - to other logical volume resources  which, in turn, have other relationship indicators  extending to other resources that continue on down to different data storage device resources .","Certain techniques herein are based in part on the observation that a management action applied to a particular resource  through  within a network environment such as the storage area network  can have an impact or affect on other resources due to the operational relationships existing between the various resources. For example, using the deallocation example from above, suppose a user  selects a graphical representation of the file system resource - in graphical user interface  and decides to deallocate some or all of the storage space associated with this file system resource -. Techniques herein employ a processor traversal function to follow the relationship indicators  from the selected file system resource - down to the logical volume resource - and further down to the host interface device resource - and then to the lowest level storage device resource -. In other words, the processor function follows a path through levels of a hierarchy of resources as in  to identify a relationship of a selected resource with other resources. Based on this information, the processor function identifies how deallocation of storage space in the file system - has an impact on the resources -, - and - within the network environment .  illustrate display of the relationships.","Referring again to , note that the volume group resource - has a relationship indicator - extending to the logical volume resource -. This indicates that the logical volume resource - is also \u201cin use\u201d by the volume group resource -. Accordingly, the deallocation operation applied to storage space associated with the file system resource - (in the above example) can potentially have an impact on the proper operation of the volume group resource - since this volume group - \u201cuses\u201d (i.e., includes data stored on storage space associated with) the logical volume - which is also, as explained above, \u201cused by\u201d the file system resource - from which space is to be deallocated. Accordingly, due to the complex series of interrelationships between the resources illustrated in , application of a management action to any particular resource  through  as selected by the user  may have potential adverse operational impact on other resources.","Embodiments herein operate to allow the user  to identify those other resources  through  that might be impacted by application of a particular management action or command to a particular selected resource  through  or group of selected resources. To perform such operation, processor functionality is capable of traversing relationships between resources as indicated in  by the resource indicators  to discover or identify operational, functional, dependency, inherency, or other types of interrelationships between resources within, for example, the host computer system  and the data storage system  in order to notify the user of those other impacted resources that may be affected upon application of a management action to the selected resource(s)  through  chosen by the user for that action.","To traverse the resource indicators , computer  applies a series of resource traversal functions that can navigate up and down a resource hierarchy along the relationship indicator paths  in the repository  that contains managed objects  that represent the collective set of resources operating within a respective storage area network. In particular, managed objects  represent respective resources  through  in the network environment. The managed objects  in the repository  are hierarchically related as identified by indicators . The hierarchy order includes host objects representing host resources  through  and storage objects representing storage resources  that are allocated for storing data accessed by the host resources. The host objects (i.e. resources  through  in a host computer system ) are hierarchically related above the storage objects  (the lowest objects) in the hierarchically arranged order.","In one application, the hierarchy or order of resources includes top-level resources that include database , file system  and volume group resources  (e.g., top level objects in the repository  or resources in the actual storage area network ), followed by the next lower level of logical volume resources , which are then followed further down in the hierarchy by multipath device resources , below which are host interface device resources  which are then followed downward by the lowest level storage device resources . Hierarchically arranged host objects thus include a top-level host computer system (i.e., the computer itself and all its resources), a database , a file system , a volume group , a logical volume , a multipath device , a host interface device such as a host interface card or port. Hierarchically arranged storage objects include the lowest-level storage devices  such as disk drives that store data. Other resources not shown in these examples can include, for example, a storage adapter, storage ports, software entities in the data storage system  and so forth. As will be explained, the hierarchy of relationships between the resources  through  can be followed up or down by the resource traversal functions in order to identify resources that extend along the set of device or relationship path indicators . It is assumed for proper operation of embodiments that the repository  contains a collective set of managed objects  that properly represent the operational relationships as they currently exist between actual resources  through  within the storage area network environment . That is, the repository  contains a collective set of managed objects  that contain data and information about each related resource in the storage area network . For example, the managed objects  contain references such as pointers, inheritances, function calls, application programming interfaces (APIs) or other software mechanisms for one object to reference another thus defining or indicating an operational relationship  between the resources that correspond to those managed objects  in the repository . Accordingly, the resources  through  illustrated in  can equivalently be thought of as respective managed objects  that reference another managed object  as indicated by relationship indicators . In other words, the illustration in  is also suitable for use as a view of the managed objects  and their interrelationship amongst each other.","An example of a repository  to which techniques herein may be applied is the Enterprise Control Center (ECC) store repository maintained by EMC Corporation's ECC storage area network management software that includes a resource manager .

For example, resource manager  generating graphical user interface  \u201cbolds\u201d storage device - in storage device column  with highlighting to indicate that storage device - has been selected by user  for deallocation. Depending on the application, a user  can select a single resource or multiple resources for deallocation. In one application, a user  selects resources from a pop-up window and thereafter clicks on a \u201ccontinue\u201d icon to produce graphical user interface  and proceed with potentially deallocating resources.","File system resource -, logical volume resource -, and host device - represent a group of resources that will be completely or inherently deleted upon deallocation of storage device -.

These sub-resources also can be displayed and highlighted in graphical user interface . This group of resources is highlighted by dotted lines.","Resource manager  generates graphical user interface  based upon which resources in  have been selected by user  for deallocation. For example, based on the selection and traversal of managed objects  in repository , the resource manager  identifies resources in the hierarchy that are related to the selected resource which will be completely or partially impacted by applying a deallocation command. In the graphical user interface  shown in , the resource manager  performs an upward traversal to identify any resources that rely on use of storage device -. For those resources identified during the upward traversal, the resource manager  identifies whether or not there are paths from such resources (e.g., sub-resources) to other resources in a downward traversal other than through the path used to initially identify the resource via the first upward traversal. If not, the resource manager  highlights the resources (e.g., file system -, logical volume -, and host device -) as being completely affected by a deallocation of the selected resource. If so, the resource manager  highlights the resources (e.g., database -, volume group -, and logical volume -) as being partially affected by a deallocation of the selected resource.","In one application, resource manager  displays sub-resources associated with a group of resources that are only partially impacted by deallocation of the originally selected resource. For example, in addition to displaying logical volume -, resource manager  can display resources such as MPD -A, host device -, host device -, logical volume -, logical volume -, etc. as in . As discussed, this group of sub-resources would be appropriately highlighted so that a user  can identify this class of resources with respect to the other highlighted groups of resources.","Note that graphical user interface  includes path indicators  to show a relationship of a resource at one level to a resource at another level in the hierarchy. For example, indicator - identifies a path from host device - to storage device -. In one application, the resource manager  does not provide a pictorial view of the indicators  in graphical user interface .","As another example, assume that the user  deallocates indicator path - instead of the storage device resource - in the hierarchy in . In this instance, the resource manager  would highlight path indicator - in graphical user interface  as the selected resource being deallocated. The resource manager  would also highlight the respective managed objects or resources (e.g., database -, volume group -, and logical volume -) that will be partially deallocated from the storage area network environment as a first set of resources, each of which has at least one associated downstream resource path other than through the selected one or more resources to be deallocated to other sub-resources in the storage area network environment . Additionally, in one application, the resource manager  would highlight respective managed objects (e.g., file system -, logical volume -, and host device -) that will be completely or inherently deallocated from the storage area network environment  as a second set of managed objects, each of which has downstream resource paths only through the selected one or more resources to be deallocated.","Note that a user  can select resources higher up in a hierarchy of  for potential deallocation.

User  can toggle display regions  and  to select and deselect resources for deallocation. For example, a user  can click on display region  to select path  and associated resources for deallocation from the storage area network environment . A user  can click on display region  to select path  and associated resources for deallocation from the storage area network environment . User  may click again on display regions  and  to deselect a respective path from being deallocated. In one application, graphical user interface  includes a selectable display region in proximity to any or all of the displayed resources so that a user  can select any additional resources in a hierarchy to deallocate from storage area network environment .","During operation, resource manager  populates columns  through  with information identifying resources (e.g., resources discussed in ) in storage area network environment  that are associated with paths  and . Accordingly, a user  can view what resources are associated with a given path to be deleted or a potential path (e.g., path ) to be deleted. In one application, resource manager  enables a user  to perform a fine-grain selection of a resource such as a host device, a host bus adapter, a host port, a switch fabric, a fiber channel port, a director, a storage array, and a storage device for deallocation from the storage area network environment .","Similar to the graphical user interface  in , columns  through  in  display resources in the storage area network environment  related to the path selected for deallocation. In one application, resource manager  highlights resources that will be impacted but not inherently deleted if the selected resource were deallocated from the storage area network environment . For example, path  is selected for deallocation. Resource manager  initiates the up-down traversal function to identify that resource  in column  would be impacted if path  were deallocated from storage area network environment  but not inherently deleted as previously discussed. In other words, resource  corresponds to a managed object  that would only be partially deallocated. Shaded region  (e.g., pink shading) identifies the partial deallocation and that the integrity of the resource  and underlying object is at risk if the user proceeds with deallocation. The user may select other resources for deallocation. Upon selection of other resources for deallocation such as clicking on display region , the resource manager  re-computes which objects will be partially deallocated and updates graphical user interface  accordingly. Selection of path  would also cause resources in path  to be highlighted as well.","In certain circumstances, a column such as column  may include multiple identified partially deallocated objects. To bring partially deallocated objects in view, the user  can click on a heading of the column (such as column ) to initiate a resorting by resource manager . Resorting causes all partially deallocated objects to be displayed toward the top of a column for simultaneous viewing by the user . This renders it easier for the user  to assess which resources are being partially deallocated and whether to proceed with deallocation. Thus, a user  can preview an affect of deallocation and abort a process of deallocating the selected one or more resources from the storage area network environment .","In one application, a user  may notify the resource manager  to proceed with deallocation of the selected one or more resources as well as other selected or related resources in the storage area network environment  so that all resources having a logical path through the initially selected one or more resources are deallocated from the storage area network environment .","Functionality supported by computer system  will now be discussed with respect to flowchart  in .

Accordingly, the resource manager  highlights the identified other resources in the storage area network environment  that would not be inherently deleted altogether from the storage area network environment  but whose ability to access data would at least be partially reduced if the selected one or more resources were deallocated from the storage area network environment . In other words, a user  may deallocate storage device resource -. As a result, file system resource -, logical volume -, and host device - will inherently be deallocated. Database resource -, volume group -, and logical volume - will survive but will be affected because each of these resources partially utilizes (e.g., does not depend solely on) storage device resource - as a resource to store data.","In step , using graphical user interface  or , the resource manager  illustrates a storage allocation relationship between the selected one or more resources and the identified other related resources.","Referring now to , in step , the resource manager  provides selectable display regions (e.g., display regions , ) in relation to respective managed objects  (e.g., resources) displayed in graphical user interface  of display screen  to enable selection of which additional resources in the storage area network environment  to deallocate along with the selected one or more resources.
