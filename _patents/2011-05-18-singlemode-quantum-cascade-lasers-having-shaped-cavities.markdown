title: Single-mode quantum cascade lasers having shaped cavities
abstract: Single-mode quantum cascade lasers having shaped cavities of various geometries are provided. The shaped cavities function as monolithic coupled resonators, and permit single-mode operation of the lasers. A folded or hairpin-shaped cavity could be provided, having a plurality of straight segments interconnected with a curved segment. Additionally, a shaped cavity could be provided having a single straight segment interconnected at one end to a curved segment. The curved segment could also be tapered in shape, such that the width of the curved segment decreases toward one end of the curved segment. A laser which includes a shaped cavity having two interconnected, folded shaped cavities is also provided.

No. 61\/346,320 filed May 19, 2010, the entire disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention was made with government support under National Science Foundation Grant No. EEC-0540832. Accordingly, the Government has certain rights to the present invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to the field of semiconductor lasers. More specifically, the present invention relates to single-mode quantum cascade lasers having shaped cavities.","2. Related Art","Quantum cascade (QC) lasers are mid-infrared (mid-IR) laser light sources fabricated from semiconductor (epitaxial) materials. QC lasers are useful in a number different applications, such as molecular detection, environmental trace gas sensing, medical diagnostics, etc. QC lasers are unipolar, and laser emission is achieved through the use of intersubband transitions present in alternating stacks of semiconductor materials.","It is possible to operate QC lasers in so-called \u201csingle mode,\u201d wherein the device emits laser light of a single wavelength. Single-mode operation of QC lasers is usually achieved by either integrating distributed feedback (DFB) Bragg gratings into the laser cavity, or by making use of macroscopic gratings in an external cavity (EC) configuration. However, both approaches require complicated fabrication and\/or coating processes. EC-QC lasers also require high-precision alignments, therefore the cost for single-mode QC lasers is much higher than that of the simple ridge lasers.","It is known to fabricate QC lasers with resonant waveguides. For example, QC lasers have been fabricated with ridge waveguides such as straight Fabry-Perot (FP) resonators. Such straight FP waveguides\/resonators generally operate in multiple longitudinal modes, and therefore are generally not suitable for single-mode applications.","The present invention relates to single-mode quantum cascade lasers having shaped cavities of various geometries. The shaped cavities function as monolithic coupled cavity resonators, and permit single-mode operation of the lasers. In one embodiment, the laser includes a folded or hairpin shaped cavity having a plurality of straight segments interconnected with a curved segment. The curved segment could have a constant width or a flat inner wall. The straight segments could include inner or outer tapered walls. In another embodiment, the laser includes a shaped cavity having a single straight segment interconnected at one end to a curved segment. The curved segment could be curved to any desired degree (e.g., 360 degrees, 180 degrees, 90 degrees, etc.), and could also be spiral shaped. The curved segment could also be tapered in shape, such that the width of the curved segment decreases toward one end of the curved segment. In another embodiment, the laser includes a shaped cavity having two interconnected, folded shaped cavities.","The present invention relates to single-mode quantum cascade lasers having shaped cavities, as discussed in detail below in connection with . It is noted that, while the structures discussed herein relate to quantum cascade lasers, it is possible that such structures could also be implanted to form lasers of other types (e.g., diode lasers).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","14","14","16","14","14","14","14","18","18","21","18","18","10","12","20","19","12","20","12","14","14"],"i":["a","b ","a","b","a","b ","a","b ","a","b","a","b "]},"The inner diameter of the curved segment  could vary, e.g., from 25 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm (or other size) with a step size of 25 \u03bcm, for example. The widths of the curved segment  and the straight segments , could be any desired width, e.g., approximately 18.5 \u03bcm. Single-mode emission from the laser  can be achieved in pulsed mode operation yielding, e.g., up to approximately 400 mA above threshold current, up to approximately 1.8 times threshold current, and\/or an additional 80% above threshold current, at a temperature of 80 K with a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of approximately 20 dB. Further, tunable and single-mode emission can be achieved in pulsed mode operation with an SMSR of up to 27 dB, with large operating current ranges of up to 60% above threshold current and tuning ranges of over 40 cmby changing ridge length and over 15 cmby changing operating temperature.","The folded FP resonator waveguide  can be considered to be a hairpin- or half-racetrack-shaped coupled cavity consisting of the two straight FP segments , and the curved segment . The curved segment  functions as a highly selective mode filter. The modes in the curved segment  are so-called \u201cwhispering gallery\u201d modes. Thus, the free spectral range of the cavity  is significantly increased compared to that of a straight FP resonator of similar length. The laser  has an emission wavelength of, for example, approximately 4.5 \u03bcm, but other wavelengths can be achieved (e.g., by altering the gain material utilized in the device) provided that single-mode emission occurs. Since the propagating modes in the straight sections and the half-ring section are different, they experience different modal refractive indices, and therefore reflection takes place at locations where different propagation modes from neighboring sections couple into each other. The three sections, though having no physical boundaries therebetween, can be seen as individual cavities and together form a monolithic coupled cavity, which enhances the mode selectivity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2","10","20","14","14","16","22","30","20","22","10","24","22","26","24","28","30","28"],"i":["a","b "]},"The laser  shown in  could be fabricated employing standard III-V semiconductor fabrication techniques. The ridges of the cavity  could be etched through the epitaxial layer to a height of approximately 7.5 \u03bcm and a width of approximately 18.5 \u03bcm, and SiO(3000 \u212b) could be deposited on the side-walls for electrical insulation. The device could be thinned to approximately 200 \u03bcm and top Ti\/Au (300\/3000 \u212b) and bottom Ge\/Au (300\/3000 \u212b) contacts could be applied. Devices with various half-ring diameters could be cleaved to approximately 1.2 mm in length and mounted epitaxial side up to copper heat sinks.
