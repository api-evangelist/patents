The three dimensional (3D) position of the point can be computed from basic geometric relationships when the 3D relationship between the imagers is known. The challenge in computing spatial location from multiple images, often referred to as stereo correlation or stereo depth computation, is automatically and accurately associating the mapping of a point in one image with its mapping in another image. This is most often done by correlating image features from one image to one or more others. The underlying assumption in all stereo matching methods, however, is that there must be some identifiable local contrast or feature in the image in order to match that point to its location in another image. Therefore a problem arises when there is no local contrast or feature in the image because of misfocus\u2014stereo matching does not produce accurate results in regions of an image that are out of focus.","The conventional means for extending the focal depth of an image is to reduce the diameter of the camera's lens's pupil (\u201cstopping down\u201d). However, two side effects restrict the usefulness of the technique. First, the sensitivity of the imaging system is reduced by a factor equal to the square of the pupil diameter ratio. Second, the maximum spatial frequency response is reduced a factor equal to the pupil diameter ratio, which limits the resolution and contrast in the image. There is thus a tradeoff between depth of field, exposure time, and overall contrast in conventional imaging systems. In the case of a multiple camera ranging system, the net effect will be a compromise between stereoscopic depth accuracy and working range.","Each patent, patent application, and\/or publication mentioned in this specification is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety to the same extent as if each individual patent, patent application, and\/or publication was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.","Systems and methods are described below for gesture-based control using three-dimensional information extracted over an extended depth of field. A system of an embodiment comprises a plurality of optical detectors coupled to at least one processor. The optical detectors image a body. At least two optical detectors of the plurality of optical detectors comprise wavefront coding cameras. The processor automatically detects a gesture of the body, wherein the gesture comprises an instantaneous state of the body. The detecting comprises aggregating gesture data of the gesture at an instant in time. The gesture data includes focus-resolved data of the body within a depth of field of the imaging system. The processor translates the gesture to a gesture signal, and uses the gesture signal to control a component coupled to the processor.","A method of an embodiment comprises imaging a body with an imaging system, wherein the imaging includes generating wavefront coded images of the body. The method automatically detects a gesture of a body, wherein the gesture comprises an instantaneous state of the body. The detecting comprises aggregating gesture data of the gesture at an instant in time. The gesture data includes focus-resolved data of the body within a depth of field of the imaging system. The method comprises translating the gesture to a gesture signal, and controlling a component coupled to a computer in response to the gesture signal.","In the following description, a number of features are described in detail in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the embodiments described herein. It is apparent that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other cases, well known features have not been described in detail.","System","A block diagram of an embodiment of the invention is illustrated in . A user locates his hands  and  in the viewing area of an array of cameras A-D. The cameras detect location, orientation, and movement of the fingers and hands  and  and generate output signals to pre-processor . Pre-processor  translates the camera output into a gesture signal that is provided to the computer processing unit  of the system. The computer  uses the input information to generate a command to control one or more on screen cursors and provides video output to display .","Although the system is shown with a single user's hands as input, the invention may also be implemented using multiple users. In addition, instead of or in addition to hands, the system may track any part or parts of a user's body, including head, feet, legs, arms, elbows, knees, and the like.","In the embodiment shown, four cameras are used to detect the location, orientation, and movement of the user's hands  and . It should be understood that the invention may be used with more or fewer cameras without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. In addition, although the cameras are disposed symmetrically in the example embodiment, there is no requirement of such symmetry in the invention. Any number or positioning of cameras that permits the location, orientation, and movement of the user's hands may be used in the invention.","In one embodiment of the invention, the cameras used are motion capture cameras capable of capturing grey-scale images. In one embodiment, the cameras used are those manufactured by Vicon, such as the Vicon MX40 camera. This camera includes on-camera processing and is capable of image capture at 1000 frames per second. A motion capture camera is capable of detecting and locating markers.","In the embodiment described, the cameras are used for optical detection. In other embodiments, the cameras or other detectors may be used for electromagnetic, magnetostatic, RFID, or any other suitable type of detection.","Pre-processor  is used to generate three dimensional space point reconstruction and skeletal point labeling. The gesture translator  is used to convert the 3D spatial information and marker motion information into a command language that can be interpreted by a computer processor to update the location, shape, and action of a cursor on a display. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the pre-processor  and gesture translator  can be combined into a single device.","Computer  may be any general purpose computer such as manufactured by Apple, Dell, or any other suitable manufacturer. The computer  runs applications and provides display output. Cursor information that would otherwise come from a mouse or other prior art input device now comes from the gesture system.","Marker Tags","The invention contemplates the use of marker tags on one or more fingers of the user so that the system can locate the hands of the user, identify whether it is viewing a left or right hand, and which fingers are visible. This permits the system to detect the location, orientation, and movement of the users hands. This information allows a number of gestures to be recognized by the system and used as commands by the user.","The marker tags in one embodiment are physical tags comprising a substrate (appropriate in the present embodiment for affixing to various locations on a human hand) and discrete markers arranged on the substrate's surface in unique identifying patterns.","The markers and the associated external sensing system may operate in any domain (optical, electromagnetic, magnetostatic, etc.) that allows the accurate, precise, and rapid and continuous acquisition of their three-space position. The markers themselves may operate either actively (e.g. by emitting structured electromagnetic pulses) or passively (e.g. by being optically retroreflective, as in the present embodiment).","At each frame of acquisition, the detection system receives the aggregate cloud of recovered three-space locations comprising all markers from tags presently in the instrumented workspace volume (within the visible range of the cameras or other detectors). The markers on each tag are of sufficient multiplicity and are arranged in unique patterns such that the detection system can perform the following tasks: (1) segmentation, in which each recovered marker position is assigned to one and only one subcollection of points that form a single tag; (2) labelling, in which each segmented subcollection of points is identified as a particular tag; (3) location, in which the three-space position of the identified tag is recovered; and (4) orientation, in which the three-space orientation of the identified tag is recovered. Tasks (1) and (2) are made possible through the specific nature of the marker-patterns, as described below and as illustrated in one embodiment in .","The markers on the tags in one embodiment are affixed at a subset of regular grid locations. This underlying grid may, as in the present embodiment, be of the traditional Cartesian sort; or may instead be some other regular plane tessellation (a triangular\/hexagonal tiling arrangement, for example). The scale and spacing of the grid is established with respect to the known spatial resolution of the marker-sensing system, so that adjacent grid locations are not likely to be confused. Selection of marker patterns for all tags should satisfy the following constraint: no tag's pattern shall coincide with that of any other tag's pattern through any combination of rotation, translation, or mirroring. The multiplicity and arrangement of markers may further be chosen so that loss (or occlusion) of some specified number of component markers is tolerated: After any arbitrary transformation, it should still be unlikely to confuse the compromised module with any other.","Referring now to , a number of tags A-E (left hand) and A-E (right hand) are shown. Each tag is rectangular and consists in this embodiment of a 5\u00d77 grid array. The rectangular shape is chosen as an aid in determining orientation of the tag and to reduce the likelihood of mirror duplicates. In the embodiment shown, there are tags for each finger on each hand. In some embodiments, it may be adequate to use one, two, three, or four tags per hand. Each tag has a border of a different grey-scale or color shade. Within this border is a 3\u00d75 grid array. Markers (represented by the black dots of ) are disposed at certain points in the grid array to provide information.","Qualifying information may be encoded in the tags' marker patterns through segmentation of each pattern into \u2018common\u2019 and \u2018unique\u2019 subpatterns. For example, the present embodiment specifies two possible \u2018border patterns\u2019, distributions of markers about a rectangular boundary. A \u2018family\u2019 of tags is thus established\u2014the tags intended for the left hand might thus all use the same border pattern as shown in tags A-E while those attached to the right hand's fingers could be assigned a different pattern as shown in tags A-E. This subpattern is chosen so that in all orientations of the tags, the left pattern can be distinguished from the right pattern. In the example illustrated, the left hand pattern includes a marker in each corner and on marker in a second from corner grid location. The right hand pattern has markers in only two corners and two markers in non corner grid locations. An inspection of the pattern reveals that as long as any three of the four markers are visible, the left hand pattern can be positively distinguished from the left hand pattern. In one embodiment, the color or shade of the border can also be used as an indicator of handedness.","Each tag must of course still employ a unique interior pattern, the markers distributed within its family's common border. In the embodiment shown, it has been found that two markers in the interior grid array are sufficient to uniquely identify each of the ten fingers with no duplication due to rotation or orientation of the fingers. Even if one of the markers is occluded, the combination of the pattern and the handedness of the tag yields a unique identifier.","In the present embodiment, the grid locations are visually present on the rigid substrate as an aid to the (manual) task of affixing each retroreflective marker at its intended location. These grids and the intended marker locations are literally printed via color inkjet printer onto the substrate, which here is a sheet of (initially) flexible \u2018shrink-film\u2019. Each module is cut from the sheet and then oven-baked, during which thermal treatment each module undergoes a precise and repeatable shrinkage. For a brief interval following this procedure, the cooling tag may be shaped slightly\u2014to follow the longitudinal curve of a finger, for example; thereafter, the substrate is suitably rigid, and markers may be affixed at the indicated grid points.","In one embodiment, the markers themselves are three dimensional, such as small reflective spheres affixed to the substrate via adhesive or some other appropriate means. The three dimensionality of the markers can be an aid in detection and location over two dimensional markers. However either can be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.","At present, tags are affixed via Velcro or other appropriate means to a glove worn by the operator or are alternately affixed directly to the operator's fingers using a mild double-stick tape. In a third embodiment, it is possible to dispense altogether with the rigid substrate and affix\u2014or \u2018paint\u2019\u2014individual markers directly onto the operator's fingers and hands.","Gesture Vocabulary","The invention contemplates a gesture vocabulary consisting of hand poses, orientation, hand combinations, and orientation blends. A notation language is also implemented for designing and communicating poses and gestures in the gesture vocabulary of the invention. The gesture vocabulary is a system for representing instantaneous \u2018pose states\u2019 of kinematic linkages in compact textual form. The linkages in question may be biological (a human hand, for example; or an entire human body; or a grasshopper leg; or the articulated spine of a lemur) or may instead be nonbiological (e.g. a robotic arm). In any case, the linkage may be simple (the spine) or branching (the hand). The gesture vocabulary system of the invention establishes for any specific linkage a constant length string; the aggregate of the specific ASCII characters occupying the string's \u2018character locations\u2019 is then a unique description of the instantaneous state, or \u2018pose\u2019, of the linkage.","Hand Poses",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},"Still referring to , a number of poses are defined and identified using ASCII characters. Some of the poses are divided between thumb and non-thumb. The invention in this embodiment uses a coding such that the ASCII character itself is suggestive of the pose. However, any character may used to represent a pose, whether suggestive or not. In addition, there is no requirement in the invention to use ASCII characters for the notation strings. Any suitable symbol, numeral, or other representation maybe used without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, the notation may use two bits per finger if desired or some other number of bits as desired.","A curled finger is represented by the character \u201c^\u201d while a curled thumb by \u201c>\u201d. A straight finger or thumb pointing up is indicated by \u201c1\u201d and at an angle by \u201c\\\u201d or \u201c\/\u201d. \u201c\u2212\u201d represents a thumb pointing straight sideways and \u201c\u00d7\u201d represents a thumb pointing into the plane.","Using these individual finger and thumb descriptions, a robust number of hand poses can be defined and written using the scheme of the invention. Each pose is represented by five characters with the order being p-r-m-i-t as described above.  illustrates a number of poses and a few are described here by way of illustration and example. The hand held flat and parallel to the ground is represented by \u201c11111\u201d. A fist is represented by \u201c^^^^>\u201d. An \u201cOK\u201d sign is represented by \u201c111^>\u201d.","The character strings provide the opportunity for straightforward \u2018human readability\u2019 when using suggestive characters. The set of possible characters that describe each degree of freedom may generally be chosen with an eye to quick recognition and evident analogy. For example, a vertical bar (\u2018|\u2019) would likely mean that a linkage element is \u2018straight\u2019, an ell (\u2018L\u2019) might mean a ninety-degree bend, and a circumflex (\u2018^\u2019) could indicate a sharp bend. As noted above, any characters or coding may be used as desired.","Any system employing gesture vocabulary strings such as described herein enjoys the benefit of the high computational efficiency of string comparison\u2014identification of or search for any specified pose literally becomes a \u2018string compare\u2019 (e.g. UNIX's \u2018strcmp( )\u2019 function) between the desired pose string and the instantaneous actual string. Furthermore, the use of \u2018wildcard characters\u2019 provides the programmer or system designer with additional familiar efficiency and efficacy: degrees of freedom whose instantaneous state is irrelevant for a match may be specified as an interrogation point (\u2018?\u2019); additional wildcard meanings may be assigned.","Orientation","In addition to the pose of the fingers and thumb, the orientation of the hand can represent information. Characters describing global-space orientations can also be chosen transparently: the characters \u2018<\u2019, \u2018>\u2019, \u2018^\u2019, and \u2018v\u2019 may be used to indicate, when encountered in an orientation character position, the ideas of left, right, up, and down.  illustrates hand orientation descriptors and examples of coding that combines pose and orientation. In an embodiment of the invention, two character positions specify first the direction of the palm and then the direction of the fingers (if they were straight, irrespective of the fingers' actual bends). The possible characters for these two positions express a \u2018body-centric\u2019 notion of orientation: \u2018\u2212\u2019, \u2018+\u2019, \u2018\u00d7\u2019, \u2018*\u2019, \u2018^\u2019, and \u2018v\u2019 describe medial, lateral, anterior (forward, away from body), posterior (backward, away from body), cranial (upward), and caudal (downward).","In the notation scheme of and embodiment of the invention, the five finger pose indicating characters are followed by a colon and then two orientation characters to define a complete command pose. In one embodiment, a start position is referred to as an \u201cxyz\u201d pose where the thumb is pointing straight up, the index finger is pointing forward and the middle finger is perpendicular to the index finger, pointing to the left when the pose is made with the right hand. This is represented by the string \u201c^^x1-:-X\u201d.","\u2018XYZ-hand\u2019 is a technique for exploiting the geometry of the human hand to allow full six-degree-of-freedom navigation of visually presented three-dimensional structure. Although the technique depends only on the bulk translation and rotation of the operator's hand\u2014so that its fingers may in principal be held in any pose desired\u2014the present embodiment prefers a static configuration in which the index finger points away from the body; the thumb points toward the ceiling; and the middle finger points left-right. The three fingers thus describe (roughly, but with clearly evident intent) the three mutually orthogonal axes of a three-space coordinate system: thus \u2018XYZ-hand\u2019.","XYZ-hand navigation then proceeds with the hand, fingers in a pose as described above, held before the operator's body at a predetermined \u2018neutral location\u2019. Access to the three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom of a three-space object (or camera) is effected in the following natural way: left-right movement of the hand (with respect to the body's natural coordinate system) results in movement along the computational context's x-axis; up-down movement of the hand results in movement along the controlled context's y-axis; and forward-back hand movement (toward\/away from the operator's body) results in z-axis motion within the context. Similarly, rotation of the operator's hand about the index finger leads to a \u2018roll\u2019 change of the computational context's orientation; \u2018pitch\u2019 and \u2018yaw\u2019 changes are effected analogously, through rotation of the operator's hand about the middle finger and thumb, respectively.","Note that while \u2018computational context\u2019 is used here to refer to the entity being controlled by the XYZ-hand method\u2014and seems to suggest either a synthetic three-space object or camera\u2014it should be understood that the technique is equally useful for controlling the various degrees of freedom of real-world objects: the pan\/tilt\/roll controls of a video or motion picture camera equipped with appropriate rotational actuators, for example. Further, the physical degrees of freedom afforded by the XYZ-hand posture may be somewhat less literally mapped even in a virtual domain: In the present embodiment, the XYZ-hand is also used to provide navigational access to large panoramic display images, so that left-right and up-down motions of the operator's hand lead to the expected left-right or up-down \u2018panning\u2019 about the image, but forward-back motion of the operator's hand maps to \u2018zooming\u2019 control.","In every case, coupling between the motion of the hand and the induced computational translation\/rotation may be either direct (i.e. a positional or rotational offset of the operator's hand maps one-to-one, via some linear or nonlinear function, to a positional or rotational offset of the object or camera in the computational context) or indirect (i.e. positional or rotational offset of the operator's hand maps one-to-one, via some linear or nonlinear function, to a first or higher-degree derivative of position\/orientation in the computational context; ongoing integration then effects a non-static change in the computational context's actual zero-order position\/orientation). This latter means of control is analogous to use of a an automobile's \u2018gas pedal\u2019, in which a constant offset of the pedal leads, more or less, to a constant vehicle speed.","The \u2018neutral location\u2019 that serves as the real-world XYZ-hand's local six-degree-of-freedom coordinate origin may be established (1) as an absolute position and orientation in space (relative, say, to the enclosing room); (2) as a fixed position and orientation relative to the operator herself (e.g. eight inches in front of the body, ten inches below the chin, and laterally in line with the shoulder plane), irrespective of the overall position and \u2018heading\u2019 of the operator; or (3) interactively, through deliberate secondary action of the operator (using, for example, a gestural command enacted by the operator's \u2018other\u2019 hand, said command indicating that the XYZ-hand's present position and orientation should henceforth be used as the translational and rotational origin).","It is further convenient to provide a \u2018detent\u2019 region (or \u2018dead zone\u2019) about the XYZ-hand's neutral location, such that movements within this volume do not map to movements in the controlled context.","Other poses may included:","[\u2225\u2225|:vx] is a flat hand (thumb parallel to fingers) with palm facing down and fingers forward.","[\u2225\u2225|:x^] is a flat hand with palm facing forward and fingers toward ceiling.","[\u2225\u2225|:x] is a flat hand with palm facing toward the center of the body (right if left hand, left if right hand) and fingers forward.","[^^^^-:-x] is a single-hand thumbs-up (with thumb pointing toward ceiling).","[^^^|-:-x] is a mime gun pointing forward.","Two Hand Combination","The present invention contemplates single hand commands and poses, as well as two-handed commands and poses.  illustrates examples of two hand combinations and associated notation in an embodiment of the invention. Reviewing the notation of the first example, \u201cfull stop\u201d reveals that it comprises two closed fists. The \u201csnapshot\u201d example has the thumb and index finger of each hand extended, thumbs pointing toward each other, defining a goal post shaped frame. The \u201crudder and throttle start position\u201d is fingers and thumbs pointing up palms facing the screen.","Orientation Blends",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"Operation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["701","702","701","702","703","703","704","705","703","704","705"]},"At step  the information is translated to the gesture notation described above. At decision block  it is determined if the pose is valid. This may be accomplished via a simple string comparison using the generated notation string. If the pose is not valid, the system returns to step . If the pose is valid, the system sends the notation and position information to the computer at step . At step  the computer determines the appropriate action to take in response to the gesture and updates the display accordingly at step .","In one embodiment of the invention, steps - are accomplished by the on-camera processor. In other embodiments, the processing can be accomplished by the system computer if desired.","Parsing and Translation","The system is able to \u201cparse\u201d and \u201ctranslate\u201d a stream of low-level gestures recovered by an underlying system, and turn those parsed and translated gestures into a stream of command or event data that can be used to control a broad range of computer applications and systems. These techniques and algorithms may be embodied in a system consisting of computer code that provides both an engine implementing these techniques and a platform for building computer applications that make use of the engine's capabilities.","One embodiment is focused on enabling rich gestural use of human hands in computer interfaces, but is also able to recognize gestures made by other body parts (including, but not limited to arms, torso, legs and the head), as well as non-hand physical tools of various kinds, both static and articulating, including but not limited to calipers, compasses, flexible curve approximators, and pointing devices of various shapes. The markers and tags may be applied to items and tools that may be carried and used by the operator as desired.","The system described here incorporates a number of innovations that make it possible to build gestural systems that are rich in the range of gestures that can be recognized and acted upon, while at the same time providing for easy integration into applications.","The gestural parsing and translation system in one embodiment consists of:","1) a compact and efficient way to specify (encode for use in computer programs) gestures at several different levels of aggregation:\n\n","2) a programmatic technique for registering specific gestures from each category above that are relevant to a given application context.","3) algorithms for parsing the gesture stream so that registered gestures can be identified and events encapsulating those gestures can be delivered to relevant application contexts.","The specification system (), with constituent elements () to (), provides the basis for making use of the gestural parsing and translating capabilities of the system described here.","A single-hand \u201cpose\u201d is represented as a string of","i) relative orientations between the fingers and the back of the hand,","ii) quantized into a small number of discrete states.","Using relative joint orientations allows the system described here to avoid problems associated with differing hand sizes and geometries. No \u201coperator calibration\u201d is required with this system. In addition, specifying poses as a string or collection of relative orientations allows more complex gesture specifications to be easily created by combining pose representations with further filters and specifications.","Using a small number of discrete states for pose specification makes it possible to specify poses compactly as well as to ensure accurate pose recognition using a variety of underlying tracking technologies (for example, passive optical tracking using cameras, active optical tracking using lighted dots and cameras, electromagnetic field tracking, etc).","Gestures in every category () to () may be partially (or minimally) specified, so that non-critical data is ignored. For example, a gesture in which the position of two fingers is definitive, and other finger positions are unimportant, may be represented by a single specification in which the operative positions of the two relevant fingers is given and, within the same string, \u201cwild cards\u201d or generic \u201cignore these\u201d indicators are listed for the other fingers.","All of the innovations described here for gesture recognition, including but not limited to the multi-layered specification technique, use of relative orientations, quantization of data, and allowance for partial or minimal specification at every level, generalize beyond specification of hand gestures to specification of gestures using other body parts and \u201cmanufactured\u201d tools and objects.","The programmatic techniques for \u201cregistering gestures\u201d (), consist of a defined set of Application Programming Interface calls that allow a programmer to define which gestures the engine should make available to other parts of the running system.","These API routines may be used at application set-up time, creating a static interface definition that is used throughout the lifetime of the running application. They may also be used during the course of the run, allowing the interface characteristics to change on the fly. This real-time alteration of the interface makes it possible to,","i) build complex contextual and conditional control states,","ii) to dynamically add hysterisis to the control environment, and","iii) to create applications in which the user is able to alter or extend the interface vocabulary of the running system itself.","Algorithms for parsing the gesture stream () compare gestures specified as in () and registered as in () against incoming low-level gesture data. When a match for a registered gesture is recognized, event data representing the matched gesture is delivered up the stack to running applications.","Efficient real-time matching is desired in the design of this system, and specified gestures are treated as a tree of possibilities that are processed as quickly as possible.","In addition, the primitive comparison operators used internally to recognize specified gestures are also exposed for the applications programmer to use, so that further comparison (flexible state inspection in complex or compound gestures, for example) can happen even from within application contexts.","Recognition \u201clocking\u201d semantics are an innovation of the system described here. These semantics are implied by the registration API () (and, to a lesser extent, embedded within the specification vocabulary ()).

This distinction between entry and continuation states adds significantly to perceived system usability.","The system described here includes algorithms for robust operation in the face of real-world data error and uncertainty. Data from low-level tracking systems may be incomplete (for a variety of reasons, including occlusion of markers in optical tracking, network drop-out or processing lag, etc).","Missing data is marked by the parsing system, and interpolated into either \u201clast known\u201d or \u201cmost likely\u201d states, depending on the amount and context of the missing data.","If data about a particular gesture component (for example, the orientation of a particular joint) is missing, but the \u201clast known\u201d state of that particular component can be analyzed as physically possible, the system uses this last known state in its real-time matching.","Conversely, if the last known state is analyzed as physically impossible, the system falls back to a \u201cbest guess range\u201d for the component, and uses this synthetic data in its real-time matching.","The specification and parsing systems described here have been carefully designed to support \u201chandedness agnosticism,\u201d so that for multi-hand gestures either hand is permitted to satisfy pose requirements.","Coincident Virtual\/Display and Physical Spaces","The system can provide an environment in which virtual space depicted on one or more display devices (\u201cscreens\u201d) is treated as coincident with the physical space inhabited by the operator or operators of the system. An embodiment of such an environment is described here. This current embodiment includes three projector-driven screens at fixed locations, is driven by a single desktop computer, and is controlled using the gestural vocabulary and interface system described herein. Note, however, that any number of screens are supported by the techniques being described; that those screens may be mobile (rather than fixed); that the screens may be driven by many independent computers simultaneously; and that the overall system can be controlled by any input device or technique.","The interface system described in this disclosure should have a means of determining the dimensions, orientations and positions of screens in physical space. Given this information, the system is able to dynamically map the physical space in which these screens are located (and which the operators of the system inhabit) as a projection into the virtual space of computer applications running on the system. As part of this automatic mapping, the system also translates the scale, angles, depth, dimensions and other spatial characteristics of the two spaces in a variety of ways, according to the needs of the applications that are hosted by the system.","This continuous translation between physical and virtual space makes possible the consistent and pervasive use of a number of interface techniques that are difficult to achieve on existing application platforms or that must be implemented piece-meal for each application running on existing platforms. These techniques include (but are not limited to):","1) Use of \u201cliteral pointing\u201d\u2014using the hands in a gestural interface environment, or using physical pointing tools or devices\u2014as a pervasive and natural interface technique.","2) Automatic compensation for movement or repositioning of screens.","3) Graphics rendering that changes depending on operator position, for example simulating parallax shifts to enhance depth perception.","4) Inclusion of physical objects in on-screen display\u2014taking into account real-world position, orientation, state, etc. For example, an operator standing in front of a large, opaque screen, could see both applications graphics and a representation of the true position of a scale model that is behind the screen (and is, perhaps, moving or changing orientation).","It is important to note that literal pointing is different from the abstract pointing used in mouse-based windowing interfaces and most other contemporary systems. In those systems, the operator must learn to manage a translation between a virtual pointer and a physical pointing device, and must map between the two cognitively.","By contrast, in the systems described in this disclosure, there is no difference between virtual and physical space (except that virtual space is more amenable to mathematical manipulation), either from an application or user perspective, so there is no cognitive translation required of the operator.","The closest analogy for the literal pointing provided by the embodiment described here is the touch-sensitive screen (as found, for example, on many ATM machines). A touch-sensitive screen provides a one to one mapping between the two-dimensional display space on the screen and the two-dimensional input space of the screen surface. In an analogous fashion, the systems described here provide a flexible mapping (possibly, but not necessarily, one to one) between a virtual space displayed on one or more screens and the physical space inhabited by the operator. Despite the usefulness of the analogy, it is worth understanding that the extension of this \u201cmapping approach\u201d to three dimensions, an arbritrarialy large architectural environment, and multiple screens is non-trivial.","In addition to the components described herein, the system may also implement algorithms implementing a continuous, systems-level mapping (perhaps modified by rotation, translation, scaling or other geometrical transformations) between the physical space of the environment and the display space on each screen.","A rendering stack which takes the computational objects and the mapping and outputs a graphical representation of the virtual space.","An input events processing stack which takes event data from a control system (in the current embodiment both gestural and pointing data from the system and mouse input) and maps spatial data from input events to coordinates in virtual space. Translated events are then delivered to running applications.","A \u201cglue layer\u201d allowing the system to host applications running across several computers on a local area network.","Gesture-Based Control Using Three-Dimensional Information Extracted Over an Extended Depth of Field",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0122"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","101","102","904","904","904","904"]},"The cameras A-D detect or capture images of the fingers and hands  and  including location, orientation, and movement of the fingers and hands  and  and generate output signals to pre-processor .

Alternatively, the wavefront coding digital signal processing can be included in, coupled to, or distributed among one or more other components of the system .

In so doing, the pre-processor  generates three dimensional space point reconstruction and skeletal point labeling. The gesture translator  converts the 3D spatial information and marker motion information into a command language that can be interpreted by a computer processor to update the location, shape, and action of a cursor on a display. The computer  uses the input information to generate a command to control one or more on screen cursors and provides video output to display .","One or more of the pre-processor , gesture translator , and computer  of an alternative embodiment can be combined into a single device. Regardless of system configuration, the functions and\/or functionality of each of the pre-processor , gesture translator , and computer  are as described above with reference to  and elsewhere herein.","Furthermore, while this example shows four cameras being used to detect the location, orientation, and movement of the user's hands  and , the embodiment is not so limited. The system configuration can include two or more cameras as appropriate to a system or workstation configuration. In addition, although the cameras are disposed symmetrically in the example embodiment, there is no requirement of such symmetry. Thus, at least two cameras with any positioning that permits the location, orientation, and movement of the user's hands may be used hereunder.","Although the system is shown with a single user's hands as input, the system can track hands of any number of multiple users. In addition, instead of or in addition to hands, the system may track any part or parts of a user's body, including head, feet, legs, arms, elbows, knees, and the like. Furthermore, the system can track any number of animate or inanimate objects and is not limited to tracking parts of a body.","In particular, for gesture analysis systems that locate an optical sensor so as to be deliberately or potentially proximal to an operator's hand (or equivalently tracked implement), the elements thus apprehended will typically range, throughout a natural sequence of operator motion, over several or many orders of relative distance magnitude. It is beyond the capacity of traditional optical imaging systems to provide a consistently focus-resolved record of events traversing such a range of distances. These close-approach to medium-distance geometries are often however desirable in the context of object- or operator-tracking for the purposes of macroscopic device and product design. It is thus of value to provide a technique (for which purpose traditional optics is inadequate) for insuring local contrast or salient feature stability over the expected range of operator activity.","In describing the extraction of three-dimensional information over an extended depth of field as used in the systems herein, distance to a point in a scene can be estimated from its location in two or more images captured simultaneously. The three dimensional (3D) position of the point can be computed from basic geometric relationships when the 3D relationship between the imagers is known. The challenge in computing spatial location from multiple images, often referred to as stereo correlation or stereo depth computation, is automatically and accurately associating the mapping of a point in one image with its mapping in another image. This is most often done by correlating image features from one image to one or more others. The underlying assumption in all stereo matching methods, however, is that there must be some identifiable local contrast or feature in the image in order to match that point to its location in another image. Therefore a problem arises when there is no local contrast or feature in the image because of misfocus\u2014stereo matching does not produce accurate results in regions of an image that are out of focus.","The conventional means for extending the focal depth of an image is to reduce the diameter of the camera's lens's pupil (\u201cstopping down\u201d). However, two side effects restrict the usefulness of the technique. First, the sensitivity of the imaging system is reduced by a factor equal to the square of the pupil diameter ratio. Second, the maximum spatial frequency response is reduced a factor equal to the pupil diameter ratio, which limits the resolution and contrast in the image. There is thus a tradeoff between depth of field, exposure time, and overall contrast in conventional imaging systems. In the case of a multiple camera ranging system, the net effect will be a compromise between stereoscopic depth accuracy and working range.","An alternate approach to increasing depth of field without stopping the lens is to introduce a phase mask of specified prescription in the pupil of the camera lens. With a properly chosen phase function, an extended depth of field can be recovered by subsequent electronic processing of the image captured on the sensor. This technique, known as wavefront coding, generally provides a tradeoff among depth of field, camera dynamic range, and signal-to-noise ratio. Wavefront coding makes it possible to optimize the camera parameters for a specific application. Applications that do not require a very high dynamic range and in which the illumination is under user control, such as gesture recognition described herein, can greatly benefit from wavefront coding to achieve a high accuracy over a prescribed volume of space.","As described above, the system of an embodiment includes a technique in which the processed outputs of a plurality of wavefront coding cameras are used to determine the range and position of selected objects within a scene. The extended depth of field that results from wavefront coding can be used in a number of applications, including gesture recognition and a broad array of other task-based imaging work, to significantly increase their performance. Although a minimum of two cameras is required, there is no upper limit to the number of cameras that can be used in the embodiment. The scene extraction can include any of a plurality of processing techniques (such as correlations) that are used for range extraction with two or more cameras. The embodiments described herein include all wavefront coding phase functions, and their corresponding decoding kernels, that result in an extended depth of field after processing.","Wavefront coding, as used in wavefront coding imaging systems, is a general technique of using generalized aspheric optics and digital signal processing to greatly increase the performance and\/or reduce the cost of imaging systems. The type of aspheric optics employed results in optical imaging characteristics that are very insensitive to misfocus related aberrations. A sharp and clear image is not directly produced from the optics, however, digital signal processing applied to the sampled image produces a sharp and clear final image that is also insensitive to misfocus related aberrations.","Wavefront coding is used to greatly increase imaging performance while also reducing the size, weight, and cost of imaging systems. Wavefront coding combines non-rotationally symmetric aspheric optical elements and digital signal processing in a fundamental manner to vastly extend the depth of field of imaging systems. With wavefront coding the depth of field or depth of focus of an imaging system can be increased by a factor of ten or more compared to traditional imaging systems, for a given aperture size or F\/#, for example. Wavefront coding optical elements of an embodiment are phase surfaces and as such do not absorb light or increase exposure or illumination requirements. Such extended depth of field performance is impossible with traditional imaging techniques without dramatic loss of optical power, such as required with stopped down apertures. Increased depth of field\/depth of focus also enables imaging systems to be physically less expensive, smaller, or lighter by controlling misfocus related aberrations that are traditionally controlled by adding lens elements or increasing lens complexity. Misfocus related aberrations that can be controlled with wavefront coding include chromatic aberration, Petzval curvature, astigmatism, spherical aberration, and temperature related misfocus.","Wavefront coding, as a hybrid imaging approach, combines optics and electronics to increase depth of field and reduce the number of optical elements, fabrication tolerances, and overall system cost.  is a block diagram of a wavefront coding imaging system  used in a gesture-based control system, under an embodiment. The optical section  of the wavefront coding imaging system  is a conventional optical system or camera modified with a wavefront coding optical element  placed near the aperture stop.

Digital processing  applied to the sampled image produces a sharp and clear image  that is very insensitive to misfocus effects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0132","num":"0136"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"],"b":["1100","1100","1101","1102","1101","1102","1120","1130","1140"]},"In the wavefront coding system , the optical portion of the system (e.g., wavefront coding cameras  and ) \u201ccodes\u201d the resulting images to produce intermediate images . Because the wavefront coding element (e.g., , element ) purposefully blurs all points in any image, the intermediate image  appears misfocused. In such intermediate images , nearly all the objects within the field of view are blurred, but they are blurred identically. In contrast, traditional optics typically form images that have a variable blur function that is dependent on the distance to each object in the scene.","In order to produce a sharp and clear image from the intermediate wavefront-coded image , electronics (e.g., wavefront coding digital signal processing) are used to process or \u201cdecode\u201d  and  the blurred intermediate image by removing the system-dependent image blur. The digital filtering can be performed in real-time by software or with specialized hardware solutions.","The system optics of an embodiment include conventional components with at least one additional optical element that performs the wavefront coding function, as described above with reference to . This element is placed in the optical path, typically near an aperture stop of the system to minimize vignetting. The signal processing performed on the detected image depends on the optics, wavefront coding element, and the first-order properties of the digital detector.","The general wavefront coding element is nonrotationally symmetric and smooth, although diffractive surfaces can be used. The element can be a separate component, or it can be integrated onto a traditional lens element by the addition of a generalized aspheric surface. All coding elements redirect light so that no ray, besides the on-axis ray, travels toward the traditional geometric focus point. In fact, no two rays are traveling toward the same point along the optical axis. The system does not form a clear image at any image plane.","The main effect of the optics portion of a wavefront-coded imaging system is to make the resulting images insensitive to focus-related aberrations such as defocus, spherical aberration, astigmatism, or field curvature. The intermediate blurry image is insensitive or invariant to changes in the object or imaging system that consist of defocus aberrations. From a systems analysis point of view, the modulation transfer functions (MTFs) and point spread functions (PSFs) of wavefront-coded systems are invariant with respect to defocus.","Although the MTF of an intermediate image from a wavefront-coded system shows little change with defocus, such MTFs do have reduced power compared with the in-focus traditional system. Since apodization is not used, total optical power is preserved. A digital filtering or image reconstruction process is used to form a clear image. These final MTFs are very insensitive to defocus\u2014thus, the wavefront-coded imaging system has a very large depth of field. Similarly, the intermediate PSFs from the wavefront-coded system are different from traditional system PSFs, but they change very little with changes in misfocus.","Referring again to , a special purpose optical aspheric element is placed at or near the aperture stop of a conventional imaging system to form a wavefront coding imaging system. This optical element modifies the imaging system in such a way that the resulting PSF and optical transfer function (OTF) are insensitive to a range of misfocus or misfocus-related aberrations. The PSF and OTF are not, however, the same as that obtained with a good quality in-focus imaging system. The process of making the imaging system insensitive to misfocus aberrations produces images with a specialized, well defined blur; this blur is removed with the wavefront coding digital signal processing.","The PSFs from a conventional imaging system, for example, change drastically with misfocus, while the PSFs from the wavefront coding imaging system show almost no noticeable change with misfocus. Digital processing to remove the misfocus blur applied to a misfocused traditional imaging system uses processing dependent on the amount of misfocus present in different areas of the image. In many situations the amount of misfocus is unknown and difficult to calculate. In addition, the MTF of the misfocused traditional imaging system can often contain zeros or nulls that further increase the difficulty of the digital processing. In contrast, the constant nature of PSFs with misfocus from the wavefront coding system is what is needed to eliminate the dependencies of digital processing on misfocus. Digital processing applied to the charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)\u2014detected image is independent of misfocus and the actual scene being imaged. In addition, the MTF of wavefront coding imaging systems, both in and out of focus, contain no zeros or nulls allowing high quality final images.","Wavefront coding for extending the depth of field can add value to imaging applications where traditional methodologies (i.e. stopping down the aperture) are generally unacceptable. Constraints on illumination levels, exposure times, or spatial resolution often limit the application of previous optical methods. By using wavefront coding, applications can enjoy fewer misfocus-related problems, without sacrificing exposure times or requiring vast quantities of illumination Wavefront coding imaging systems comprise non-conventional optical designs and digital signal processing of the resulting images, as described above. The signal processing used is dependent on the specific optical system. The wavefront coding optics are dependent on the type and amount of signal processing to be used. Since the optics and signal processing are closely coupled, it is natural to expect best performance from systems where the optical and digital components of the system are jointly optimized during design. The optical components are configured to minimize the changes or sensitivity of the optics to misfocus effects as well enable efficient signal processing. The digital components are designed to minimize algorithm complexity, processing time, and effects of digital processing on image noise.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0142","num":"0146"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1202","1202","1204","1204","1206","1208"]},"The base routine for wavefront coding of an embodiment can include a ray-trace program that traces rays through typical spherical and aspherical surfaces as well as general wavefront coding surface forms.

The output of this design includes but is not limited to the following: traditional optical surfaces, materials, thickness, and spacings; parameters of wavefront coding surfaces; and, digital filter coefficients.","The general optical\/digital design loop is now described with reference to . A ray-trace program  traces rays through optical surfaces to calculate exit pupil optical path differences (OPDs)  and optimize a given set of optical and digital merit functions or operands. Inputs to the ray-trace program  include optical surfaces, thickness, and operating conditions (wavelengths, field of view, temperature range, sample object images, etc.) to name a few. The OTFs are calculated or generated , and pixel OTFs related to detector geometry are added . Sampled OTFs and PSFs are calculated . Digital filter coefficients are generated  for a selected processing algorithm based on the sampled PSFs. The processing continues by forming figures of merit (e.g., wavefront coding operands) for the filter that are based on minimizing: changes of the sampled PSF and MTF through focus, with field angle, with color, due to temperature changes, due to aliasing, etc.; digital processing parameters such as amount of processing, form of the processing, processing related image noise, digital filter noise gain etc. The wavefront coding operands are combined with traditional optical operands (Seidel Wavefront aberrations, RMS Wavefront errors, etc.) through optimization routines to modify the optical surfaces. Operations return to generate  exit pupil optical path differences (OPDs) via traditional ray tracing.","Theoretically calculated wavefront coding surface forms are used as starting points for the optical optimization. One general family of rectangularly separable surface forms is given in normalized coordinates as:\n\n()=|\u03b2|sign()|x|\n\nwhere sign(x)=+1 for x>0,\n\nand sign(x)=\u22121 for x\u22660.\n","The exponential parameter a controls the height of the MTF over a range of misfocus, and the parameter \u03b2 controls the sensitivity to misfocus. In general, increasing the parameter \u03b2 decreases the sensitivity to misfocus while decreasing the height of the MTF and increasing the length of the resulting PSF.","The filtering process used to reconstruct the intermediate images and produce final images can impose a computational burden. The size of the filter kernel required for image reconstruction may be as large as 70\u00d770 coefficients, depending on the optical system and the enhancement to depth-of-field introduced by the coding process. Generally, the larger the depth of field extension, the larger the filter kernel, and the larger the noise penalty or noise gain. Furthermore, because every pixel in an image is blurred by wavefront coding, every pixel needs to be filtered; thus, larger images can require more computation than smaller images. With image sizes approaching tens of millions of pixels, efficient computational solutions are used for practical and economical systems. Computational implementations, such as rectangularly separable filter approximations, can help reduce kernel dimensions. The wavefront coding element used, for example, can have a rectangularly separable cubic phase form described as\n\n()=\u03b1().\n","Filtering a blurred image to remove the blur essentially imposes an amplification and phase shift as a function of spatial frequency. This amplification increases the signal as well as the noise in the final images. For very large depth-of-field enhancements, for instance, over 10 times, the noise gain in a wavefront-coded system can be a factor of four or five. For more moderate depth-of-field enhancements of two to four, the noise gain is typically a factor of two or less.","For uncorrelated Gaussian noise (a good assumption for most images) the noise gain is the RMS value of the filter coefficients. For systems with depth-of-field extensions too large to produce a suitably small noise-gain value, reducing the resolution or spatial bandwidth of the digital filter can reduce the noise gain. Reducing the contrast in the final image also can reduce the overall effects of the increased noise. Specialized nonlinear filtering is the best solution for removing noise in wavefront-coded images.","Because the wavefront coding optical element used to form the MTFs and PSFs in an embodiment is rectangularly separable, the signal processing used may also be rectangularly separable. Rectangularly separable processing can reduce the required number of computations by an order of magnitude or more. Due to the fact that the digital filtering is performed with spatial convolution, the computational methods of an embodiment comprise a series of multiplications to scale the data by the filter coefficients and summations to add all the scaled data values together across the entire kernel. The fundamental unit of such a computation is a multiply-accumulate operation. A typical 2-D wavefront coding filter kernel for a large depth-of-field increase might be 30\u00d730 coefficients. A rectangularly separable version of this filter would contain a row filter that is 30 coefficients long and a column filter that is 30 coefficients tall, or 60 total coefficients. While wavefront coding elements can be rectangulalry separable in design, they are not so limited, and highly aberrated systems may use nonseparable filtering.","By combining optical imaging techniques with electronic filtering, wavefront coding technology can improve performance for a wide range of imaging systems. The performance gains in high-performance imaging systems can include very large depth-of-field without sacrificing light gathering or spatial resolution. The performance gains in lower-cost imaging systems can include good image quality with fewer physical components than traditionally required.","The embodiments described herein include a system
