title: Automatic re-initialization of resonant sensors in rocket and missile guidance systems
abstract: An apparatus and method improves the fault tolerance of a rocket or missile guidance system which includes a resonant sensor. When improper initialization is detected, the resonant sensor is reinitialized, repeatedly if necessary, until normal operation is achieved. Improper initialization is detected by comparing data from the guidance system with pre-specified physical limits to roll, pitch, yaw, and/or other features of the flight scenario. Embodiments can also detect a fault condition due to an error signal from a “Built-in-Test” (BIT) module. The initialization sequence initiated by the invention can be identical to the power-on sequence, or it can be a separate, reinitiating sequence. Subsequent resets are initiated as needed, for example until the burn of the rocket fuel and the associated vibrations have ceased and the resonant sensor has been successfully initialized.

Each of these applications is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.","The invention was made with United States Government support under Contract No. W31P4Q-06-C-0330 awarded by the Navy. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","The invention relates to rocket and missile guidance systems, and more particularly to apparatus and methods that improve the fault tolerance of a guidance system which includes at least one resonant sensor.","Resonant sensors are devices which use mechanical vibrations, typically induced at a specific resonant frequency, to detect any of a variety of conditions. Typical implementations include \u201ctuning fork\u201d resonators, piezo-electric resonators, hemispherical resonators, and tilting wheel resonators. In many cases, resonant sensors (such as Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems [MEMS] sensors) can be compact, low in cost, and highly accurate. Because of the inherent sensitivity of most vibrating systems to physical manipulations, resonant sensors can be used to detect accelerations and rotations, and are often used in accelerometers and in devices which detect rotations (referred to sometimes as \u201cgyroscopes,\u201d although not based on the classic \u201cspinning top\u201d gyroscope approach).","Resonant sensor accelerometers, gyroscopes, and other resonant sensors that are critical to flight guidance algorithms, are frequently used in guided rockets and missiles, which typically have severe vibration environments. Under some circumstances, including the burn of the rocket motor fuel, the body vibrations may induce a resonant frequency at, or close to, the resonant frequency of the sensor, which can interfere with the initialization of the device and can cause the device to provide highly inaccurate data.","In many cases, for example for many air-to-surface missiles, the rocket motor burn lasts for only a short period of time after the initial launch of the rocket, such as a few seconds, after which the rocket glides to its target with relatively low vibrations. However, if the guidance system has been improperly initialized due to vibrations during the initial fuel burn, then the guidance system may provide highly erroneous data, both during and after the burn, and the missile may accept the data from the guidance system as if it were accurate, thereby causing the missile to rapidly deviate from its intended course.","Typically, this problem is addressed by providing shock isolators, which attempt to isolate the resonant sensors from shocks and vibrations experienced by the rocket or missile. However, this approach can be inadequate and\/or impractical.","Some guidance systems include a \u201cBuilt-in-Test\u201d (BIT) fault detector. However, these fault detectors can also be fooled by vibrations of the rocket or missile, and can fail to detect if a resonant sensor has been improperly initialized.","What is needed, therefore, is a system for reliably detecting when a rocket or missile guidance system which includes at least one resonant sensor has been improperly initialized, and providing appropriate corrective action, so as to improve the fault tolerance of the guidance system.","The present invention is an apparatus and method for improving the fault tolerance of a rocket or missile guidance system which includes at least one resonant sensor. The invention determines if the guidance system has been properly initialized, and causes, the guidance system to reset and reinitialize itself if it has not been properly initialized. This is repeated, if necessary, until proper initialization and operation of the resonant sensor is achieved. Abnormal operation of the resonant sensor is detected by comparing guidance data provided by the guidance system with specified physical limits which are applicable to the rocket or missile, and determining that the guidance system has not been properly initialized if it reports \u201cunphysical\u201d guidance data which falls outside of the specified physical limits. For example, if the guidance data indicates a rate of rotation, pitch, or yaw which is not physically attainable by the rocket or missile, or at least is highly improbable, then the invention will determine that the guidance system is not functioning properly.","In some embodiments, a fault condition can also be detected by evaluating data from an already existing \u201cBuilt-in-Test\u201d (BIT) fault detector. However, even if the BIT fault detector fails to report a fault, the present invention will still determine that the guidance system is not operating properly if the guidance data provided by the guidance system is deemed to be unphysical.","Once a fault condition is detected, an initialization sequence of the resonant sensor is initiated. The invention continues to monitor and evaluate the guidance data, and subsequent resets are initiated as needed, until successful reinitialization of the resonant sensor is achieved, for example after the burn of the rocket motor fuel and the associated vibrations have ended. In various embodiments, monitoring of the guidance data provided by the guidance system continues even after successful initialization is achieved, and further resets are initiated if non-physical data is once again detected, for example due to vibrations caused by a nearby burst of an anti-aircraft shell.","One general aspect of the present invention is an apparatus for improving a fault tolerance of a rocket or missile guidance system which includes at least one resonant sensor. The apparatus includes a fault detection module which is configured to receive guidance data originating from the resonant sensor, compare the guidance data with specified physical performance limits of the rocket or missile, determine if the guidance data exceeds the physical performance limits, and transmit a fault detection signal if the guidance data exceeds the physical performance limits. The apparatus further includes a reset module configured to receive the fault detection signal from the fault detection module, the reset module being configured to initiate a reinitializing sequence which will reinitialize the resonant sensor when the fault detection signal is received from the fault detection module.","In embodiments, the apparatus further includes a Built-In Test (BIT) module cooperative with the resonant sensor and configured to detect at least one failure modality of the resonant sensor, the BIT module being configured to transmit a BIT error signal if it detects at least one failure modality, the fault detection module being configured to receive the BIT error signal and to transmit the fault detection signal when it receives the BIT error signal.","In some embodiments, the reinitializing sequence is substantially identical to a power-up initializing sequence which initializes the resonant sensor upon activation of the rocket or missile.","Various embodiments further include a data output module cooperative with the resonant sensor and configured to receive the fault detection signal from the fault detection module, the data output module being configured to prevent the rocket or missile from acting upon the guidance data when the fault detection signal is received from the fault detection module.","In certain embodiments, the specified physical performance limits include at least one limit pertaining to roll of the rocket or missile. In some embodiments the specified physical performance limits include at least one limit relating to pitch of the rocket or missile. And in other embodiments the specified physical performance limits include at least one limit relating to yaw of the rocket or missile.","Another general aspect of the present invention is a method for improving a fault tolerance of a rocket or missile guidance system, the rocket or missile guidance system including at least one resonant sensor. The method includes receiving guidance data from the guidance system, comparing the guidance data with specified physical performance limits of the rocket or missile, determining if the guidance data exceeds the physical performance limits, and, if the guidance data exceeds the physical performance limits, initiating a reinitializing sequence which will reinitialize the resonant sensor.","In some embodiments, the method further includes determining if a Built-In Test (BIT) module cooperative with the resonant sensor has detected improper operation of the resonant sensor, and initiating the reinitializing sequence if the BIT has detected improper operation of the resonant sensor.","In certain embodiments the reinitializing sequence is substantially identical to a power-up initializing sequence which initializes the resonant sensor upon activation of the rocket or missile. Some embodiments further include preventing the rocket or missile from acting upon the guidance data when the fault detection signal is received from the fault detection module.","In various embodiments the specified physical performance limits include at least one limit pertaining to roll of the rocket or missile. In some embodiments, the specified physical performance limits include at least one limit pertaining to pitch of the rocket or missile. And in other embodiments the specified physical performance limits include at least one limit pertaining to yaw of the rocket or missile.","The features and advantages described herein are not all-inclusive and, in particular, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and not to limit the scope of the inventive subject matter.","The present invention is an apparatus and method for improving the fault tolerance of a rocket or missile guidance system which includes at least one resonant sensor.  illustrates an embodiment  of the apparatus of the present invention, which includes a fault detection module  and a reset module .","In the embodiment of , both the guidance data provided by the resonant sensor  and the output of a Built-in Test Module  are provided to the Fault Detection Module . Accordingly, in this embodiment the Fault Detection Module  can detect a fault condition in either of two ways, by evaluating the guidance data received from the resonant sensor  and recognizing that the guidance data is unphysical and inconsistent with the flight scenario, or by evaluating the \u201cBuilt-in-Test\u201d (BIT) results from the built-in fault detector . Typically, the BIT is configured to detect at least one failure modality of the resonant sensor, but the BIT may fail to report improper operation of the resonant sensor under some conditions.","In various embodiments, the Fault Detection Module  determines that there is a fault condition if the resonant sensor  reports unphysical guidance data, even if the BIT  does not report a fault. In other embodiments, the Fault Detection Module  determines that there is a fault condition if the BIT  reports a fault, even if the guidance data from the resonant sensor  appears to be physically reasonable. In various embodiments, a BIT  is not included, and the Fault Detection Module  depends entirely on the detection of unphysical guidance data from the resonant sensor .","In the embodiment of , once a fault condition is detected, the Fault Detection Module  triggers a Reset Module , which in turn activates the Initialization and Control Module  and thereby begins an initialization sequence of the resonant sensor . In some embodiments, the initialization sequence started by the Reset Module  is identical to the initialization sequence started by the Power-on Reset module  when the device is first started. In other embodiments, the Reset Module  starts a special initialization sequence that is optimized for resetting the Resonant Sensor  after a fault condition has been detected. Note that the embodiment of  also includes mechanical shock isolation , which reduces the influence of vibrations and shocks on the resonant sensor , but may not be able to ensure correct initialization and functioning of the resonant sensor  under all conditions.","If a fault condition is not detected by the Fault Detection Module , then the guidance data from the resonant sensor  is passed through a Data Processing and Output module  and used to control the flight path of the rocket or missile. However, if a fault condition is detected, then a fault signal is transmitted to the Data Processing and Output module , either directly by the Fault Detection Module  or, as shown in , routed through the BIT . This causes the Data Processing and Output module  to block the guidance data supplied by the resonant sensor , so that the flight path of the rocket or missile is not influenced by invalid guidance data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","106","202","108","102","204","206","106","102","208","204"]},"If a fault condition is detected , an initialization sequence is started , and the method returns to monitoring the guidance data output from the resonant sensor . If additional fault conditions are detected, subsequent resets  are initiated as needed, for example until the burn of the rocket motor fuel is completed and the associated vibrations have diminished. This process continues until the resonant sensor is successfully re-initialized and normal operation of the resonant sensor is achieved. In the embodiment of , the process continues even after the resonant sensor has been successfully re-initialized and the rocket burn has ended, so as to detect improper operation of the resonant sensor caused by other vibrations sources, such as severe air turbulence or an explosion of a nearby anti-aircraft shell, and reset the guidance system if needed."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
