title: Stackable tray having prestressed sections
abstract: A tray having prestress sections including a domed shaped bottom and a merchandising window. The window includes a surface parallel to the dome shaped bottom. When the tray is subjected to a load, the dome and the surface of the merchandising window become substantially planar. The front of the tray also includes vertically extending corners that are angled inwardly toward one another from an outer top end to an inner lower end when the tray is empty. When the tray is loaded, the corners deflect toward a vertically extending parallel relationship with respect to one another. The corners adjacent the rear of the tray are fixed relative to one another.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of the provisional patent application 60\/377,725 for a STACKABLE TRAY HAVING PRESTRESSED SECTIONS, filed on May 3, 2002, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The invention relates to multi-purpose reusable load-bearing trays and, more specifically, to trays adapted to be stackable in three positions.","Plastic trays that are stackable and\/or nestable can be desirable to maintain cargo such as material and\/or products. However, existing trays are not as efficient as desired. Specifically, existing trays can deform under loading in an undesirable manner such that the tray appears to sag.","The present invention provides a tray including one side defining an opening such as a merchandising window. The tray can also include a domed bottom. The side of the tray defining the merchandising window can include a portion extending substantially parallel to the domed bottom. The structure of the portion and the domed bottom provide a prestressed section such that the arcuate domed bottom and the arcuate portion of the one side are flattened, or straightened when material and\/or goods are loaded with respect to the tray and the tray does not sag.","The present invention also provides recessed corners on opposite sides of the merchandising window. Specifically, the walls of the tray on opposite sides of the merchandising window can be angled inwardly with respect to the opposite corners. When material and\/or goods are received by the tray, the tray can be deflected such that the corners deflect with respect to the bottom of the tray and align to be generally perpendicular with the respective opposing corners.","The present invention provides a tray having a front, first side, a second side, a rear and a bottom. The front includes an opening positioned between first and second ends of the front. The bottom is shaped, at least partially, as a dome. When the tray is subjected to a load, the dome portion of the bottom is flattened.","The opening of the front can include a surface that extends parallel to the dome portion of the bottom. When the tray is empty, the surface can extend along an arched path corresponding to the profile of the dome. When the tray is subjected to a predetermined load, the surface of the opening can flatten out and define a plane. The rear can also include an opening. The opening of the rear can include a surface that is flat or planar when the tray is empty and when the tray is loaded.","The front is integrally formed with the first side at a first end of the front and is integrally formed with the second side at a second end. A first vertically extending corner can be defined between the first side and the front, and a second vertically extending corner can be defined between the second side and the front. The first and second corners can be initially angled outwardly toward one another from an outer top end to a lower inner end when the tray is empty. A third vertically extending corner can be defined between the rear and the first side, and a fourth vertically extending corner can be defined between the rear and the second side. A horizontal distance between the upper and lower ends of the third and fourth vertically extending corners can be the same when the tray is empty and when the tray is loaded.","The first and second sides can twist when the tray is subjected to a predetermined load. For example, top portions of the first and second corners can deflect with respect to the bottom of the tray when the tray is subjected to a load, moving closer to one another. On the other hand, the third and fourth corners are fixed rigidly with respect to the bottom to minimize any deflection under loads.","The dome defined by the bottom can be centered with respect to the tray bottom or can be positioned closer to the front. For example, the front can include a bottom portion that defines an arched surface when the tray is empty and a substantially planar surface when the tray is loaded. A bottom portion of the rear can define a substantially planar surface when the tray is empty and when the tray is loaded.","Other applications of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art when the following description of the best mode contemplated for practicing the invention is read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","The present invention is shown throughout the Figures. Some of the Figures include more than one tray according to the present invention, and in those Figures, different trays are designated with a common base numeral and differentiated with an alphabetic designation.","Referring now to , the present invention provides a multi-purpose tray . The tray  can include a front , a rear , a first side , a second side , and a bottom . Each of these portions , , ,  and  of the tray  can be integrally formed with respect to one another. The bottom  can extend in a transverse direction between the first side  and the second side  and in a longitudinal direction between the front  and the rear . The tray  can be fabricated from plastic in an injection molding process.","The front  can include an opening  defined by surfaces , , , , , , and . The surfaces , , ,  and  can define a merchandising window. The rear  can include an opening  defined by surfaces  and . The opening  can be larger than the opening  to enhance the removal of material and\/or products from the tray  from the front  and\/or to enhance inspection of the material and\/or products.","The front  and rear  can include walls  and , respectively, to enhance the structural integrity and\/or rigidity of the tray . The wall  can include a rib  to enhance the structural rigidity of the front . Specifically, the wall  can be shorter than the wall , because of the merchandising window, and can be reinforced by the rib .","The rear  can also include one or more pins . When two trays are stacked at an angle of 180\u00b0 relative to one another, the pins  can engage apertures  defined by the bottom . In , the apertures  are representative and may not indicate the precise aperture engaged by either of the pins . When the pin  is engaged with an aperture  of the bottom , movement of an upper tray relative to a lower tray is limited.  shows two trays and stacked at an angle of 180\u00b0 relative to one another.","The first side  can be a mirror image of the second side  about an axis , best seen in . Both the first side  and the second side  can include a discontinuous runner  adjacent a top of the first side  and second side , respectively, for enhancing sliding engagement of two trays relative to one another. The runner  can include a front portion , a middle portion , and a rear portion . Each portion , ,  is substantially longitudinally aligned with respect to one another. A first notch  can be disposed between the front portion  and the middle portion . A second notch  can be disposed between the middle portion  and the rear portion .","Each of the first side  and the second side  can also include a channel  defined in part by walls  and . The channel  can be disposed adjacent the bottom . Foot members  and  can be individually disposed at each end of the channel . One or more ribs  can be disposed along the length of the channel .","When two trays  are stacked at an angle of 0\u00b0 relative to one another, middle portion  of the bottom tray is positioned in the channel  of the top tray between the foot members  and . Also, foot members  and  of the top tray can be positioned in the first notch  and second notch , respectively, of the bottom tray. As best seen in ,  and , a surface  of a member  can be disposed adjacent an inwardly facing surface  of the front . A surface  of a member  can be disposed adjacent an inwardly facing surface  of the rear .","Two trays  can be stacked at an angle of 180\u00b0 relative to one another. When two trays  are stacked at an angle 180\u00b0 relative to one another, a middle portion of the bottom tray can be positioned in the channel  of the top tray between foot members  and . The middle portion  of the bottom tray can be positioned in the channel of the top tray between the foot member and Foot members and of the top tray are positioned in the second notch  and first notch , respectively, of the bottom tray. A surface of a member can be disposed adjacent the inwardly facing surface  of the rear . A surface of member can be disposed adjacent the inwardly facing surface  of the front .","Two trays  can be stacked at an angle of 90\u00b0 relative to one another. When two trays  are stacked at an angle 90\u00b0 relative to one another, walls  and  can be supported with the surface  as well as one of the surfaces , . Two trays  stacked at an angle of 90\u00b0 relative to one another define a height that is less than a height defined by two trays stacked at an angle of 180\u00b0 relative to one another, or a height defined by two trays  stacked at an angle of 0\u00b0 relative to one another. The highest stacking height is achieved when two trays are stacked at either one of an angle of 0\u00b0 with respect to one another or an angle of 180\u00b0 with respect to one another. The lowest stacking height is achieved when the trays are stacked at an angle of 90\u00b0 with respect to one another.","The present invention provides a tray having prestressed sections to enhance stacking of the trays and the structural integrity of individual trays. Specifically, the present invention provides a dome, or arched bottom, and inwardly angled front corners, best seen in , , and . The domed bottom and angled corners can reduce the likelihood that a tray will sag when material and\/or product is loaded with respect to the tray.","Referring now to , a cross-sectional view of a tray  having a domed bottom is shown. The cross-sectional view is taken generally from the longitudinal axis  of the tray . The domed bottom  includes an outwardly facing surface  and an inwardly facing surface . The bottom  can include an arcuate profile in two substantially perpendicular directions, along the longitudinal axis  of the tray and along a transverse axis of the tray. Preferably, the dome is three-eighths (\u215c) of one inch at the center of the bottom  in height. In other words, the center of the dome extends towards the interior of the tray  three-eighths (\u215c) of one inch relative to the intersection of the bottom  with the first side , the second side , the front , or the rear . Where the bottom is partially domed, arched, or partially arched, the center of the dome can extend towards the interior of the tray  three-eighths (\u215c) of one inch relative to the intersection of any of the bottom  with the first side , the second side , the front , or the rear . However, the height of the dome can be increased or decreased as desired. The height of the dome can be varied based on the weight of the material and\/or products to be maintained in the tray .","Referring now to , a portion of the front follows the profile of the partially-domed bottom The portion can be centered with respect to the front between the first side and the second side and, more particularly, between the surfaces and to define a merchandising window. The bottom surface of the front along the portion can be substantially parallel to the portion of the outwardly facing surface of the bottom adjacent the front The bottom can engage the rear of the tray such that a bottom surface  of the rear does not extend substantially parallel to the portion of the outwardly facing surface of the bottom adjacent the rear The top surface of the portion can extend substantially parallel to the bottom surface Preferably, the highest portion of the surface can be one-half (\u00bd) of one inch higher than the center of the domed bottom  is a schematic view of the tray  in an unloaded or static condition. When the tray  receives material and\/or goods to be maintained by the tray , the load  associated with the material and\/or goods can deflect the tray  such that the surfaces  and , as well as the bottom , can be substantially horizontal, best seen in .","The present invention also provides outwardly angled front corners disposed between the front  and the first side , and the front  and second side , shown best in . As shown in , a lower portion of the corner defined between the front (not shown) and the second side  can be angled inwardly toward a lower portion with respect to the tray  as the second side  extends from the rear  to the front (cut away). When material and\/or products are received by the tray , represented by load arrow , the tray  can deflect such that the second side  adjacent the front is substantially horizontally aligned with the second side  adjacent the rear . Preferably, the horizontal transverse distance between the top portion of the second side  adjacent the rear  and the top portion of the second side  adjacent the front is one-half (\u00bd) inch. However, the distance d can be modified and be determined based on the material and\/or product to be loaded with respect to the tray and the material of the tray. The walls and can be spaced apart to receive the runner when the tray  is loaded or unloaded.","The tray  can include a front  having a first end , a second end  and first opening  disposed between the first and second ends , . The opening  can be substantially centered between the first and second ends , . The first opening  can be larger than the second opening . The first side  can extend from the first end  of the front , and a first corner  can be defined between the first side  and the front . The second side  can extend from the second end  of the front , and a second corner  can be defined between the second side  and the front . The rear  can include a first end  engageable with the first side  and a second end  engageable with the second side . The second opening  can be disposed between the first end  of the rear  and the second end  of the rear . The bottom  is operably associated with and extending between the front , rear , first side  and second side . The bottom  at least partially defines a dome  when the tray  is empty. The dome  is best shown in .","Referring now to , the opening can include a surface extending substantially parallel to at least a portion of the dome defined by the bottom The surface partially defines the opening When the tray is empty, the surface extends along an arcuate path. When the tray is loaded, the surface can become a substantially planar surface, flattening to be parallel with the dome which also flattens when the tray is subjected to a predetermined load, such as load  shown in . A surface of the second opening defined by the rear, can be a planar surface when the tray is supporting a predetermined load and when the tray is empty. A bottom portion of the front defines an arcuate surface when the tray is empty and a bottom portion  of the rear defines a substantially planar surface  when the tray is empty.","In operation, when the tray  is subjected to a load, the lower ends of the first and second corners ,  move away from one another, deflecting in response to the bottom  flattening into a more planar orientation. The channels  and are sized to receive the first portions , whether the tray  is loaded or empty. For example, when a bottom tray  is loaded, the front portions , will be closer to one another than when the tray  is empty. The channels , are sized to receive the front portions , in both positions.","Third and fourth corners ,  can be defined between the rear  and the first side  and the rear  and the second side , respectively. The third and fourth corners are spaced a predetermined distance apart from one another when the tray is loaded or empty. For example, the lower portions of the corners  and  move away from one another when the tray is loaded, however the third and fourth corners ,  can be immovably associated with respect to one another.","When the tray  is loaded, at least a portion of one of the first and second sides ,  can be twisted with respect to the bottom . For example, a top portion of the corner  can twist inwardly relative to the bottom  when the tray  is loaded, as best shown in . A corresponding portion of the second side  adjacent the rear  can be fixed with respect to the bottom . As a result, an end of the second side  adjacent the front  can deflect and an end of the second side  adjacent the rear  can remain fixed and thus the second side  can twist when the tray  is subjected to a predetermined load . In addition, since the end of the second side  adjacent the rear  does not deflect and the end of the second side  adjacent the front  does deflect, the degree of deflection at any point along the length of the second side  increases along the length of the second side  from the rear  to the front .","While the invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiments but, on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims, which scope is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures as is permitted under the law."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The description herein makes reference to the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the several views, and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
