Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to computer software, and more particularly to insurance claim processing software.","2. Description of the Related Art","Insurance companies have been processing and settling claims associated with bodily injury for a long time. The task of evaluating, analyzing or estimating the amount of damage associated with one or more types of bodily injuries, especially trauma-induced bodily injuries, can be very complex. Complexity in the evaluation process often arises out of the fact that concurrent expertise in legal, medical and insurance fields is often required to arrive at a particular decision involving a bodily injury claim.","Several factors can affect the estimated amount of the claim associated with a bodily injury. Every accident is different and every injury is unique. Arriving at a customized evaluation of a bodily injury claim, which is unique for a specific accident, injury, etc. is desirable. Applying across-the-board standards may tend to result in an inequitable solution for one or more parties involved. External environmental factors, such as the experience level of a claims adjuster, record of accomplishment of the legal professionals, post-injury quality of life for the injured party, etc., all can affect the valuation of a claim.","During the past several years, many insurance companies have been using computer-based and knowledge-based claim-processing systems to process, evaluate, analyze and estimate thousands of claims in a fair and consistent manner. A knowledge-based claim-processing system includes an expert system which utilizes and builds a knowledge base to assist the user in decision making. It may allow the insurance companies to define new rules and\/or use previously defined rules, in real-time. The business rules are generally written by industry experts to evaluate legal, medical, insurance conditions before arriving at a valuation of a claim.","In knowledge-based systems, to estimate a claim for bodily injury, the user may enter inputs on a display screen and step through a series of displays or screens to complete the data input process. This process may be referred to as a consultation session. The knowledge-based claim processing system may then utilize the user-provided inputs to generate a consultation report. The consultation report may include, for example, an estimate of a value of an insurance claim.","In the past, such knowledge-based systems for estimating the value of an insurance claim have been limited to traditional computing architectures such as mainframes and stand-alone personal computers. Therefore, it was necessary to install and maintain client software as well as server software for these knowledge-based systems in particular physical locations. With the growth of the Internet, however, many personal computers may now be granted client access to servers distributed all over the world.","It may therefore be desirable to develop a knowledge-based system for insurance claim processing which is configured to be accessed over the Internet. It may also be desirable to develop a knowledge-based system for insurance claim processing which is configured to be accessed through a web browser. It may be desirable to develop new business models for providing insurance companies with access to a web-based or internet-based insurance claim processing server.","The present invention provides various embodiments of an Internet-enabled method and system for processing insurance claims. The system may include an insurance claim processing server which may include a first CPU and a first memory coupled to the first CPU. The first memory may stores a first set of program instructions which are executable by the first CPU to estimate a value of an insurance claim as a function of insurance claim assessment data entered by a user during an insurance claim consultation session. The insurance claim may include a bodily injury claim, and the estimate of the value of the insurance claim may include an estimate of bodily injury general damages. The insurance claim assessment data may include one or more bodily injuries and one or more treatments of the bodily injuries. The first set of program instructions may include a rules engine and a web server. The first set of program instructions may be further executable by the first CPU to generate and send to a client computer system a plurality of web pages comprising insurance claim assessment questions.","The system may also include a client computer system which may include a second CPU and a second memory coupled to the second CPU. The client computer system may be coupled to the insurance claim processing server through a network. The network may include the Internet, and the insurance claim processing server and the client computer system may therefore be operable to communicate over the network via TCP\/IP. The second memory may store a second set of program instructions which are executable by the second CPU to receive the insurance claim assessment data entered by the user and send the insurance claim assessment data across the network to the insurance claim processing server. The second set of program instructions may include a web browser. The second set of program instructions may be further executable by the second CPU to display the web pages comprising the insurance claim assessment questions during the insurance claim consultation session.","In one embodiment, the system may include additional client computer systems such as a second client computer system including a third CPU and a third memory. The second client computer system may be coupled to the insurance claim processing server through the network. The third memory may store a third set of program instructions, such as a second web browser, which are executable by the third CPU to receive a second set of insurance claim assessment data entered by a second user. The third set of program instructions may be further executable to send the second set of insurance claim assessment data across the network to the insurance claim processing server. The first set of program instructions may be further executable to estimate a value of a second insurance claim as a function of the second set of insurance claim assessment data entered by the second user during a second insurance claim consultation session.","While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"h-0005","num":"0000"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["70","80","55","90","55","70","80"]},"The network  may be a local area network or wide area network, and may include communications links including, but not limited to: Ethernet, token ring, Internet, satellite, wireless, telephone, cable, DSL, and other suitable pathways.
