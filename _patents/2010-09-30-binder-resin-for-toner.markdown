In view of the above, as a resin binder for use in a toner, numerous studies on polyesters testing for excellent low-temperature fixing ability are made.","On the other hand, studies on those using lignin compounds using raw materials from a plant source are also made.","Patent Publication 1 discloses, as an objective of inexpensively obtaining a natural color brown and at the same time having environmental resistance and background fogging, a color toner characterized in that a compound having a phenylpropane backbone is blended.","Patent Publication 2 discloses, as an objective of having sufficient offset resistance and low-temperature fixing ability upon fusing, and also being free from generating winding around a fixing roller, a toner for electrostatic image development, characterized in that the toner contains, as a binder component, a resin obtained by subjecting lignin and cellulose to an esterification treatment or etherification treatment.","Patent Publication 3 discloses, as an objective of providing a toner for electrophotography having a very low environmental burden during production and upon discarding, without lowering image quality, characterized in that the toner contains a resin binder comprising a biodegradable polymer, a releasing agent comprising a plant-based natural wax, a colorant comprising a food pigment, and a charge control agent comprising a natural mineral.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["Patent Publication 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei-3-83069","Patent Publication 2: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei-5-216271","Patent Publication 3: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2008-129188"]}},"However, in the toners meeting the demands of speeding-up of the machines, further improvements in durability as well as in low-temperature fixing ability and storage property are earnestly desired.","The present invention relates to a resin binder for a toner capable of improving durability of the toner, while maintaining its low-temperature fixing ability and storage property, and a method for producing the resin binder, and a toner for electrophotography containing the resin binder.","The present invention relates to:","[1] a resin binder for a toner obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component and an alcohol component in the presence of a lignin compound;","[2] a toner for electrophotography, containing the resin binder as defined in the above [1]; and","[3] a method for producing a resin binder for a toner, including the step of polycondensing a carboxylic acid component and an alcohol component in the presence of a lignin compound.","The toner for electrophotography of the present invention which contains a resin binder for a toner exhibits some excellent effects in durability as well as in its low-temperature fixing ability and storage property.","The resin binder for a toner of the present invention is obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component and an alcohol component in the presence of a lignin compound, whereby durability of the toner can be improved while maintaining its low-temperature fixing ability and storage property. This is presumably due to the fact that the lignin compound, as mentioned below, is a polymeric compound having a three-dimensional network structure, the polymeric compound having a functional group such as a hydroxyl group or a carboxy group, and the lignin compound can be partly polycondensed with the carboxylic acid component or the alcohol component, so that the polyester resin has an increased molecular weight with the compound, thereby improving durability of the toner. In addition, according to the method of the present invention, it is deduced that the lignin compound is more likely to be finely dispersed in the polyester produced by polycondensing the alcohol component and the carboxylic acid component, thereby consequently improving hardness of the toner, and improving durability of the toner.","The lignin is one of three components constituting wood such as a plant or lumber, i.e. lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose, which are collectively referred to as lignocellulose, and the lignin is a polymeric compound obtained by polycondensing constituting units having a hydroxyphenylpropane having a methoxy group, represented by the formula (I) or (II):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0016"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"46.91mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08883949-20141111-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein an element or substituent bound to the carbon atom is, independently \u2014H, \u2014OH, \u2014SOH or \u2550O or the like, and wherein \u2014C\u2014C\u2014 and\/or \u2014C\u2014C may be an unsaturated bond,","as basic backbones.","The lignin compound used in the present invention refers to a compound obtained from a lignocellulosic compound as a raw material, the compound being in the form of a residue after removing cellulose from the lignocellulosic compound.

While sequentially raising the temperature of a fixing roller from 100\u00b0 to 240\u00b0 C. in an increment of 10\u00b0 C., the unfixed images were subjected to a fixing test at each temperature with a fixing device (fixing speed: 390 mm\/sec) adjusted so that a total fixing pressure was 40 kgf. \u201cUNICEF Cellophane\u201d tape (MITSUBISHI PENCIL CO., LTD., width: 18 mm, JIS Z-1522) was adhered to the fixed images, and the resulting fixed images were allowed to pass through a fixing roller set at 30\u00b0 C., and the tape was then removed. The optical reflective densities of the image before adhesion of the tape and after removal of the tape were measured with a reflective densitometer \u201cRD-915\u201d (manufactured by Macbeth Process Measurements Co.). The temperature of a fixing roller at which the ratio of the optical reflective densities (after removal of the tape\/before adhesion of the tape) initially exceeds 90% is defined as the lowest fixing temperature.

During the course of printing, black solid images were printed for every 500 sheets, and the presence or absence of the lines on the formed images was confirmed. At the point where the generation of the lines was confirmed, printing was stopped. The test was conducted up to 5,000 sheets at the maximum. Durability was evaluated by defining the number of printed sheets at the point where the generation of lines was visually confirmed on the images as the number of sheets at which lines were generated by fusion or fixing of toner on a developer roller, in accordance with the following evaluation criteria. In other words, it can be judged that the larger the number of sheets without generation of lines, the higher the durability of toner.
