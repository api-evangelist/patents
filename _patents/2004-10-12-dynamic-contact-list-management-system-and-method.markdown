title: Dynamic contact list management system and method
abstract: A dynamic contact list management (DCLM) method and system operable in a communications network environment. In one embodiment, upon receiving a communication request from an originating party over a first network towards a networked party, a query is generated for determining and locating an IM address associated with the originating party. Upon establishing presence awareness between the originating party and the networked party, the IM address of the originating party is added to a contact list database associated with the networked party. The IM address, which is persistent at least for the duration of a first communication session established responsive to the communication request, may be used for engaging in a second communication session between the parties.

Technical Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to presence-aware communication networks. More particularly, and not by way of any limitation, the present invention is directed to a dynamic contact list management system and method operable in a communications network environment.","2. Description of Related Art","With today's widespread use of the Internet as a major communication medium, data communication devices are now being designed so that they are capable of communicating over packet-switched networks. For instance, telephones, pagers, personal digital assistant devices, cell phones, handheld computers, and even fax machines can now be accessed and controlled from the Internet. Communication over a packet-switched network using communication devices that traditionally communicate over a circuit-switched telecommunications network is generally known as network telephony, or IP telephony when an IP network is involved.","Various types of user communication devices (e.g., a cell phone, laptop or handheld PC, desktop PC, and the like) can identify themselves to the network using a suitable identifier (e.g., username@company.com). \u201cPresence\u201d refers to, for example, the availability, proximity, activity level or operating state of a user or device on a network. The ability for users to monitor each other's presence is a feature offered in connection with many applications that support network telephony. For example, instant messaging (IM) applications such as MSN\u00ae, Yahoo\u00ae, et cetera, have an \u201cavailable buddy\u201d feature, in which a user of the application can determine whether select users are available for engaging in communication. The data retrieved and returned to the buddy list, e.g. \u201cJohn OFFLINE\u201d or \u201cSusan ACTIVE\u201d, is known as \u201cpresence information,\u201d and is generally maintained by a presence server in the data network, often a dedicated server. Typically, the presence server supports network protocols such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Users can register their communication devices with the presence server in order to have their presence maintained and to allow various programs on the network to facilitate network telephony services. A first device user wishing to detect the presence of a second device user does so by \u201csubscribing\u201d with the presence server, such as via a SIP SUBSCRIBE message. The presence server intermediates between the first device user (also known as the watcher or subscriber) and the second device user to facilitate the communication of the second device user's presence information to the first device user.","Additional details concerning presence and presence data modeling are set forth in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comment (RFC) 2778 entitled \u201cA model for Presence and Instant Messaging,\u201d dated February 2002; RFC 2779 entitled \u201cInstant Messaging\/Presence Protocol Requirements,\u201d dated February 2002; and Internet-Draft identified as <<draft-schulzrinne-simple-rpids-01.ps>> and entitled \u201cRPIDS\u2014Rich Presence Information Data Format for Presence Based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),\u201d dated Feb. 18, 2003, which are incorporated herein by reference.","Although presence and IM applications have been implemented in a variety of settings such as those exemplified hereinabove, several areas remain deficient in terms of presence and contact list management.","The present invention is directed to a dynamic contact list management (DCLM) method and system operable in a communications network environment. In one embodiment, upon receiving a communication request from an originating party over a first network towards a networked party, a query is generated by a DCLM logic functionality for determining and locating an instant message (IM) address associated with the originating party. For purposes of the present patent application, a SIP address or SIP Uniform Resource Indicator (URI) may be treated as the IM address, by way of example. Upon establishing presence awareness between the originating party and the networked party, the IM address of the originating party is dynamically added to a contact list database associated with the networked party. The IM address, which is persistent at least for the duration of a first communication session established responsive to the communication request, may be used for engaging in a second communication session between the parties.","In another embodiment, the DCLM logic is operable to generate a query to determine an IM address associated with a knowledge-specific entity relative to a networked party disposed in a presence-capable network. The query is operable to search for a match between the IM address and a specific skill set or domain expertise of the entity. Upon establishing presence awareness between the knowledge-specific entity and the networked party, the IM address is added to a contact list database associated with the networked party, which may be persistent for a predetermined amount of time, whereupon the IM address may be deleted.","Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to various examples of how the invention can best be made and used. Like reference numerals are used throughout the description and several views of the drawings to indicate like or corresponding parts, wherein the various elements are not necessarily drawn to scale. Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , depicted therein an embodiment of a communications network environment  wherein a dynamic contact list management (DCLM) system and method may be provided in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. As illustrated, the communications network environment  is comprised of a first network  and a second network , wherein an external originating party , i.e., a caller or calling party, is operable to initiate the communication event request (or, simply \u201ccommunication request\u201d or \u201crequest\u201d) over one of the networks, e.g., the first network , for delivery to an intended networked party that is networked to both first and second networks. By way of example, a plurality of networked parties NP- - through NP-N -N are operable to access the first network , each using a suitable first communication device, -, i=1, 2, . . . , N. Likewise, NP- - through NP-N -N are also operable to access the second network , each using a suitable second communication device -, i=1, 2, . . . , N.","At the outset, it should be realized by those skilled in the art that for purposes of the present invention, the first and second networks may comprise any known or heretofore unknown telecommunications or data communications networks, either private or public, as long as one of them, e.g., the second network , is capable of operating as a presence-aware network. Accordingly, the first network  can be a network selected from the group consisting of an enterprise communications network, e.g., a digital Private Branch Exchange (PBX) network, at least a portion of a public circuit-switched voice communications network such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or a cellular\/mobile\/wireless communications network, or a packet-switched network, e.g., an Internet Protocol (IP)-based network. In terms of the type of communications that can be supported, it is envisaged that the first network  is capable of supporting voice communications, video communications, data communications, text message communications, electronic mail (email) communications, multimedia communications, or any combination or combinations thereof. As a consequence, the term \u201ccall\u201d or \u201ccommunication request\u201d used in reference to a communication event initiated by the originating party  should be construed broadly and can include any communication event relating to the communication types exemplified herein (e.g., voice calls, video calls, text messages, email messages, video mail messages, multimedia calls, et cetera). Correspondingly, the first communication devices - to -N associated with the networked parties may comprise wireline telephones, wireless telephones, PBX digital phones, video phones, text messaging devices, Voice-over-IP (VOIP) or web phones, and the like, depending on particular network implementation and application.","As alluded to in the foregoing, the second network  is preferably operable as a presence-aware network wherein presence information relating to the networked parties as well as other originating parties and associated communication devices may be collected and shared using any presence-capable network protocol. By way of example, the second network may be implemented as an IP-based network that is operable with a presence application protocol such as one selected from the group consisting of SIP, Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), IBM Sametime protocol, and so on. Furthermore, the second network  may comprise a local area network, wide area network, an enterprise intranet network, or a public packet-switched network such as the Internet. Accordingly, the second communication devices - to -N associated with the networked parties may comprise a computing\/communication device such as, e.g., a desktop or laptop personal computer, although any hardware platform operable with a presence application may be provided as part of the second network  within the context of the present invention. Additionally, in a further embodiment, the first and second communication devices associated with a networked party may be integrated into a single device, e.g., equipment that supports computer telephony integration (CTI), with which the networked parties may access both first and second networks. For instance, additional details regarding integration of PBX phones and presence-capable computer equipment may be found in the following co-pending commonly assigned United States nonprovisional patent application entitled: \u201cCLIENT-BASED INTEGRATION OF PBX AND MESSAGING SYSTEMS,\u201d application Ser. No. 10\/750,795, filed Dec. 31, 2003, in the name(s) of Michael S. Wengrovitz, cross-referenced hereinabove.","To facilitate presence information collection and sharing, i.e., presence awareness, a presence server  may be provided as part of the second network . In one embodiment, the presence information relates to the presence state\/data of the networked parties as well as any external parties, and their associated communication devices (e.g., \u201cOFFLINE\u201d; \u201cONLINE\u201d; \u201cOUT TO LUNCH\u201d; \u201cBUSY\u201d; \u201cIDLE\u201d; \u201cON PHONE\u201d; \u201cIN CONFERENCE\u201d; \u201cWITH CUSTOMER\u201d; \u201cKEYBOARD INACTIVE\u201d; \u201cCALL WAITING\u201d; \u201cOFF-HOOK\u201d; \u201cRINGING\u201d, et cetera). In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, a contact list that is dynamically managed may be provided for any networked party, wherein a contact may be an external party, that is, a party not included in the enterprise network of the networked parties NP- through NP-N, such as, e.g., external originating party , or an internal party, i.e., one of the networked parties (\u201cco-worker\u201d parties). A dynamic contact list management (DCLM) logic function operable to generate a query to determine and locate the IM address and other IM-related indicia of a calling party may be provisioned in the communications network environment  either in a centralized manner (e.g., as a separate network node or as a co-located module associated with a network switch or a presence server) or by way of a distributed arrangement wherein the DCLM logic may be partitioned across one or more network entities, i.e., communication devices associated with the networked parties, or in any combination thereof. As shown in , DCLM module  is illustrative of an embodiment where the DCLM logic is provided as an application operating in conjunction with the computing\/communication device - of one particular networked party, i.e., NP- -. DCLM module  exemplifies the provisioning of the DCLM logic as a co-located entity operable in conjunction with the presence server . On the other hand, DCLM module  exemplifies the provisioning of the DCLM logic as a separate network node disposed in the second network . Although not explicitly shown in , those skilled in the art will recognize that the DCLM functionality may also be provisioned as part of a network switch associated with the first network  (e.g., as a CTI-enhanced PBX node).","In one embodiment, regardless of where or how the DCLM logic is provisioned in the communications network environment , the logic is operable to effectuate the generation of a query for determining and locating the IM address or related indicia of an originating party (which can be an external party such as the external originating party  or an internal co-worker party) upon receiving a communication request therefrom towards a particular networked party (e.g., NP- -) for whom a dynamically-managed contact list database is provisioned. Upon determining the IM address and establishing presence awareness between the originating party and the networked party, the IM address is added to the contact list database of the networked party, which IM address can be persistent at least for the duration of a communication session set up responsive to the communication request. As can be appreciated, the IM address and\/or related indicia (e.g., an alias, screen name, or a handle, etc.) of the originating party may be used for establishing another communication session with the networked party, which may involve complementary communications in addition to the first communication session. By way of example, the first communication session may be a voice call session whereas the second communication session using the dynamically-acquired IM address of the originating party (who is now added as a dynamic contact) may involve an escalated communication session such as an instant message session, a text chat session, a multimedia session, a document exchange session, or a desktop sharing session, or any combination thereof.","In an exemplary implementation, the telephone numbers and matching IM addresses\/indicia associated therewith are provisioned in a service database, such as a white pages database served by a server that is operable with respect to external originating parties. In another exemplary implementation, such data may be provisioned as an internal database associated with a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)-based server that is operable to serve an enterprise including the receiving networked party as well as the internal originating party, i.e., the co-worker party. Further service database implementations may include Active Directory databases, Structured Query Language (SQL) databases, IBM Databases, et cetera. As shown in , reference numeral  refers to an external contact address information database and reference numeral  refers to an internal contact address information database, which are illustrative of the aforesaid implementations.","In a further embodiment, the DCLM logic is operable to generate a query to determine an IM address associated with a knowledge-specific co-worker of a networked party disposed in a presence-capable network such as the network . The query is operable to search for a match between the IM address and a specific skill set of the co-worker. Upon establishing presence awareness between the knowledge-specific co-worker and the networked party, the IM address is added to a contact list database associated with the networked party, which may be persistent for a predetermined amount of time, whereupon the IM address may be deleted. A similar implementation may be provided for dynamically locating knowledge-specific databases, documents, domain-specific ontologies, etc., within an enterprise that are networked using an appropriate protocol, e.g., as databases served by LDAP servers with suitable SIP interface extensions. Accordingly, a networked party of the enterprise network may dynamically access either knowledge-specific co-workers having particular skill sets (i.e., experts) or other resources, and maintain addresses relating to such entities as dynamic contacts in a contact database for a predetermined time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","104","100","202","200","204","206","208"]},"A DCLM module  includes a query generation function  that is operably coupled to an instant messaging (IM) module  (e.g., representative of known IM applications operable to provide IM services), a contact list or database  that includes appropriate database management interfaces for adding, deleting, and manipulating contact address data. Also, a database of user preferences and options  may be provided for further refinement of database query generation and contact list database management. As should be apparent to one skilled in the art, the contact list database and management logic  may be dynamically configurable, and can involve real-time input from the user. In addition, the user preferences\/options database  may be populated, updated, and maintained in a number of ways. A display and\/or user interface  is provided for supporting appropriate GUI-based dialog boxes and menus that facilitate user interaction as needed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["100","302","304"]},"Upon determining and locating the IM address and associated indicia of the originating party, presence awareness may be established between the particular networked party and the originating party (block ).

A first communication session may be established between the originating party and the particular networked party responsive to the communication request (block ). In addition, if necessary, a second communication session may be engaged between the particular networked party and the originating party by using the IM address of the originating party (block ). The first communication session is terminated upon completion of the call (block ), whereupon the IM address of the originating party may be deleted from the DCL database of the networked party, either substantially immediately or after being persistent for a predetermined amount of time (block ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":"350"},"Upon discovering and locating the IM address\/indicia of the knowledge-specific co-worker or co-workers, presence awareness between the co-worker(s) and the networked party may be established via a presence server using appropriate presence protocols (block ).

Those skilled in the art will recognize that a similar methodology may also be employed for dynamically adding IM address and related indicia information of other resources, e.g., domain-specific ontologies, corporate documents, presentations, etc., to the database of a networked party, wherein suitable query requests may be appropriately tailored based on particular concepts, keywords, contexts, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["1","402","406","1","410","1","2","410","2","412","1","412","2","410","1","410","2","2","404","408","2","404","414","1","414","2","410","1","410","2","1","414","1","416"]},"An internal contact database server  (e.g., LDAP server with appropriate extensions) and an external contact database server  (e.g., a white pages server) are also exemplified in . Additionally, an external originating party is exemplified by customer  equipped with a phone  and a PC .","Upon receiving an incoming call  from customer  towards Worker, the DCLM function  generates a search query  operable to interrogate the external contact database server . A successful reply message  includes the matching tuple which contains the customer's IM address. As part of establishing presence awareness between Worker - and customer , Worker subscribes to the presence status of customer as exemplified by a message  towards customer, which elicits a suitable RESPONSE . Subsequently, customer  is added to the contact list of Worker as a dynamic contact (block ). Thereafter, a call session  is established between Worker - and the originating customer . Upon completion of the call, the call session may be terminated as indicated by reference numeral . Also, a NOTIFY message  is shown that provides a \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d notification, although not limited thereto. Worker - can get customer's presence state via the customer's presence server (not shown in this FIGURE), or Worker can obtain the presence state of the customer  via its own presence server, where the worker's presence server is connected to customer's presence server. A second communication session may be established between the parties which can involve document sharing, video sharing, etc. After terminating the first communication session, i.e., call termination, customer  is deleted from the contact list of Worker - as shown in block .","With respect to dynamically adding knowledge-specific entities as contacts, the DCLM function  is operable to generate a query  for interrogating the internal database server .

The matching IM address or addresses are added as dynamic contacts for Worker (block ), which may persist as long as Worker maintains them or upon expiration of a predetermined amount of time. As part of establishing presence awareness between Worker - and the knowledge-based entities, appropriate messaging is effectuated via the presence server , e.g., SUBSCRIBE , RESPONSE , and NOTIFY  messages.
