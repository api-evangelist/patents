title: System and method for selectively providing information to a user device
abstract: A system and method for selectively providing information to a user device includes an event server that provides restricted access to various types of event content information and services related to a particular event. A wireless portable user device may provide an access code to the event server at a particular event location through a wireless base station that is coupled to a local area network. A system user may thereby utilize the user device to access the event server for downloading appropriate event content information and related services until the foregoing access code expires.

No. 60\/250,944, entitled \u201cInfrastructure To Enhance User Experience At Live Events,\u201d filed on Dec. 1, 2000, and to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/250,947, entitled \u201cVideo Streaming To Personal Wireless Devices For Live Event Enhancement,\u201d filed on Dec. 1, 2000. The foregoing related applications are commonly assigned, and are hereby incorporated by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to techniques for accessing information, and relates more particularly to a system and method for selectively providing information to a user device.","2. Description of the Background Art","Implementing effective methods for accessing information is a significant consideration for designers and manufacturers of contemporary electronic devices. However, effectively accessing information with electronic devices may create substantial challenges for system designers. For example, enhanced demands for increased device functionality and performance may require more system processing power and require additional hardware resources. An increase in processing or hardware requirements may also result in a corresponding detrimental economic impact due to increased production costs and operational inefficiencies.","Furthermore, enhanced device capability to perform various advanced operations may provide additional benefits to a system user, but may also place increased demands on the control and management of various device components. For example, an enhanced electronic device that effectively accesses, stores, displays, and manipulates digital image data may benefit from an efficient implementation because of the large amount and complexity of the digital data involved.","Due to growing demands on system resources and substantially increasing data magnitudes, it is apparent that developing new techniques for accessing information is a matter of concern for related electronic technologies. Therefore, for all the foregoing reasons, developing effective systems for accessing information remains a significant consideration for designers, manufacturers, and users of contemporary electronic devices.","In accordance with the present invention, a system and method are disclosed for selectively providing information to a user device. In one embodiment, an electronic system may preferably include, but is not limited to, a user device, a base station, a local area network (LAN), an event server, and an Internet network. The user device may preferably be implemented as any appropriate type of electronic device. For example, the user device may be configured as a portable wireless telecommunications device.","In certain embodiments, the user device may preferably communicate bidirectionally with the base station which may include a radio-frequency transceiver system to transmit and receive wireless communications to and from the user device. The base station may preferably be coupled to the LAN which may preferably be implemented at a particular event location. For example, the LAN and the base station may be located at a movie theater, a sporting venue, or a sports bar. In certain embodiments, the electronic system may include multiple base stations coupled to one or more different LANs.","In one embodiment, the LAN may preferably communicate directly with the event server which may preferably include various types of event services or event information related to a particular event or event location. In another embodiment, the LAN may preferably include a computer device for connecting to the Internet which may then responsively communicate with the event server. In accordance with the present invention, the user device may thus access relevant event information from the event server via the LAN and the base station. In certain circumstances, the user device may also communicate directly with the Internet to access the event server.","During the utilization of the foregoing embodiment, a system user may initially purchase an admission to a particular event or event location. The system user may then preferably receive an access code corresponding to the particular event or event location. Subsequently, the system user may preferably enter the event location and there determine whether to perform a login procedure with the user device to thereby gain access to the event server. During the login procedure, the user device may preferably provide the foregoing access code to the event server. In certain embodiments, the user device may also provide various other types of user data to the event server.","The user device may then preferably perform a configuration procedure with configuration information downloaded from the event server. In addition, when appropriate, the user device may also update device application software to correspond to a latest software version for the particular event or event location. The user device may then preferably access and utilize various restricted services and restricted content information relating to the particular event from the event server. In certain embodiments, the event server may preferably regulate access to the various restricted services and content information based upon time-stamped access capabilities corresponding to the access code provided by the user device to the event server during the foregoing login procedure.","In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the event server may periodically determine whether access rights for the user device have expired. For example, an access rights manager of the event server may preferably monitor corresponding time-stamped capabilities to determine whether various access rights of the particular user device have expired. In one embodiment, when the event server determines that the access rights of a user device have expired, then access to the restricted event content and services may preferably be terminated. The present invention thus provides an improved system and method for selectively providing information to a user device.","The present invention relates to an improvement in information management techniques.
