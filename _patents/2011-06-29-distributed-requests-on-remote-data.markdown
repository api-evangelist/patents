title: Distributed requests on remote data
abstract: Various embodiments of systems and methods for communicating with a plurality of remote systems are described herein. A remote data query is sent from a central data requesting system to remote systems. A query result is received asynchronously from at least one of the remote systems. The remote systems may include data pools which are independent of each other. In one embodiment, the remote systems include a responsive remote system and an unresponsive remote system, and the query result is received from the responsive remote system. In one embodiment, a predetermined timeout period is set at the central data requesting system and the query result obtained after the pre-determined timeout period is ignored by the central data requesting system.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments generally relate to computer systems, and more particularly to methods and systems for communication with remote systems.","Large enterprises have a huge amount of data stored on remote systems, such as customer systems or mobile devices. Usually these enterprises want to query the remote systems for the remote data. Typically, the data from all the remote systems are transferred to a central system, located at the enterprise, which is then queried for the remote data. However, downloading the remote data to the central system causes a huge data load at the central system which is undesirable.","Furthermore, remote systems may store data in distributed databases which allow the enterprise to query the remote data at the remote system itself. However, distributed databases are defined by strict rules (12+1 rule) such as: availability: all the remote systems should be \u201clive\u201d when the query is sent to the remote systems, consistency: whenever the remote data is changed in one of the distributed database the change should be updated in other distributed databases as well, etc.","In some cases, the query sent to the remote systems might be statistical in nature, which does not require the remote data, stored at the remote systems, to be defined by such strict rules. Therefore, there is a need for a system and method that allows enterprises to easily query data stored in remote systems.","Various embodiments of systems and methods for distributed requests on remote data are described herein.","In one aspect, a remote data query is sent from a central data requesting system to one or more of the plurality of remote systems.","In another aspect, a query result is received asynchronously, at the central data requesting system, from at least one of the plurality of remote systems.","These and other benefits and features of embodiments of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, presented in connection with the following drawings.","Embodiments of techniques for distributed requests on remote data are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","1","102","2","104","3","106","4","108","1","102","2","104","3","106","4","108","102","108"]},"The communication system  includes a central data requesting system  that sends a remote data query  to the remote system  , the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system  . As shown, the central data requesting system  sends the remote data query  in parallel to the remote system  , the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system  . In one embodiment, the central data requesting system  sends the remote data query  in series to the remote system  , the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system  . The remote data query  may be a query on the data stored in the remote system  , the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system  . Based on the received remote data query , the remote system   and the remote system   send query result  and query result , respectively to the central data requesting system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202"]},"Next at block , at least one of the remote systems, which received the remote data query, may send the query result to the central data requesting system. According to one embodiment, the remote systems send the query result asynchronously to the central data requesting system, i.e., the query results from the different remote systems are independent of each other, and it does not matter if some of the remote systems, which received the remote data query, do not send the query results to the central data requesting system.","The central data requesting system may then analyze the query result received from the remote systems. Since the remote data query sent by the central data requesting system is statistical in nature, the central data requesting can analyze the query result even though only one of the remote systems provides the query result, i.e., even though only one of the remote systems responds to the remote data query.","For example, consider that the central data requesting system sends the remote data query to five remote systems for inquiring about an average usage of a particular hardware on these five remote systems. Suppose that the central data requesting system receives query result from only two of these five remote systems. The central data requesting system can analyze the query results obtained from the two remote systems to derive the average usage of the particular hardware on the remote systems. Since the remote data query is statistical in nature the central data requesting system does not require the query results from all the five remote systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","302","304","302","304","304","304","304"]},"The communication system  also includes a remote system  , a remote system  , and a remote system  . Each of the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system   may include a data pool  , a data pool  , and a data pool  , respectively. The data pool  , the data pool  , and the data pool   may store data related to the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system  , respectively. The data pool  , the data pool  , and the data pool   may include any source of data. For example, the data pools - may be a database such as a relational database or an in-memory database. The data pool  , the data pool  , and the data pool   are independent of each other, i.e., the data in any of the data pools - (-) are not dependent on each other and can be different. For example, if the data in the data pool   is edited or updated, this change is not required to be replicated in the data pool   and the data pool  .","The remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system   also include an interface  , an interface  , and an interface  , respectively. The interface  , the interface  , and the interface   converts the remote data query  into a language understood by the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system  , respectively. For example, the remote data query  might be defined in \u201cOpen SQL\u201d which is converted by the interface  , the interface  , and the interface   to \u201cNative SQL\u201d that is understood by the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system  . In one embodiment, the interface  , the interface  , and the interface   are a database management system (DBMS). In another embodiment, the interface  , the interface  , and the interface   may be an ABAP interpreter.","The remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system  may also include a result processing module for executing the remote data query  received from the central data requesting system . Executing the remote data query  at the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system   may include accessing the data pool  , the data pool  , and the data pool  , respectively, for obtaining the query result of the remote data query . The result processing module may be for example a database engine that may be used to create, read, update, and delete data from the data pool  , the data pool  , and the data pool  . In one embodiment, the query result may be a data, such as a database table, which has been requested for, in the remote data query . In another embodiment, when the remote data query  is the repair program, the query result may be \u201csuccessful\u201d or \u201cunsuccessful\u201d depending on whether the repair program was executed successfully or unsuccessfully at the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system  .","In one embodiment, each of the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system   may include a collecting module for collecting data of the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system   and storing the collected data in the data pool  , the data pool  , and the data pool  , respectively. The collecting module may be for example Solution Manager, provided by SAP AG, of Walldorf, Germany.","A communication is established between the central data requesting system  and the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system  . The communication established between the central data requesting system  and the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system   may be a wired connection or a wireless connection. The central data requesting system  may send the remote data query  to the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system   via the established communication. The remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system   may send the query result for the remote data query  via the established communication. The remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system   may send the query result independently to the central data requesting system .","In one embodiment, the central data requesting system  may send the remote data query  to the remote systems  , the remote system  , and the remote system   using any asynchronous communication protocol, i.e., the central data requesting system  does not wait for receiving the query result from the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system   after sending the remote data query  to the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system  , respectively. For example, the central data requesting system  may send the remote data query , to the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system   using the asynchronous remote function call (aRFC) protocol. The remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system   may also send the query result of the remote data query  to the central data requesting system  using the asynchronous communication protocol.","In another embodiment, the central data requesting system  may send the remote data query  to the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system   using a communication protocol that has a timeout exit strategy. For example, the central data requesting system  may send the remote data query  to the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system   as a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request. In this case, the central data requesting system  waits for a certain time to receive a reply (query result) for the HTTP request (remote data query ), if the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system   do not reply to the HTTP request before the time then the HTTP request ends in a \u201ctimeout\u201d.","The central data requesting system  may wait for a pre-determined timeout for receiving the query result from the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system  . In one embodiment, the pre-determined timeout may be set by an end user at the central data requesting system . The central data requesting system  only accepts the query result obtained before this pre-determined timeout.","In one embodiment, one or more of the remote systems, i.e., the remote system  , the remote system  , and the remote system  , are not responsive, when the remote data query  is sent to the remote system  , the remote  , and the remote system  . This may be due to several reasons, for example if one of the remote system  , the remote system  , or the remote system   is shutdown. As shown, the remote system   is unresponsive, i.e., not responding to the remote data query , the remote system   and the remote system   are responsive. The central data requesting system  receives the query result  and the query result  from the responsive remote system   and the responsive remote system  .","Finally, the central data requesting system  analyzes the query result  and the query result . Analyzing the query results  and  by the central data requesting system  may include listing the query results  and  on a user interface at the central data requesting system , counting the number of rows in the query result  and , or generating and presenting a graph based on the received query results  and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","402","404","406","402","402","404"]},"The communication system  also includes a remote system \u201cS\u201d , a remote system \u201cS\u201d , a remote system \u201cS\u201d , a remote system \u201cS\u201d , a remote system \u201cS\u201d , a remote system \u201cS\u201d , a remote system \u201cS\u201d , and a remote system \u201cS\u201d , at a customer  end.
