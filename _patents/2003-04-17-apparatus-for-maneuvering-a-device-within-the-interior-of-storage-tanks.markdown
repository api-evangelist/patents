title: Apparatus for maneuvering a device within the interior of storage tanks
abstract: An apparatus for attachment to a commercially available cleaning wand for maneuvering the wand inside a storage tank. Two arms each have an end pivotally connected to a handle and another end pivotally connected to the wand to form a four bar linkage. A gimbal arrangement is supported above a base, which is placed over an opening in the tank, and one of the arms is coupled to the gimbal arrangement to allow movement about three mutually perpendicular axes for directing the wand to various orientations within the tank.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for government purposes without the payment of any royalties therefor.","Various storage tanks, including rail car tanks and other vessels require periodic inspection and internal cleaning to remove fluid or debris built up on the interior tank wall. For example, the tank is cleaned through a manway, or opening, with a lancing, or cleaning wand which is supplied with high-pressure fluid. To clean or inspect the interior an operator generally holds the inspection equipment or cleaning wand through the opening while laying on a personnel platform. If such a platform is not part of the tank structure, a portable staging platform is erected for this purpose.","This method of cleaning the tank is cumbersome and uncomfortable for the operator. Further, it is difficult for the operator to hold and direct the cleaning wand while in the prone position. The present invention eases the cleaning operation, allowing it to be done with less effort and in a shorter period of time. Further, for inspection purposes, the present invention allows for easy, controlled inspection of the tank interior.","The present invention includes an apparatus for maneuvering a device such as a cleaning wand supplied with high-pressure fluid for cleaning the interior of a storage tank, the tank having an opening through which the wand is inserted. The apparatus includes a base with an outer gimbal ring disposed above the base and a plurality of legs connecting the outer gimbal ring with the base. First and second shafts connect an inner gimbal ring with the outer gimbal ring in a manner to permit oscillation of the inner gimbal ring about a first axis.","A sleeve is positioned within the inner gimbal ring with third and fourth shafts connecting the sleeve with the inner gimbal ring in a manner to permit oscillation of the sleeve about a second axis perpendicular to the first axis. First and second pivotal connectors are positioned at spaced apart locations on a handle member with a first arm having a first end being connected to the first pivotal connector and passing through the sleeve. A second arm having a first end is connected to the second pivotal connector. A swivel bushing surrounds and is secured to the first arm and is positioned on top of the sleeve to permit rotation of the first arm about a vertical axis.","Third and fourth pivotal connectors are positioned at respective second ends of the first and second arms for connection to the device.","In the drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, like or corresponding parts are denoted by like or corresponding reference numerals. Although the apparatus is applicable to various devices including inspection cameras and other viewing gear, it will be described, by way of example, with respect to cleaning equipment.","Referring now to , the cleaning apparatus  includes a base member  and an outer gimbal ring  supported above the base  by a plurality of legs . An inner gimbal ring  is connected to the outer gimbal ring  by respective first and second shafts  and  in a manner to permit oscillation of the inner gimbal ring  about a first axis X.","More particularly, and in a preferred embodiment, each shaft  and  includes a respective end member  and  which reside, and are rotatable in, respective diametrically opposed notches  and  of the outer gimbal ring , best illustrated in . A typical end member  is illustrated in . The end member  includes a central cylindrical portion  straddled by opposed flanges  and . Central cylindrical portion  may oscillate in the notch  about axis X, while flanges  and  limit axial movement of shaft . This same structure and operation also describes end member  residing in notch . The shafts  and  may be metal pipes and the end members  and  may be of a hard durable plastic material.","Referring once again to , the apparatus includes a sleeve  positioned within the inner gimbal ring  and connected to the inner gimbal ring  by means of respective third and fourth shafts  and  in a manner to permit oscillation of the sleeve  about a second axis Y, perpendicular to first axis X. The third and fourth shafts  and  may be constituted by shoulder bolts passing through respective apertures in inner gimbal ring  and threaded to sleeve .","The apparatus utilizes a linkage comprised of a handle  having first and second pivotal connectors  and  positioned at spaced apart locations on the handle . In the embodiment illustrated, the first pivotal connector  is located at an end of the handle . Depending from the first pivotal connector  is a first arm  which passes through the sleeve  as well as a swivel bushing  secured to arm  by means of, for example, a thumbscrew . The swivel bushing  rests on, and is rotatable relative to, the top of the sleeve , thus permitting rotation of the arm  about a vertical axis Z.","A third component of the linkage is comprised of a second arm  which is connected to the second pivotal connector  and remains parallel to the first arm  during operation. Positioned at respective second ends of arms  and  are third and fourth pivotal connectors  and  for connection to a commercially available lancing, or cleaning wand , which is supplied with high pressure fluid via flexible hose . When attached, the cleaning wand  completes a four bar linkage, along with handle  and arms  and , for leverage and motion maneuverability of the wand. The handle  and first and second arms  and  are preferably hollow tubes.","For example,  illustrate the apparatus placed on a support platform  over a manway, or opening , of a storage tank , having an interior . With the four bar linkage, when the handle  is raised, the cleaning wand  is directed to a downward position. Conversely, and as indicated in , when the handle  is depressed, the cleaning wand  is directed to an upward position. Handle  is also utilized to rotate the linkage around approximately 180\u00b0, and to this end reference is made to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["70","64","76","74","46","19","20","78","40","79","50","80","50","56","19","20","12"]},"Various pivotal connector designs may be used herein and  illustrates one such connector  for arm . Pivotal connector  is a clevis having a shank  inserted within handle  and secured to it by a pin . The U-shaped end  of the clevis accommodates the first arm  which is free to pivot about a pin such as a shoulder bolt .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["56","48","90","46","91","92","56","93","60","61"]},"It will be readily seen by one of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention fulfills all of the objects set forth herein.
