The composition and methods of the disclosure can include any value or any combination of the values, specific values, more specific values, and preferred values described herein, including explicit or implicit intermediate values and ranges.","Lithium ion capacitors (LICs) are a new class of innovative hybrid energy storage devices. Unlike EDLC's, which store energy based on double layer mechanism on both electrodes, the hybrid lithium ion capacitors store energy on the cathode via the double layer mechanism whereas energy storage on the anode is via Faradaic mechanism. As a result, the energy density in such devices can be, for example, five times greater than an EDLC, while maintaining the power also at a 3 to 4 times greater than an EDLC's power. Despite the Faradaic mechanism of energy storage, these LIC devices still show very high cycle life, for example, in excess of 200,000 cycles, making the devices attractive for many applications. LICs utilize a high surface area (typically greater than 1,000 m\/g) carbon on the positive electrode and an intercalating carbon with low porosity and low surface area (typically less than 300 m\/g) on the anode, which combination of a high and a low surface area carbon supports fast intercalation and de-intercalation of lithium ions. During charge and discharge, lithium intercalation and de-intercalation occurs within the bulk of the negative electrode (i.e., the anode), whereas anion adsorption and desorption takes place on the positive electrode (i.e., the cathode). The adsorption and desorption on the positive electrode is a non-Faradaic reaction, which is relatively faster than the lithium ion intercalation and de-intercalation on the negative electrode.","In the lithium ion capacitor, as mentioned above, the negative electrode (intercalating and de-intercalating) can be pre-doped with lithium metal. The pre-doping of the lithium ion capacitor allows an increase in the voltage to approximately about 3.8 volts.","A lithium ion capacitor permits a voltage of about 1.5 times that of an EDLC. The cell capacitance (C=Q\/V) can be stated by the charge-discharge curve. Since the energy density and power are both proportional to square of the voltage there is a significant increase in energy and power density of the device. In addition to the voltage related increase, the Faradaic reaction also has significantly greater energy associated with it and contributes to an increase in the energy and the power density. The negative electrode stays at a constant or even potential during the charging and discharging of the cell.","Properties of the negative electrode or anode are significant to the performance of the device. These properties are derived mainly from the materials comprising the negative electrode. The carbon materials comprising the negative electrode are significant to the performance of the device. The properties required for the Li ion capacitor anode are different from properties required for Li ion battery anodes, although both involve insertion of lithium ions in the carbon structure. The Li ion capacitor is a power device and hence a fast intercalation\u2014deintercalation of ions is essential, whereas for Li ion batteries a slow intercalation rate is acceptable. In embodiment, the disclosure provides a carbon for the use in an anode electrode of a lithium ion capacitor. The data provided was obtained at desired high charge-discharge rates.","Different types of carbons have been evaluated as anode materials of lithium ion capacitors. Graphite has been used mainly as the material of choice, but hard carbon materials, i.e., non-graphitic materials having a low surface area are also being used. Hard carbon materials show superior discharge capacities compared to graphite due to structural differences between the hard carbon and graphite.","Charge and discharge capacity is a quantitative measure of charge being stored and discharged, respectively, during the charge-discharge process. Discharge capacity is an intrinsic property of a carbon material. The higher the discharge capacity, the higher the energy density of the device. The discharge capacity of the carbon material can depend on, for example, the structure of the carbon and the impurity levels present in the carbon material.","The disclosure provides experimental support that shows the superior rate performance of coconut shell sourced carbon compared to a graphite (i.e., a standard material used in published studies), a phenolic resin (660\u00b0 C.) (comparative commercial material), and coconut shell sourced carbon carbonized at 600\u00b0 C., and at 1000\u00b0 C. Coconut shell sourced carbon that was carbonized at 1200\u00b0 C., at 1400\u00b0 C., and at 1600\u00b0 C., shows superior rate performance especially at higher rates (higher currents).","The disclosure provides experimental data for the disclosed carbon composition, an anode, and an LIC, which data includes a performance comparison as the anode material in Li ion capacitors of the disclosed anode carbon with anode carbons made from various different raw materials, such as carbon produced from a phenolic resin, and from a graphite.","The carbon products produced from the coconut shell carbonized at 1200\u00b0 C., the coconut shell carbonized at 1400\u00b0 C., and the coconut shell carbonized at 1600\u00b0 C. showed the highest discharge capacities compared to the other carbons and their respective treatments.","Rate performance is significant as a capacitor device is subjected to high rate charge-discharge cycles unlike batteries where the charge discharge rates are orders of magnitude lower.","In embodiments, the disclosure includes high performance active materials for lithium ion capacitors, and electrodes fabricated from these materials. The disclosure also includes a method of making the electrode from a carbon composition, which carbon composition is used as an anode in a lithium ion capacitor.","In embodiments, the disclosure provides a carbon composition for an anode in a lithium ion capacitor.","In embodiments, the disclosure provides an anode for a lithium ion capacitor having a low surface area carbon obtained from an inexpensive carbon source, such as coconut shell.","In embodiment, the disclosure provides a hard carbon, which shows superior discharge capacities compared to other hard carbons or graphite. Additionally, the disclosed carbon has superior rate performance, especially at high rates, leading to higher power and superior performance. The material, method of making and use, and the device performance is provided below and is compared with prior art materials.","In embodiments, the disclosure provides a performance comparison of the disclosed hard carbon prepared from a coconut shell source with a graphite and with carbons produced from different raw materials such as commercial phenolic resin.","In embodiments, the disclosure provides a method of making a carbon as an anode material in a lithium ion capacitor. The disclosure includes the performance comparison of anodes containing a coconut shell derived hard carbon with carbons produced from different raw materials such as a phenolic resin and a commercial graphite. This disclosure identifies fundamental aspects of the performance of the lithium ion capacitor with the coconut shell sourced activated carbon as an electrode material on the anode side and compares it to the activated carbons sourced from the phenolic resin and the graphite.","A carbonaceous material used on an anode electrode in a lithium ion capacitor is known to intercalate and de-intercalate lithium ions (see J. Electrochem. Soc., Vol. 140, No. 4, 922-927, April 1993). Charge and discharge capacity is a quantitative measure of the carbon's ability to store charge or discharge charge. Discharge capacity is an intrinsic property of a carbon. The discharge capacity of the carbon can depend on, for example, the structure of the carbon and the impurity levels in the carbon. The discharge capacities can directly reflect on the performance aspects of an energy cell. A higher discharge capacity is a desirable property in a carbon on the anode side as the carbon will directly and positively affect the packaging volume of a cell, which in turn will positively affect the energy and power density in a lithium ion capacitor device. It is significant to note that the capacity must be measured at high discharge rates since a capacitor is a power device, unlike an energy device such as a battery, where the discharge rates are significantly lower. The capacity of a material at high discharge rates will be different than at low discharge rates and will be a function of the structure of the material, which structure controls the diffusion rate of lithium ions into the structure of the materials.","In embodiments, the disclosure provides an anode in a lithium ion capacitor, comprising:\n\n","In embodiments, the coconut shell sourced carbon can be, for example, present in from 88 to 92 wt %; the conductive carbon can be, for example, present in from 4 to 7 wt %; and the binder is PVDF and can be, for example, present in from 4 to 6 wt % and the PVDF has a molecular weight of from 300,000 to 1,000,000.","In embodiments, the coconut shell sourced carbon composition can have, for example, a disorder (D) peak to graphitic (G) peak intensity ratio by Raman analysis of from 1.48 to 1.8.","In embodiments, the coconut shell sourced carbon can have, for example, a hydrogen content of from 0.01 to 0.24 wt %; a nitrogen content of from 0.03 to 0.5 wt %; an and oxygen content of from 0.01 to 1.9 wt %, including intermediate values and ranges.","In embodiments, the coconut shell sourced carbon can have, for example, a relatively low surface area of from 1 to 100 m\/g, such as from 10 to 75 m\/g, from 20 to 50 m\/g, and like areas, including intermediate values and ranges.","In embodiments, the coconut shell sourced carbon can have a particle size, for example, from 1 to 30 microns, from 2 to 7 microns, and like particle sizes, including intermediate values and ranges.","In embodiments, the anode operates at a high charge-discharge rate, for example, of from 1 C to 4000 C, including intermediate values and ranges.","In embodiments, the lithium ion capacitor can further comprise, for example: a cell comprising: the abovementioned anode in combination with a stacked cathode comprising an a heat and KOH activated wheat flour sourced carbon, e.g., 85% Corning carbon (mentioned below), a fluoropolymer, e.g., 10% PTFE DuPont 601A Teflon, a conductive carbon black, e.g., 5% Cabot Black Pearl 2000, a separator, e.g., NKK-4425, and a lithium composite powder (mentioned below) on the anode.","In embodiments, the cell can have a discharge capacity, for example, of from 60 to 120 mAh\/gm, such as 96.32 mAh\/gm based on the anode carbon weight, and a maximum energy density, for example, of from 20 to 60 Wh\/l, such as 44.77 Wh\/l.","In embodiments, the disclosure provides a method of making the above mentioned carbon composition comprising:\n\n","In embodiments, the method of making can further comprise, for example, washing the resulting powder with an aqueous acid (e.g., HCl).
