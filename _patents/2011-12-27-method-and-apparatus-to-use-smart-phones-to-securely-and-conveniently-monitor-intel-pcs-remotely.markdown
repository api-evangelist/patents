{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Due to the ease of use, improved battery power management, and access to information via instant communications, the use of portable mobile computing devices that are often classified as information technology (IT) assets has skyrocketed in recent years. Examples of mobile computing devices may include notebooks, laptops, pads and tablets, smart cellular phones and similar others. Often these mobile computing devices store or provide access to personal or corporate digital assets such as confidential personal data, proprietary technical information, or classified documents. There is a growing security concern about potential theft or misplacement of such mobile computing devices.","Techniques to improve security often rely on the use of strong passwords or the use of cable lock dongles to protect the digital assets. However, many of these techniques may be easily bypassed or disabled to steal valuable information.","Applicants recognize that software-only solutions to monitor IT assets such as computer systems typically require: 1) the support of an operating system (OS) that is loaded and is operational, and 2) normal power mode of operation. Therefore, the software-only solutions may not be effective when the above conditions are not met, e.g., when the computer system is operating in a low power or sleep mode.","Applicants also recognize that hardware-type solutions such as cable lock dongles equipped with an alarm typically require the user to locate a non-movable anchor object to secure the IT asset. Therefore, the hardware-type solutions may not be effective when an anchor object is not readily locatable.","The security of an IT asset may be improved by incorporating a monitoring device that is integrated into the hardware or firmware of the IT asset. The monitoring device is configured to operate in all modes of power operation of the IT asset. This includes all power modes that consume lower power than the normal power mode. Examples of low power operating modes may include sleep mode, standby power mode, hibernate mode, deep sleep mode, and similar others. Therefore, the operation of the monitoring device is independent of the availability of the OS and is independent of the power mode of operation of the IT asset.","The IT asset may be remotely monitored by using a mobile device such as a smart cellular phone. The IT asset and the mobile device may be paired by simply tapping the two devices using a near field communications (NFC) standard. The tapping procedure may be used during initial set up for authentication of identities, and for enabling or disabling of an alarm feature of the monitoring device.","The monitor device may be configured to generate the alarm in response to detecting a breach of security. Events that define a breach of security for the IT asset may be configured to include detecting motion, detecting a loss of communication using the NFC standard, receiving a user input and similar others. The IT asset may send a notification alarm to the mobile device in response to detecting the breach of security using a secure short message service (SMS) text message or message payload. The task of generating the alarm and the task of notification of the alarm may be performed by the monitor device independent of whether the IT asset is operating in a low power mode or in a normal power mode.","In response to receiving the notification alarm, an authorized user may send an authenticated SMS text message to the IT asset to perform an action such as request a current location of the IT asset, place it in a lockout mode to limit unauthorized access, or similar other. Authentication may used to prevent an attacker from sending a malicious message that the recipient interprets as genuine. It is desirable to prevent an attacker from sending malicious messages to the mobile device.","The IT asset includes an interactive display device for generating displays on a display screen and an input device to receive user inputs. A graphical user interface (GUI) display is configured to manage user interaction related tasks. The GUI may be used to configure various functions of an Asset Manager (AM) agent used to define various policies, rules and conditions for performing alarming and remote monitoring functions. For example, the AM may define that the IT asset simply inform the mobile user about its current location in response to an alarm condition or in some applications the AM may define that the IT asset be placed in a lockout mode in response to the alarm.","The mobile device may include a monitor application to remotely monitor the IT asset (simply referred to as a SmartRemon App). The SmartRemon App is similar to an App program developed for an Apple or Android or Windows cellular phone that may be purchased from an Internet App Store web site, may be provided as a utility by the IT asset manufacturer, or may be pre-loaded into the mobile device by the phone manufacturer.","The mobile device is configurable to perform wireless communications for: 1) contacting other mobile phone users, accessing Internet based services, and communicating via SMS text messages with the IT asset, and 2) communicating with the IT asset that is located within a close proximity using the NFC standard. The SmartRemon App uses the same intuitive, graphical user interface (GUI) display available on a mobile device to manage user interaction related tasks. The GUI improves the user experience of remotely monitoring the security of IT assets. Examples of some of the functions provided by the SmartRemon App may include displaying location of the IT asset on a map display and sending an authenticated SMS text message to the IT asset to perform an action.","This brief introduction, including section titles and corresponding summaries, is provided for the reader's convenience and is not intended to limit the scope of the claims, nor the proceeding sections.","The word \u201cexample\u201d is used herein to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration. As used in this application, the term \u201cor\u201d is intended to mean an inclusive \u201cor\u201d rather than an exclusive \u201cor\u201d. That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from context, \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, if X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B, then \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is satisfied under any of the foregoing instances. In addition, the articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean \u201cone or more\u201d unless specified otherwise or clear from context to be directed to a singular form.","Remote Monitoring System to Monitor IT Assets",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120"]},"In some implementations, a message (or a message payload) may be sent over another network transport such as an internet protocol (IP) network, which may be 3G, 4G, WiFi, and similar others. As long as a first processor (not shown) of the MCD  is coupled to a communications interface that is active and connected to a publicly routable network in a low power mode, the monitoring device  may send a secure message to the mobile device .","The mobile device  is configurable to wirelessly communicate with: 1) the MCD  using an interface  for short distance communications, and 2) web sites via the Internet and with other wireless cellar phone users using interface  for communications via a communication network . The interface  includes two components, one component, which is included in the mobile device , and another component which is included in the MCD . The interface  may utilize a communications standard such as a near field communications (NFC) standard or a Bluetooth standard that may be suitable for short distance communications.","The interface  may be based on IEEE 802.11 and\/or 802.16 family of standards for wireless communications over longer distances. Additional details of the flow of communications between the mobile device  and the MCD  via interfaces  and , including initial setup and operation, are described with reference to .","Although not expressly shown in , the mobile device  and MCD  are both computing devices (or computer systems) that may include hardware, firmware, and\/or software, which are configured to perform, at least in part, the techniques described herein. In addition, it is understood that the remote monitoring system  may include additional number of mobile devices and\/or mobile computing devices to fit the asset monitoring requirements.","An architecture for the MCD  may typically include hardware , software , and application  layers. Included in the hardware  layer is a monitoring device  that may be configured to monitor security related events. Examples of security related events may include monitoring operation of the communications interfaces  and , detecting motion of the MCD , and detecting tampering of the MCD  by an unauthorized user. Additional details of the monitoring device  configured to perform various remote monitoring related operations are described with reference to .","The software  layer may include components such as an operating system (OS), drivers, application programming interfaces (API's) and similar others. The application  layer may include software programs that leverage the functionality of the software  layer to perform one or more functions such as processing documents, spreadsheets, and similar others. For performing alarming and remote monitoring functions, an Asset Manager (AM) agent  may be configured in the application  layer to define various policies, rules and conditions. The policies, rules and conditions may be configured by the user using a graphical user interface (GUI) of the MCD  or via a GUI  of the mobile device . Additional details of the configuration of the AM agent  are described with reference to .","To conserve power, the MCD  is operable in several power usage modes such as normal power mode during periods of normal computing activity and a low power mode during periods of significantly reduced computing activity, e.g., during periods of sleep, hibernation, or inactivity. Transition between the different power usage modes may be automatic, event triggered, or activated by a user.","Although the MCD  may operate in a low power mode to reduce power consumption, the monitoring device  is configured to be active and is enabled to be fully operational in a continuous mode to monitor security related events. Thus, the operation of the monitoring device  is independent of whether the MCD  is operating in at least one of a normal power mode and a low power mode.","In response to detecting a security threat, the monitoring device  is configured to generate an alarm and notify the mobile device  by sending a secure SMS text message via the interface  and the communication network . In response to receiving the alarm, a user of the mobile device  may send an authenticated message to the monitoring device  (and hence MCD ) to perform one or more actions. Examples include identifying the current location of the MCD  on a map displayed by the mobile device , logging out and shutting down the MCD , securing the hard disk, or placing the MCD  in a lockout mode to prevent unauthorized user access. The remote monitoring system  is configured to support cryptographic features with hardware-protected key storage suitable for enterprise-class data protection.","The monitoring device  may be configured to generate audible warning sounds in response to detecting the security threat and dissuade potential attackers from continuing with an attack. In addition to activating an alarm, the monitoring device  may also collect audio and\/or video data from sensors on the platform to generate additional forensic evidence available for later investigation. The forensic information collected may be sent over an IP network or over a suitable 3G or 4G network using technology such as multimedia messaging service (MMS). As an option, the remote monitoring system  may provide an optional cloud service for enterprise-class monitoring and asset protection.","The mobile device  includes a SmartRemon App , a software program, which may be configured to improve the user experience of remotely monitoring the security of IT assets. The SmartRemon App  leverages the intuitive and easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI)  of the mobile device  for user interaction. The SmartRemon App  customizes the GUI  for monitoring the security of IT assets.

The display  is configured to provide a GUI  for user interaction. Although not shown, the input device  may include a QWERTY type fixed keypad for user input. The memory device  may be used to store the digital assets.","In one application, a level of activity of the second processor  may be used to determine whether or not the MCD  is operating in a low power mode or a normal power mode. When operating in a low power mode the second processor  is configured to receive an interrupt signal but is not configured to execute instructions stored in the memory device . Also, when the MCD  is operating in a low power mode, operation of the OS is typically suspended.","The monitoring device  includes a first processor , a first communications module (COM)  coupled to the first processor  via a bus , a second COM  coupled to the first processor  via the bus , a sensor  coupled to the first processor  via the bus , and the user input device  coupled to the first processor  via the bus .

The sensor  is configurable to sense one or more variables such as motion, GPS position, temperature, and similar others. The user input device  is configured to detect receiving a user input.","The first COM , may be configured to wirelessly communicate over very short distances, e.g., within a close proximity of about 20 centimeters, using the interface  and the first communication standard described with reference to . As previously described, the first communication standard may include a near field communications (NFC) standard configured to provide secure authenticated communications between any two NFC compliant devices. The first communication standard may also include the Bluetooth standard.","Near Field Communication (NFC) is a very short-range wireless standard that enables secure authenticated wireless communication between NFC compliant devices over a short distance of approximately 2-4 centimeters. NFC is an ISO based standard. The ISO 14443 Type A and Type B standards+FeliCa is a four-part international standard for contact-less smart cards operating at 13.56 MHz in close proximity with a reader antenna. The ISO 18092 standard defines communication modes for NFC Interface and Protocol.","The NFC standard enables data transactions, data exchange, and wireless communications between two NFC compliant devices in close proximity to each other, e.g., located approximately within 20 centimeters. The NFC standard compliant devices may be configured to automatically discover one another. The mobile device  may be configured to query the mobile computing device  and establish the wireless link. Set up time for automatically pairing two NFC compliant devices is typically less than 1 millisecond. Compared to the NFC standard, the Bluetooth standard typically supports communication over longer distances (e.g., up to 30 meters) and requires a longer set up time (e.g., about 5-6 seconds).","The second COM  may be used to communicate with other computing devices via the interface  the communication network  and a second communication standard. The second communication standard may be based on IEEE 802.11 family of standards for wireless local area network (WLAN). The mobile device  may also be configured to support IEEE 802.16 family of standards for wireless broadband devices such as 2G, 3G or 4G cell phones with long term evolution (LTE) or WiMAX capability.","The memory device  is operable to store instructions  that are executable by the first processor  to perform one or more functions in a manner that is independent of whether the MCD  is operating in a low power or a normal power mode. The first processor  is operable to execute instructions or commands  received from the user of the wireless device  to perform communication functions and to perform actions to protect digital assets that may be stored in or may be accessed via the MCD . An action performed by the first processor  in response to detecting a breach of security may include disabling the second processor  to be awakened from the low power mode to the normal power mode.","Events that define a breach of security for the MCD  may be configured to detect a loss of communication and generate a separation alarm, detect motion of the MCD  and generate a motion alarm, and detect receiving a user input and generate a tamper alarm similar others. In response to the generation of the separation alarm, or the motion alarm, or the tamper alarm, the monitoring device  may generate a security alarm (or simply an alarm) and send the alarm to the mobile device .","The components of the mobile computing device  may be modules of computer-executable instructions, which are instructions executable on a computer, computing device, or the processors of such devices.

The NFC data exchange may verify that the SmartRemon App  is properly licensed and certified by a trusted publisher.","Once trust between the mobile device  and the MCD  is established, the two devices may exchange cryptographic keys used to authenticate and protect future communications. The cryptographic keys may be accessed from a library of cryptographic keys implemented as hardware-protected keys for providing improved enterprise-class data protection.","The initial set up may also include configuration of the Asset Manager (AM) agent , which may include definition of various policies, rules and conditions that constitute a breach in security. For example, the monitoring device  may be configured to monitor both sensor input and user input. For example, trigger conditions may be configured in the AM agent  for generating alarms, notification of alarms, defining acceptable responses to the notification of alarms, and defining acceptable actions performed to ensure protection of the IT asset. Depending on the value of the digital asset protected, the severity of action(s) performed as defined in the security policy may vary from simply notifying the mobile device  of the alarm condition to permanently erasing the digital asset information stored in the MCD  in response to receiving a cryptographic message.","Although customization of the policies, rules and conditions is available to the user, in many applications, a single NFC tap feature may be used to activate a default monitoring setting for basic monitoring of the IT asset.","At process , another NFC tap operation may be performed by the mobile device  to activate the monitoring and alarming function performed by the monitoring device . At process , the monitoring device , which is configured to operate in low power mode as well as in normal power mode, sends an alarm notification to the mobile device  via interface  using an IEEE 802.16 or IEEE 802.11 family of standards. In one implementation, the interface  may use an Internet Protocol (IP) network transport for communications. In one application, the notification of the alarm is sent as a SMS text on established, secure, and widely available 2G or 3G networks or as a message payload via an IP network. When the SMS text notification is received by the mobile device , the SmartRemon App  may be configured to verify the authenticity of the notification message and enable the user to respond appropriately depending on the policy, conditions, and feature set of the application.","At process , the user operating the mobile device  may send a SMS text response to perform one or more actions in accordance with the established policies, rules and conditions that constitute a breach in security. Commands or instructions sent as a SMS text message from the mobile device  to the MCD  may be checked for authorization based on credentials established during the local pairing between the two devices. In one application, a SMS text request is sent to the MCD  to locate itself (e.g., via a built-in GPS sensor) and report the location. In another application, a SMS text request is sent to the MCD  to disarm the monitoring device . In yet another application, a cryptographic SMS text message or a message that includes the same text message payload is sent (e.g., via 2G or 3G networks or via an IP network) to perform a lockout of MCD  to prevent unauthorized access. The text message or message payload sent to the MCD  to instruct it to lock down is authenticated. Encryption may be optionally used to prevent an attacker from reading the contents of the message. Authentication may be used to prevent an attacker from sending a malicious message that the recipient, e.g., the MCD , interprets as genuine.
