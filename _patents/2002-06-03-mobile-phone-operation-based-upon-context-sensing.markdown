{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a Continuation-In-Part Application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/875,477, filed Jun. 6, 2001, which claims priority from a U.S. Provisional application having Ser. No. 60\/218,748, filed on Jul. 17, 2000 and entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS USING MULTIPLE SENSORS IN A MOBILE DEVICE.\u201d","The present invention relates to mobile devices, and more particularly to mobile phones.","Mobile phones have become ubiquitous communication devices, but they often employ naive alerting policies that can transform them into nuisances. In particular, mobile phones are typically unaware of how they are being used. Thus, they may act in a way that is disruptive of others, and\/or embarrassing to the user. While many mobile phones do support profiles that allow the user to manually set an appropriate response for different contexts, the user must still remember to switch to the correct profile when an old profile is no longer relevant, or even appropriate for future contexts. For example, a mobile device user attending a function in a quiet auditorium might forget to select the \u201csilent\/meeting\u201d mode on the device, only to be reminded of this fact when the device receives an incoming call and announces itself to the entire auditorium. Conversely, a mobile device erroneously left in a \u201cmeeting\u201d profile may lead to missed calls in a subsequent noisy outdoor context.","In addition to the current need to ameliorate the \u201cnuisance\u201d of mobile phones, there is an additional need to allow such devices to interact with users in a more intuitive fashion. This allows users to take advantage of more-sophisticated device functions with relative ease. Mobile phones that can recognize, and appropriately respond to the intuitive actions that users customarily provide would simplify operation and facilitate user acceptance.","A mobile device is provided that includes at least one sensor that provides contextual information to the device. When the mobile device receives an incoming message, or notification, the device responds thereto based at least in part upon the contextual information.","Embodiments of the present invention will be described hereafter based upon a generic mobile device. It is contemplated that such description encompasses both mobile computing devices, such as handheld computers, as well as mobile phones and combinations thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["200","200","202","204","206","208","210"]},"Memory  is implemented as a non-volatile electronic memory such as a random access memory (RAM) with a battery back-up module (not shown) such that information stored in memory  is not lost when the general power to mobile device  is shut down. A portion of memory  is preferably allocated as addressable memory for program execution, while another portion of memory  is preferably used for storage, such as to simulate storage on a disk drive.","Memory  includes an operating system , application programs , and an object store . During operation, operating system  is preferably executed by processor  from memory . Operating system , in one preferred embodiment, is a WINDOWS\u00ae CE brand operating system commercially available from Microsoft Corporation. Operating system  is preferably designed for mobile devices, and implements database features that can be utilized by applications  through a set of exposed application programming interfaces and methods. The objects in object store  are maintained by applications  and operating system  at least partially in response to calls to the exposed application programming interfaces and methods.","Communication interface  represents numerous devices and technologies that allow mobile device  to send and receive information. The devices include wired and wireless modems, satellite receivers and broadcast tuners to name a few. Mobile device  can optionally be directly connected to a computer to exchange data therewith. In such cases, communication interface  can include an infrared transceiver or a serial or parallel communication connection, all of which are capable of transmitting streaming information.","Input\/output components  include a variety of input devices that have previously been found on mobile devices such as a touch-sensitive screen, buttons, rollers, and a microphone as well as a variety of output devices including an audio generator, a vibrating device, and a display. The devices listed above are by way of example and need not all be present on mobile device .","Mobile device  also includes additional input devices in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Under one embodiment, these input devices are connected: to the mobile device through a separate serial port  and a peripheral interface controller (PIC) microprocessor . In other embodiments, these additional devices are connected to processor  through communication interface  and PIC microprocessor  or through PIC microprocessor  directly. Under one embodiment, a microchip 16C73A peripheral interface controller is used as the PIC microprocessor. In still further embodiments, PIC microprocessor  is not present and the input devices are connected to processor  through various ports such as serial port  or through communication interface .","Under the embodiment illustrated in , the additional input devices include two touch sensors  and , a forward\/back tilt sensor , a left\/right tilt sensor , proximity sensor(s)  consisting of a capacitive sensor and\/or a range sensing infrared sensor\/emitter pair, an optional temperature sensor , and a gravity switch . The sensing signals from the proximity sensor(s) , left\/right tilt sensor , forward\/back tilt sensor , and gravity switch  are provided through respective amplifiers , ,  and  to analog inputs of PIC microprocessor . These analog inputs are connected to analog-to-digital converters within PIC microprocessor . In other embodiments, the sensors provide a digital output and thus are connected to digital inputs on the microprocessor. All of sensors , , and  can be considered contextual sensors in that they sense parameters related to the environment of device .","In the embodiment of , touch sensors  and  are provided to a separate peripheral interface controller microprocessor  which converts the touch signals into digital values and provides the digital values to PIC microprocessor . In other embodiments, touch sensors  and  are connected directly to analog or digital inputs in PIC microprocessor  instead of being connected to PIC  or are connected to processor .","Under one embodiment, PIC microprocessor  continuously samples the sensors and transmits packets representing the state of these sensors at a rate of approximately  samples per second through serial port  to processor  and optionally to an appropriate external entity or notification platform through interface . In some embodiments, samples are reported at lower speeds to conserve power and processing resources. Some sensors may be reported at different sampling rates than others (e.g. tilt may be updated more frequently than touch).","Left\/right tilt sensor  and forward\/back tilt sensor  are shown as a single dotted element  in  representing a two-dimensional tilt sensor. These tilt sensors are embedded within the casing of mobile device  and in one embodiment are located at a point about which users typically pivot mobile device  when tilting the device. Note that the tilt sensor's position within the mobile device is unimportant as it senses only the angle of its physical attitude with respect to gravity. The sensor's angular position within the device is important.","Under one embodiment, an Analog Devices ADXL05 two-axis linear accelerometer is used for tilt sensors  and . The sensor also responds to linear accelerations, such as those resulting from shaking the device. Typically, the tilt sensor has a response curve both in the forward\/back direction and left\/right direction with the form:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"Angle","mo":"=","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"sin","mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"T","mo":"-","msub":{"mi":["T","c"]}},"mi":"k"}}}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"EQ","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"c ","b":"282","figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["300","300","308","302","300","302","300","302","302","300","300"]},"Device  also includes touch sensors  and , which can be identical to touch sensors ,  described above.

At block , an incoming message, typically a call, is detected. When an incoming call is detected, the mobile device determines if it is currently held, as indicated at block . In one embodiment, the detection is performed at block , using signals from the touch sensor(s) to determine if the mobile device is being touched. However, it is contemplated that detecting whether the mobile device is being held can include more sophisticated analyses, such as including tilt and\/or proximity information. If the mobile device is being held, then control passes to block , where normal, non-held notification begins.","Typically, the notification provided at block  includes full-volume audio notification, as well as visual indication. Moreover, if device  is equipped with a vibration generator, then notification at block  can include vibration as well.","At block , the mobile device determines whether the call is acknowledged by the user. When the mobile device is not held, acknowledgement is accomplished by the user simply touching the device, as registered by one or more touch sensors; or by picking up the phone, in a manner indicative of viewing the phone display, as registered by a combination of the touch sensors and the tilt sensor and\/or the gravity switch. If the call is not acknowledged, the mobile device determines if the notification has exceeded a selected Timeout, as indicated at block . If notification has not timed out, control returns to block , however, if notification has timed out, control passes to block  where the call is treated as an unanswered, and unacknowledged call on a non-held device. This treatment may include routing the call to a voice-messaging system or forwarding the call to an alternate device.","If during block , device  determines that the user acknowledged the call by touching or picking up the mobile device, then control passes to block . Because the user has acknowledged the call, the audio notification can be made less obtrusive. Thus, at step  the mobile device switches to a more non-obtrusive mode wherein the visual indication of the pending call is maintained, while the audio volume is substantially reduced. It is possible to mute the notification in this state as well, however, simply reducing volume is believed to be a better response since muting the notification can cause the user to believe that he or she has hung up on the caller by mistake, or that the caller abandoned the call. After the notification has been modified based on the acknowledgement, the mobile device determines if the user actually indicates a desire to ignore or answer the call at steps  and , respectively.","In most embodiments, the user actively ignores a call by returning the mobile device to a position or state that is less-consonant with answering the call than a position or state detected during or after acknowledgement. Thus, the user's desire to ignore a call can be determined by touch and\/or tilt sensors. For example, if the user has acknowledged the call by rotating the device to a position where the screen can be viewed, rotating the device back would indicate that the user wishes to ignore the call. Once the mobile device determines that the user wishes to ignore the call, at step , the call is processed as an unheld, acknowledged but ignored call at step . This processing can include immediately ceasing all notifications including, in some situations, visual notifications.","To determine if the user wants to actively answer a call, the mobile device can either detect that the user pressed a \u201cTalk\u201d button to accept the call, or can detect that the user is making a gesture with the mobile device that is consonant with wishing to take the call. Generally, such gesturing includes positioning device  near the user's ear at an appropriate tilt angle. Thus, device  will sense the associated touch, tilt, and proximity via sensors ,  and . Additionally, sensing a microphone signal for the user's voice, and\/or the word \u201chello,\u201d for example, will add robustness to answer detection. If device , detects a user's desire to answer, control passes to block  where the call is passed on to the user.","However, if no such desire is detected, then control passes to block , where the call is treated as acknowledged, but unanswered. This can include muting the notification without notifying the caller, and\/or routing the call directly to a voice-messaging system. This may also include displaying options on the screen for the user to choose what to do with the call (ignore\/hang up, send to voice mail, put on hold, send a short text macro as a response such as \u201cI am busy, call back later\u201d, etc.)","If the mobile device is being held when a call arrives at step , the device enters a notification mode consonant with being held (block  ). This can include the same initial notification as provided at block . However, in some embodiments where the mobile device is equipped with a vibration generator, notification at block  can be simple vibration and visual notification, since vibration is bound to get the user's attention when the mobile device is held. During notification indicated by block , block  determines if the user has acknowledged the call. Since the user's touch generated the \u201cHeld\u201d condition, touch is generally not used to sense acknowledgement when device  is held. Instead, at block , the mobile device senses tilt to determine if the user has moved the mobile device into a position consonant with viewing the device.","If the mobile device does not detect acknowledgement during block , control passes to block  where the mobile device determines whether an allotted time period for notification has expired. If the time period has not expired, the notification continues at step . If the time period has expired, the call is handled as being held but not acknowledged at step . This generally indicates that the user is holding the phone but is too busy to take the call. As a result, the call is either directed to a voice-messaging system after a period of time, or is abandoned by the caller.","If acknowledgement is detected at step , control passes to block , where any audio volume is muted and any vibration notification is preferably discontinued, since the user has acknowledged the call and further audio signals and vibration might be a nuisance. At block , however, the visual notification is preferably continued so that the user knows he or she can still answer the call if that is desired.","From block , control passes to block  and , where the mobile device determines if the user wishes to actively ignore or answer the call in a manner similar to that described above with respect to blocks  and . If the user wishes to ignore the call, control passes to block  where it is handled as a held, acknowledged, but ignored call. If the user wishes to take the call, control passes to block , but if the user does not wish to take the call, control passes to block . At block , the call is treated as acknowledged, but unanswered while the device is held and is therefore routed to a voice-messaging system or allowed to go abandoned.","Treatment of unanswered calls at blocks , , , , , and  can be identical, i.e. passing the call to a messaging system. However, since each of blocks , , , , , and  represents a different condition of the mobile device and\/or user interaction, the incoming call may be dealt with differently based upon the acquired contextual information. For example, additional information could be provided to the caller, such as, \u201cUser has acknowledged your call but cannot take it at the moment\u201d to potentially let the caller better interact with the user.","Additionally, in situations where device  is not held, further detection can be performed to determine if other contexts are applicable. For example, if device  is not held, but tilt sensor  indicates that device  is positioned upon a flat perpendicular surface, such as a table, the notification may be further adapted such that only audio and visual cues are provided, instead of also engaging a vibration generator. This feature can help ameliorate the situation where a device set on silent\/vibrate mode buzzes on the table upon receipt of an incoming call.","Together, the device and method described above use naturally occurring gestures prevalent in mobile device use, particularly mobile phones, to help ensure that the device quiets, and then mutes, as soon as is feasible, thus minimizing potential disruption to others while also being certain that notifications get through if possible.","Thus far, description of embodiments of the present invention has focussed on device  operating alone. In reality, a user may have a number of different mobile devices. For example, a single user may have a mobile phone, mobile computing device, digital pager, and\/or other suitable devices. Typically, a user will only interact with one such device at a time. Thus, if one mobile device, such as a mobile phone, has current sensor information indicative of it being held, it may communicate data based thereon to other mobile devices, or to a notification manager, such that notifications to the user that would otherwise arrive on a different mobile device, arrive on the held device. A wireless communication standard known as Bluetooth, is one example of wireless communication that facilitates such functions. It is contemplated that each mobile device that acquires contextual information via sensors can provide data indicative of the sensor signals themselves to other devices, or a notification platform. Thus, although a single mobile device may not be able to ascertain sufficient contextual information to assess a user's intention, the aggregated information from multiple such devices may indeed be sufficient.","Incorporating the sensors described above into mobile devices facilitates providing additional features for mobile phones. For example, a number of commercially available mobile phones allow voice-dialing, where the user simply says something like \u201cCall Home.\u201d The phone responds by calling the number associated with home. However, the user must generally speak a selected word, or press the Talk button to trigger this functionality. However, users generally pick the phone up before they issue voice commands. Thus, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention, when device  registers a touch, and tilt, when no calls are incoming, then device  activates the microphone to receive voice-dialing and\/or voice recognition.","Another feature of embodiments of the present invention is useful in low-light situations. Device  can optionally be provided with a light sensor. In such embodiments, when the sensor detects low light, and device  registers a touch, a backlight can turn on allowing the user to interact with device . The light can be set to time out if no interaction is registered, but can stay on if touch sensors or tilt sensors register continued interaction. optionally, an ambient light sensor can also be included in device  to sense ambient light such that a user's touch during normal levels of ambient light will not activate the display light.","Although the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
