No. 60\/373,003 entitled \u201cDETECTION OF GENUINE AND HOAX BIOLOGICAL AND NON-BIOLOGICAL CONTAMINANTS ON VARIOUS MEDIA\u201d, filed on Apr. 16, 2002, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. N00024-98-D-8124 awarded by the Department of the Navy. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to systems for handling and screening parcels to detect contamination thereof, and applications thereof.","2. Description of the Related Art","Numerous parcel handling systems have been developed and are in use. The United States Postal Service (USPS) utilizes such systems to handle the enormous quantity of parcels that are delivered each day by the USPS. A notable feature, and an inherent disadvantage, of the USPS system is that the sender of a parcel can remain anonymous.","Following the terrorist attacks of Sep. 11, 2001, the U.S. mail was utilized to propagate bioterrorist attacks upon high level governmental representatives and important members of the media. A number of similar hoax attacks have followed and continue to this day. The ability of users of the USPS to remain anonymous has thwarted law enforcement efforts to apprehend the bioterrorist(s).","The need for an apparatus and method for sanitizing parcels that may contain particles of biological contaminant, i.e. anthrax, non-biological contaminant, or other particulate matter or powders, that have the ability to become airborne, has become apparent. The overwhelming volume of parcels handled by the USPS and other entities, however, has made it impossible to sanitize every parcel delivered. Nonetheless, following the bioterrorist attacks, the USPS began a campaign of irradiating parcels sent to persons and organization that are likely terrorist targets.","Irradiation, however, is recognized as being an inadequate long-term defense. Aside from entailing an unduly long time to irradiate parcels, the double digit kilogray doses that are needed to kill anthrax spores makes paper contained within the parcels brittle and smelly, and is fatal to film, magnetic media, electronic devices and prescription drugs that are in the parcels that pass through the irradiating machines. The irradiation has also led to reports of sickness of the workers at mail processing facilities.","A further shortcoming is that irradiation simply kills the contaminant, and does nothing to identify contaminated parcels, such as envelopes and boxes. Identification of contaminated parcels is an essential threshold requirement for law enforcement to identify and apprehend the terrorists.","Other techniques that can be used to sanitize suspect parcels include the use of penetrative gamma rays or chemical sterilization, such as by use of chlorine dioxide gas. Each has its drawbacks. Use of penetrative gamma rays raises concerns of housing radioactive gamma sources such as cobalt-60, and chlorine dioxide gas requires lengthy exposure time for adequate penetration of the parcels.","The techniques and apparatus known in the art either require individual treatment of the parcels or require prolonged exposure to the sterilization method.","While known techniques can sanitize parcels, the known techniques fail to screen suspect parcels and cause an unacceptable processing delay of such parcels. Further, the known techniques fail to identify suspect parcels, as necessary to advance the efforts of authorities to apprehend the terrorists and hoax perpetrators.","The present invention provides the advantage of allowing real-time screening of parcels for detection of possible contaminants. The screening can be performed either prior to or following irradiation or other parcel sterilization processes.","The present invention can be utilized to winnow the number of parcels that must be subjected to irradiation or other sterilization means, thereby accelerating the processing of the parcels.","Further, the present invention allows for timely screening of previously irradiated parcels, wherein such additional screening is useful in detecting parcels containing contaminant residue or powder or other hoax threat.","In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus that allows for rapid screening and identification of parcels likely to contain biological or non-biological contaminants is provided comprising a jogger for shaking a plurality of parcels, an air duct for channeling an air flow over the plurality of parcels in the jogger, and a particulate sampler for analyzing the air flow to detect whether the plurality of opened parcels is likely to include contaminants.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus that allows for rapid screening and identification of parcels likely to contain biological or non-biological contaminants is provided comprising a cutter for opening each parcel, a jogger for shaking the opened parcels, an air duct for channeling an air flow obtained when the jogger shakes the parcels, and a particulate sampler connected by the air duct to the jogger, wherein the particulate sampler analyzes the air flow to detect whether the plurality of parcels is likely to include contaminants.","A method is also provided for rapid screening of parcels to identify parcels likely to contain particles of biological or non-biological contaminants, comprising the steps of shaking the parcels, creating an air flow over the parcels as the parcels are shaken, and analyzing the air flow to detect whether the parcels are likely to include contaminants.","The following detailed description of the invention will be made in reference to the accompanying drawings. In describing the invention, explanation of related functions or constructions known in the art are omitted for the sake of clearness in understanding the concept of the invention, to avoid obscuring the invention with unnecessary detail.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","110","110","120"]},"After the cutter  opens the parcel , the parcel  is loaded into a jogger , which shakes the parcel , causing release of any particles contained within or on the parcel .","An air duct  connects with the jogger  and diverts an airflow  over the shaken parcel  to a particulate sampler , which notifies the operator of the apparatus , via an indicator alarm , when the air flow  contains either a high concentration of particles or particles with suspect characteristics. The air flow  over the parcels  in the jogger  is preferably created by a particulate concentrator , which is located downstream from the particulate sampler , drawing a vacuum on air duct , and may alternatively be created by pressurizing the jogger .","Any parcels  that are in the jogger  when the indicator alarm  sounds are identified as being suspect parcels . In the event that an alarm is not received from indicator alarm , the parcels  in the jogger  are determined to be non-suspect parcels .","Suspect parcels  are isolated for more detailed confirmatory analysis, such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) analysis. This confirmatory analysis is performed separately and will not cause delay of the inline, real-time screening process and method of the present invention.","The particulate concentrator  is equipped with a screen , as shown in . The screen  is preferably constructed in manner similar to that utilized to construct a dry-type high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. The particulate concentrator  captures, i.e. collects or concentrates, aerosolized particles which are ejected from the parcel .","Each screen  is preferably provided with a unique identifier and is analyzed at periodic intervals, thereby providing a second-check of the accuracy of the screening provided by the particulate sampler . To facilitate the second-check capability of the analysis performed by the particulate sampler , parcels  which are found to be non-suspect parcels  are quarantined in groups corresponding to a specific screen  that was in place at the time the non-suspect parcels  were screened. If the periodic analysis of the screen  detects biological or non-biological contaminants during a time frame when none of the parcels  were identified as being suspect parcels , the entire quarantined group can either be re-screened or submitted for further testing.","It will be recognized by those of skill in the art that the function of the dry-type filter of screens  which are depicted for illustrative purposes in  can be performed by other types of confirmatory analysis systems, such as a liquid or solid sampler units which collect aerosolized particles, as well as by concentrator units. Also, in certain embodiments known in the art, particulate collectors units can also serve to act as concentrators. Accordingly, \u201cparticulate concentrator\u201d is used herein to mean concentrators, collectors and units that acts as both concentrators and collectors.","The particulate concentrator  is arranged to capture respirable particles, which present research indicates are generally those particles between about 0.3 and 10 microns in size.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","120","142","165","170","172","190"]},"The cutter , which is preferably integrated with the apparatus , is a conventional letter opener that is preferably adapted to operate as a corner cutter. The cutter  that is preferably included in the apparatus  of the present invention comprises a conventional cutter that has been modified to prolong blade life by reducing the length of the slice made to each parcel . Accordingly, the cutter  of the present invention slices open and removes one corner of each parcel . The cutter  includes a blade\/slicer  operationally exposed on top of the cutter . Cutter guides  are provided to allow the operator to readily position the parcel  in the cutter.","Removal of the corner of the parcel  creates a defined path for egress of any contaminants within the parcel . Further, by slicing open only the corner, rather than slicing open an entire edge of the parcel , the integrity of the original seal of the parcel  is maintained. This provides assurance to the recipient that the contents of parcels  which are of a sensitive nature have not been compromised by the screening process. Further, the unique corner cut left by the cutter  of the present invention serves as an identifiable indication that the parcel  has been screened for contaminants.","As shown in , the cutter  can be connected to a corner collector  that vacuums away corners cut from the parcels , keeping the work table  of the apparatus clear of cutting debris.","In an alternative embodiment, the cutter  is modified to punch, rather than slice or cut, an opening in parcel . Such an embodiment is preferably used to screen parcels  such as boxes.","The present invention uses a modified conventional table top paper jogger . Conventional paper joggers are utilized in mailroom and mail processing facilities to shake groups of parcels  into a uniform alignment, creating a stack of parcels aligned along a common edge. Conventional joggers include a frame  and an oscillating motor (not shown) which connects the frame  and a bin . When activated, the oscillating motor jogs, i.e. shakes and agitates, the parcels  that are loaded in the bin  of the jogger . The shaking liberates particles contained in and on the parcel .","As shown in Table 1 (percentage of amount liberated), the jogger  was successful in liberating contaminants when tested with various hoax materials and various letter preparation methods (e.g. loose folded, etc.) when the parcels  were shaken.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Hoax material 1","Hoax material 2","Hoax material 3"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["First prepara-","\u20028%","15%","17%"]},{"entry":"tion method"},{"entry":["Second pre-","13%","25%","N\/a"]},{"entry":"paration"},{"entry":"method"},{"entry":["Third prepara-","10%","16%","N\/a"]},{"entry":"tion method"},{"entry":["Partial open-","\u2014","50%","\u2014"]},{"entry":"ing created"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The jogger shown in  is a flats jogger , which is essentially a conventional jogger that has been modified to include the air duct , air inlets , and a ram .","The ram  is a further preferred feature of the present invention. The ram  compresses the parcel  that is loaded in the bin , preferably at the same time that the parcel  is being shaken by the jogger . The compressing further assists in releasing any particles contained within the parcel . The ram  is preferably pneumatically actuated via pneumatic lines from a controller (not shown).","The air duct  shown in  channels the air flow  toward the particulate sampler , which samples the particles in the air flow . The particles in the air flow  are sampled in a real-time manner to provide an essentially immediate indication of whether the parcels  in bin  are suspected of being contaminated with genuine or hoax biological or non-biological contaminants.","The particulate sampler  can utilize one or a combination of detection methods, including absolute particle count detection, particle size discriminatory detection, particle fluorescence detection and\/or particle fluorescence coupled with size detection. The particulate sampler  preferably utilizes a particle counter, such as that manufactured by Climet Instruments Company and sold under the CLiMET\u00ae trademark, to perform the detection of suspect parcels .","Initial testing indicated that certain types of parcels  produce high background particle counts. For example, post cards were found to produce a particle distribution that is highly concentrated in the 1 to 5 micron size range. Such high background and other obscurant aerosols can produce unacceptable false alarms or mask the finding of a contaminated parcel. Such high background particle counts can be overcome by physically separating and processing in separate batches certain types of parcels , e.g. postcards, known to have high background levels.","Predetermined characteristic signatures of contaminants and hoax particles can also be utilized by the particulate sampler .  depicts a process for a performing threshold detection by comparing (in step ) a total particle count (TPC) computed from the CLiMET data (step ) with an acceptable threshold (T). Alternatively, or additionally, as shown in the flowchart of , an MVG (Multivariate Gaussian) classifier can analyze the CLiMET data. In step  the size of the particles in the air flow  is computed and the features of the particles are extracted (step ). A Mahalanobis Distance (D) is then computed (step ). In step , the computed Dis compared to a previously computed Mahalanobis Distance (D) for clean, non-suspect parcels . A determination of whether the parcel  is a suspect parcel  or a non-suspect parcel  is then made.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"i":["a ","a ","b "],"b":["100","142","146","120","100","170","170","146","100"]},"Also shown on , and is a translucent hood  that protects the operator and other personnel from inadvertent contamination by contaminants released by the cutter  or the jogger(s). also shows a manifold  that is utilized to connect the apparatus  to an external air filtration system that preferably places the apparatus  under a slight negative atmospheric pressure, thereby pulling the contaminants away from the operator. Preferably, for the embodiment shown in and , each particulate concentrator  draws approximately 27 cfm (cubic feet per minute) and the manifold  draws between approximately 1,100 and 1,500 cfm.","The first class mail jogger  shown in is shown in further detail in and ","The first class mail jogger  is constructed to accommodate a plurality of similarly sized parcels , typically folded first class mail in standard size business envelops juxtaposed positioned in the bin . The ram  of the first class jogger  travels in a longitudinal direction, applying compressive force toward the port .","The flats jogger  more readily accommodates flat parcels . In contrast to the sideward stroke of the ram  of the first class mail jogger , the ram  of the flats jogger  has a front to back stroke, moving toward the rear of the apparatus .
