Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to the management of data between a plurality of electronic devices through short-range wireless communication, and more particularly, to a method and system for managing data between a plurality of electronic devices in a Near Field Communication (NFC).","2. Description of the Related Art","Portable electronic devices, such as mobile phones and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), are frequently used for communication, such as for example, Short Field communication (SFC), Near Field Communication (NFC) and communication over a telecommunication network. However, the use of portable electronic devices is not limited to communication. They can also be used for storing context information, storing personal information, aggregating information, sharing data, listening music, and watching stored videos.","For example, a user of a mobile phone can store personal information or context information in the mobile device. Context information is any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity. An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to interaction between a user and an application. Further, the context information can change dynamically based on the environment of the user.","Through the use of electronic devices the user can share data, such as personal information and\/or context information, with other electronic devices. The data can be shared between two electronic devices through a telecommunication network, a short range wireless communication network, and the like. For example, a mobile phone can share a data file with another electronic device through short range wireless communication, for example, short range radio (Bluetooth\u00ae), InfraRed light (IR) and NFC.","For sharing data using Bluetooth\u00ae or IR, a user performs several manual activities, such as selecting data to be sent, activating a communication technique (for example, activating Bluetooth), searching for an electronic device in the vicinity of the mobile phone, selecting an electronic device to which the data is to be sent, and sending the data to the selected electronic device. For the following description the term Bluetooth\u00ae will also be referred as Bluetooth (BT).","However, in NFC, which is a short-range high frequency wireless communication technology, a communication channel is established automatically as soon as two electronic devices are placed close proximity to one another. NFC enables the exchange of data between devices that are within \u02dc10 centimeters (cm). Further, NFC is a short range wireless communication technology that has evolved from a combination of contactless, identification and networking technologies and is complementary to long range technologies.","Thus, in NFC, manual intervention for sharing and exchanging data is very minimal. Hence, it is more convenient for users to share data using NFC. But currently through NFC, only transfer of static data is possible. There exists no method in NFC for exchanging context information between a plurality of electronic devices. Also, the information cannot be aggregated and changed dynamically between a plurality of electronic devices.","The present invention has been made to address at least the above problems and\/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described below. Accordingly, an aspect of the present invention provides a method and system for managing data between a plurality of electronic devices in an NFC.","According to one aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for managing data between a plurality of electronic devices in an NFC network. The method is performed at a first electronic device. A request is received from a second electronic device to send context data. The context data is then represented in accordance with a context Record Type Definition (RTD). The context RTD is used for defining context data in the NFC network. The context data that is represented in accordance with the context RTD is exchanged with the second electronic device.","According to another aspect of the present invention, an electronic device is provided. The electronic device includes a processor and a transceiver. The processor represents context data based on a context RTD. The context RTD is a record type definition used for defining context data in the NFC network. The transceiver receives a request from a second electronic device to send the context data. The transceiver further enables exchange of the context data that is represented based on the context RTD with the second electronic device.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention are described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The same or similar components may be designated by the same or similar reference numerals although they are illustrated in different drawings. Detailed descriptions of constructions or processes known in the art may be omitted to avoid obscuring the subject matter of the present invention.","It should be understood that the terms used to describe various embodiments are provided to merely aid the understanding of the description, and that their use and definitions in no way limit the scope of the invention. Terms first, second, and the like are used to differentiate between objects having the same terminology and are no where intended to represent a chronological order, as and where stated otherwise. A set is defined as a non-empty set including at least one element.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B"],"b":["110","110","102","104","110","110","102","104"]},"In an embodiment of the present invention, the electronic devices  and  are capable of communicating with each other using a telecommunication network. In another embodiment of the present invention, the electronic devices  and  are capable of communicating with each other through short-range wireless communication technology. Examples of short range wireless communication technology includes but are not limited to, short range radio (BT), IR and NFC. Hence, the electronic devices  and  are capable of communicating with each other through NFC technology.","In the environment , a user of the electronic device  exchanges context information between the electronic device  and the electronic device  through NFC. The different fields in which context data may be used are shown as use cases . In an embodiment of the present invention, the electronic devices  and  are known as NFC devices. In an embodiment of the present invention, the electronic device  takes the role of an aggregator device. The aggregator device is a device that aggregates context data received from a plurality of devices. The aggregator device dynamically arranges context data corresponding to each of the electronic devices in a memory.","In NFC, the electronic devices, for example electronic devices  and , can communicate in three application modes. The three application modes are Peer-to-Peer mode, Reader\/Writer mode, and Card Emulation mode. In the Peer-to-Peer mode of communication, both NFC devices have similar capability and there is no distinction between the NFC devices. In the Reader\/Writer mode of communication, one of the NFC devices has the capability of the Reader\/Writer and the other NFC device is a simple tag. In the Card Emulation mode of communication, one of the NFC devices is a reader and the other NFC device could be a simple tag. Hence, the information can be exchanged through any of the application modes described above.","To transfer data in the NFC network, the data is represented based on well-defined NFC data formats called RTDs. The RTDs are in turn packaged in a format called NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF). Different types of RTDs in NFC standards are for example, Smart Poster RTD, Text RTD, URI RTD, Web RTD, and the like.","In the Peer-to-Peer networks, participating users\/devices may exchange context information  with other electronic devices, as shown in . Examples of context information  include, but are not limited to, user profile, current location of the user, user preferences, room temperature, user's blood pressure, user's emotion, user's presence, user's identity, and the like. The context information can be private information associated with the users and can even vary with time and environment.","However, the set of defined RTDs are not sufficient to define CA information, which can be required by Peer-To-Peer devices and applications. Hence, a context RTD can be used for exchanging and transferring context information over the NFC interface. The structure of the context RTD is explained in conjunction with  and . For the sake of clarity and for the purpose of this description the context data is also referred as context information. Further, the electronic device  is also referred as the aggregator .","In an embodiment of the present invention, the context data from different nodes and\/or electronic devices is aggregated at a single node and the node is called the aggregator. The aggregated context data at the aggregator is represented by an extended form of Context RTD. For example, in  and , a context environment can be established by exchanging context information through easily readable tags. The aggregator device, for example, electronic device , can capture the context information from various electronic devices and aggregate them for the use of other devices.","In an embodiment of the present invention, when a user of the electronic device  enters the context environment, the context data associated with the electronic device  and the context environment are exchanged over the NFC interface. The use case  in the  shows a plurality of cases where the NFC technology can be used. Examples of NFC uses, sharing files, payment, ticketing, and the like. The context information can be exchanged through a stored NFC tags as per a NFC pre-defined format, RTD.","In  when the user of the electronic device  touches the electronic device  the context information  of the user, for example location, floor, and room information of the user, are updated in the environment and other context information is updated in the electronic device . Thereafter, the context data can be used for managing different applications using one or more short-range wireless communication networks. For example, the context information  gathered by electronic device  is used by different applications communicating over BT and a BT profile is derived for such a context transfer operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["102","102","202","204","202","102","202"]},"The transceiver  receives a request from one or more electronic devices to send context data. Hence, when the transceiver  receives the request, the processor  represents the context data in the context RTD format. Thereafter, the transceiver  exchanges the context data that is represented based on the context RTD with the one or more electronic devices. In an embodiment of the present invention, the transceiver  transmits the processed context data to other electronic devices.

The different bit fields can represent different values for representing the data. For example, the TNF can have the value 0x01 or 0x04.","The byte field  represents type length of the type field shown in byte field .

At step , the shop  sends the context information using SEND_CONTEXT_INFO_BT( ). At step , User   gets information about the shop .","Thereafter, User   will be prompted through BT profile and connectivity if he\/she crosses a stall of Bio-tech sensors related to Nano technology. Therefore, the context data can be requested and received based on the interest of User   and preferences. The context data can be received at step  and sent at step  based on the REQUEST_CONTEXT_INFO( ) primitive and RECEIVE_CONTEXT_INFO( ) primitive.
