title: Methods, kits, reagents and devices for detecting mesothelin and/or megakaryocyte potentiating factor in peritoneal fluids
abstract: Certain embodiments disclosed herein are directed to methods and kits for detecting and quantifying in patient peritoneal fluid, such as spent peritoneal dialysis buffer, peptides having amino acid sequences related to megakaryocyte potentiating factor. The methods and kits can be used to monitor the biological status of the mesothelial lining of the peritoneal cavity in a patient, to predict development of a pathology of the mesothelium in an otherwise asymptomatic patient, and/or to assess the risk and suitability of a therapeutic method. In particular, the method can be used to assess negative effects of peritoneal dialysis on the biological integrity of the peritoneum, and thus to determine the time point when peritoneal dialysis treatment should be discontinued in favor of hemodialysis in a patient with kidney dysfunction, in order to avoid the development of peritoneal hypertrophy and other progressive mesothelial disorders such as encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis.

More particularly, certain embodiments are directed to monitoring the condition of the peritoneal cavity, fluids therein, and the cellular integrity of peritoneal membranes by detecting a decrease in mesothelin, megakaryocyte potentiating factor (MPF), or both, e.g., as compared to a reference standard.","Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a common therapeutic method for the treatment of kidney failure. Patients whose kidneys have insufficient capacity to filter the blood inject dialysis solution into their peritoneal body cavity in order to clear excessive salts, uric acid and other waste substances. By osmosis across the peritoneal membrane, solutes are exchanged between the blood and the dialysis fluid. After a suitable time, the dialysis fluid is removed from the peritoneum and discarded. In this way, the blood becomes equilibrated and terminal metabolic products, such as uric acid, are prevented from indefinitely accumulating in the blood.","An alternative treatment to PD is hemodialysis (HD). It is known that PD is superior to HD in preserving the patient's residual kidney function and also is accompanied by less severe anemia than HD. As a consequence, PD has a superior survival rate during the first two years of treatment (mainly due to a lower risk of cardiovascular events). In the long term, however, PD can lead to peritoneal hypertransport, peritoneal hypertrophy, non-bacterial peritonitis and encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS). Peritoneal hypertrophy describes an inflammation-like thickening of the peritoneal mesothelium, accompanied by intense vascularization and consequentially more efficient solute exchange between the blood and dialysis solution\u2014thus hypertransport. Unfortunately, peritoneal hypertrophy often progresses to obstructive symptoms in the bowel, ranging from chronic pain and toilet difficulties to death.","In certain aspects discussed herein, the devices, reagents, methods and kits described advantageously detect a decrease in megakaryocyte potentiating factor (MPF), mesothelin (MSLN) or both to assess the condition of the peritoneal cavity of a subject, e.g., a subject undergoing treatment for kidney malfunction. The MPF and MSLN levels may be measured in a body fluid including, but not limited to, serum and peritoneal fluid, using the illustrative devices, reagents, methods and kits described herein or other suitable devices, reagents, methods and kits that will be selected by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure.","In one aspect, a method of assessing the condition of the peritoneal cavity and\/or peritoneal membrane of a subject undergoing treatment for kidney malfunction is described. In certain examples, the method comprises exposing peritoneal fluid of the subject to at least one binding agent specific for MPF to determine the level of MPF in the peritoneal fluid.","In one embodiment, the method may further comprise comparing the determined level of MPF in the peritoneal fluid to a reference standard, e.g., the level of MPF detected in the blood prior to or at the time of initiation of dialysis treatment, or detected in the peritoneal fluid at the initiation or within one, two, three months of initiating dialysis treatment for kidney malfunction in the subject. In another embodiment, the method may further comprise selecting a treatment for the subject based upon the level of MPF in the peritoneal fluid. In some examples, the treatment selected may be peritoneal dialysis. In some embodiments, if the MPF level is greater than a threshold level, e.g., the MPF level is statistically the same or greater than, for example, a certain\/defined fraction of the reference standard, the treatment selected is peritoneal dialysis. In some embodiments, if the MPF level is statistically less than the same fraction of the reference standard or decreases below the same fraction of the reference standard, the treatment selected is hemodialysis.","In certain embodiments, the binding agent is selected from a small molecule and a protein (e.g., a ligand, antibody or antigen binding fragments thereof). In some embodiments, the binding protein is an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof that binds to MPF, e.g., binds to at least 10 or at least 20 contiguous amino acids shown in SEQ ID NO.: 1 or a variant thereof.

In certain embodiments, the antibody, or antigen binding fragment thereof, binds to the same epitope as antibody 20-10. In other embodiments, the antibody, or antigen binding fragment thereof, binds to the same epitope as antibody 41-28.","In certain embodiments, the binding agent can be directly or indirectly labeled, e.g., with a detectable label. In some examples, the detectable label may be a radioactive label, a fluorescent label, a luminescent label, a paramagnetic label, or an enzyme. In some embodiments, the detectable label is directly associated with the binding agent. In other embodiments, the label may be associated with an agent that binds to the binding agent.

A non-limiting example of such an agent is an anti-idiotypic antibody.","In other embodiments, the level of MPF may be determined by contacting the MPF with a second binding agent of MPF, e.g., a second binding agent that binds to a region of MPF that is different from the first binding agent, comprising a detectable label. In an additional embodiment, the detectable label is a radioactive label, a fluorescent label, a luminescent label, a paramagnetic label, or an enzyme.

Existing assay are designed to detect an increase in MPF as an indicator of cancer or other disease states \u2014See, for example, Iwahori, K. et al. (Lung Cancer 2008, 2008 October; 62(1):45-54. Epub 2008 Apr. 3, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference). In contrast to existing methods that measure increases, it has been unexpectedly found that the decreases in the level of MPF, MSLN or both may be used to determine the suitability of a particular treatment for a disease such as malfunction of the kidney. The treatment can be peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. In some examples, a decrease in MPF or MSLN may be used to monitor the cytological integrity or general condition of the peritoneal cavity. Additional uses and indications of a decrease in MPF, MSLN or both are discussed in more detail below.","Mesothelial membranes line various body cavities, such as the peritoneal cavity, the pleural cavity, and the pericardial cavity. Peritoneal hypertrophy may be thought of as an inflammatory response to the mechanical stress exerted by an unusual amount of peritoneal fluid and the resulting loss of the mesothelium, a monolayer of cells which protectively cover the peritoneal membrane. As peritoneal hypertrophy may progress even after PD is discontinued, an early diagnostic marker is needed, which can indicate the loss of mesothelial cells before the onset of peritoneal hypertrophy and before hypertransport becomes apparent.","One known diagnostic marker which can be measured in spent dialysate to indicate the health of the mesothelial cell lining is CA125. CA125 has been observed to be present on the surface of some, but not all peritoneal mesothelial cells which detach from the peritoneum during peritoneal dialysis (Kamida at al., poster P-268, 50symposium of the Japanese Kidney Society). CA125 concentration in spent dialysate fluctuates greatly, and it has not yet proven useful in clinical practice, even though its use in combination with solute transport markers is controversially discussed in the scientific literature (see for example, Krediet, Kidney International 55: 341-356; Otsuka et al., Clin. Exp. Nephrol 9:315-319; Breborowicz et al. Nephron Clin. Pract. 100:c46-c51).","There is no diagnostic marker in clinical practice today which provides an appropriate time point for a PD patients to switch to HD treatment in order to take advantage of the benefits of PD in the early phase (namely protection of residual renal function, less severe anemia and lower risk of cardiovascular events), but avoid the long-term risks (namely bowel obstruction due to peritoneal hypertrophy and EPS).","Mesothelial cells are known to synthesize mesothelin precursor protein. The precursor protein is thought to be efficiently cleaved by a furin protease, yielding a short N-terminal fragment (31 kDa), MPF, that is secreted into the extracellular space, and a longer C-terminal fragment, mesothelin, that remains bound to the cell membrane through a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor.","Mesothelin has been observed on the cell surface of mesothelial cells, mesotheliomas, some squamous cell carcinomas, and ovarian cancers, pancreatic and lung cancers (Chang et al., 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93: 136-140; U.S. Pat. No. 6,083,502), and is under investigation as a target for therapeutic antibodies against those cancers (e.g. US clinical trial no. NCT00325494 by Morphotek, Inc.). MPF, on the contrary, has never been observed on the cell surface. Rather, MPF was first identified in the culture supernatant of a pancreatic cancer cell line, HPC-Y5 (Kojima et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270: 21984-21990; also Japanese patent No. 3490125). This report shows that only MPF, but not full length mesothelin precursor protein, was detected in the culture supernatant of COS cells transfected with full length mesothelin precursor cDNA, indicating that mesothelin precursor is not secreted from the cells but completely cleaved into MPF and mesothelin on before reaching the cell surface.","Scholler et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96: 11531-11536, also U.S. Pat. No. 6,770,445) have reported the generation of several mouse monoclonal antibodies, which could bind to the cell surface of cancer cells expressing mesothelin precursor mRNA, as well as to a recombinant mesothelin fusion protein. This recombinant protein did not incorporate the MPF (N-terminal) portion of mesothelin precursor protein, indicating that the antibodies only bound to the mature mesothelin (C-terminal) portion after proteolytic cleavage. Scholler et al. used two of those antibodies, clones OV659 and 4H3, to construct a sandwich ELISA and demonstrate the presence of Mesothelin or related peptides, which they termed SMR (for soluble mesothelin-related peptides). It is thought that SMR arise from several sources, including release from the cell surface by enzymatic cleavage of the GPI anchor (catalyzed, for example, by phospholipase C).","In contrast, MPF is believed to be cleaved off the precursor protein before the protein reaches the cell surface, because furin protease, which is thought to be responsible for cleaving off MPF from the mesothelin precursor peptide, is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and mainly located in the trans-golgi network (e.g. Nakayama, Biochem. J. 327: 625-635). It is therefore evident that mesothelin precursor protein does not normally enter the blood stream, but rather, the cleavage products, MPF and mesothelin, enter the blood stream separately, after being released from the cells by different and independent mechanisms. It is further evident that MPF and mesothelin would display different pharmacokinetics after entering the blood, as mesothelin has been demonstrated to bind to CA125, a very large glycoprotein which is found on the surface of cells of mullerian epithelial cells and also partially cleaved into the blood stream. In fact, Iwahori et al. (Lung Cancer 2008, referenced herein) measured 70 ng\/ml of MPF in the culture supernatant of NCI-H226 cells, a human lung cancer cell line known to express mesothelin precursor mRNA, and 20 ng\/ml in the supernatant of HEK 293T cells transfected with a cDNA expression vector of mesothelin precursor. The same culture supernatants only contained 4 ng\/ml and 2.8 ng\/ml of mesothelin, respectively, suggesting that approximately 80-95% of mesothelin remained bound to the cells under the culture conditions used. In contrast, Iwahori et al. found that healthy Japanese have 9.0+\/\u22122.9 ng\/ml MPF and 61.4+\/\u221221.4 ng\/ml mesothelin their serum, a finding that suggests that mesothelin may be more stable (approximately by a factor 50-100) in the blood stream than MPF. Taken together, there is ample and consistent evidence over the years indicating that mesothelin and MPF are distinct biomarkers with different mechanisms of secretion, sequestration and degradation.","Patent application WO2005072341 uses the same antibodies as Scholler et al., clones OV659 and 4H3, to demonstrate the presence of mesothelin in peritoneal fluid. The patent discusses the conceptual idea that mesothelial cancers lead to accumulation of peritoneal fluid and the accumulation of mesothelin in the fluid. Therefore, a measurement of a high concentration of mesothelin in peritoneal fluid may indicate that the cause of the accumulation of peritoneal fluid is a cancer, rather than a non-malignant cause. To demonstrate that mesothelin can be detected in peritoneal fluid, the applicants, presumably due to difficulties to find patients with an accumulation of peritoneal fluid due to natural pathological causes, instead showed that about 5-65 ng\/ml of mesothelin can be detected in spent peritoneal dialysis fluid.","Dialysis fluid is commonly used in peritoneal dialysis therapy of kidney failure. It is an artificial buffer that is injected into a person's peritoneum for a given span of time and then drained again. WO2005072341 suggests that mesothelial cells in the peritoneum can release mesothelin into peritoneal fluid. Mesothelin concentration is thus an indicator of the condition of the mesothelial cells, and an increase suggests a malignant proliferation of the mesothelial cells. Conceptually, malignant conditions may be particularly conductive to the secretion of mesothelin from the cell surface into the peritoneal fluid, because malignancies often create hypoxic areas of low pH where cells die from necrosis and proteolysis occurs.","These articles, patent publications and patents do not consider the diagnostic usefulness of reduced MPF or MSLN concentration, the use of MPF or MSLN for the diagnosis of any non-neoplastic disease, or the measurement of MPF in body fluids other than blood. While both mesothelin and MPF have attracted attention as diagnostic markers of cancers, these markers have not been considered for monitoring PD therapy, in particular for assessing the risk of future complications or for determination of the optimal time point for patients with kidney dysfunction to stop PD treatment in the favor of HD treatment. MPF has not been demonstrated to exist in detectable amounts in peritoneal or pleural fluids, such as spent peritoneal dialysis solution. In addition, decreases in MPF or MSLN from an initial level were not used in any of the applications as an indicator of a particular condition.","Certain embodiments of the methods, kits, reagents and devices disclosed herein advantageously detect MPF, MSLN or both and in particular detect decreases in MPF, MSLN or both from a reference level, which is typically a level measured or determined at the initiation of treatment. In some embodiments, the levels of MPF, MSLN or both may be used to assess health status including, for example, the health of the abdominal cavity of a subject undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Kits configured to implement the methods are also described.","Certain embodiments disclosed herein are directed to a diagnostic assay that can be performed using a sample of body fluid or peritoneal fluid. In some examples, that fluid sample may be obtained from the peritoneal cavity in order to monitor the cytological integrity of the mesothelial lining of the peritoneal cavity. By way of non-limiting example, the assay can be performed using spent peritoneal dialysis solution to assess the risk of peritoneal complications from peritoneal dialysis treatment.","In some embodiments, a non-invasive method of monitoring the cytological integrity of the mesothelium in a human patient may be performed using the methods and materials described herein. In some examples, the method comprises assessing occurrence of MSLN or MPF, or proteolytic fragments thereof, in a spent dialysis solution obtained from the patient. For example, the amount of MSLN or MPF or fragments thereof that is measured in the spent dialysis fluid, and a decrease over the time of PD therapy in the accumulation of said peptides in the spent dialysis fluid, can be used as an indication of risk that the patient may develop peritoneal hypertrophy and related complications.","In certain embodiments, MSLN or MPF, or fragments thereof, may be assessed in the patient's spent dialysis fluid by exposing the spent dialysis fluid (or centrifuged or filtered dialytic effluent) with a binding agent such as, for example, a first antibody that binds specifically with the MSLN or MPF peptide. By determining whether the MSLN or MPF peptide binds to the first antibody, the presence and level of MSLN or MPF peptide in the patient's mesothelial fluid can be assessed. For example, a first antibody may be bound to a substrate, such as a plastic multi-well plate of the type adapted for automated analysis in a robotic apparatus. Binding of the MSLN or MPF peptide and the first antibody can, for example, be assessed by contacting the first antibody with a second antibody that binds specifically with the MSLN or MPF peptide and assessing co-localization of the first and second antibodies. In some examples, as discussed further below, the second antibody can be detectably labeled, such as with a compound selected from the group consisting of an enzyme, a radionuclide, a fluorophore, and a chromophore or other detectable label. The levels of MPF, MSLN or fragments thereof may be monitored during treatment, and treatment can be discontinued or altered when the MPF or MSLN level falls below a threshold level, whereas the threshold may either be defined as an absolute level or as a decrease relative to the same patient's past MPF or MSLN level, preferably the MPF or MSLN level determined within three months of the initiation of peritoneal dialysis therapy.","In some embodiments, a method comprising contacting a plate, which includes an anti-MSLN or anti-MPF peptide \u201ccapture\u201d antibody bound thereto, with spent dialysis fluid obtained from a patient may be performed. The spent dialysis fluid can, optionally, be incubated with the plate for a period such as, for example, ten minutes, twenty minutes, thirty minutes or an hour or other selected times. The plate can then be contacted with a biotinylated second antibody that binds with an epitope of the respective MSLN or MPF peptide that is distinct from the epitope bound by the capture antibody. A streptavidin-linked enzyme can be bound to the biotinylated antibody to enable its detection in the presence of a chromogenic substrate (for example, 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), which is a chromogenic substrate of horseradish peroxidase). Of course, the second antibody could instead be fluorescently labeled, radiolabeled, or otherwise detectably labeled as discussed in more detail below.","In another embodiment, a method of monitoring the cytological integrity of the mesothelium is provided. In some examples, the method comprises exposing a first antibody with a labeled ligand thereto and contacting the first antibody with the mesothelial fluid. By comparing the amount of labeled ligand that binds with the first antibody that has been contacted with the mesothelial fluid with the amount of labeled ligand that binds with an equivalent amount of the first antibody that has not been contacted with the mesothelial fluid, it is possible to assess how much of MSLN or MPF from the mesothelial fluid has bound with the first antibody.","In certain embodiments of the assays and kits disclosed herein, it is desired, but not necessarily required, that the amino acid sequence of the MPF or MSLN peptide comprises at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180 or 200 consecutive residues of SEQ ID NO. 1 or SEQ ID NO. 2, or the known variants listed in Swiss-Prot accession number Q13421. Alternatively, the MPF or MSLN peptide can comprise a portion of at least 20 consecutive amino acid residues, wherein the amino acid sequence of the portion is at least 90% (or 95%) identical to 20 consecutive residues of SEQ ID NO. 1 (for MPF) or SEQ ID NO. 2 (for MSLN), or the known variants listed in Swiss-Prot accession number Q13421.","In certain examples, the kits, devices and methods disclosed herein can be used in conjunction with known or hereafter developed kits and methods for assessing the status of the peritoneal cavity (be it for example from spent dialysis fluid, serum, or with imaging techniques such as ultrasound), for example, with indicators of inflammatory and proliferatory processes, indicators of solute transport between blood and dialysate, indicators of proper hemostasis in the patients, and additional indicators of cellular integrity or damage of the peritoneum. Assessment of occurrence of MSLN or MPF, or fragments thereof, in a patient's peritoneal fluid can likewise be performed in conjunction with assessment of MSLN or MPF, or fragments thereof, in the patient's serum.","Substantially the same kits and methods can be used to characterize the peritoneal pathology of a symptomatic patient, such as a patient with symptoms of bacterial or non-bacterial peritonitis or encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS). Substantially the same kits and methods can also be used to monitor the effect of any given dialysis buffer has on the cellular integrity of the peritoneal mesothelium in vivo or in vitro, for example in order to assess the biocompatibility of a novel dialysis buffer. A rapid change, particularly a decrease, in the accumulation of MSLN or MPF, or fragments thereof, in the dialysis buffer, can prove an indication that the dialysis buffer is not well tolerated by a patient, while a slower change in accumulation of MSLN of MPF, or fragments thereof, in the dialysis buffer can provide an indication of a buffer which causes less risk of peritoneal complications. Such kits, devices and methods can therefore be used to assess the therapeutic value and safety of new agents added to peritoneal dialysis solutions.","These and other embodiments, features, aspect and examples are described in more detail below with reference to the following definitions","Megakaryocyte Potentiating Factor (\u201cMPF\u201d) refers to a polypeptide having a molecular weight of about 31 kDa and including an amino acid sequence that either (i) comprises at least 10 consecutive residues of SEQ ID NO: 1 or (ii) comprises a portion of at least 20 consecutive amino acid residues wherein the amino acid sequence of the portion is at least 90% (preferably at least 95% or 100%) identical to 20 consecutive residues of SEQ ID NO: 1 as shown in , or the known variants thereof listed in Swiss-Prot accession number Q13421.

The mesothelin may include a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and several N-linked sugar chains as post-translational modifications. The GPI anchor binds Mesothelin to the cell membrane but can be cleaved by a phospholipase to provide a soluble form of mesothelin.","MPF\/Mesothelin precursor is about a 70 kDa protein that after cleavage by a furin protease provides MPF and MSLN.","The term \u201cbody fluid,\u201d as used herein is intended to include body fluids that may be extracted, isolated or sampled including fluids naturally occurring in the body (for example, blood, lymph, urine, etc.). Body fluid is also intended to include an artificial solution of fluid that has been equilibrated with the blood (or otherwise mixed with a naturally occurring body fluid) and thus taken up considerable fluid and solutes from the body. For example, in certain embodiments peritoneal fluid may be considered a body fluid. Peritoneal fluid is, for example, fluid found in the peritoneal cavity of an individual, often due to insertion of peritoneal dialysis buffer into the peritoneal cavity.","The term \u201ckidney malfunction\u201d is intended to include kidney disorders, kidney disease, kidney dysfunction, kidney cancer, absence of at least one kidney due to accidents, surgical removal or genetic disorders, or other conditions wherein one or both of the kidneys are not properly functioning.","The term \u201cantibody\u201d refers to a protein that includes at least one immunoglobulin variable domain or immunoglobulin variable domain sequence. For example, an antibody can include a heavy (H) chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH), and a light (L) chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL). In another example, an antibody includes two heavy (H) chain variable regions and two light (L) chain variable regions. The term \u201cantibody\u201d encompasses antigen-binding fragments of antibodies (e.g., single chain antibodies, Fab and sFab fragments, F(ab\u2032), Fd fragments, Fv fragments, scFv, and domain antibodies (dAb) fragments (de Wildt et al., Eur J. Immunol. 1996; 26(3):629-39.)) as well as complete antibodies. An antibody can have the structural features of IgA, IgG, IgE, IgD, IgM (as well as subtypes thereof). Antibodies may be from any source, but primate (human and non-human primate) and primatized are preferred. Either or both of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies can be used in the assays and kits described herein.","The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed \u201ccomplementarity determining regions\u201d (\u201cCDR\u201d), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed \u201cframework regions\u201d (\u201cFR\u201d). The extent of the framework region and CDRs has been precisely defined (see, Kabat, E. A., et al (1991) , U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242, and Chothia, C. et al. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917, see also www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk). Kabat definitions are used herein. Each VH and VL is typically composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4.","As used herein, an \u201cimmunoglobulin variable domain sequence\u201d refers to an amino acid sequence which can form the structure of an immunoglobulin variable domain such that one or more CDR regions are positioned in a conformation suitable for an antigen binding site. For example, the sequence may include all or part of the amino acid sequence of a naturally-occurring variable domain. For example, the sequence may omit one, two or more N- or C-terminal amino acids, internal amino acids, may include one or more insertions or additional terminal amino acids, or may include other alterations. In one embodiment, a polypeptide that includes immunoglobulin variable domain sequence can associate with another immunoglobulin variable domain sequence to form an antigen binding site, e.g., a structure that preferentially interacts with an MPF or MSLN protein, for example, MPF or MSLN in peritoneal fluid.","The VH or VL chain of the antibody can further include all or part of a heavy or light chain constant region, to thereby form a heavy or light immunoglobulin chain, respectively. In one embodiment, the antibody is a tetramer of two heavy immunoglobulin chains and two light immunoglobulin chains, wherein the heavy and light immunoglobulin chains are inter-connected by, for example, disulfide bonds. In IgGs, the heavy chain constant region includes three immunoglobulin domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. The light chain constant region includes a CL domain. The variable region of the heavy and light chains contains a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies typically mediate the binding of the antibody to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement system. The light chains of the immunoglobulin may be of types kappa or lambda. In one embodiment, the antibody is glycosylated. An antibody can be functional for antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and\/or complement-mediated cytotoxicity.","One or more regions of an antibody can be human or effectively human. For example, one or more of the variable regions can be human or effectively human. For example, one or more of the CDRs can be human, for example, HC CDR1, HC CDR2, HC CDR3, LC CDR1, LC CDR2, and LC CDR3. Each of the light chain CDRs can be human. HC CDR3 can be human. One or more of the framework regions can be human, e.g., FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4 of the HC or LC. For example, the Fc region can be human. In one embodiment, all the framework regions are human, for example, derived from a human somatic cell (for example, a hematopoietic cell that produces immunoglobulins or a non-hematopoietic cell). In one embodiment, the human sequences are germline sequences, for example, encoded by a germline nucleic acid. In one embodiment, the framework (FR) residues of a selected antibody can be converted to the amino-acid type of the corresponding residue in the most similar primate germline gene, especially the human germline gene. One or more of the constant regions can be human or effectively human. For example, at least 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or 100% of an immunoglobulin variable domain, the constant region, the constant domains (CH1, CH2, CH3, CL1), or the entire antibody can be human or effectively human.","All or part of an antibody can be encoded by an immunoglobulin gene or a segment thereof. Exemplary human immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha (IgA1 and IgA2), gamma (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as the many immunoglobulin variable region genes. Full-length immunoglobulin \u201clight chains\u201d (about 25 KDa or about 214 amino acids) are encoded by a variable region gene at the NH2-terminus (about 110 amino acids) and a kappa or lambda constant region gene at the COOH-terminus. Full-length immunoglobulin \u201cheavy chains\u201d (about 50 KDa or about 446 amino acids) are similarly encoded by a variable region gene (about 116 amino acids) and one of the other aforementioned constant region genes, for example, gamma (encoding about 330 amino acids). The length of human HC varies considerably because HC CDR3 varies from about 3 amino-acid residues to over 35 amino-acid residues.","The term \u201cantigen-binding fragment\u201d of a full length antibody refers to one or more fragments of a full-length antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to a target of interest. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term \u201cantigen-binding fragment\u201d of a full length antibody include, but are not limited to, (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) a F(ab\u2032)fragment, a bivalent fragment including two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) 341:544-546), which consists of a VH domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR) that retains functionality. Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules known as single chain Fv (scFv). See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,260,203, 4,946,778, and 4,881,175; Bird et al. (1988) 242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) 85:5879-5883.","Antibody fragments can be obtained using any appropriate technique including conventional techniques known to those with skill in the art. The term \u201cmonospecific antibody\u201d refers to an antibody that displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular target, for example, an epitope. This term includes a \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d or \u201cmonoclonal antibody composition,\u201d which as used herein refer to a preparation of antibodies or fragments thereof of single molecular composition, irrespective of how the antibody was generated.","An \u201ceffectively human\u201d immunoglobulin variable region is an immunoglobulin variable region that includes a sufficient number of human framework amino acid positions such that the immunoglobulin variable region does not elicit an immunogenic response in a normal human. An \u201ceffectively human\u201d antibody is an antibody that includes a sufficient number of human amino acid positions such that the antibody does not elicit an immunogenic response in a normal human.","A \u201chumanized\u201d immunoglobulin variable region is an immunoglobulin variable region that is modified to include a sufficient number of human framework amino acid positions such that the immunoglobulin variable region does not elicit an immunogenic response in a normal human. Descriptions of \u201chumanized\u201d immunoglobulins can be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,407,213 and 5,693,762.","As used herein, \u201cbinding affinity\u201d refers to the apparent association constant or K. The Kis the reciprocal of the dissociation constant (K). A binding protein may, for example, have a binding affinity of at least 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10and 10Mfor a particular target molecule, for example, MPF, mesothelin, or fragments thereof. Higher affinity binding of a binding protein to a first target relative to a second target can be indicated by a higher K(or a smaller numerical value K) for binding the first target than the K(or numerical value K) for binding the second target. In such cases, the binding protein has specificity for the first target (for example, a protein in a first conformation or mimic thereof) relative to the second target (for example, the same protein in a second conformation or mimic thereof; or a second protein). Differences in binding affinity (for example, for specificity or other comparisons) can be at least 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 37.5, 50, 70, 80, 91, 100, 500, 1000, or 10fold.","Binding affinity can be determined by a variety of methods including equilibrium dialysis, equilibrium binding, gel filtration, ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, or spectroscopy (for example, using a fluorescence assay, electron spin resonance or nuclear magnetic resonance). Exemplary conditions for evaluating binding affinity are in TRIS-buffer (50 mM TRIS, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaClat pH 7.5). These techniques can be used to measure the concentration of bound and free binding protein as a function of binding protein (or target) concentration. The concentration of bound binding protein ([Bound]) is related to the concentration of free binding protein ([Free]) and the concentration of binding sites for the binding protein on the target where (N) is the number of binding sites per target molecule by the following equation:\n\n[Bound]=\u00b7[Free]\/((1)+[Free]).\n\nIt is not always necessary to make an exact determination of K, though, since sometimes it is sufficient to obtain a quantitative measurement of affinity, for example, determined using a method such as ELISA or FACS analysis, is proportional to K, and thus can be used for comparisons, such as determining whether a higher affinity is, e.g., 2-fold higher, to obtain a qualitative measurement of affinity, or to obtain an inference of affinity, for example, by activity in a functional assay (for example, an in vitro or in vivo assay).\n","An \u201cisolated composition\u201d refers to a composition that is removed from at least 90% of at least one component of a natural sample from which the isolated composition can be obtained. Compositions produced artificially or naturally can be \u201ccompositions of at least\u201d a certain degree of purity if the species or population of species of interests is at least 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 80, 90, 92, 95, 98, or 99% pure on a weight-weight basis.","An \u201cepitope\u201d refers to the site on a target compound that is bound by a binding protein (for example, an antibody such as a Fab or full length antibody). In the case where the target compound is a protein, the site can be entirely composed of amino acid components, entirely composed of chemical modifications of amino acids of the protein (e.g., glycosyl moieties), or composed of combinations thereof. Overlapping epitopes include at least one common amino acid residue, glycosyl group, phosphate group, sulfate group, or other molecular feature.","Calculations of \u201chomology\u201d or \u201csequence identity\u201d between two sequences (the terms are used interchangeably herein) may be performed as follows. The sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (for example, gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). The optimal alignment is determined, for example, as the best score using the GAP program in the GCG software package with a Blossum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid \u201cidentity\u201d is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid \u201chomology\u201d). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences.","In a preferred embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% of the length of the reference sequence. For example, the reference sequence may be the length of the immunoglobulin variable domain sequence.","As used herein, the term \u201csubstantially identical\u201d (or \u201csubstantially homologous\u201d) is used herein to refer to a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence that contains a sufficient number of identical or equivalent (e.g., with a similar side chain, e.g., conserved amino acid substitutions) amino acid residues or nucleotides to a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence such that the first and second amino acid or nucleic acid sequences have (or encode proteins having) similar activities, e.g., a binding activity, a binding preference, or a biological activity. In the case of antibodies, the second antibody has the same specificity and has at least 50%, at least 25%, or at least 10% of the affinity relative to the same antigen.","Sequences similar or homologous (for example, at least about 85% sequence identity) to the sequences disclosed herein are also part of this application. In some embodiments, the sequence identity can be about 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or higher. In addition, substantial identity exists when the nucleic acid segments hybridize under selective hybridization conditions (for example, highly stringent hybridization conditions), to the complement of the strand. The nucleic acids may be present in whole cells, in a cell lysate, or in a partially purified or substantially pure form.","Clone 41-28 refers to the mouse monoclonal antibody clone 41-28, of isotype IgG1 kappa, specific to MPF, as reported by Iwahori et al., Lung Cancer 2008; the CDR's for Clone 41-28 are shown in .

Examples of indirect labeling include detection of a primary antibody using a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody and end-labeling of a peptide with biotin such that it can be detected with fluorescently labeled streptavidin.","An \u201cinstructional material\u201d is a publication, a recording, a diagram, or any other medium of expression which can be used to communicate how to use a kit described herein, information for interpreting occurrence of MPF or Mesothelin in spent peritoneal dialysis fluid as it relates to the cytological status, pathological state, or both, the peritoneal cavity, or relates to the risk of complications from continued peritoneal dialysis treatment, or recommendations of a change of therapy. The instructional material of the kit can, for example, be affixed to a container which contains a kit or be shipped together with a container which contains the kit. Alternatively, the instructional material can be shipped or made available separately from the container with the intention that the instructional material and the kit be used cooperatively by the recipient.","The terms \u201cdialysis fluid\u201d or \u201cdialysis buffer\u201d or \u201cdialysis solution\u201d synonymously refer to an aqueous solution that is commonly inserted into a patient's peritoneal cavity, usually through a surgically inserted access tubing, in order to equilibrate and detoxify the blood after chronic kidney failure. \u201cSpent\u201d dialysis solution refers to the dialysis solution which a patient has drained out of his peritoneal cavity a suitable amount of time (usually several hours) after inserting it. Therefore, spent dialysis solution contains many solutes from the patient's blood stream and peritoneal cavity, including the uremic toxins that the patient's failed kidneys failed to remove, and the concentration of those solutes can be measured to make a diagnostic judgment with respect to the therapeutic status of the patient.","An MPF or MSLN binding protein may have mutations (for example, at least one, two, or four, and\/or less than 15, 10, 5, or 3) relative to a binding protein described herein (for example, conservative or non-essential amino acid substitutions), which do not have a substantial effect on protein function. Whether or not a particular substitution will be tolerated, for example, will not adversely affect biological properties, such as binding activity can be predicted (for example, by evaluating whether the mutation is conservative or by the method of Bowie, et al. (1990) Science 247:1306-1310.)","A \u201cconservative amino acid substitution\u201d is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (for example, lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (for example, aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (for example, glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (for example, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (for example, threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (for example, tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). It is possible for many framework and CDR amino acid residues to include one or more conservative substitutions.","Motif sequences for proteins can include positions which can be varied amino acids. For example, the symbol \u201cX\u201d in such a context generally refers to any amino acid (e.g., any of the twenty natural amino acids or any of the nineteen non-cysteine amino acids). Other allowed amino acids can also be indicated for example, using parentheses and slashes. For example, \u201c(A\/W\/F\/N\/Q)\u201d means that alanine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, asparagine, and glutamine are allowed at that particular position.","A \u201cnon-essential\u201d amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered from the wild-type sequence of the binding agent, for example, the antibody, without abolishing or more preferably, without substantially altering a biological activity, whereas changing an \u201cessential\u201d amino acid residue results in a substantial loss of activity.","Statistical significance can be determined by many different methods commonly used to assess deviations and variations in data points. Illustrative statistical tests include, but are not limited to: the Students T-test, Mann Whitney U non-parametric test, and Wilcoxon non-parametric statistical test. Some statistically significant relationships have a P value of less than 0.05 or 0.02. Particular binding proteins may show a difference, for example, in specificity or binding, that are statistically significant (e.g., P value<0.05 or 0.02). The terms \u201cinduce\u201d, \u201cinhibit\u201d, \u201cpotentiate\u201d, \u201celevate\u201d, \u201cincrease\u201d, \u201cdecrease\u201d or the like, for example, which denote distinguishable qualitative or quantitative differences between two states, and may refer to a difference, for example, a statistically significant difference, between the two states, for example, a decrease in MPF or MSLN from an initial level to a current level.","Certain embodiments of the technology described herein are directed to the monitoring of MSLN and\/or MPF levels to assess health status and\/or health risk. For example, MSLN and MPF show a gradual decline in their ability to accumulate in peritoneal dialysis fluid of peritoneal dialysis patients. A declining accumulation of these biomarkers correlates with physiological changes in the peritoneal membrane, which can lead to treatment complications that indicate the discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis treatment, and may also lead to serious complications such as peritoneal sclerosis, bowel obstruction, chronic pain and death. As discussed herein, a low accumulation of each of these biomarkers in peritoneal dialysis fluid is a statistically significant predictor of the need to discontinue peritoneal dialysis.","A decrease in concentration or occurrence of MPF or MSLN can provide an indication of deterioration of the cytological integrity of the mesothelial membrane lining the peritoneal cavity, both chronically and during acute insults, such as bacterial peritonitis. The amount of MPF and MSLN rebounds after effective treatment of such pathological conditions. Thus, the accumulation of MPF or mesothelin in peritoneal dialysis fluid can also be used to monitor the recovery of the peritoneum after an acute disease or chronic peritoneal dialysis treatment, as well as to assess the biocompatibility of novel dialysis solutions, or to assess the therapeutic effectiveness of therapeutic agents added to a patient's dialysis solution or otherwise administered to a patient in order to protect or improve the health and integrity of the peritoneal membrane, or delay the occurrence of complications from peritoneal dialysis therapy.","MPF was first identified in the culture supernatant of a human pancreatic tumor cell line, HPC-Y5, which enhanced the colony formation of megakaryocytes in an in vitro culture system of mouse bone marrow cells (Yamaguchi N, Hattori K, Oh-eda M, Kojima T, Imai N, Ochi N. A novel cytokine exhibiting megakaryocyte potentiating activity from a human pancreatic tumor cell line HPC-Y5. J. Biol. Chem. 269(2):805-8 (1994)). Cloning of the cDNA led to the discovery of the full coding sequence of the mesothelin precursor peptide, which comprises of the sequence for mesothelin and MPF, separated by a furin protease cleavage site (Kojima T, Oh-eda M, Hattori K, Taniguchi Y, Tamura M, Ochi N, Yamaguchi N., Molecular cloning and expression of megakaryocyte potentiating factor cDNA. J. Biol. Chem. 270(37):21984-90 (1995))). Mesothelin was subsequently identified to be the cognate antigen for the CAK1 antibody, an antibody known to bind to ovarian cancer cells, and named for its expression in the mesothelial cells lining the peritoneal, pleural and cardiac body cavities (Chang K, Pastan I. Molecular cloning of mesothelin, a differentiation antigen present on mesothelium, mesotheliomas, and ovarian cancers. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 93(1):136-40 (1996)). Various researchers subsequently demonstrated that mesothelin as well as MPF can be detected in human serum and are elevated in various cancers of mesothelium-related origin, such as ovarian carcinoma and certain lung cancers. Fujirebio Diagnostics has commercialized a blood test, Mesomark\u00ae, which is used for the diagnosis of mesothelioma by measuring mesothelin. http:\/\/www.fdi.com\/mesomark\/world\/home.html","While an increase in mesothelin or MPF in a patient is well known to be of diagnostic value for the diagnosis of cancer, embodiments described herein advantageously monitor a decrease in the levels of MSLN or MPF, as compared to an initial level, and correlate the decrease with a deterioration of peritoneal heath during peritoneal dialysis.","The risk of serious complications, such as an inflammatory thickening of the peritoneum leading to obstruction of bowels and other organs, increases with the duration of peritoneal dialysis. Rarely, patients can carry on peritoneal dialysis treatment for much over ten years. Yet, in the first two years, peritoneal dialysis has a lower risk of cardiovascular events and death than hemodialysis. As demonstrated herein, MSLN and MPF accumulation in the peritoneal dialysis solution shows a significant decrease over the years of the therapy () and showed a clear decrease over a three month span in most of the patients observed (). Importantly, in patients on peritoneal dialysis for 5 years or longer, the decrease in both mesothelin and MPF concentrations in spent dialysis solution were predictive with respect to the treatment, as patients who had to discontinue peritoneal dialysis had a statistically lower concentration of both mesothelin and MPF in their spent dialysis fluid (). In addition, a severe decrease of mesothelin and MPF levels was detected during acute peritonitis (contraction of a bacterial infection of the peritoneum), often to undetectable levels during the acute phase of the infection (). These results are consistent with mesothelin and MPF being biological indicators of the health of the peritoneal membrane, which is known to be sensitive to the physicochemical wear of the dialysis solution. It is known that mesothelial cells can be detached and be washed out by peritoneal dialysis treatment (see for example, Kamida et al., poster P-268, 5symposium of the Japanese Kidney Society), and gradually become replaced by fibroblasts over time during peritoneal dialysis. The decreased accumulation of Mesothelin and MPF in the peritoneal solution is a convenient indicator of this fibrotic process, which leads to dangerous inflammatory complications.","Furthermore, Mesothelin and MPF are not known to be expressed in any non-cancerous cells other than mesothelial cells. As the peritoneum is the largest mesothelium in the body, with the pleura and pericardium being minor additional sources, it is obvious that a person's serum concentration of MSLN or MPF, particularly a decrease of such concentration, is also a biological indicator of the deterioration of peritoneal health during dialysis. This is particularly noteworthy because spent dialysis solution is not available prior to the initiation of peritoneal dialysis treatment. Therefore, serum MSLN or MPF is useful in determining a patient's individual baseline to which later measurements of spent dialysate or serum Mesothelin or MPF can be compared so that the patient's individual decrease can be determined. In addition, serum Mesothelin or MPF may be useful indicators to determine prior to treatment how well a patient may tolerate peritoneal dialysis treatment, and thus give helpful guidance in the choice of therapy.","Furthermore, MSLN or MPF produced in the pleura and pericardium can enter the blood stream, and from there be secreted into the peritoneal cavity together with other serum proteins, and mask a decreased peritoneal production of MSLN and MPF. The amount of serum-derived versus peritoneal derived MSLN or MPF can be assessed by assessing the accumulation of MSLN or MPF in the peritoneal fluid in comparison to the accumulation of total protein, or certain serum proteins of comparable size and property, for example, albumin, beta-trace protein or cystatin C, or creatinine.","MPF and MSLN Level Measurement and Uses","In accordance with certain embodiments, methods to assess the level of MSLN or MPF in a body fluid are provided. In some examples, the methods may be used to diagnose the cytological status and biological integrity of the peritoneal cavity in a patient. In other embodiments, the methods may be used to determine a decrease in the MPF or MSLN level, as compared to an initial level, in a body fluid such as, for example, serum, spent dialysis fluid or the like.","In certain embodiments, the methods may comprise assessing occurrence of MPF or mesothelin in spent peritoneal dialysis solution obtained from a mammalian subject, for example, a human individual with kidney malfunction. A decrease in MPF or mesothelin levels can be used as an indication of a deterioration of the cytological status and biological integrity of the peritoneal lining and therefore an increased risk of treatment complications. After a decrease in the levels by a specific percentage, the peritoneal dialysis treatment may be discontinued and hemodialysis may be initiated. Periodically, the level of MPF or mesothelin in peritoneal fluid may be assessed to determine whether it is safe to resume peritoneal dialysis.","In certain examples, it may be desirable to determine an initial level of MPF or MSLN in a body fluid. Such initial level may be obtained at any point post-gestation including immediately after birth, 1 day from birth, 1 week from birth, 1 month from birth, 1 year from birth, 10 years from birth, 25 years from birth, 50 years from birth, 75 years from birth, 100 years from birth or any time in between. In some examples, it is desirable to determine an initial level of MPF or MSLN in peritoneal fluid as soon as possible after peritoneal dialysis has commenced. Such initial level may be used and compared with subsequent levels to assess whether or not the MPF or MSLN has decreased to the point where it would be advisable to discontinue peritoneal dialysis.","The exact initial level may vary from subject to subject and therefore, in certain embodiments, the change in the MPF or MSLN, rather than the absolute amount present, may be used to assess health status. In some examples, peritoneal dialysis may be discontinued when the MPF level decreases by at least 40%, more particularly decreases by about 80%, as compared to an initial level. In certain examples, a threshold level change may be used to assess whether or not peritoneal dialysis should be continued. In some examples, when the threshold level change is one-half, one-third or one-quarter, one-fifth, one-tenth or one-twentieth of an initial level then peritoneal dialysis may be discontinued. If the actual level shows a sub-threshold level change (such that the level remains above the threshold and thus the decrease compared to an initial value is relatively small), then peritoneal dialysis may be continued. If the actual level shows more than threshold level change (such that the level drops below the threshold and thus the decrease compared to an initial value is relatively large), then peritoneal dialysis may be discontinued and hemodialysis may be initiated.","In embodiments in which an antibody, for example, an anti-mesothelin or anti-MPF peptide antibody, is contacted with spent peritoneal dialysis solution obtained from a patient, the spent peritoneal dialysis solution can be used in its naturally expressed state or it can be partially purified or clarified or filtered or concentrated prior to use. For example, spent peritoneal dialysis solution can be centrifuged using standard methods to substantially remove any sediment therefrom prior to contacting the mesothelial fluid with the antibody. Alternatively, the spent peritoneal dialysis solution can be filtered or ultrafiltered to reduce its volume or to remove large contaminants. Because mesothelin and MPF peptides that occur in spent peritoneal dialysis solution can be expected to be glycosylated polypeptides having molecular weights in the range 10,000-50,000 Daltons, selection of an appropriate filtration\/ultrafiltration is desirable to prevent loss of the mesothelin or MPF peptide prior to its detection. By way of example, a relatively large pore filter, for example, one that permits passage of globular particles having molecular weights of 250,000 to 1 million Daltons can be used to remove particulate material from spent peritoneal dialysis solution, and an ultrafiltration device equipped with a membrane that excludes passage of proteins having molecular weights greater than about 5,000 Daltons can be used to concentrate the filtrate. In this example, occurrence of mesothelin or MPF can be assessed in the retentate in the ultrafiltration device.","Because many of the methods (for example, the immunological methods) described herein are relatively sensitive, concentration of spent peritoneal dialysis solution is usually not necessary to detect occurrence of MPF or mesothelin peptides in spent peritoneal dialysis solution of patients. Instead, spent peritoneal dialysis solution may be diluted with a suitable dilution buffer in order to obtain an optimal quantitative readout in the concentration range of interest. In situations in which clarification of spent peritoneal dialysis solution is desired, centrifugation can be preferable, since the potential that mesothelin or MPF peptides present in the spent peritoneal dialysis solution will become bound with or enmeshed within the filter medium is not present.","In certain embodiments, many different methods may be used to assess the level of MPF or mesothelin in the patient's spent dialysis solution. In particular, any method that can be used to assess whether one of the respective peptides is present or absent is suitable. In one embodiment, the level of MPF or mesothelin peptide in the patient's peritoneal fluid may be assessed by exposing the peritoneal fluid to an antibody that binds specifically with the MPF or mesothelin peptide. Such exposing may be accomplished by adding a selected amount of an antibody to the peritoneal fluid. In some examples, a second antibody that binds may be added to the peritoneal fluid to assess whether the MPF or mesothelin peptide has bound with the first antibody. The two antibodies preferably do not compete for binding to the same epitope, but rather bind to the same antigen in a non-competitive manner.","One preferred method for assessing occurrence of MSLN or MPF in the spent peritoneal dialysis solution or other body fluids of a patient is the procedure commonly known as a \u201csandwich ELISA\u201d assay. (ELISA is an abbreviation for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). In this technique an antibody is bound to a substrate, such as a glass bead or the bottom surface of a plastic multi-well assay plate. This antibody is designated a \u2018capture\u2019 antibody. Raw, clarified, or purified spent peritoneal dialysis solution from the patient or a sample of the respective body fluid can be contacted with the substrate under conditions (for example, low concentrations of salt and detergents and non-protein-denaturing conditions), so that any mesothelin or MPF peptide present in the spent peritoneal dialysis solution or body fluid sample can bind specifically with the capture antibody. The substrate is optionally rinsed with a fluid that does not comprise the capture antibody or the mesothelin or MPF peptide to remove residual spent peritoneal dialysis solution or body fluid. The substrate can then be contacted with a second antibody that specifically binds with the mesothelin or MPF peptide at an epitope independent of the epitope at which the capture antibody binds. The second antibody is either detectably labeled or linked with either a ligand or a receptor of the ligand. Either way, binding of the second antibody is detected (and, optionally, quantitated) after rinsing the substrate with a fluid that does not comprise the second antibody. Detection of the second antibody is indicative of the presence in the spent peritoneal dialysis solution or body fluid of respective MPF or MSLN peptides. If the amount of the second antibody is quantitated, then the amount of the MPF or mesothelin peptides in the spent peritoneal dialysis solution or body fluid can be quantitated, for example, by comparison of the amount of second antibody detected with measurements made using control samples or standards containing known amounts of MPF or MSLN.","In other embodiments, a competition assay may be used to assess the presence and\/or level or MSLN or MPF in spent peritoneal dialysis solution or in a body fluid. In one embodiment of this assay, an antibody that binds specifically with the mesothelin or MPF peptide can be fixed to a substrate. Raw, clarified, purified or diluted spent peritoneal dialysis solution or body fluid is contacted with the substrate (preferably for a period of minutes or hours), so that any mesothelin or MPF peptides present in the spent peritoneal dialysis solution or body fluid bind with the antibody. A labeled ligand (for example, a labeled version of an MPF or mesothelin peptide) that binds specifically with the antibody is then contacted with the substrate (preferably for a period of minutes or hours). The amount of labeled ligand bound with the substrate is assessed after rinsing the substrate with a fluid that does not comprise the label or the labeled ligand. The amount of label bound with the substrate is compared with the amount of label bound with an otherwise identically treated substrate that is not contacted with the patient's spent peritoneal dialysis solution or body fluid. The difference between the two amounts of bound label represents the amount of MPF or mesothelin peptide bound to the substrate, and is indicative of the amount of MPF or mesothelin peptides that were present in the spent peritoneal dialysis solution or body fluid sample applied to the substrate.","When an immunological competition assay is used, the labeled ligand of the antibody bound with the substrate is desirably as nearly identical to the MPF or mesothelin peptide known or expected to be present in the patient's body fluid or spent peritoneal dialysis solution as possible. For example, the ligand and the MPF or mesothelin peptide should have or comprise the same amino acid sequence in the region bound by the antibody. Similarly, if the MPF or mesothelin peptide that may occur in the patient's spent peritoneal dialysis solution or body fluid is expected to be glycosylated (or modified in some other manner), then the ligand may be glycosylated in the same way, at the same position, and\/or to the same extent. In this way, affinity differences of the antibody for the ligand and for the MPF or mesothelin analyte can be minimized and the accuracy of the competition assay can be improved.","In certain examples, a homogeneous assay may be used to assess the presence and level of MSLN or MPF in a body fluid. In a homogenous assay, after all components of the assay are added, additional fluid manipulations are not required. For example, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) can be used as a homogenous assay (see, for example, Lakowicz et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,169; Stavrianopoulos, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,868,103). A fluorophore label on a first molecule (a donor) is selected such that its emitted fluorescent energy can be absorbed by a fluorescent label on a second molecule (an acceptor) if the second molecule is in proximity to the first molecule. The fluorescent label on the second molecule fluoresces when it absorbs the transferred energy. Since the efficiency of energy transfer between the labels is related to the distance separating the molecules, the spatial relationship between the molecules can be assessed. If the acceptor label is present on a competing ligand, then the overall fluorescence intensity may be reduced in the presence of MPF or MSLN. Where no MPF or MSLN is present, the fluorescent emission of the acceptor molecule label in the assay should be maximal. A binding event that is configured for monitoring by FRET can be conveniently measured through standard fluorimetric detection means, e.g., using a fluorimeter. By titrating the amount of the first or second binding molecule, a binding curve can be generated to estimate the equilibrium binding constant and\/or to determine the level of MPF or MSLN in a body fluid. Some particular FRET technologies known to give precise quantitative result useful for monitoring of the change of biomarker levels in a patient over time include, but are not limited to, homogeneous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF) and TR-FRET, FRET techniques which use fluorophores with long emission half-lives, including lanthanides such as europium and terbium (caged in organic complexes called cryptates). Diagnostic HTRF assays for various biomarkers are marketed by BRAHMS AG of Berlin-Henningsdorf, Germany under license from Cisbio, Bagnols\/Ceze, France, and essentially similar assays are feasible for the quantification of MSLN or MPF in spent peritoneal dialysis solution or body fluid samples.","Another example of a homogenous assay is ALPHASCREEN\u2122 (Packard Bioscience, Meriden Conn.). ALPHASCREEN\u2122 uses two labeled beads. One bead generates singlet oxygen when excited by a laser. The other bead generates a light signal when singlet oxygen diffuses from the first bead and collides with it. The signal is only generated when the two beads are in proximity. One bead can be attached to the display library member, the other to the target. Signals are measured to determine the extent of binding. In some examples, a competitive ligand attached to a bead can be used to assess the level of MPF or MSLN in spent peritoneal dialysis solution or in a body fluid, with a decrease in the overall signal indicative of the presence of MPF or MSLN. Where quantitation is desired, standards may be implemented over a desired concentration range and used to determine how much MPF or MSLN is present in spent peritoneal dialysis solution or in a body fluid sample.","In certain examples, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) may be used to measure the level of MPF or MSLN in a body fluid. SPR or Biomolecular Interaction Analysis (BIA) detects biospecific interactions in real time, without labeling any of the interactants. Changes in the mass at the binding surface (indicative of a binding event) of the BIA chip result in alterations of the refractive index of light near the surface (the optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR)). The changes in the refractivity generate a detectable signal, which are measured as an indication of real-time reactions between biological molecules. Methods for using SPR are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,640; Raether, 1988, Surface Plasmons Springer Verlag; Sjolander and Urbaniczky, 199163:2338-2345; Szabo et al., 19955:699-705 and on-line resources provide by BIAcore International AB (Uppsala, Sweden). BIAcore Flexchip can be used to compare and rank interactions in real time, in terms of kinetics, affinity or specificity without the use of labels. Information from SPR can be used to provide an accurate and quantitative measure of kinetic parameters and the levels of MPF or MSLN in spent peritoneal dialysis solution or in a body fluid.","In some examples, cellular assays may be performed to determine the presence and\/or level of MPF and\/or MSLN. For example, binding proteins can be screened for ability to bind to cells which transiently or stably express and display the target of interest on the cell surface. For example, MPF or MSLN binding proteins can be fluorescently labeled and binding to MPF or MSLN in the presence or absence of antagonistic antibody can be detected by a change in fluorescence intensity using flow cytometry, for example, a fluorescence activate cell sorter. In some examples, cells, beads or other detectable probes which display molecules on their surface that are known to bind to MSLN or MPF may be contacted with the a spent peritoneal dialysis solution of body fluid sample. Such molecules that are known to bind to MSLN or MPF include the antibodies disclosed herein, other antibodies specific to MSLN or MPF, or natural ligand molecules or fragments of such antibodies or ligands, for example CA125 or fragments of CA125 that contain at least one mucinous repeat domain of CA125, which is known to bind specifically to Mesothelin (Rump et al., J Biol. Chem. 5; 279(10):9190-8 (2004). After suitably contacting the cells or probes with the sample, the amount of MSLN or MPF present in the sample may be quantified in comparison to standard samples by contacting the probe with a labeled molecule that binds MPF or MSLN non-competitively with the first binding molecule, or alternatively, by contacting the probe with a labeled peptide can compete with MSLN or MPF for binding to the binding molecule.","In certain embodiments, a scintillation proximity assay may be used to assess the presence and\/or level of MPF or MSLN in spent peritoneal dialysis solution or in a body fluid sample. In a scintillation proximity assay, beads that contain a scintillant that can be stimulated to emit light are used. This stimulation event only occurs when radiolabeled molecules of interest are bound to the surface of the bead. When the molecules are bound, then light is emitted that can be detected on standard scintillation counters or using other suitable optical devices. In some examples, radioactively labeled MPF or MSLN may be added to a bead including a binding protein for MPF or MSLN. A body fluid containing unlabeled MPF or MSLN may be added, and the decrease in fluorescence may be used to determine the level of MPF or MSLN in the sample. A standard curve may be produced using various standard concentrations to facilitate determination of the MPF or MSLN level in a body fluid sample.","In certain embodiments, assays other than those mentioned above may be used or may be used in addition to the assays listed above. For example, agglutination\/nephelometry assays, laminar flow\/quick tests, antibody chips or other multiplex assays, or assays including nanomaterials such as, for example, carbon nanotube assay may be performed.","In certain examples, a method of assessing the condition of the peritoneal cavity and\/or peritoneal membrane of a subject undergoing treatment for kidney malfunction is described. In certain examples, the method comprises exposing peritoneal fluid of the subject to at least one binding agent specific for MPF to determine the level of MPF in the peritoneal fluid.","In one embodiment, the method may further comprise comparing the determined level of MPF in the peritoneal fluid to a reference standard, e.g., the level of MPF detected in the blood prior to or at the time of initiation of dialysis treatment, or detected in the peritoneal fluid at the initiation or within one, two, three months of initiating dialysis treatment for kidney malfunction in the subject. In another embodiment, the method may further comprise selecting a treatment for the subject based upon the level of MPF in the peritoneal fluid.

In some embodiments, if the MPF level is statistically less than the same fraction of the reference standard or decreases below the same fraction of the reference standard, the treatment selected is hemodialysis.","In certain embodiments, the binding agent is selected from a small molecule and a protein (e.g., a ligand, antibody or antigen binding fragments thereof).

In some examples, hemodialysis is administered after discontinuing of the peritoneal dialysis treatment. In some embodiments, the method comprises detecting the level of MPF or MSLN using another antibody comprising a detectable label.","In another embodiment, a method of selecting a dialysis treatment is provided. In certain examples, the method comprises selecting peritoneal dialysis if an MPF level in peritoneal fluid is above, for example, a certain fraction of a reference standard, and selecting hemodialysis if the MPF level in the peritoneal fluid is below a certain fraction of a reference standard. In some examples, the reference standard value may be based, at least in part, on a change from an initial MPF value measured at the initiation of or within one, two or three months from the initiation of dialysis treatment. For example, if the MPF level is 50%, 40%, 30%, 20% or less than the reference standard value, then peritoneal dialysis may be discontinued and hemodialysis may be initiated.","In an additional aspect, a method of selecting a dialysis treatment is provided. In certain examples, the method comprises selecting peritoneal dialysis if an MSLN level in peritoneal fluid is above a certain fraction of a reference standard, and selecting hemodialysis if the MSLN level in the peritoneal fluid is below a certain fraction of reference standard.

The kits may be configured in many different ways including single or multiple antibodies, standards, buffers, reagents and the like. Illustrative configurations are described below.","In certain examples, a kit for assessing the presence and\/or level of MSLN, MPF, or fragments thereof, in peritoneal fluid obtained from a patient is provided. In certain examples, the kit comprises a first binding protein (for example, e.g., an antibody) for binding the Mesothelin or MPF peptide or a fragment thereof, and an instructional material that describes contacting peritoneal fluid with the first agent. The format of the kit is not critical\u2014many standard formats can be used, such as ELISA, latex bead aggregation, and surface plasmon resonance formats. The kit can include a Mesothelin or MPF peptide for use as a positive control. Of course, the kit can also include reagents for assessing other known markers of pathological conditions of mesothelial membranes or tissues or organs within mesothelial cavities, as well as reagents for assessing the performance of dialytic fluid exchange.","In other examples, kits for detecting the presence and\/or level of mesothelin or MPF peptides in a spent peritoneal dialysis solution sample obtained from a mammal (e.g., a human patient) is provided. The kit comprises a first agent (for example, a binding protein) for binding the mesothelin or MPF peptide, a second agent for assessing binding of the respective peptide with the agent, and an instructional material for using the first agent and the second agent. Embodiments of such kits can be used, for example, to determine if a subject is at increased risk of developing a pathological condition of the peritoneum. For example, the kit can comprise a labeled compound or agent capable of determining the amount of mesothelin or MPF peptides in a spent peritoneal dialysis solution sample. Kits can include instructions for assessing whether the tested subject is suffering from or is at risk of developing a pathological condition if the amount of mesothelin or MPF peptides is below a normal level or has decreased by a certain factor compared to an initial level, established, for example, by measurement of the respective analyte in the same patient's blood or spent peritoneal dialysis solution at a previous time, for example prior to or shortly after the initiation of peritoneal dialysis treatment.","In embodiments where the kit includes an antibody, the kit can comprise, for example: (1) a first antibody (for example, attached to a solid support) which specifically binds with mesothelin or MPF peptides and, optionally, (2) a second, different antibody which specifically binds with either the same peptide (for example, at a epitope distinct from the epitope at which the first antibody binds) or the first antibody and is conjugated to a detectable agent. Alternatively, the kit can comprise the first antibody and a labeled ligand of the first antibody. After contacting the first antibody with a patient's spent peritoneal dialysis solution sample, binding of the labeled ligand with the first antibody can be assessed in a competition-type assay, as described herein.","In some examples, the kits can further comprise reagents and\/or instructions for assessing occurrence in spent peritoneal dialysis solution or serum or another body fluid of the patient another marker indicative of occurrence of a pathological condition in the patient, including but not limited to uremic toxins or indicators of uremic toxicity, markers indicative of inflammatory reaction, solute exchange across the peritoneal membrane, and markers of bacterial and fungal infection, ions and small organic molecules whose balance may be disturbed due to the kidney dysfunction, such as potassium, calcium, creatinine, CRP, as well as glucose degradation products, advanced glycosylation end products, or other markers of damage inflicted by specific components of peritoneal dialysis solution such as glucose, or by diseases associated with chronic kidney failure, such as diabetes mellitus.","In certain embodiments, the kits (and the methods described herein) can be used alone to assess occurrence of a mesothelin or MPF peptide in spent peritoneal dialysis solution of a human patient or experimental animal, and such occurrence is indicative of the health and cytological integrity of the peritoneal mesothelium. If desired, a greater number of pathological or biochemical states can be detected to provide greater confidence in the status of the peritoneal cavity by using more than one marker of the status of the peritoneal cavity in the patient's spent peritoneal dialysis solution. Any additional marker(s) can include, but are not limited to, mesothelin, MPF, CA125, or other marker(s) normally found in spent peritoneal dialysis solution, in blood, or in other body fluids or in several of such fluids. The kits and methods described herein may also contain instructions pertaining to pathological or physical methods of assessing peritoneal health, such as peritoneal endoscopy, biopsy, or ultrasound imaging. The kits and methods described herein for assessing occurrence of mesothelin or MPF peptides in spent peritoneal dialysis solution can be used in conjunction with kits and methods of detecting the same or other mesothelin or MPF peptides in serum.","The kits and methods described herein for assessing occurrence of MSLN or MPF peptides in spent peritoneal dialysis solution obtained from a patient can be used to assess the likelihood that the patient will develop a pathological condition for a component of the peritoneal cavity. Detection of a pronounced decreased accumulation of mesothelin or MPF peptides in a patient's spent peritoneal dialysis solution is an indication that the patient is more likely to develop complications from peritoneal dialysis treatment early on than an otherwise identical patient in whose spent peritoneal dialysis solution the accumulation of MSLN or MPF decreases less. It is recognized that the difference between being afflicted with a condition, the earliest stages of the condition, and enhanced susceptibility to the condition may be substantially indistinguishable. Nonetheless, the outcome of each of these processes is development of the condition to the detriment of the patient's health. For this reason, assessment of any of these states using the kits and methods disclosed herein is useful.","In some examples, the kits may include mesothelin or MPF specific antibodies that can be used diagnostically or prognostically to monitor mesothelin or MPF levels in serum or spent peritoneal dialysis solution fluid of patients with kidney disease as part of a clinical testing procedure, for example, to determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen.","In other embodiments, the kits and methods described herein can be used to determine whether an agent (for example, an agonist, antagonist, peptidomimetic, protein, peptide, nucleic acid, small molecule, or other therapeutic candidate) can be administered to a subject in order to alleviate, inhibit, reverse, or prevent peritoneal complications from peritoneal dialysis treatment. For example, such methods can be used to determine whether a specific peritoneal dialysis solution, an agent or class of agents added to peritoneal dialysis solution before performing peritoneal dialysis, or an agent or class of agent administered to the patient systematically (orally, intravenously, intraperitoneally or otherwise), can prevent the deterioration of the peritoneal mesothelium during peritoneal dialysis treatment, or can reverse such deterioration during ongoing peritoneal dialysis treatment or after peritoneal dialysis has been discontinued. Such kits can, for example, assist in avoiding the painful and dangerous peritoneal complications that frequently develop after long-term peritoneal dialysis treatment.","Detecting the antibodies used in the kits may be facilitated by coupling the antibody to a detectable substance. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, paramagnetic materials, and radioactive materials. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin\/biotin and avidin\/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride orphycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol; examples of bioluminescent materials include luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin, and examples of suitable radioactive material include I, S or H. Illustrative paramagnetic labels include, but are not limited to, spin labels, paramagnetic metals and other species having an unpaired electron. Such components may come with the kit or may be obtained separately. In some examples, one or more antibodies may be pre-labeled such that the end-user can immediately use the components of the kit.","Use of standardized assay apparatus permits automation of the method described herein. For example, many different standardized assay containers are known, such as 24-, 48-, 96-, and 384-well plastic plates. Where these containers are adapted to fit a robotic apparatus, automated analysis of samples can be achieved, permitting high-throughput screening of many samples in a relatively short time. Automated assay apparatus and containers adapted for their use in computer-controlled assays are known in the art and will be readily adapted by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, for the kits and methods described herein.","In certain examples, the components of the kits may be prepackaged in a cartridge, vials of other forms to facilitate use by an end-user. For example, one or more antibodies may be packaged in cartridge form such that the cartridge can be attached to a multiple stem pipette to eject the antibodies into a well-plate. In some examples, the cartridge may have eight tubes each including substantially the same amount of antibody such that antibody may be deposited in a single step into eight wells of a well-plate. Of course, other numbers of tubes including, but not limited to, two, four, eight, twelve, sixteen or more may be included in a cartridge as well. In some examples, a cartridge including pre-packaged standards may be included such that deposition of the contents of each tube provides a different concentration of standard in different wells of a microtiter plate. This pre-packaging can reduce pipetting errors and overall contamination of the standards.","In another embodiment, a kit for use in detecting the level of MPF in a body fluid (or more particularly, the level in peritoneal fluid), the kit comprising a first binding agent that binds to an epitope of MPF is provided.","In certain embodiments, the binding agent is selected from a small molecule and a protein (e.g., a ligand, antibody or antigen binding fragments thereof).

For example, the MPF or MSLN binding protein can include a heavy chain (HC) immunoglobulin variable domain sequence and a light chain (LC) immunoglobulin variable domain sequence. A number of illustrative MPF and MSLN binding proteins are described herein and shown in the figures.","In certain examples, the MPF or MSLN binding protein may be an isolated protein (for example, at least 70, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99% free of other proteins).","In some examples, the MPF or MSLN binding proteins may be antibodies. For example, MPF or MSLN antibodies may have their HC and LC variable domain sequences included in a single polypeptide (e.g., scFv) or on different polypeptides (e.g., IgG or Fab).","Several MPF and Mesothelin antibodies are known in the art. For example, Clone 41-28 in combination with Clone 20-10 are known to detect MPF with high sensitivity, and Clone 11-25 in combination with Clone MN are known to detect mesothelin with high sensitivity (Iwahori K, Osaki T, Serada S, Fujimoto M, Suzuki H, Kishi Y, Yokoyama A, Hamada H, Fujii Y, Yamaguchi K, Hirashima T, Matsui K, Tachibana I, Nakamura Y, Kawase I, Naka T. Megakaryocyte potentiating factor as a tumor marker of malignant pleural mesothelioma: Evaluation in comparison with mesothelin. Lung Cancer, 2008, in press).","In certain embodiments described herein, clone 11-25 in combination with Clone IC14-30 can detect mesothelin with high sensitivity. Thus, for example, clone IC14-30 can be bound to a substrate and used as a \u2018capture\u2019 antibody to bind mesothelin peptide present in a patient's spent dialysis fluid under appropriate antibody-binding conditions, and clone 11-25 can be detectably labeled and contacted with the \u2018capture\u2019 antibody after contacting the \u2018capture\u2019 antibody with the patient's spent dialysis fluid.","Similarly, clone 20-10 can be bound to a substrate and used as a \u2018capture\u2019 antibody to bind MPF peptide present in a patient's spent dialysis fluid under appropriate antibody-binding conditions, and clone 41-28 can be detectably labeled and contacted with the \u2018capture\u2019 antibody after contacting the \u2018capture\u2019 antibody with the patient's spent dialysis fluid.","Binding of the detectably labeled antibody with the \u2018capture\u2019 antibody indicates that the mesothelin or MPF peptide was present in the patient's spent dialysis fluid. Analysis of the amount of detectable label co-localized with the \u2018capture\u2019 antibody can provide the level of the peptide that is present.","It is known that there exist some variants of MPF and mesothelin, specifically splice variants and polymorphisms summarized in Swiss-Prot entry Q13421 (entry version 64, last modified on Mar. 18, 2008). From these sequences, it is apparent that the sequences shown in  (SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2, respectively) represent useful portions of mesothelin and MPF peptides. Antibodies raised against all or a portion (for example, 10, 20, 50, or 200 consecutive residues) of either of these sequences can be expected to bind specifically with a broad range of mesothelin or MPF peptides, including those that occur in the spent dialysis solution of peritoneal dialysis patients.","Methods of generating antibodies are well known and only briefly summarized here. An immunogen typically is used to prepare antibodies by immunizing a suitable (for example, immunocompetent) subject such as a rabbit, goat, mouse, or other mammal or vertebrate. An appropriate immunogenic preparation can contain, for example, recombinantly-expressed or chemically-synthesized polypeptide. The preparation can further include an adjuvant, such as Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant, or a similar immunostimulatory agent. Mesothelin or MPF, or a fragment thereof, can be used as an immunogen to generate antibodies using standard techniques for polyclonal and monoclonal antibody preparation. A fragment of Mesothelin or MPF, when used as an immunogen, desirably comprises at least 10 (preferably 12, 15, 20, 50, 100, or 200 or more) amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 1-2 or the amino acid sequence of another variant of mesothelin or MPF.","Appropriate Mesothelin or MPF peptides for generation of antibodies useful in the kits and methods described herein comprise a portion of at least 20 consecutive amino acid residues that is at least 90% (preferably at least 95% or 100%) identical to 20 consecutive residues of a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1-2 or the know variants described in Swiss-Prot entry Q13421.","The MPF or MSLN may be recombinantly expressed to provide suitable amounts of MPF or MSLN for use in producing the antibodies. For example, a recombinant MPF protein may be produced by amplifying the coding part for amino acids 1-288 from the cDNA encoding the transcript variant 1 for human mesothelin (Genbank accession no.

The amplicon may be inserted into a EcoRI\/Xbal site of mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA3.1\/myc-His (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and transfected into HEK 293T cells by lipofection (Lipofectamine-2000; Invitrogen) The culture supernatant may be applied to a TALON resin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech, Mountain View, Calif.). The purified MPF protein may be obtained by dialysis using 4.0 liters of PBS and kept frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. until it is used as an immunogen or as a standard in the methods, kits and devices disclosed herein.","Similarly, MSLN may be produced by amplifying the coding part for amino acids 297-580 of the same cDNA discussed in reference to the MPF and using primers (for example, 5\u2032-AAATTTCCCAAGCTTGTGGAGAAGACAGCCTGTCCTTCAGGCAAG-3\u2032(SEQ ID NO: 25) and 5\u2032-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCGCCCTGTAGCCCCAGCCCCAGCGTGTCCAG-3\u2032(SEQ ID NO: 26)). The amplified DNA may be inserted into the HindIII\/Notl site of expression vector pSecTag2B (Invitrogen). The plasmid DNA may be transfected into HEK 293T cells, and recombinant MSLN may be produced in the culture supernatant and purified as described in reference to the recombinant MPF. The recombinant MSLN may be used as an immunogen or as a standard in the methods, kits and devices disclosed herein.","Polyclonal antibodies can be prepared as described above by immunizing a suitable subject with a polypeptide as an immunogen. The antibody titer in the immunized subject can be monitored over time by standard techniques, such as with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using immobilized polypeptide. If desired, the antibody molecules can be harvested or isolated from the subject (for example, from the blood or serum of the subject) and further purified by well-known techniques, such as protein A chromatography to obtain the IgG fraction.","At an appropriate time after immunization, for example, when the specific antibody titers are highest, antibody-producing cells can be obtained from the subject and used to prepare monoclonal antibodies by standard techniques, such as the hybridoma technique originally described by Kohler and Milstein (1975) Nature 256: 495-497, the human B cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et al. (1983) Immunol. Today 4: 72), the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al. (1985), Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96) or trioma techniques. The technology for producing hybridomas is well known (see generally Current Protocols in Immunology (1994) Coligan et al. (Eds.) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y.). Hybridoma cells producing a monoclonal antibody are detected by screening the hybridoma culture supernatants for antibodies that bind the polypeptide of interest, for example, using a standard ELISA assay.","In one embodiment, monoclonal antibodies may be prepared against MPF and MSLN by immunizing 4-6 week old BALB\/c mice with an appropriate immunogen (for example, either MPF or MSLN) at selected times, for example, days 0, 7, 14, and 16. Following the last injection, lymphocytes of the spleen may be collected and fused with P3U1 myeloma cells in a 50% polyethylene glycol 4000 solution (Wako, Osaka, JP) on day 18. The fused cells may be plated on 96-well plates with RPMI-1640 medium containing 15% fetal calf serum, an antibiotic and HAT solution (Invitrogen). After 10 days incubation at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% CO2 in a humidified environment, culture supernatants may be collected and screened for their ability to bind to the immunizing antigen using, for example, an ELISA assay. Positive hybridoma colonies may be expanded and subcloned by limiting dilution.","As an alternative to preparing monoclonal antibody-secreting hybridomas, a monoclonal antibody directed against a polypeptide can be identified and isolated by screening a recombinant combinatorial immunoglobulin library (for example, an antibody phage display library, or yeast display library, mammalian cell display library or bacterial cell display library, or similar) with the polypeptide of interest. Kits for generating and screening phage display libraries are commercially available (for example, the Pharmacia Recombinant Phage Antibody System, Catalog No. 27-9400-01; and the Stratagene SURFZAP Phage Display Kit, Catalog No. 240612).

The night before a visit to the clinic, patients injected 2000 ml peritoneal dialysis solution into their peritoneal cavity. At the clinic, 9-10 hours after injection, the peritoneal dialysis was removed, samples were taken for analysis and the remainder was discarded.

These patients had already carried out peritoneal dialysis for between 154-3884 days at the start of this study.  demonstrates that, the concentration of both mesothelin and MPF in the spent peritoneal dialysis buffer of individual patients decreased. The decrease of both MSLN and MPF was highly significant (p<0.001, as determined with the dependent Student's T-test) Furthermore, it was apparent that those of the 22 patients with a shorter history of peritoneal dialysis tended to have higher overall levels of both markers (data not shown but similar to ).","With the method described in Example 10, MPF and mesothelin in spent dialysis solution was followed over the course of peritonitis due to bacterial or fungal infection in several patients and compared to inflammatory markers including white blood cell count and Matrix Metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) concentrations in the peritoneal dialysis fluid.","As shown in , for a typical patient MPF and Mesothelin concentration in the spent peritoneal dialysis solution decreased rapidly at the time of inflammation, but in some cases recovered to pre-infectious levels after the inflammatory infection had subsided.","The samples in this studies were grouped into four groups according to the time length of time of peritoneal dialysis treatment:","Group 1: <1 Year Group: 20 patients with CAPD treatment time 240+\/\u221281 days (mean+\/\u2212standard deviation), aged 59+\/\u221212 years;","Group 2: 1-3 Years Group: 34 patients with CAPD treatment time 584+\/\u2212168 days, aged 63+\/\u221213 years;","Group 3: 3-5 Years Group: 12 patients with CAPD treatment time 1385+\/\u2212225 days, aged 67+\/\u221212 years; and","Group 4: >5 Years Group: 18 patients with CAPD treatment time 2557+\/\u2212633 days, aged 64+\/\u22129 years.","MPF and Mesothelin levels were determined as described in Example 10. As shown in , the average mesothelin and MPF accumulation in peritoneal dialysis solution decreased steadily with treatment duration. The decrease was statistically significant (P<0.01, Mann-Whitney U test) between Group 1 and any other group for both MSLN and MPF, and between Group 2 and Group 4 for MSLN.","In a retrospective analysis of therapeutic outcome, the 18 patients who had been on peritoneal dialysis for more than 5 years (Group 4 of Example 10) were divided into patients still on peritoneal dialysis treatment at the end of the observation period (12 patients, 33 samples) and patients who had to discontinue peritoneal dialysis treatment (6 patients, 47 samples).","MPF and Mesothelin levels were determined as described in Example 10. As shown in , both mesothelin and MPF were significantly (P<0.005) lower in samples from patients who had to discontinue peritoneal dialysis treatment, compared to the group who continued peritoneal dialysis treatment. These data indicate that both mesothelin and MPF accumulation in the peritoneal dialysis solution are predictive indicators of the treatment outcome. Consequently, these markers provide useful guidance to discontinue peritoneal dialysis in time for a patient to avoid serious and irreversible damage to the peritoneum, including chronic pain and organ obstruction.
