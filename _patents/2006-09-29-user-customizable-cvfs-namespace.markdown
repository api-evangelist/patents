{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention is related generally to the field of file system checkpoints and more particularly to a user customizable Checkpoint Version File System (CVFS) name space.","In network environments where high-availability is a necessity, system administrators are constantly faced with the challenges of preserving data integrity and ensuring availability of critical system components. One critical system component in any computer processing system is its file system. File systems include software programs and data structures which define the use of underlying data storage devices. File systems are responsible for organizing disk sectors into files and directories and keeping track of which sectors belong to which file and which are not being used.","The accuracy and consistency of a file system is necessary to relate applications and data. However, there always exists the potential for data corruption in any computer system and therefore measures are taken to periodically save or back up file server state, to enable system recovery in the event of faults or failures.","Administrators are also looking for ways to recover from user based errors, where users and\/or applications logically corrupt or delete files contained in filesystems. Traditionally tape based filesystems backups have met this need, however as the cost of disk continues to fall, more and more of these backup needs are being fulfilled by disk based, online representations of the filesystem that are statically preserved in time. These views can then be examined (for instance the 9 am, 10 am, 11 am views) at the time of loss (say 12 am) and the individual files can be retrieved from the static views and moved to the primary filesystem.","One method for backing up a file system is to collect verified snapshots (\u2018snaps\u2019) of a consistent file system, and to store the snaps as file system checkpoints. When data corruption is detected or an object in the filesystem is logically corrupted or lost, one of the checkpoints can be used for file system recovery. Typically the selection of a checkpoint for recovery involves sifting through a list of available checkpoints and selecting one as a basis for recovery.","As the desire for seamless recovery grows, the number of checkpoints that are saved for file systems is increasing. As the number of checkpoints increases the time needed to sort through checkpoint lists becomes a factor in recovery delay.","According to one aspect of the invention, a method of displaying checkpoint information includes the steps of identifying one or more characteristics of a checkpoint recovery set, filtering checkpoints to generate a result set of recovery checkpoints having one or more of the characteristics, merging this list of checkpoints into the namespace view of the primary filesystem and optionally forwarding the result set of recovery checkpoints to a graphical user interface.","With such an arrangement, network administrators can generate custom views of desired checkpoints by specifying characteristics of a checkpoint recovery set, thereby increasing their ability to quickly select an appropriate checkpoint for use.","The present invention is directed towards an apparatus and method for defining, maintaining and displaying a checkpoint result set to facilitate identification of desirable checkpoints during system recovery. The checkpoint result set may be mapped to a user-customizable namespace. The user may customize the namespace using any type of interface, including but not limited to a graphical user interface (GUI), an application program interface (API) and command line code.","The user customizes the namespace by selecting one or more characteristics of desirable file system checkpoints. The characteristics may be absolute; meaning that the membership of the checkpoint in a group associated with the characteristic is known when the checkpoint is generated. An example of an absolute characteristic is organizing the checkpoints in a hierarchal manner according to the fiscal quarter in which they were taken. The characteristic may also be time-indexed, or relative, meaning that the membership of the checkpoint in the group associated with the characteristic is evaluated upon the occurrence of a triggering event. An example of a relative characteristic is organizing the checkpoints in a hierarchal manner according to the amount of time that has elapsed since their creation (for instance \u2018yesterday, last week, last month, last year, etc.) Being able to customize the namespace in this manner enables the user to be provided a more streamlined checkpoint result set in the event of data corruption. As a result an appropriate checkpoint can be more quickly selected for use in recovery.","In one embodiment a user customizable checkpoint version file system of the present invention is implemented as checkpoint software, a portion of which is associated with and provides an interface to a user, and a portion of which monitors checkpoints and manages directories of the checkpoints in accordance with information provided by the user interface.","An exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be shown and described with reference to the Network Attached Storage (NAS) system  of . One or more NAS a client such as client  is coupled via a Local Area Network (LAN)  to NAS file server . File server  has its own network address and may be accessed using a variety of network protocols, including but not limited to the Network File System (NFS) protocol of Sun Microsystems\u2122 and the Common Internet File System (CIFS) provided by Microsoft Systems\u2122. An exemplary NAS device that may be used for primary storage  is any Celerra product provided by EMC Corporation of Hopkinton Mass.","File server  controls the access and retrieval of data from attached storage devices such as primary storage . The file server is a computer on which a user can map or mount a drive or directory so that the directory appears to be on the machine at which the user is sitting. Additionally, the user can read or write a file as though it were part of the filesystem of the user's computer.","The filesystem includes program codes and data structures for storing and organizing computer files and the data they contain to make it easy to find and access them. File systems may use a storage device such as a hard disk or CD-ROM and involve maintaining the physical location of the files, they might provide access to data on a file server by acting as clients for a network protocol,","A storage system may store one or more snapshots (\u2018snaps\u2019), or \u2018checkpoints\u2019 of the file system. If a failure or a corruption impacts an application's data the application can be re-started using one of the point-in-time checkpoints. The checkpoint may be a clone of the file system, a mirror of the file system or a snapshot of the file system. Both the clone and mirrors of the file system use a large amount of space. However, snap-shots use pointers to the production copy and physically copy only the data that changes, using less capacity than a full clone or mirrored copy. The present invention may work with any type of checkpoint.","As shown in  there may be multiple checkpoints of a file system. Although only three are shown by way of example, it may be that hundreds of checkpoints are available for use during system recovery, and it is an object of the present invention to assist user identification of a desirable checkpoint.","According to one aspect of the invention, the checkpoint software module (CkptSW) , executing on file server , can build and display a customized view of the available checkpoints and tunnel that customized view of the available checkpoints into the namespace of the primary filesystem. The checkpoints arranged according to the policy of the customized view are organized and presented in the namespace of the primary filesystem\u2014for instance a user navigating in the primary filesystem path \/foo\/bar, a directory which contains the file \u2018bat\u2019, could navigate into \/foo\/bar\/.ckpt (or whatever virtual directory created by the CVFS infrastructure) and be presented with:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\/foo\/bar\/.ckpt\/today","[directory]"]},{"entry":[{},"\/foo\/bar\/.ckpt\/yesterday","[directory]"]},{"entry":[{},". . ."]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"When the user enters the \u2018today\u2019 directory they would be presented with the checkpoints taken today and within those checkpoints the directory views of \/foo\/bar that correspond to those snapshots. The exact set of hierarchal names (today, etc.) the policy of arranging checkpoints into these buckets, and the triggers that force reorganization (the passage of time etc.) are defined within the larger context of this invention and are not limited to the examples provided here.","According to another aspect of the invention, a user interface (UI)  is shown executing at a NAS client. A checkpoint software module (CkptSW)  is shown executing on file server . Although the UI and Ckpt SW are shown operating at particular devices in the network, it is appreciated that they may be executed at any type of device, including at policy servers, file servers, attached clients, etc. The UI enables a user to identify checkpoint characteristics that enable the CkptSW to build a hierarchical checkpoint namespace that can be used in the event of data corruption to quickly identify a desirable checkpoint for use during recovery. The UI may be implemented in many forms, including as a graphic user interface with pull down menus, a command-line-interface (CLI), an application programming interface (API), etc., and the present invention is not limited to any particular for of user interface. The UI may include functionality to build the checkpoint namespace as well as a display interface that allows for selective viewing of checkpoints in a checkpoint result set during data recovery.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["1","8","1","2","4","5","1","2","3","1"]},"In one embodiment, the characteristics that are input by the user are forwarded to a checkpoint software module, which builds filters and schedules filter operations according to the particular characteristics.  is a block diagram that illustrates several components of an exemplary embodiment of checkpoint software code of the present invention.","The checkpoint software is shown to include a collection of checkpoints, shown in  as checkpoint list  which identifies stored checkpoints or links to checkpoints. Each checkpoint is an independent filesystem views. The list is used to dynamically and virtually create a .ckpt directory in every directory of the filesystem on demand when the user requests it.","In a \u2018flat\u2019 checkpoint namespace implementation of the prior art, when a user residing in \/foo\/bar and attempts to change directory into \/foo\/bar\/.ckpt, a checkpoint directory is automatically, dynamically, created that lists:\n\n","Should the user change directory into \/foo\/bar\/.ckpt\/a\/ they would receive the directory listing from checkpoint A for the directory \/foo\/bar in checkpoint A. However, the sorting filters  and  allow a richer set of more streamlined set of checkpoints to be made available to the user. Using the example above, when a user in \/foo\/bar requests a checkpoint, the result set may provide the user with the options of:\n\n","The virtual checkpoint hierarchy is built on the fly in memory; it does not really \u2018exist\u2019 on disk, but rather is the application of a policy rule set to the metadata of the checkpoints to create a result set that may then be used to create a virtual directory out of in response to the client request.","The software also includes a namespace customizing user interface  by which a user can customize a checkpoint namespace. Absolute checkpoint filters  filter checkpoints as they are created to determine whether the checkpoints are members of a checkpoint group having an absolute characteristic. Relative checkpoint filters  filters checkpoints from the list  upon the occurrence of a triggering event to determine if the checkpoints are members of groups in a relative namespace. The checkpoints identified by filters  and  are forwarded to a checkpoint result set  The checkpoint result set is then nested into the namespace of the primary filesystem  via a virtual directory populated with handlers of checkpoints identified by the. NFS and CIFS clients can then navigate to this virtual hierarchy by going into \/foo\/bar\/.ckpt\/<virtual namespace according to the sorted view>. The result set may also be forwarded to a display user interface  or to the client directly (via a shared folder previous version tab in Windows) to enable a user to view the checkpoint result set and select a desired checkpoint from the checkpoint result set.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["50","52"]},"However the characteristics are identified, at step  they are used to build filters that are used to filter checkpoints to determine whether the checkpoints are members of checkpoint groups of interest to the user. A filter may include software code which parses appropriate locations in the file system to determine if the file system is a member of a particular group. At steps  and , each time that a new checkpoint is generated, absolute filters  are executed to determine whether the checkpoint is a member of the group and, if so, to populate the virtual checkpoint result set . At step  and , each time a relative trigger event occurs, the relative virtual directories associated with the relative trigger events are updated. The relative trigger event may include any update to a relative condition. The relative condition may be a time relative condition, a distance relative condition, a security relative condition, or any characteristic of a file system which can be looked on as being dynamic versus a set point. For example, age is a dynamic characteristic. If checkpoints are moved between storage locations it may be that the location of the file system checkpoint is dynamic, in that it may be remote or local, or even organized with respect to the geography in which it resides. In addition a checkpoint may be assigned a priority based on any combination of absolute or relative characteristics, and file system checkpoints may be categorized according to their priority. In such an instance, the change in priority of the file system checkpoint may be the triggering event which causes the checkpoint to be re-categorized. Accordingly it can be seen that there are a variety of methods of identifying relative characteristics and determining events that will cause membership in relative characteristic groups to be re-evaluated, and the present invention is not limited in this manner.","Accordingly a method an apparatus has been shown and described which allows a user to customize the namespace in a file system which contains methods to directly access checkpoint versions of that file system.
