abstract: A gas insulated switchgear is configured including phase-A, phase-B, and phase-C breaker units. For example, the phase-A breaker unit includes breakers connected in series in a horizontal first direction, disconnectors annexed on the breaker, disconnectors annexed on a breaker, and disconnectors annexed on a breaker. The disconnector is connected to a main bus that extends in the first direction, and the disconnector is connected to a main bus that extends in the first direction. Each of the disconnectors on the breakers is arranged while a longitudinal direction thereof is set to a second direction orthogonal to the first direction so that a switching direction of the disconnector is equal to the second direction. Thereby, the length of the main buses can be shortened, and an interphase distance and a breaker-to-breaker distance can be reduced.

The gas insulated switchgear is used in an electric power station such as a transforming station or a power generating station.","Patent Literature 1 describes a so-called 1\u00b7\u00bd CB (Circuit Breaker) system gas insulated switchgear having three breakers arranged and connected between a pair of main buses. Specifically, first to third breakers are connected in series between the paired main buses while making axes of the breakers horizontal, and disconnectors are annexed to both sides of an upper portion of each of the breakers, respectively. The disconnectors are arranged to match the longitudinal direction of the disconnectors to match the axial direction of the breakers so that an operating direction of each of the disconnectors is equal to the axial direction of the corresponding breaker. Therefore, the breakers and disconnectors are arranged on one and the same plane. Furthermore, three units each including these three breakers are prepared for three phases, and these units are arranged in a direction orthogonal to the axes of the breakers.","Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2002-186124","However, the conventional gas insulated switchgear described in Patent Literature 1 has the following problems. That is, because the breakers and disconnectors are arranged on the same plane, when the main buses are connected, for example, to one of the disconnectors annexed to the first breaker, it is necessary to draw the main buses once in a direction perpendicular to the above-mentioned same plane from the disconnector, then change the drawing direction to the axial direction, and extend the main buses. For this reason, the length of the main buses increases by a length of the part drawn in the direction perpendicular to the same plane and an interphase distance increases accordingly. This results in increase in an installation area for the gas insulated switchgear.","Patent Literature 1 also has the following problem. That is, since each disconnector extends in the axial direction of the corresponding breaker, the distance between the breakers increases by the length of the disconnector, and the length of the main buses increase. This also results in increase in an installation area for the gas insulated switchgear.","The present invention has been achieved in view of the above-mentioned problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide a gas insulated switchgear capable of shortening the length of main buses and reducing an interphase distance and a breaker-to-breaker distance.","In order to solve the above-mentioned problems and achieve the object, the present invention provides a gas insulated switchgear comprising a three-phase unit, the three-phase unit including breaker units for three phases, the breaker units being juxtaposed in a second direction that is a horizontal direction, orthogonal to a horizontal, first direction, each of the breaker units including first to third breakers arranged between first and second main buses that extend in the first direction at the same height, the first to third breakers being arranged and connected in series while matching axes of their breaker tanks to one another on the same line parallel to the first direction; and a pair of disconnectors annexed to both sides of an upper portion of each of the breakers, wherein: each of the disconnectors annexed to the first to third breakers is arranged while a longitudinal direction of the disconnector is set to the second direction so that a switching direction of the disconnector is equal to the second direction; one of the disconnectors annexed to the first breaker is connected to the first main bus; the other of the disconnectors annexed to the first breaker is connected to a first line bus and to one of the disconnectors annexed to the second breaker; the other disconnector annexed to the second breaker is connected to a second line bus and to one of the disconnectors annexed to the third breaker; and the other of the disconnectors annexed to the third breaker is connected to the second main bus.","According to the present invention, the first to third breakers are arranged in series in the first direction, and the disconnectors provided on the first to third breakers are arranged with the longitudinal direction thereof being along the second direction so that the switching direction thereof is along the second direction orthogonal to the first direction. In this way, the invention offers advantageous effects in that the length of the main buses can be shortened, and the interphase distance and the breaker-to-breaker distance can be reduced.","Now embodiments of a gas insulated switchgear according to the present invention will be described below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.

While the operating shaft is provided on the disconnector as described above, operating shafts (not shown) are also provided in equivalent locations on the disconnectors and , respectively. The operation connecting rod  (first operation connecting rod) extends in the second direction to be connected to the operating shafts of the disconnectors to , and can collectively operate the disconnectors for three phases. At this time, the operation connecting rod  can be easily connected to the operating shafts of the disconnectors to because the operating shafts protrude upward out of the respective breakers. The same also applies to the disconnectors to . The operation connecting rod  (second operation connecting rod) extends in the second direction to be connected to the operating shaft on the disconnector , the operating shaft on the disconnector and the operating shaft on the disconnector , and can collectively operate the disconnectors to (). Similarly, the operation connecting rod  (third operation connecting rod), the operation connecting rod  (fourth operation connecting rod), the operation connecting rod  (fifth operation connecting rod) and the operation connecting rod  (sixth operation connecting rod) can collectively operate the disconnectors to , to , to , and to , respectively.","An operation connecting rod  (seventh operation connecting rod) extends in the second direction to be connected to the operating shafts (the operating shaft etc.) of the line disconnectors connected to the lower portions of the disconnectors to , and can collectively operate the line disconnectors for three phases. The operation connecting rod  is connected to side surfaces of the line disconnectors or, to be specific, arranged on the side of the disconnectors to .

After being drawn from the breaker units for three phases in the second direction, the line buses to and to extend along predetermined directions according to locations of the air bushings to and to , respectively. In the present embodiment, the line buses to and to are drawn toward the side opposite to the phase-B breaker unit when viewed from the phase-A breaker unit. Alternatively, the line buses to and to may be drawn toward the phase-B breaker unit.","As described above, in the present embodiment, the first to third breakers (the breakers to , to , or to ) are arranged in series in the first direction, and the disconnectors annexed on the first to third breakers are arranged with the longitudinal direction thereof set to the second direction orthogonal to the first direction so that the switching direction of the disconnectors is equal to the second direction. With this configuration, the one disconnector (, or ), one of the disconnectors annexed on the first breaker, is drawn in the second direction. This makes it unnecessary to provide any extra main bus tank and draw the first main bus (, or ) in the second direction and makes it possible to directly connect the first main bus that extends in the first direction, to the one disconnector, when the first main bus is to be connected to the disconnector (, or ). The same also applies to the second main bus (, or ). Therefore, as compared with the configuration disclosed in Patent Literature 1, the configuration according to the present embodiment can facilitate drawing the first and second main buses, shorten the lengths of the main buses, reduce an interphase distance D (), and eventually reduce the installation area of the gas insulated switchgear.","According to the present embodiment, the disconnectors annexed on the first to third breakers are arranged with the longitudinal direction thereof set to the second direction. Therefore, each disconnector is arranged on the corresponding breaker with respect to the first direction, and the length of the bellows or that of the connection tank substantially determines a breaker-to-breaker distance I (). For this reason, the breaker-to-breaker distance does not increase by the length of each disconnector unlike the configuration disclosed in Patent Literature 1. Accordingly, it is possible to shorten the breaker-to-breaker distance I or a bus length L (), and so eventually reduce the installation area of the gas insulated switchgear.","The breaker unit for each phase according to the present embodiment is a 1\u00b7\u00bd CB (Circuit Breaker) system unit. The 1\u00b7\u00bd CB system is a system designed to bring no influence of the main buses on a system even in trouble of the main buses by use of the three disconnectors for drawing two lines, and designed to take it into consideration not to require shutoff of the lines during the checkup of the breakers or the like.","According to the present embodiment, the operating shafts of, for example, the disconnectors , and for three phases are directed in the same direction, protrude upward, and are arranged on the same plane. Therefore, the single operation connecting rod  can easily connect these operation shafts together. This can simplify a connection mechanism for collectively operating the disconnectors for three phases. The same effect can be achieved by the operation connecting rods  to .","In Patent Literature 1, because the operating direction of a disconnector is equal to the axial direction of the breaker, the operating shaft of the disconnector is directed in the interphase direction, but the disconnectors for the respective phases are arranged in the interphase direction. Accordingly, if the disconnectors for three phases are collectively operated, then the main bodies of the disconnectors for the respective phases hamper the connection between the operating devices and the operating shafts of the disconnectors for the respective phases. To overcome this problem, it had been necessary to interpose an intermediate connection mechanism between the operating device and each operating shaft, to prevent each disconnector main body from hampering the connection between the operating device and the operating shaft in the interphase direction by, for example, once drawing out each operating shaft above the disconnector by means of the intermediate connection mechanism, and after that to connect the operating device to the operating shaft. This configuration has a problem that it requires a complicated connection mechanism.","According to the present embodiment, the line buses to and to extend at a height between the height of the breakers to and that of the main buses to or to , and the main buses are set equal in height to the disconnectors. Therefore, the installation height of each of the breakers and the length of each of the disconnectors annexed on the breaker in the height direction thereof determine a height of the entire unit. This makes it possible to make low-rise arrangement of the gas insulated switchgear.","According to the present embodiment, line buses, for example, the line buses to are arranged between the two disconnectors annexed on the first breakers (to ) or, to be specific, between the paired outlets. Therefore, it leads to effective use of the spaces formed between the first breakers and the respective disconnectors by the outlets, thereby preventing the interphase distance and the breaker-to-breaker distance from increasing. This also applies to the line buses to ","According to the present embodiment, each of the other-side disconnectors (to ) annexed on the first breakers, the one-side disconnectors (to ) annexed on the second breakers, the other-side disconnectors (to ) annexed on the second breakers, and the one-side disconnectors (to ) annexed on the third breakers has one end arranged on the axis of the first to third breakers and the other end drawn toward one side (the side opposite to the phase-B breaker unit with respect to the phase-A breaker unit) in the second direction with respect to the axis of the first to third breakers. In addition, the line buses to and to are also drawn toward the one side. This can shorten the length of the line buses in the second direction.","According to the present embodiment, the disconnectors and are connected to each other by the bellows , for example. Therefore, vibrations generated when each of the breakers operates or those generated by an earthquake can be absorbed and relaxed.","According to the present embodiment, a space is formed between the installation surface of the gas insulated switchgear and each of the breakers because each breaker is mounted on the trestle . The operating device  for each breaker is arranged in the lower portion of the breaker while utilizing this space. This can realize the economic arrangement of the operating devices .","Second embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["50","51","50","15","15","17","17","51","50","51","50","51","15","15","17","17","50"],"i":["a ","c ","a ","c","a ","c ","a ","c "]},"A difference between the three-phase unit  and the three-phase unit  is a difference in direction of drawing line buses. That is, the drawing direction of the line buses to and to of the three-phase unit  is opposite to that of line buses to and to of the three-phase unit  in the second direction defined in the first embodiment. For example, air bushings to are connected to tips of the line buses to , respectively, and air bushings to , for example, are connected to tips of the line buses to , respectively. Intervals of the air bushing to or to are equal to each other, for example.","According to the present embodiment, the drawing directions of the line buses are opposite to each other between the adjacent three-phase units  and .

The operating shafts of the line disconnectors and are installed in the same locations as those according to the first embodiment.","Operation connecting rods  to  are described next. While the operating shaft is provided on the side surface of the disconnector as described above, operating shafts (not shown) are also provided in equivalent locations on side surfaces of the disconnectors and , respectively. The operation connecting rod  (first operation connecting rod) extends in the second direction, and is connected to the operating shafts of the disconnectors to , so that it can collectively operate the disconnectors for three phases. At this point, the operation connecting rod  can be easily connected to the operating shafts of the disconnectors to because the operating shafts protrude laterally of the respective disconnectors to . This also applies to the disconnectors to . The operation connecting rod  (second operation connecting rod) extends in the second direction, and is connected to the operating shafts of the disconnectors to , so that it can collectively operate the disconnectors to . Similarly, the operation connecting rod  (third operation connecting rod), the operation connecting rod  (fourth operation connecting rod), the operation connecting rod  (fifth operation connecting rod), and the operation connecting rod  (sixth operation connecting rod) can collectively operate the disconnectors to , the disconnectors to , the disconnectors to , and the disconnectors to , respectively. The operation connecting rod  (seventh operation connecting rod) and the operation connecting rod  (eighth operation connecting rod) are in the same manner as in the case of the first embodiment.","According to the present embodiment, the main buses to (first main buses) are arranged in upper portions of the disconnectors to annexed to the breakers to (first breakers), respectively, and further, the main buses to (second main buses) are arranged in upper portions of the disconnectors to annexed to the breakers to (third breakers), respectively, so that the interphase distance can be shortened. This can make the installation area of the gas insulated switchgear smaller than in the first embodiment.","Furthermore, according to the present embodiment, the operation connecting rods  to  can be easily installed because the installation locations thereof are in the side surfaces of the disconnectors to and the like. Other effects of the present embodiment are nearly identical to those of the first embodiment.","Fourth embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["52","53","52","25","25","35","35","53","52","53","52","53","25","25","35","35","52"],"i":["a ","c ","a ","c","a ","c ","a ","c "]},"A difference between the three-phase unit  and the three-phase unit  is a difference in direction of drawing a line bus. That is, the drawing direction of the line buses to and to of the three-phase unit  is opposite to that of the line buses to and to of the three-phase unit  in the second direction defined in the first embodiment. For example, the air bushings to are connected to tips of the line buses to , and the air bushings to , for example, are connected to tips of the line buses to , respectively. Intervals of the air bushings to and to are equal to each other, for example.","The present embodiment has effects almost identical to those of the second embodiment. The same holds true for the case of providing three or more three-phase units, and the same effects can be achieved as long as the gas insulated switchgear is configured such that the drawing directions of the line buses are opposite to each other between the adjacent three-phase units in the second direction.","Industrial Applicability","As described above, the gas insulated switchgear according to the present invention is suitable for shortening the length of main buses as well as reducing an interphase distance and a breaker-to-breaker distance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"b":["1","1","2","2","3","3"],"i":["a ","c","a ","c","a ","c "],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0001","num":"0090"},"b":["4","6","8","9"],"i":["a","a","a","a "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0002","num":"0091"},"b":["5","5","7"],"i":["a ","c","a "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0003","num":"0092"},"b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0004","num":"0093"},"b":["11","11"],"i":["a ","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0005","num":"0094"},"b":"13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0006","num":"0095"},"b":["15","15"],"i":["a ","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0007","num":"0096"},"b":["16","16","18","18","19","19"],"i":["a ","c","a ","c","a ","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0008","num":"0097"},"b":["17","17"],"i":["a ","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0009","num":"0098"},"b":["20","20"],"i":["a ","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0010","num":"0099"},"b":["21","21","22","22","24","24"],"i":["a ","c","a ","c","a ","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0011","num":"0100"},"b":["23","23"],"i":["a ","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0012","num":"0101"},"b":["25","25"],"i":["a ","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0013","num":"0102"},"b":["26","26","27","27"],"i":["a ","c","a ","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0014","num":"0103"},"b":["28","28","29","29"],"i":["a ","c","a ","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0015","num":"0104"},"b":["30","30","31","31"],"i":["a ","c","a ","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0016","num":"0105"},"b":["32","32","33","33"],"i":["a ","c","a ","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0017","num":"0106"},"b":"34"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0018","num":"0107"},"b":["35","35"],"i":["a ","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0019","num":"0108"},"b":["36","41"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0020","num":"0109"},"b":["42","43"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0021","num":"0110"},"b":["50","51","52","53"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0022","num":"0111"},"b":["60","65"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0023","num":"0112"},"b":["70","71","72","73","74","75"],"i":["a","a","a","a","a","a "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0024","num":"0113"},"b":["80","81","81","84","85"],"i":["a","a ","c","a","a "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0025","num":"0114"},"b":["88","88"],"i":["a ","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0026","num":"0115"},"b":["90","91","92","93","94","95","96","97"],"i":["a","a","a","a","a","a","a","a "]}]}}}}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 9"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
