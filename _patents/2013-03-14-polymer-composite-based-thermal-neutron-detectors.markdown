The research, defense, and industrial communities use scintillators as radiation detectors in a variety of applications, such as, but not limited to, imaging, nuclear power generation, detection of special nuclear materials, and homeland security.","Detectors for the detection of neutrons in the presence of photons can use many different methods to discriminate signals that originate from either neutrons or photons. As an example, use of He in a pressurized tube for neutron detection permits discrimination of neutrons from photons by pulse amplitude. These detectors fail to correctly discriminate neutrons from photons only about one per 50,000 events. There are a few other scintillation materials that have slightly different light output characteristics when the energy is deposited by a photon or by a charged particle. This permits pulse shape discrimination (PSD) with sophisticated electronics. Another approach is to employ detectors with a very small probability of interaction for photons and a relatively high probability of interaction for neutrons. Some detectors of this type can achieve essentially 100% discrimination if charged particles are directly detected.","There is an ongoing need in the research, defense and industrial communities for scintillators that demonstrate improved capabilities in terms of light output, detection efficiency, high count rate capability, better time resolution of events, and, for neutron scintillators, fewer false counts due to gamma radiation. Especially in view of the imminent shortage of He, there is a need for an inexpensive replacement technology for thermal neutron detection, particularly for replacement technologies that provide easy to make detectors that can have various geometries and\/or sizes.","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a polymer composite comprising: a polymeric matrix material, wherein the matrix material comprises an organic polymer, copolymer or blend thereof, and wherein the matrix material comprises at least one polymer or copolymer comprising an aromatic moiety; a neutron capture agent distributed within the matrix material, optionally wherein the neutron capture agent comprises a Li compound; and an organic or inorganic luminescent fluor distributed within the matrix material.","In some embodiments, the matrix material comprises a polymer, copolymer or blend thereof comprising an aromatic moiety having a higher quantum yield than the quantum yield of phenyl.

Polyimides are polymers of imide monomers. In some embodiments, polyimides can be prepared by reacting a diamine or a diisocyanide with a dianhydride.","The terms \u201cpolyarylvinyl\u201d and \u201caryl vinyl polymer\u201d refer to a polymer prepared from monomers comprising vinyl groups and aryl groups. Exemplary polyarylvinyl polymers include, but are not limited to, polystyrene and polyvinyltoluene.","The terms \u201cvinylpolyester\u201d, \u201cvinylpolyamide\u201d, \u201cvinylpolythioester,\u201d and \u201cvinylpolyether\u201d refer to polymers of vinyl (i.e., alkene-containing) monomers having ester, amide, thioester, or ether side chains. In some embodiments, these polymers are derivatized polyacrylic acid or polyalkylacrylic acids wherein the acids groups are derivatized to form esters, thioester, or amides with aromatic group-containing alcohols, thiols or amines.","Neutron scintillators can employ stable isotopes with a high neutron cross section. In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides composite materials comprising Li compounds as neutron capture agents distributed within a polymer matrix scintillator. On thermal neutron capture, the Li nucleus can undergo fission to produce charged particles with high kinetic energy (about 4.78 MeV), namely an alpha particle (about 2.05 MeV) and a triton particle (about 2.73 MeV). These high-energy charged particles can leave behind them a field of ionization along their path length as they fragment the polymeric chains of the matrix by breaking covalent bonds. These ionizations can in turn create secondary electrons, secondary ions, and excitations in the aromatic matrix of the scintillator polymer of the presently disclosed composites, all of which can directly or indirectly take part in activation of the polymer to produce excitations. Such excitations can either produce photons directly through monomer\/excimer emission (characterized by quantum yield), be dissipated by vibrational means, or be transported through the matrix by random hopping to be eventually harvested by antenna molecules distributed within the matrix (e.g., energy harvesting fluors, such as inorganic or organic luminescent fluors) that can concomitantly emit photons at a longer wavelength than the matrix. The transfer of energy to the lower energy excited state of the luminescent fluor can allow for re-radiation at a wavelength where the bulk material is more transparent, such that higher quantum efficiency is achieved. Thus, according to the presently disclosed subject matter, the polymer matrix is more than simply a binder or structural element, it also produces and transports excitations efficiently.","II.A. Composites","Thus, in some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a polymer composite comprising a polymeric matrix material. Distributed within the polymeric matrix material (e.g., non-covalently encapsulated or embedded within the polymeric matrix material) can be a neutron capture agent and an organic or inorganic luminescent fluor. The polymeric matrix material can comprise an organic polymer, copolymer or blend thereof having high energy transport efficiency and comprising at least one polymer or copolymer comprising an aromatic moiety.","Any suitable ratio of polymeric matrix material to neutron capture agent to fluor can be used. In some embodiments, the composite has a ratio of matrix material to neutron capture agent of between about 9:1 by weight to about 1:5 by weight (e.g., about 9:1, 8:1, 7:1, 6:1, 5:1, 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1.5:1, 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:2.5, 1:3, 1:3.5, 1:4, 1:4.5 or 1:5). In some embodiments, the ratio of matrix material to neutron capture agent is between about 3:1 to about 1:5. In some embodiments, the ratio of matrix material to neutron capture agent is between about 3:1 and about 1:2 by weight. In some embodiments, the ratio of matrix material to neutron capture agent is between about 1:1 and about 1:5 by weight. In some embodiments, the ratio is between about 3:1 and about 1:1 by weight.","Typically, the amount of organic and\/or inorganic luminescent fluor is relatively low compared to the amount of matrix material and neutron capture agent. In some embodiments, the composite comprises about 5% (e.g., about 5, 4.5, 4, 3.5, 3, 2.5, 2, 1.5, 1, or 0.5%) or less by weight of the organic or inorganic luminescent fluor. In some embodiments, the composite comprises about 1% by weight of the organic or inorganic luminescent fluor.","II.A.i. Matrix Materials","In some embodiments, the polymer matrix is selected from the group including, but not limited to, aromatic polyesters, polyamides, polyethers, polyimides, polythioesters, arylvinyl polymers (i.e., \u201cpolyarylvinyls\u201d, such as, but not limited to poly(anthrylenevinylene) (PAV) and poly(naphthalenevinylene) (PNV)), vinylpolyesters, vinylpolyethers, vinylpolyamides and polythioesters. In some embodiments, the polymer matrix is not polystyrene, polyvinyltoluene, or poly(phenylenevinylene). In some embodiments, the polymer matrix includes an aromatic moiety other than phenyl or alkyl-substituted phenyl (e.g., methylphenyl). In some embodiments, the polymer matrix is stereo-regular. In some embodiments, the polymer matrix includes an aromatic moiety that has a higher energy transport efficiency and\/or quantum yield than phenyl (i.e., a higher quantum yield than about 0.07) or methyl-substituted phenyl (i.e., a higher quantum yield than about 0.17). In some embodiments, the aromatic moiety of the polymer is selected from the group including, but not limited to, naphthalene, anthracene, fluorine, terphenyl, phenanthrene, pyridine, furan, and thiophene. In some embodiments, the aromatic moieties are unsubstituted (i.e., with the exception of any bonding required to attach the aromatic moiety to the backbone of the polymeric matrix). In some embodiments, the aromatic moiety can be substituted by one or more aryl group substituents.","In some embodiments, the polymer matrix is an aromatic polyester. In some embodiments, the matrix material comprises or consists of polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) or polytrimethylene naphthalate (PTN) or a blend or copolymer of both. In some embodiments PEN and PTN can be modified by various functional groups (i.e., by one or more aryl group substituents).","Polyesters in general have good structural integrity and their synthesis is relatively straight forward. A large variety of polymers can be prepared by several different routes. Aromatic polyesters are often highly crystalline with high melting points and low solubility. Crystallinity can be decreased by introducing bulky side-groups (e.g., alkyl or aryl groups) or kinks in the polymer backbone to make more soluble polyesters.","Suitable polyesters can be prepared, for example, by reacting a dicarboxylic acid or diacid chloride with a diol in a step-growth condensation reaction, liberating water or HCl. Equimolar amounts of reactants can be used to achieve high molecular weights. In some embodiments, the dicarboxylic acid can be malonic acid and the diacid chloride can be terephthaloyl chloride. A mixture of isophthaloyl chloride and terephthaloyl chloride can be used to introduce kinks into the polymer backbone. The diol generally can contain a scintillating functional group (e.g., an aromatic moiety), such as fluorene, or another aromatic group that has a high quantum yield.","The reaction between a dicarboxylic acid and a diol can be done in a melt, and liberated water can be removed in order to force the reaction. A catalyst such as zinc acetate or antimony trioxide can be used to obtain high molecular weights in a timely fashion. The reaction between a diacid chloride and a diol can occur quickly and irreversibly at room temperature. A tertiary amine such as pyridine or triethylamine can be added to neutralize the produced HCl, resulting in the hydrochloride salt of the amine. Reactions can also be done in solution. Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, tetrahydrofuran (THF) or dichloromethane (DCM) and other ethers, halogenated alkanes, or aromatic solvents. The reaction mixture can be heated in order to speed up the kinetics of the reaction, which should cause an increase in the molecular weight of the obtained polymer.","The structures of some exemplary polyester matrix polymers are shown in Scheme 1, below. These exemplary polyesters include poly(9H-fluorene-9,9-dimethanol malonate), which can be synthesized in the melt, is soluble in a variety of solvents, melts at about 140\u00b0 C., and which turns yellow-brown in color upon melting due to decomposition of fluorine dimethanol. Poly(9H-fluorene-9,9-dimethanol terephthalate) can be synthesized by a diacid chloride route and is white in color. Poly(4,4\u2032-(9-fluorenylidene)-diphenol terephthalate) can be synthesized by an acid chloride route, is white in color, fairly soluble in a variety of solvents and give a good fluorescence spectrum. To introduce kinks into the backbone in attempts to increase solubility mixtures of acid chlorides (e.g., 50\/50 and 70\/30 mixtures of terephthaloyl chloride\/isophthaloyl chloride), for example, can be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0133"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"121.33mm","wi":"71.46mm","file":"US08796631-20140805-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In some embodiments, the matrix material can comprise a vinyl polymer with ester (or amide, ether, or thioester)-linked scintillating side-groups.

The acid groups of a polyacrylic acid or poly(alkylacrylic acid) polymer can react with thiols or alcohols to form thioester or ester linked side chains or with amines to form amide linked side chains. The side chains can be derived from, for example, the following high quantum yield molecules: 9-anthracenemethanol, 9-fluorenemethanol, and 1,1\u2032,4\u2032,1\u2033-terphenyl-4-thiol.

Neutron Capture Agent","Neutron scintillators can benefit from the presence of stable isotopes with a high neutron cross section. Typically, the neutron capture agent of the presently disclosed materials comprises a Li compound. However, in some embodiments, other neutron capture agents, such as those including isotopes of boron (e.g., B), xenon (Xe), Cadmium (Cd), hafnium (Hf), Gadolinium (Gd), Cobalt (Co), Europium (Eu), and Ytterbium (Yb) can be used. When the neutron capture agent comprises Li, suitable Li compounds can include, but are not limited to, Li-containing LiBH, LiOH, LiF, LiCO, LiCl, LiBF, LiClO, and Li salicylate (i.e., LiSal).","In some embodiments, the neutron capture agent is non-hygroscopic (and\/or not reactive with water) or only slightly hygroscopic. By non-hygroscopic is meant a compound that does not absorb water or that does not appreciably absorb water. In some embodiments, a non-hygroscopic compound is a compound that absorbs less than 5% weight\/weight of water when exposed to ambient atmospheric conditions for 24 hours or longer (e.g., 1 week or more). In some embodiments, the non-hygroscopic compound is a compound that absorbs less than 0.5% weight\/weight of water when exposed to ambient atmospheric conditions for 24 hours or longer (e.g., 10 weeks) with high relative humidity (e.g., 80% relative humidity or higher). In some embodiments, the neutron capture agent is slightly hygroscopic, i.e., the agent can absorb more water than a non-hygroscopic compound, but not enough water to cause a composite material containing said agent to become mechanically unstable or to degrade its performance (e.g., as a scintillator). Thus, in some embodiments, the Li compound is non-hygroscopic, and is a compound such as, but not limited to, Li-containing LiF or LiCO. In some embodiments, the Li compound is slightly hygroscopic, such as, but not limited to, Li-containing LiClOor LiSal. The non- or low hygroscopic nature of the Li compound can aid in the provision of composites and composite films that remain mechanically stable over time. Although LiSal can absorb moisture, it does not form unstable films when composites are made using arylvinyl polymers (e.g., P2VN).","In some embodiments, the Li compound is LiF. LiF is one of the few lithium compounds that is thermally stable, non-hygroscopic, and that does not violently react with water. LiF demonstrates one of the highest transparencies in the UV and near blue region of the visible spectra. Furthermore LiF has a very high density of 2.64 g\/cc and has a high stoichiometric lithium content of 24%.","Generally, LiF has relatively low solubility in common organic solvents that dissolve polymers. Thus, in some embodiments, it can be advantageous to employ a Li compound that is soluble (e.g., LiSal) and forms a single phase or a nano-phase distribution within a scintillation polymer matrix. However, an alternative to a single phase system is to obtain uniformly distributed LiF phases with a minimum possible mean crystal size with low standard deviation which in turn reduces self-absorption of charged particles within LiF crystals, increases the probability of neutron interaction, and can improve transparency of the composite. LiF is also slightly soluble in THF (approximately 6 mg\/mL), which can make it possible to process as a partially soluble component in a polymeric composite with uniformity in composition.","In some embodiments, the neutron capture agent comprises LiF micro- or nanoparticles. The LiF micro- or nanoparticles can be prepared by titrating lithium hydroxide with hydrofluoric acid. In some embodiments, the micro- or nanoparticles are about 100 microns or smaller (e.g., about 100, 75, 50, 25, 10, or 5 microns or smaller). In some embodiments, the micro- or nanoparticles are about 3.2 microns or smaller. In some embodiments, the LiF micro- or nanoparticles range in size from about 3.2 microns to about 200 nm (e.g., about 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, 2.9, 2.8, 2.7, 2.6, 2.5, 2.4, 2.3, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0, 1.9, 1.8, 1.7, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.3, 1.2, 1.1, 1.0, 0.9. 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, or 0.2 microns). In some embodiments, nanoparticles are about 200 nm or less or about 100 nm or less in size. For example, LiF nanoparticles that are about 200 nm or about 100 nm or less can be prepared by size reduction of larger LiF microparticles or nanoparticles (e.g., LiF particles that are about 0.5 nm to about 10 microns in size). Size reduction can be carried out, for instance, via ball milling (e.g., cryo ball milling) the larger particles for a period of time (e.g., 10 to 20 hours). Size reduction of the particles can increase the transparency of the polymer composite films prepared with the particles, increase interactions with neutrons, and better allow charged alpha and triton particles to escape into the polymer matrix, thus improving light emission. Accordingly, size reduction of the particles can increase light yield.","In some embodiments, the composite comprises Li salicylate or LiF as a neutron capture agent and P2VN as a matrix material. In some embodiments, the composite comprises LiF as a neutron capture agent and PEN or another aromatic polyester as a matrix material.","II.A.iii. Organic and Inorganic Luminescent Fluors","The presently disclosed composites can comprise organic and\/or inorganic luminescent fluors. The term \u201cfluor\u201d as used herein refers to a substance that displays fluorescence when excited by electromagnetic or particular radiation. The organic or inorganic luminescent fluors of the presently disclosed composites can act as energy harvesting antenna molecules to trap excitations from the matrix and to emit photons. For example, an excitation can hop from one aromatic moiety to another in the polymeric matrix until it comes within a particular distance (e.g., transfer radius) of the fluor, at which time the fluor traps the excitation and subsequently emits a photon. The fluors can act as light amplifiers when the composite materials are used as scintillation detectors and can also act as wavelength shifters for improving the efficiency of the detectors. Thus, use of the fluors can increase the quantum yield of the composites (e.g., by allowing radiation at a wavelength where the composite is more transparent).","Any suitable luminescent fluor can be used. In some embodiments, the fluor can be selected based on acceptor donor resonance, the light emission characteristics of the fluor and\/or its ability to resist oxygen and\/or moisture induced scintillation quenching. In some embodiments, the fluor can be selected based on overlap between the excitation spectra of the fluor and the emission spectra of the other components of the composite (e.g., the polymer matrix).","Suitable luminescent fluors include, but are not limited to, 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO), 1,4-bis-(5-phenyloxazol-2-yl) (POPOP), anthracene, 9,9,9\u2032,9\u2032,9\u2033,9\u2033-hexakis(octyl)-2,7\u2032,2\u2032,7\u2033-trifluorene, n-terphenyl, 2-biphenyl-5-phenyl-1,3-oxazole, 2-biphenyl-5(\u03b1-naphthyl)-1,3-oxazole, 2-phenyl-5-(4-biphenylyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole, 2-(4\u2032-tert-butylphenyl)-5-(4\u2033-biphenylyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole, n-bis-(o-methylstyryl)-benzene 1,4-di-(5-phenyl-2-oxazolyl)-benzene, conjugated polymeric and oligomeric dyes, metal organic framework dyes, quantum dots, two-photon absorber semiconductor fluors and mixtures thereof.","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides films of the presently disclosed polymer composites. The films can be used, for example, as thin scintillation detectors. The thinness of the films can allow secondary electrons to escape the scintillators, providing better neutron to gamma discrimination.","The composite films can be prepared by any suitable technique, such as, but not limited to, solution casting, hot pressing, and extrusion. For example, the film can be prepared by using an extruder such as, but not limited to, a randcastle extruder with various processing conditions (e.g., various process zone temperatures, feed rate, die slit arrangements and opening size, take off rate, and downstream cooling of the extruded film) to increase the degree of crystallinity and\/or optical clarity of the film.","In some embodiments, the film can have a thickness of about 500 microns or less (e.g., about 500, 450, 400, 350, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 75, 50, 40, 30, 20, or 10 microns or less). In some embodiments, the film has a thickness between about 400 and about 200 microns. In some embodiments, the film has a thickness of about 220 microns or less. In some embodiments, the film has a thickness of about 50 microns or less. In some embodiments, thicker films (>500 microns) can be used, for example, when the neutron capture agent is provided as nanoparticles that are about 200 nm or less in size. In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides thin films of composite materials where the films are as thick as about 1 millimeter. Thus, in some embodiments, the films can be about 1000, about 950, about 900, about 850, about 800, about 750, about 700, about 650, about 600, about 550, or about 500 microns thick.","In some embodiments, the film can be biaxially or uniaxially stretched. The stretching can be performed by any suitable method, e.g., mechanically or manually. In some embodiments, the stretching can be done with a commercial film stretching machine. The stretching can be performed using hot circulated air (e.g., at between about 120\u00b0 C. and about 150\u00b0 C.). Stretching of the films below the matrix melting point can allow polymeric chains to orient. For example, in PEN-containing composite films (or other naphthalene-containing polymer composite films), strain induced stacking of naphthalene units can be obtained much like a single crystal. Such stacking of naphthalene units can increase the energy transport efficiency of the matrix. Addition of excitation harvesting luminescent molecules in stretched films can increase the net quantum yield of the composite as compared to an unstretched film.","In some embodiments, the films or stretched films can be thermally annealed. Any suitable annealing technique can be used, e.g., free annealing, taut annealing, etc. In some embodiments, the films are thermally annealed, for example, between about 150\u00b0 C. to about 180\u00b0 C. (e.g., about 150, 155, 160, 165, 170, 175 or about 180\u00b0 C.), using confined conditions using a ring or free annealing. Annealing the film can increase light yield when the film is used as a scintillator due to an increase in crystallinity of semi-crystalline polymer matrix materials, such as, but not limited to, polyethylene naphthalate (PEN).","In some embodiments, the film comprises a composite wherein the matrix material is selected from the group comprising, but not limited to, a polyester, a polyamide, a polyether, a polyimide, a polythioester, a vinylpolyether, a vinylpolyester, a vinylpolyamide, and a vinylpolythioester, wherein the polymer comprises at least one aromatic group. In some embodiments, the matrix material is a polyester. In some embodiments, the polyester is selected from the group comprising, but not limited to, polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polytrimethylene naphthalate (PTN), poly(9H-fluorene-9,9-dimethanol malonate), poly(9H-fluorene-9,9-dimethanol terephthalate), and poly(4,4\u2032-(9-fluorenylidene)-diphenol terephthalate).","In some embodiments, the film comprises a non-hygroscopic neutron capture agent, e.g., LiF micro- or nanoparticles. In some embodiments, the film comprises a composite wherein the matrix material comprises PEN, the neutron capture agent comprises LiF micro- or nanoparticles and the film is a stretched film and\/or thermally annealed film.","In some embodiments, the film comprises a polymer composite having a ratio of matrix material to neutron capture agent of between about 5:1 and about 1:5 by weight (e.g., about 5:1, 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, or 1:5). In some embodiments, the film has a ratio of matrix material to neutron capture agent between about 3:1 and about 1:1 by weight. In some embodiments, the film comprises a ratio of matrix material to neutron capture agent that is about 1:1 by weight. In some embodiments, the film comprises about 5% or less (e.g., about 5%, 4.5%, 4%, 3.5%, 3%, 2%, 1.5%, 1%, or 0.5%) by weight of an organic or inorganic luminescent fluor. In some embodiments, the film comprises a polymer composite comprising about 49.5% by weight PEN, about 49.5% by weight LiF, and about 1% by weight 9,9,9\u2032,9\u2032,9\u2033,9\u2033-hexakis(octyl)-2,7\u2032,2\u2032,7\u2033-trifluorene. In some embodiments, the film comprises a polymer composite comprising about 70% by weight PEN, about 25% by weight LiF nanoparticles, and about 5% weight of a fluor or fluor mixture (i.e., PPO\/POPOP).","Films of the presently disclosed subject matter can have a neutron count rate per mg of Li of between about 4 and about 12 counts per second (cps; e.g., about 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, or 12 cps). In some embodiments, the neutron count rate per mg of Li is above that of a commercially available lithiated glass detector, i.e., GS20 available from Applied Scintillation Technologies, Ltd., (Harlow, United Kingdom). Thus, in some embodiments, the neutron count rate per mg of Li is above about 6.23.","In some embodiments, the film can be prepared by: providing a mixture of an aromatic polymeric matrix material, a neutron capture agent, and a luminescent fluor; and hot pressing or extruding the mixture to form the film. In some embodiments, providing the mixture comprises preparing micro- or nanoparticles of LiF; and mixing the micro- or nanoparticles with the matrix material and the luminescent fluor (e.g., in the desired weight ratios). In some embodiments, the film is further stretched (e.g., biaxially or uniaxially) and\/or annealed.","Referring now to , in some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides an apparatus  for detecting neutron radiation wherein the apparatus comprises a photon detector  and a polymer composite  (e.g., in the form of a molded coupon, film, fiber, or fiber mat). In some embodiments, polymer composite  comprises a polymeric matrix material comprising an organic polymer, copolymer or blend thereof. The polymer, copolymer or blend can comprise an aromatic moiety (e.g., an aromatic moiety with high excitation transport efficiency like naphthalene and\/or with a quantum yield higher than phenyl). Polymer composite  can comprise a neutron capture agent comprising a Li compound distributed within the matrix material and an organic or inorganic luminescent fluor distributed within the matrix material. Composite  can convert charged particles to light that can be collected by a CCD or a PMT or other photon detector  efficiently and at a fast rate.

The apparatuses can be easily implemented in public places without complications in operations.","Thus, in some embodiments, apparatus  can comprise a photon detector  and a polymer composite  comprising: a polymeric matrix material, wherein the matrix material comprises an organic polymer, copolymer or blend thereof, and wherein the matrix material comprises at least one polymer or copolymer comprising an aromatic moiety; a neutron capture agent distributed within the matrix material, wherein the neutron capture agent comprises a Li compound; and an organic or inorganic luminescent fluor distributed within the matrix material.

In some embodiments, the film is biaxially or uniaxially stretched and\/or thermally annealed.","In some embodiments, the method comprises the use of a suitable detector or detectors optically coupled to the polymer composite for producing an electrical signal in response to emission of light from the composite. Thus, in some embodiments, the method comprises using a photon detector in combination with the polymer composite. Suitable photon detectors include, but are not limited to, photomultiplier tubes, photodiodes, CCD sensors, and image intensifiers.","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a method of making a film or a molded coupon comprising a polymer composite of the presently disclosed subject matter. The method can comprise: providing the neutron capture agent (e.g., providing micro- or nanoparticles of the neutron capture agent, such as micro- or nanoparticles of LiF); mixing the neutron capture agent (e.g., the micro- or nanoparticles of the neutron capture agent) with a polymeric matrix material and a luminescent fluor to form a mixture; and pressing and heating the mixture to form the film or molded coupon. Thus, in some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter relates to preparing a mixture (e.g., a solid powder mixture) of a matrix material (e.g., a partially polymerized resin or resin mixture of an organic polymer, copolymer or polymer blend or polymerizable monomers for the polymer matrix material), a neutron capture agent (e.g., micro- or nanoparticles of a neutron capture agent), and an organic or inorganic luminescent fluor (e.g., a luminescent activator and\/or a wavelength shifter); and hot pressing or extruding the mixture to form a film or a thick coupon wherein the neutron capture agent and luminescent fluor are distributed within the matrix material (e.g., non-covalently encapsulated within pores in the polymer matrix). Suitable extruders include, but are not limited to, randcastle extruders. Processing conditions (e.g., process zone temperatures, feed rate, die slit arrangements and opening size, take off rate, downstream cooling, etc.) can be adjusted to increase the degree of crystallinity and optical clarity.","In some embodiments, the matrix material is powdered (e.g., using a high speed grinder) prior to mixing with the neutron capture agent and the luminescent fluor. In some embodiments, the mixture is ground in to a powder (e.g., using a high speed grinder) and sieved and\/or blended (e.g., in a vortex mixer or by stirring or shaking mechanically or manually) to obtain a homogenous mixture. In some embodiments, the mixture is sieved through a 500 \u03bcm or smaller sieve (e.g., through a 500, 450, 400, 350, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 50 \u03bcm or smaller sieve).","In some embodiments, the neutron capture agent is LiF micro- or nanoparticles that are 3.2 microns or smaller in diameter.

The collecting can also include washing (e.g., with water) the particles to remove impurities and\/or drying the particles.","In some embodiments, the neutron capture agent is LiF nanoparticles that are about 200 or about 100 nm or smaller. The LiF nanoparticles can be prepared by pulverizing larger LiF particles (e.g., LiF particles that are about 0.5 to about 10 microns or about 1 to about 3 microns in size). The pulverizing can be performed by, for example, by ball milling (e.g., cryo ball milling) the larger LiF particles for a period of time (e.g., between about 10 to 20 hours) to achieve the desired size reduction.","In some embodiments, pressing and heating the mixture comprises heating the mixture to a temperature of between about 260\u00b0 C. and about 300\u00b0 C. (e.g., about 260, 270, 280, 290, or 300\u00b0 C.). In some embodiments, the film can be stretched (e.g., uniaxially or biaxially). The stretching can be performed manually or mechanically. In some embodiments, the stretching is performed using a commercial film stretcher. In some embodiments, the stretching is performed at a temperature between about 120\u00b0 C. and about 150\u00b0 C. (e.g., at about 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, or 150\u00b0 C.). In some embodiments, the film can be thermally annealed, for example, at a temperature between about 150\u00b0 C. and about 180\u00b0 C. (e.g., at about 150\u00b0 C., 155\u00b0 C., 160\u00b0 C., 165\u00b0 C., 170\u00b0 C., 175\u00b0 C. or 180\u00b0 C.). The annealing can increase the crystallinity of the composite.","In some embodiments, the film can be prepared by solution casting a solution comprising the matrix material, the neutron capture agent and the luminescent fluor.

The vial is sealed, evacuated using an aspirator, and refilled with argon. This evacuation and refilling is repeated two more times. In a separate vial with a septum, terephthaloyl chloride (0.7308 g, 3.6 mmol) is dissolved in THF (3 mL). The vial is sealed, evacuated and refilled with argon like above. While stirring, the diol solution is heated to 65\u00b0 C., and the acid chloride solution is added drop-wise with a syringe over about ten minutes. The mixture is then allowed to stir for an additional hour. Upon cooling, the polymer mixture is dropped into vigorously stirred methanol (120 mL). The precipitated polymer is then suction filtered and dried in a vacuum desiccator. White polymer is obtained. A typical yield is 70 to 80%.","Methacryloyl chloride is dissolved in THF in a vial with a septum and a stir bar. The vial is evacuated and refilled with argon three times.

The solution is stirred for one hour and\/or until formation of the vinyl monomer with ester-linked side group is complete (e.g., as determined by thin layer chromatography or by gas or liquid chromatography). A solution of azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) in THF is then added to the vial with a syringe to initiate polymerization, and the solution is heated overnight at a temperature of 70 to 80\u00b0 C.

Translucent films about 46 mm in diameter, with thicknesses ranging from 85 to 110 microns were obtained. Some phase separation was detected by optical microscopy, which showed what appeared to be LiSal domains separated within the P2VN matrix. It is also possible that pores formed in the polymer matrix during solvent evaporation.

Pure P2VN and PVT films without LiSal were exposed to the same radiation flux and did not show any scintillation response. There were no major changes in P2VN fluorescence spectra of samples that were held under nitrogen as compared to air-equilibrated samples, indicating that the detectors were stable to oxygen.","Films having equal total weight (200 mg), but different weight % of LiSal and different thicknesses were prepared and subjected to thermal neutron flux.

See . The emission spectra are mirror images of absorption spectra of PEN, and fluorescence occurs from the lowest energy level of the singlet-excited states. The fluorescence peak at about 380-390 nm of the pure PEN film spectra is assigned to monomer fluorescence because of its coincidence with that of dimethyl 2,6-naphthalate, whereas the peak around 420-430 nm was assigned to be excimer fluorescence because the excitation spectrum monitored at 430 nm coincided with that for the monomer fluorescence.","Emission spectra of unstretched PEN film and biaxially stretched PEN films excited at 310 nm show peaks at 434-436 nm, whereas biaxially streteched composite PEN films excited at 310 nm show peaks at 466-468 nm.

The high-energy charged reaction products can excite electrons in the aromatic group of the polymer matrix of the scintillation detector and can generate secondary electrons. It appeared that the PEN excimers can have an excited level corresponding to the emission peaks of 434-436 nm. The excitons can either produce photons directly through excimer emission or can harvested by the luminescent molecules that concomitantly emit photons at a longer wavelength than the polymer matrix.","Excitation Spectra:","Excitation spectra of unstretched PEN film and biaxially stretched PEN films observed at 430 nm show absorption band peaks at 285-286 nm and 375-379 nm, whereas biaxially stretched composite PEN films observed at 430 nm show two absorption band peaks, one at 287 nm and second band peaks at 372 nm, 400 nm, and 427 nm. See . The fluorescence spectrum of naphthalene showed excitation at 266 nm, 275 nm, and 285 nm.","The absorption band peaks of biaxially stretched composite PEN films are shifted toward longer wavelengths because of the presence of wavelength shifting fluor. The absorption peaks correspond with the excitation peaks. The peak with a maximum at 413 nm and two shoulders at 392 nm and 430 nm is attributed to the fluorescence of an excimeric configuration of the PEN molecule. PEN can exhibit a low rate of intersystem crossing of the monomeric unit. See Cheung et al., 24, 1809-1830 (1979).","Neutron Response:","Thermal neutrons interact with Li and produce charged a particles and triton with kinetic energy sufficient to excite the aromatic units of the PEN of the scintillation detector. The energy released as kinetic energy during neutron capture by Li is split into 2.73 MeV for the triton and 2.05 MeV for the \u03b1 particle. The neutron count rates of the PEN films are presented in Table 5, below, and the neutron count spectra are shown in . The count rates for stretched and unstretched composite films were compared to that of a 2 mm thick lithiated glass scintillator (GS20, Applied Scintillation Technologies, Ltd., Harlow, United Kingdom). The choice of amplifier time constant determines the degree of charge collection from the tube. Time constant of 2 \u03bcs or greater resulted in nearly complete charge collection and yield spectra. The unstretched composite PEN film with a mass of 521 mg had a count rate of 265 cps, whereas the stretched composite PEN film with a mass of 76 mg had a count rate of 62 cps. The GS20 had a count rate of 442 cps. A significant increase (60%) in the count rate per mg Li was observed for the stretched composite film as compared to the unstretched composite film. The count rate per mg Li of the stretched composite film was found to be higher than that for GS20.","Without being bound to any one theory, a scintillation detector with high crystallinity is believed to be capable of capture of higher incident high-energy particles to generate a greater number of photons. The efficiency of singlet-singlet energy transfer given in steady-state experiments depends, for example, upon excitation energy, which is brought into the neighborhood of the luminescent molecule singlet level by the naphthalene singlet band, luminescent molecule\/polymer fluorescence ratio, excitation exchange interactions, the lifetime, the luminescent molecule\/polymer energy difference, the temperature, and system defects and impurities. See Argyfukis and Kopelman, 51, 9-16 (1980). A crystal provides a highly efficient energy transport system to luminescent molecules as it has has fewer defect sites or imperfections in the lattice. Defect sites or imperfections can act as traps for the annihilation of excitons. See Ratnera et al., 486, 463-470 (2002). The luminescent molecules within the presently disclosed polymer matrix can harvest the resonant energy transferred (RET) from excited naphthalene molecules and emit photons. RET depends upon the degree of spectral overlap, distance and the orientation of transition moments between the luminescent molecule and the polymer. See Andrews, 86, 855-870 (2008).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0175","num":"0209"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 5"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Neutron Performance of PEN Films"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"Count","Count"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Mass Li","Neutron","rate","rate per"]},{"entry":["Sample","Mass (mg)","(mg)","Peak","(cps)","mg Li"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Unstretched","521","62.52","~3000","265","4.24"]},{"entry":"composite PEN"},{"entry":"film"},{"entry":["Stretched","76","9.12","~2000","62","6.80"]},{"entry":"composite PEN"},{"entry":"film"},{"entry":["GS 20","\u2014","71.00","7,342","442","6.23"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"A broad neutron peak for unstretched composite PEN film was observed at approximately 3000, whereas a broad neutron plateau was observed for stretched composite PEN film. An unstretched film had a thickness of 150 \u03bcm and is thick enough to capture the energy deposited by charged reaction products but the stretched composite PEN film had a thickness of 41 \u03bcm, which is less than the range of charged reaction products. So it is believed possible that the charged reaction products do not deposit the full energy in the stretched film. The energy deposited by charged reaction products within the crystals is efficiently transported by luminescent molecules, which produced net radioluminescence response with lower pulse height deficit.","Neutron-gamma discrimination curves for unstretched and stretched composite PEN films are shown in . The stretched composite PEN film showed better discrimination. The effect of energy deposited by gamma and charged particles became clearly separable leading to thermal neutron discrimination because of the lower thickness of the stretched composite PEN film. The low pulse height from gamma-ray events can be due to secondary electrons that are knocked off by gamma rays to escape thin detectors. The stretched composite PEN films appear to have low susceptibility to gamma-induced scintillation and thus can be effective discriminators for thermal neutrons. At low LLD settings, the electronic system is paralyzed by the processing of low amplitude noise, while at high LLD values, the count rate decreases due to the loss of neutron detection events. Based on , if the LLD is set at 3000 for the stretched composite PEN films, neutron-gamma discrimination can be established and yields the possibility of discrimination based on pulse height. However, suitable LLD settings can vary depending upon the gain used for a given PMT, scintillation material composition, and attachment settings.","Alpha, Beta and Gamma Response:","Pulse height spectra were obtained by exposing the unstretched and stretched pure and composite PEN films to alpha (Am), beta (Cl), and gamma (Co) particles. See , B, and C, respectively. The photoelectron yield is the number of photoelectrons created at the photocathode of the PMT. The total number of the counts in the photopeak can be calculated from the area under the spectral curve in the photopeak zone. The light yields of various PEN films are provided in Table 6.

See . Stretched film samples were approximately one fourth as thin as unstretched composite PEN films, so the alpha particles were not able to deposit on the stretched films as much. However, as the stretched composite PEN film had higher crystallinity, which results in more efficient energy transport to luminescent molecules, it generated a higher number of photons as compared to unstretched composite PEN film.","Stretched composite PEN films have low alpha to beta ratio and hence neutron\/gamma discrimination. The low gamma-ray sensitivity can be due to the high thermal-neutron capture cross-section, the large 4.78 MeV energy of the reaction products and the thinness of the detectors. Thicker PEN films have more interactions than the thinner PEN films. Photopeaks were observed at less than 500 keV by the film samples as the secondary electrons at higher energy had greater probability to escape without deposition of energy in the 41 to 150 micron film samples.","Compton scattering was observed for unstretched composite PEN films and was absent in the case of stretched composite PEN films. Lack of Compton scattering can be attributed to non-deposition of the energy of the electrons in the thinner stretched composite PEN films. The broadness of the photopeaks can also be due to the thin samples or from an increase in the transfer resolution due to the optical transmission of the sample. Pulse height spectroscopy of a thicker unstretched composite PEN film sample yielded a smaller photopeak, suggesting that light yield was significantly degraded due to poor light propagation in the sample. Scattered light trace out a longer distance and therefore will be attenuated to a greater extent in the presence of impurities and quenching.","Conclusions:","Unstretched and stretched pure as well as composite PEN films embedded with LiF and a wavelength shifting luminescent molecule were fabricated. The stretched composite detectors effectively discriminate between thermal neutrons and gamma radiation, due at least in part because the film samples were thin (in some embodiments having a thickness of 41 microns). Low atomic number components have low susceptibility to gamma-induced scintillation and thus are effective discriminators for thermal neutrons. The effect of energy deposited by gamma and charged particles became clearly separable leading to thermal neutron discrimination because of the higher degree of crystallinity in the scintillation detector. Stretched composite PEN films have low alpha to beta ratio and hence, neutron\/gamma discrimination due to higher crystallinity. A 60% increase in the count rate per mg Li was observed for the stretched composite film as compared to the unstretched composite film. The count rate per mg Li of stretched film was found to be higher than that for a Li-based transparent glass detector (GS20). The stretched composite PEN film had about 30% higher light output than unstretched composite PEN film. The energy deposited by charged particles within such oriented molecules is efficiently harvested by luminescent molecules, which produced net radioluminescence response with lower pulse height deficit.","Synthesis of LiF Nanoparticles:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0187","num":"0221"},"sup":["6","6"]},"The dried purified LiOH was dissolved in de-ionized water by vigorous stirring (at about 350 to 400 rpm) for about 30 to 60 minutes. Once dissolution was complete, the LiOH solution was treated with a solution of hydrofluoric acid (HF) according to the equation:\n\nLiOH+HF\u2192HO+LiF\n\nThe resulting liquid was then poured into a cold acetone bath and subsequently filtered. All reactions were performed in TEFLON\u2122 (E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company, Wilmington, Del., United States of America) beakers to avoid silicon impurities in the final product. The acetone mixture was vacuum filtered through a 1 \u03bcm filter paper. The filtrate was collected and retained, while the filtrant was allowed to dry. The filtrate was then passed through a 450 \u03bcm filter paper. The resulting filtrate was allowed to dry.\n","Resulting LiF particles were subjected to cryo ball milling for 10 to 20 hours to provide nanoparticles of very small sizes (i.e., less than 100 nm).","Processed Composite Films:","Composite films were prepared by mixing about 25 weight % of the LiF nanoparticles, about 70 weight % PEN, and about 5 weight % PPO\/POPOP and then blending the mixture in a vortex mixer to obtain a homogenous blend. The homogenous blend was dried in a vacuum. The dried blends were weighed and formed into cast composite polymer films.","Unstretched cast composite films (UCFs) were post processed by different technologies. In particular, the UCFs were annealed at 150\u00b0 C. to provide processed composite polymer films (PCFs). Circular samples of 50 mm diameter size were cut from the UCFs and PCFs for further characterization.","Tables 7 and 8 below show the impact of post-processing on neutron count rate and brightness.

An increase of between 70% to 90% in neutron count rate above gamma LLD and a 40% increase in brightness was observed for the PCFs compared to the UCFs. Neutron count rate above gamma LLD for the PCFs was three to five times higher than that for GS20.

Briefly, a solution of high molecular weight PS (M=10as determined by gel permeation chromography) and P2VN (M=1.2\u00d710) was prepared in anhydrous THF\/DMF (4:1 v\/v) by mixing the polymer and solvents (3 weight by volume PS and 2 weight % by volume P2VN) and heating the mixture to 75\u00b0 C. for 90 minutes until a homogenous solution was obtained. A solution of the high molecular weight PS (3 weight % by volume) was prepared in anhydrous CHCl\/DMF (17:3) by mixing the polymer and solvents and heating the mixture to 75\u00b0 C. for 90 minutes until a homogenous solution was obtained. To the PS\/P2VN solution was added LiSal (13.5 weight % in polymer) and anthracene (7 weight % in polymer). To the PS solution was added LiF (20 weight % in polymer) and PPO\/POPOP (8 weight % in polymer). The polymer solutions were electrospun using 3 mL and 5 mL syringes, having 16.5 gauge (for the PS solution) and 23 gauge (for the PS\/P2VN solution) needles. A metering pump delivered polymer solution through the syringe to the tip of the needle. A direct current high voltage power supply was used to apply voltage (16 kV-18 kV) to the needle, producing a jet toward a grounded collector.","For characterization by energy dispersive X-ray-scanning electron microscopy or scanning electron microscopy, the fibers were coated with gold using a sputter coater. The fibers had diameter size distributions between 200 and 1400 nm. The fiber distribution and average fiber diameter (505 nm) of the LiF\/PS fibers were slightly narrower and smaller than the fiber distribution and average fiber diameter (515 nm) of the LiSal\/PS\/P2VN fibers. Without being bound to any one theory, it is believed that an increase in polymer concentration can increase the average nanofiber diameter, while the dielectric properties and surface tension of the solution solvents can influence the phase morphology and fiber dimensions. In one larger diameter fiber, micron size crystals (approximately 3 microns) were observed distributed within the PS fibers.","The excitation-emission behavior of fiber mats of the LiF\/PS and LiSal\/PS\/P2VN nanofibers were studied. The LiF\/PS nanofiber mat had an excitation peak at 280 nm and an emission peak at 420 nm with a Stokes shift of 140 nm. The LiSal\/PS\/P2VN nanofiber mat had an excitation peak at 313 nm and an emission peak at 432 nm with a Stokes shift of 119 nm. The emission curve of the LiSal\/PS\/P2VN nanofiber mat had a single peak, corresponding to the emission of anthracene, indicating efficient intermolecular energy transport.","The samples were tested under irradiation with alpha, beta and gamma sources using a neutron irradiator containing acrylic and cadmium cylinders to obtain a net thermal neutron response as described in Sen et al.

Although the neutron response was not as large as for GS20, the nanofiber mat had a significantly lower loading of Li, was thinner and had a smaller net weight. Neutrons were not detected for the LiF\/PS fiber mats. Without being bound to any one theory, this is believed to be due to quenching of light and to micron-sized domains scattering light within the samples. The fiber mats did not yield appreciable light response using alpha, beta, or gamma rays. This was expected due to the small amount of neutron absorbing material in the mats.","It will be understood that various details of the presently disclosed subject matter may be changed without departing from the scope of the presently disclosed subject matter.
