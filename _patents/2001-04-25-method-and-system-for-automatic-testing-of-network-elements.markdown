title: Method and system for automatic testing of network elements
abstract: A method and system for the testing of multiple elements in a communications network. The method may include using a test host that has both control and data input/output capabilities. The test host may send a signal over the network via one communication device, such as a mobile station, that is connected to and controlled by the test host. A resulting signal may then be received at the communication device or at a second communication device, which may be another mobile station, that is connected to and controlled by the test host. A comparison of the signal sent into the network with the signal received from the network may be used to verify proper operation of any elements in the network.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to communications networks, and more specifically, to a method and system for testing elements in communications networks.","2. Description of Related Art","By loading new software in network elements, it is easy and convenient to modify software-based network elements (or other network elements) to improve their performance, add features, or correct problems. Such comprehensive software updates are referred to as platform software loads. As elements of networks are modified by new platform software loads, consistent, efficient testing of the networks and the modified elements within the networks becomes more difficult. For example, if a seemingly simple hardware or software change is made to a network element, the network may continue to function normally for one type of call, like a circuit-switched voice call. The change, however, may create problems or failures for data transfers over the network, such as fax calls, asynchronous data transfers, mobile-to-mobile fax calls, mobile-to-land fax calls, mobile-to-land data calls, etc.","Thus, it may be useful, when testing a network that has a modified element or elements, to send data of various kinds over the network to ensure complete functional compatibility (i.e., interoperability), between the modified element and various communications devices that may be used on the network.","One way to ensure such interoperability is regression testing. Regression testing of a network element may be accomplished by sending data over the network (and through the network element under test) from a transmitting communication device to a receiving communication device and then comparing the sent data to the received data. As an example, a regression test may be performed by sending data over the network from a mobile station acting as a cellular modem and receiving the data in a receiving communication device, such as a modem, and determining if any errors occurred in the transmission.","In an ideal data regression test of a network element (for example, an InterWorking Function, or IWF), rigid consistency and repeatability would be preferable to ensure that the test procedure itself does not introduce errors in the data transfer. Alternatively, by replacing the element under test with the element it replaced (or by restoring the element's software to its previous version) and running the same regression test again, test consistency and repeatability may be used to determine whether any problems that do occur during a data transfer are due to the network element under test or due to some other part of the system. Achieving such consistency and repeatability during data network regression testing may be very difficult or impossible with manual execution of test procedures. Further, manual testing consumes engineering and lab resources during times of high demand. Therefore, a test procedure that is more consistent, time efficient, and repeatable is desired.","A method of testing various elements of a communications network is provided. In an exemplary embodiment, the method may include the steps of using a test host to cause a first communication device to send a test signal into a network, and then receiving, in the test host via the first or a second communication device, another test signal from the network. To complete the test, the test host may perform a comparison between the original test signal and the received test signal and provide an output indicative of a result of the comparison, by which the interoperability of the network entity and the communications devices may be determined.","In another embodiment of the invention, the method may include using a test host to cause an actual (i.e., non-simulated) mobile station, such as a wireless telephone or PDA, to send a set of test data into a communications channel that includes a network entity. Next, the test host may receive a second set of test data from the communications channel via the mobile station or a second communication device, which may also be a non-simulated mobile station, such as a wireless telephone or PDA. The test host may then perform a comparison between the first set of test data and the second set of test data and provide an output indicative of a result of the comparison, by which the interoperability of the network entity and the communications devices may be determined. If, for example, the fist set of test data is a digital file, the second set of test data may be a digital file that is substantially the same as the first set. In other words, the data contained in the two files may be bit-for-bit identical. The comparison performed in this case would be a bit-for-bit comparison of the two files, where the test host may flag any unreported errors.","1. Exemplary Architecture","Referring to the drawings,  illustrates a simplified diagram of a system  in which an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may be employed. As shown in , system  may include multiple communication devices, such as (without limitation) landline sending modem  and receiving modem , and mobile stations such as sending mobile station  and receiving mobile station , interconnected to a network . Communication devices , , , and  may be both communicatively coupled and under the control of a computer such as test host .","Network  may include the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or another network used for the testing of modified network elements. Network  may include one or more network elements that are to be tested by the method and system of the exemplary embodiment.","Mobile stations  and  may be part of a code division multiple access (CDMA) cellular communication system, as set forth in TIA IS-95A. Mobile stations  and  may be communicatively coupled to network  through a mobile switching center (MSC) , such as a Telcordia MSC, a base station controller (BSC) , and a base transceiver station (BTS) . Although mobile stations  and  are shown as wireless telephones, they may take any suitable form, such as (without limitation) wireless personal digital assistants (PDAs) or wireless modems. Further, mobile station  may be a different type of device than mobile station .","As shown in , an IWF  may be connected to MSC . An IWF acts as a gateway between wireless CDMA networks and circuit-switched or packet-switched networks, such as the PSTN or the Internet. An IWF or its equivalent is sometimes necessary to perform interworking and protocol conversions that give CDMA cellular users circuit-switched data capabilities (i.e., the data capabilities typically accessed through land-line modems) such as e-mail access, Internet access, and fax services. For circuit-switched data conversion, the IWF may be implemented as a pool of modems typically connected to an MSC via an A2 link as described in TIA\/EIA IS-634.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["12","12","12","32","34","38","36"]},"Memory  may include more than one physical element, and may also include: an operating system for processor ; a sending component comprised of a set of stored logic by which processor  may send a test signal into network  via mobile station ; a receiving component comprised of a set of stored logic by which processor  may receive a test signal from network  via mobile station ; and a comparing component comprised of a set of stored logic by which processor  may compare one test signal, such as a set of data, to another test signal. Provided with the present disclosure, those skilled in the art can readily prepare appropriate computer instructions to perform such functions.","Graphical user interface  may include an input keyboard and a display. The keypad may be used to cause test host  to initiate a test case or various combinations of test cases, such as sending different formats of data files into network . The display may be used to display the results of a test or tests. It should be noted that a keypad and display are not crucial to the functioning of the present invention, and that any technology may be used to implement graphical user interface . For example, a touch screen could take the place of a keypad and an audible signal could take the place of a display.","Communication and control interface  may be comprised of a conventional serial board such as Equinox Systems' SuperSerial I\/O adapter (not shown) and may be used as the computer's interface to landline modems  and  and mobile stations  and  acting as cellular modems as shown in .","An object of the exemplary embodiment is to perform closed-loop testing of a network element (or elements) such as an IWF, using communications devices such as mobile stations. While the exemplary embodiment may be implemented using any combination of wireless and landline terminals (such as landline modems  and ) and more than one type of communication, such as voice or data, this description will focus on the operation of the method using mobile station  and mobile station  to send and receive data calls, respectively.","Under the control of test host , a data call may be initiated at mobile station , be connected to network  as described above, and finally be received at mobile station . While this description focuses on a data call between only two mobile stations connected to test host , it should be understood that test host , as well as the other elements of the exemplary embodiment, can easily support simultaneous network tests using multiple communications channels. It should also be understood that the functions performed by test host  may be carried out by one or more computers or other appropriate devices operating in concert.","During network testing, it is preferred, where possible, to use the same equipment that customers use to access the network, such as mobile stations and other communications devices. Thus, to ensure that testing occurs under real-world conditions, test host  may be configured to control actual mobile stations connected to the network as shown in the exemplary embodiment. Network testing could be implemented using a test host and simulated mobile stations (e.g., a computer module configured to drive a stand-alone RF device) to perform data transfers when testing network elements. Conducting a data transfer test without using actual mobile stations, however, may mask any network interface problems that could occur later when a customer uses the system with a mobile station. Thus, it would also be advantageous to include mobile stations as part of an automatic test system that could be run at night or any time, to produce realistic, consistent test results and better utilize lab and engineering resources.","According to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, an element of a circuit-switched or packet-switched data network may be regression tested by using a test host to cause a mobile station to perform the same steps a user would perform to effect a wireless data transfer. The data transfer may be of any type, but would typically be either a class  fax call (TIFF format), an asynchronous data (AD) call, or a Quick Net Connect (QNC) single-stack or double-stack call. The type of test or tests run during a session may be specified by a user of the system.","Test host  may be used to control both the transmitting and receiving communication devices and to process the test results. To test a network element, such as IWF , a data transfer call may be set up to transfer data over a known network between the transmitting device and the receiving device. Thus, any individual network element within the known data path may be regression tested under the control of test host . The network element under test may reside either in a public network, a test lab's network, or any other network. Test calls may include mobile originated, mobile terminated, and mobile-to-mobile calls as well as landline calls.","By way of example, for a mobile originated, mobile terminated fax call, an exemplary test host may control the transmitting and receiving mobile stations in a way that simulates user action. To do this, it may be advantageous (though not strictly necessary) to use mobile stations that are programmed to receive commands and to act on them through their application programming interfaces (APIs). Using mobile stations that can be controlled through their APIs (for example, Denso Eagle 10 or Eagle 12 wireless phones), test host  may send a command to dial digits, execute a \u201csend\u201d command, or recognize and respond to a ring signal, and the mobile stations will respond as if a user had pressed buttons to accomplish these functions.","Test host  can perform other functions in addition to sending and receiving data via communications devices. Some of the fax modem functions tested for a CDMA analog fax call under the control of test host , for example, might include modem initialization, answering, dialing, protocol handshaking, and call termination.","2. Exemplary Operation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["12","28","28","12","28","10","28","10"]},"First, at block , test host  may cause a first communication device, such as mobile station , to send a first test signal into network . This first test signal may be a DTMF tone or tones that represents dialed digits, a digital data file such as a TIFF formatted file, or virtually any signal capable of being sent through network . As shown at block , a second communication device, such as mobile station , can receive a test signal from network , the test signal (or an indication of it) in turn being received at test host . The received test signal may be a ring signal that results from the dialed digits from mobile station . It may also be a digital data file, such as a TIFF formatted file. Finally, the received test signal may be virtually any signal capable of being received from network . If there is no problem with network , the received test signal, such as a TIFF file, may be the same as a file sent through network , so that a comparison of the received file to the sent file may indicate the quality of network .","To verify that one or more elements that make up network  or even system  are operating properly, test host  can perform a verification of the results of sending the first test signal into network , as depicted at block . This verification may be a one-to-one comparison of each bit of the digital data of the first test signal to the digital data of the second test signal, if a data file was transferred at blocks  and . Alternatively, step  may simply be a verification that a communications channel was successfully established. For example, test host  may cause mobile station  to dial digits and execute a \u201csend\u201d command and then verify that mobile station  received a ring signal in response to the call.","The results of this regression test can be displayed on graphical user interface , in comprehensive form or simplified form, as shown at block . The regression test may typically be done before any modification to network  to establish a performance baseline. The regression test may then be repeated after network  has been modified in some way; after replacing a network element or upgrading it through a platform software load, for example. If the test results in any errors, a user may replace the modified network element (or return it to its pre-test condition) and run the test again to determine whether the error was caused by the modified network element or by something else.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["28","14","16","10","50","12","30","30","12","16","16","52"]},"Once the TCP connection is established with IWF , test host  may send a configuration command (AT+CFG) and then a dial command (ATD) and the desired dial string to the acquired modem in IWF  via mobile station . Mobile station  may then send a fax call origination message (encapsulated in the PPP and TCP protocols) to IWF , and IWF  may set up a fax connection. As depicted at block , this completes the process of establishing a communications channel between mobile stations  and  that originates at test host  and also terminates at test host  via system  and network , as shown in . The communications channel includes IWF .","In addition to simulating user commands and establishing a data communications connection over system  and network , test host  may provide mobile station  with data input that simulates a user sending (or, for that matter, receiving) a cellular fax via a laptop computer or a cellular fax machine coupled to mobile station  acting as a cellular modem. Thus, as shown in  at block , test host  may cause mobile station  to send one or more TIFF files into network . Alternatively, test host  may cause mobile station  to send one or more data files through network  using the Zmodem file transfer protocol, as is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Using the Zmodem protocol, it is possible to encounter errors, have them reported, and transparently continue with the transmission via the detect and retry strategy.","The test host may then receive the file or files via network  and mobile station , as shown at . Thus, where digital data files are used as test signals, a test case with no errors means that the data file received by mobile station  will be substantially the same as the data file sent into network  from mobile station . To verify this, test host  can compare the file received to the file that was sent, as shown at block . As shown at block , test host  can report, via a graphical user interface or a simple text output, any results generated by the data transfer test, as described in more detail below.","The comparison of the first test signal to the second test signal may indicate whether a platform software load (or other change) in a network element such as IWF  has created a problem or a failure that could affect customers sending data over a network. Test host  may be configured to capture the simple text output stream generated as a result of a test case. These simple results may include a listing of the tests performed, the time that each test was performed, and an indication of success or failure of each test, as shown at block . The text output may also be used to display, via a graphic interface, comprehensive test results that may include the time each test began, test duration, the mobile identification numbers (MINs) of any mobile stations used in the test, files transferred, wireline modems and serial interfaces used, pass\/fail results for each test, and total pass\/fail statistics. The graphic interface may also be configured to give a user the ability to display only passed or only failed tests.","The test procedure may be somewhat similar for the other types of data transfers mentioned and for wireline-terminated and wireline-to-wireline calls. When QNC calls are used to test the network, no separate modem is required on the wireless end of the data transmission. Also, with QNC calls, the data may be sent directly into the internet via the IWF without first being routed through the PSTN. The data may then be received at the second communications device either through a direct internet connection or back through the PSTN, depending on how the call is routed.","Some functional steps that may be used for QNC calls are illustrated in . At block , test host  may cause mobile station  to establish a PPP session with IWF . After the PPP session is established, a static route may be added to insure the subsequent TCP\/IP session will occur via the mobile data path rather than the Ethernet LAN connection within IWF  (block ). As in the previous example, test host  can cause mobile station  to dial digits and establish a direct IP or layer  tunneling connection to a file server (not shown) over network , as shown at block . At block , test host  may invoke a standard TCP\/IP \u201cping\u201d function to verify connectivity between mobile station  and the file server. If no connectivity has been established, the ping will time out and the error will be logged by test host .","Next, FTP may be used to send one or more files into network  to test the quality of the network connection (block ). Once a file is sent to a file server on network , test host  may request that the server send it back via an FTP \u201cget\u201d command. The file will then return to test host  via mobile station , where it may be compared to the file originally sent (block ). The results of the test may be reported to the user as shown at block  and described in detail above.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described. It will be understood, however, that changes and modifications may be made to the invention without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention, as defined by the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described herein with reference to the drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
