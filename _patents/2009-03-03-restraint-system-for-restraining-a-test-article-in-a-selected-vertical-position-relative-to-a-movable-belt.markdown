No. 61\/033,172, and filed Mar. 3, 2008, the content of which is incorporated herein in its entirety.","The discussion below is merely provided for general background information and is not intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Aspects of the present invention relate to equipment and methods used during laboratory testing of bodies moving over surfaces such as but not limited to all types of vehicles traveling on a roadway.","Referring to vehicles such as automobiles by way of example, the use of simulated roadways has become important in the development of vehicle designs. These roadway simulators generally comprise one or more individual endless belts that are mounted below the vehicle, engaging one or more wheels, and\/or positioned below other body panels of the vehicle. The belts are driven to simulate driving the vehicle over a road. Commonly, the roadway simulators are disposed in wind tunnels so as to measure aerodynamic characteristics. Generally, roadway simulators improve the realism of flow characteristics leading to improved measurement of aerodynamic characteristics.","The vehicle is typically restrained with respect to the simulated roadways through a linkage that restrains the vehicle from movement in longitudinal direction (fore and aft), in lateral direction (side-to-side) and in yaw (steering motion). Commonly, the vehicle restraints are passive restraints which do not affect the vehicle's dynamics, but which can be used for measuring loads if desired in the different directions of restraint.","This Summary and the Abstract herein are provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary and the Abstract are not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor are they intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. The claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in the background.","A first aspect of the present invention is a test system that includes a platform having a movable endless belt. A restraint is configured to restrain a test article in a selected vertical position relative to the moveable belt. The restraint includes at least a pair of axially rigid supports wherein at least one rigid support is provided on each side of the movable belt and has an end configured to be secured to the test article, and wherein each support extends from a stationary portion, relative to the belt, of the platform over at least a portion of the movable belt.","In one embodiment, the test system can further include a load cell operably coupled to each support. Each load cell is configured to measure a vertical force associated with each support.","In yet another embodiment, the test system can further include an actuator coupled to each support so as to apply a selected force upon the test article. If desired, the actuators and supports are configured to lift the test article off the movable belt and\/or apply a vertical force on the test article directed toward the movable belt.","Positioners can be coupled to at least one support. The positioners can be configured to adjust a longitudinal and or a lateral position of the support relative to the platform.","In a particularly advantageous embodiment, the platform is part of a wind tunnel and each of the supports are streamlined. If desired, each support can include means for adjusting airflow characteristics around the support.","Each support can include a stiffening assembly. The stiffening assembly includes an upright member on the support and elongated members extending from the upright member to each end of the support. If desired, each support can include a compartment for storing the upright member and the elongated members.","Another aspect of the present invention is a test system that includes a platform having a movable endless belt. A restraint is configured to restrain a test article in a selected position relative to the moveable belt. The restraint includes at least a pair of axially rigid supports wherein at least one rigid support is provided on each side of the movable belt and has an end configured to be secured to the test article, and wherein each support extends from a stationary portion, relative to the belt. The restraint further includes an actuator coupled to each support, wherein each actuator is configured to exert a vertical force on the test article directed toward the movable belt. If desired, the actuators and supports are configured to lift the test article off the movable belt.","In a further embodiment, the test system includes a load cell operably coupled to each support. The load cell is configured to measure a vertical force associated with each support.","In yet a further embodiment, the test system includes a strut having a first end coupled to the test article proximate at least one support and a second end configured to engage the belt as it moves so as to transfer force between belt and the test article. In a particularly advantageous embodiment, the test article comprises a vehicle and the test system includes a plurality of struts, where each strut is proximate each support and has a first end coupled to the vehicle and a second end configured to engage the belt as it moves so as to transfer force between belt and the vehicle.","Yet another aspect of the present invention is a method for testing a vehicle in a wind tunnel having an movable endless belt. The method includes coupling the vehicle to rigid supports that restrain the vehicle in a selected vertical position relative to the movable belt, the rigid supports extending from a stationary portion in the wind tunnel over a portion of the movable belt; and restraining the vehicle during application of blowing air upon the vehicle and moving the movable belt.","If desired, the method can further include applying a selected vertical force through each of the supports to the vehicle during application of blowing air upon the vehicle and moving the movable belt, and\/or lifting the vehicle off the movable belt using the supports.","Referring to , a vehicle restraint  and simulation system  having one or more aspects of the invention is illustrated. In the embodiment illustrated, a vehicle  is an automobile; however, it should be understood that this is but one example of a vehicle that can benefit from aspects of the present invention. For that matter, any type of test article restrained relative to a moving surface provided by an endless belt can benefit from one or more aspects of the present invention; however, particular advantages are realized for a vehicle moving over a roadway surface.","In the embodiment illustrated, the system  includes a support base , which generally comprises a large concrete structure having a pit indicated generally at  in which the main roadway mechanisms  are mounted so that the vehicle  to be tested is at about the level of the surface surrounding the pit . In many instances, the system  forms part of a wind tunnel having a fan, not shown, but represented by arrow . The vehicle  and the main roadway mechanism  can include a platform , which, in the embodiment illustrated, is a turntable that allows the vehicle  to be positioned selectively with respect to the air flow generated by the fan.","The platform  and the main roadway mechanisms , although not necessary, can be mounted on a balance assembly, schematically illustrated at , which can measure various forces upon the vehicle . Such balance assemblies, which can take many forms, are well known in the art and need not be further discussed for purposes of the present application. However, one suitable balance assembly is described in United States Published Patent Application 2007\/0039400, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In an alternative embodiment, the balance mechanism can be integrated in the system  as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,360,443, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","It should also be noted that the roadway mechanism  herein illustrated includes a single endless belt  upon which the vehicle  is supported. As appreciated by those skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention can be applied to roadway mechanisms that comprise two or more belts used to support the vehicle  and\/or are positioned under various portions or proximate to panels of the vehicle . All of the belts, if more than one is present, are driven by suitable motors and rollers, the details of which are well known, and not necessary for understanding aspects of the present invention.","Referring now to the vehicle restraint , in one form, the vehicle restraint  restrains and can control the position of the vehicle  on the belt(s) , and in particular, control a vertical position of the vehicle and\/or measure loads or forces on the vehicle . In another aspect, the restraint  has the ability to lift the vehicle  upwardly relative to the platform  or belt  so as to perform work upon the vehicle  such as to access the underside of the vehicle  to replace components. The restraint  should have as minimal effect on air flow around the vehicle  as possible during testing. As such supports  that extend from \u201cstationary\u201d portions of the platform  (relative to belt ) on opposite sides of the vehicle  over portions of the belt  are provided. The supports  are axially (along their longitudinal length) rigid or stiff and generally aerodynamic (e.g. slender and\/or streamlined in shape) to minimize airflow disturbance.","Referring to , couplers  are coupled to attachment points  of the vehicle , which may already be available, or may require slight modification such as by providing suitable flanges, thereby allowing the vehicle to be rolled onto the belt  and quickly secured. In general, each of couplers  is joined through each respective support  to an actuator . Selective control of each of the actuators , allows the operator to obtain desired characteristics of the vehicle  such as vehicle position, ride height, etc., which furthermore can be adjusted while the vehicle  is rolling on the belt . In addition, when desired, the actuators  can be controlled so as to lift the vehicle  completely off the belt . It should be noted that although illustrated where each support  is attached to a body portion of the vehicle , this is not limiting. If desired, as is known in the art, couplers can be provided on the end of each support to connect the support  to a wheel hub  ().","Aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle  such as drag are can be obtained with the system  by restraining the vehicle  with vehicle restraint  in a manner so as to generally hold the vehicle in a somewhat soft or compliant manner while the belt  is run for a relatively long period of time such as but not limited to 20-30 seconds. Having a relatively long test period allows trembling or buffeting that the vehicle  may experience to be averaged out so that the average or mean load values obtained can be used.","However, in a second form of a test, the trembling or buffeting characteristics of the vehicle  are desired. As another aspect of the invention, this is obtained by holding the frame of the vehicle  in a rigid manner so as to minimize any oscillation of the vehicle  on its tires. In this manner, the forces being applied to the body of the vehicle  from buffeting can be measured. In order to maintain the vehicle  in a rigid manner using only the supports  would require the supports  to be very stiff. To provide the required stiffness, the supports  may be designed to be relatively large. However, this is not desired, because as the size of the supports increases so does their disturbance of the airflow in the wind tunnel. However, as another aspect of the invention, by providing one, two or typically four struts , as illustrated in , that are joined to the vehicle  such as to the frame of the vehicle or coupler , vertical loads of the vehicle  can be reacted down to and through belt . It should be noted strut(s)  can be used on any of the exemplary embodiments herein disclosed.","It should be understood that each of the struts  include, on end opposite the end joined to the vehicle or coupler , a coupling  that allows the vertical forces to be applied to the belt . In one embodiment, coupling  can be a fluid (e.g. air or liquid) bearing that slides with minimal friction upon the upper surface of the belt . Vertical forces carried by each strut  are reacted through the fluid bearing upon the belt . If necessary, a suitable reaction structure indicated by dashed block  is provided under the portion of the belt  having the strut . If necessary, a fluid bearing coupling can be provided between belt  and reaction structure . In short, the vehicle  is retained in a stiff manner due to the stiffness provided by the vertical struts  (possibly, in combination with vertical stiffness from the supports ), while lateral stiffness is provided by the supports . It should be noted, that additional mass can be provided in the vehicle in order to increase the weight of the vehicle  as an aid in maintaining the vehicle  in a stiff manner. A particular advantage of the vertical struts  is that they are relatively small, and thus, do not disturb the airflow around the vehicle  very much. If desired, outer surfaces can be configured in a streamlined manner to further reduce airflow disturbances. In addition, as illustrated, the struts  can be positioned proximate to and\/or in-line with the tires or wheel assemblies of the vehicle  to further reduce airflow disturbances.","Referring to , in some systems a load cell  is provided under each tire of the vehicle  so as to measure vertical forces through the belt . However, the presence of the vertical struts  will cause some vertical loads to pass through the struts  to reaction structure . In view of this situation, it may be necessary to ascertain the vertical loads passing through each of the struts . Such loads can be measured using a variety of techniques that include a load cell  operably coupled to the reaction structure , a load cell  in each strut  or a load cell  in the load path coupling each strut  to the vehicle  or coupler . Load cells , , and  enable the measurement of trembling or buffeting characteristics of the vehicle with stiff restraint of the vehicle. In the particular configuration illustrated, load cell  might be used to measure such loads in one or more directions of vertical (into the belt ), lateral (across the belt ), and longitudinal (orthogonal to lateral) orientation. When the struts  are not present such as in the case of the first test mentioned above, vertical loads can be obtained from the load cell  and\/or in combination with a suitable load cell coupled to each support  remote from the vehicle  such as at , which is coupled to the actuator  and support .","As indicated above, each support  is coupled to actuator  that can be used to lift the vehicle  off the belt  when desired and\/or can be used to adjust the ride height, control the ride height and\/or apply other vertical loads upon the vehicle during testing. It should be noted adjusting the ride height is to obtain a desired vertical position of the vehicle and then perform some form of testing at the selected ride height, while ride height control is a form of testing to control the vertical position so as to obtain a desired set-point of ride height, or to control the vertical position of the vehicle  to follow a command signal, which commonly involves a feedback loop measurement of position.","Actuator  like all actuators herein mentioned can be hydraulic, pneumatic and\/or electric. Commonly, a position sensor is provided to measure the position of the vehicle . Referring to , a camera  is provided and monitors a target  coupled to the vehicle  or end of the support , although other forms of electric (e.g. resistive, inductive or capacitive) or optical position sensors can be used.","In the embodiment illustrated, each support  is pivotally coupled to a support fixture  where an end of each support  remote from the vehicle  is coupled to the lift actuator . In view that each support pivots at or on a support fixture , it may be necessary to provide lateral compensation. In the embodiments illustrated in , compensation is provided by a lateral positioner  that can carry the lift actuator  and support fixture  as well as a load cell  that measures horizontal loads (generally transverse and\/or parallel to simulated vehicle motion) and a load cell  that measures vertical loads (generally orthogonal to simulated vehicle motion). The positioner  can take many forms as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Commonly, the positioner  includes two elements moving via a guide track under the control of an actuator with suitable sensors providing position information back to a controller  (). In a further embodiment, the lateral positioner  is also supported on platform  by a longitudinal positioner . Like the lateral positioner , the longitudinal positioner  can take many forms as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Commonly, the positioner  includes two elements moving via a guide track under the control of an actuator with suitable sensors providing position information back to the controller. The longitudinal positioner  allows longitudinal positioning of each corresponding support .","As appreciated by those skilled in the art, a particular advantage of the restraint  via the actuators  and positioners  allows the vehicle  to be lifted, serviced and then restored back to its previous position, thereby minimizing errors associated with having to conduct the same motions with different vehicle positioning and lifting configurations. Likewise, the ease in which the supports  and\/or struts  can be positioned (by positioner ) and\/or attached to the vehicle  with minimal modifications to the vehicle , makes the restraint  easy to apply, thus, it can be used on common vehicles (e.g. passenger automobiles and trucks). The fact that the restraint  need not be removed and\/or a separate lift mechanism be employed decreases downtime and increases testing efficiency.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["30","63","30","63","65","30","63","63","30","32","56"]},"If desired, characteristics of the airflow pass the support  can be adjusted so as to control operational characteristics of the support  such as but not limited to any forces and\/or other forms of compensation (e.g. damping) to be provided by the support . Attributes of the strut such as its geometry can be changed by manually or remotely adjusted control surfaces  located anywhere on the strut and\/or texture of the support . The control surfaces  can be adjusted by suitable actuators , if desired under the control of controller .","Also, if desired, the support  can include a compartment(s)  of size and shape to store components such as projection , wire , coupler , and\/or other components associated with use of the support . Storage of one or more of these components in the support  reduces the chances that the components are lost, thereby minimizing the time needed to deploy the support  when its use is desired.  illustrates another support  that can also restrain and\/or control the position of the vehicle  during testing as well as can lift the vehicle off the belt  for servicing if desired. It should be noted that elements identified with the same numbers perform the same function and have the same characteristics as that discussed above. In this embodiment, a lift actuator  is coupled to support , herein below upstanding projection ; however, such a location should not be considered its only position. Actuator  can be used to lift support , and thus, the vehicle for servicing as well as during testing such as to adjust or control ride height, and\/or provide a downwardly directed force. It should be understood that the actuator  can be used on the support  not having the upstanding projection  and cable or wire . Furthermore, as appreciated by those skilled in the art, the lift actuator  and its location along the longitudinal length of the support can also be used with the other support configurations described below. A lateral positioner  is coupled to an end of the support  remote from the coupler  and can move the support in the direction indicated by double arrow  as necessary. It should be noted that the surface  indicated in  and similar surfaces illustrated below in other figures are not intended necessarily to be an upper surface of the platform  in the wind tunnel, but rather, a surface of the platform , which could include a surface located below the upper surface. Hence, some of the components illustrated in  and other figures below would project up through the upper surface and typically each have a streamlined configuration. Alternatively, or in addition, portions of the support  such as positioner  illustrated in  and components in other figures may be outside the wind tunnel in a lateral direction away from the vehicle.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIGS. 9-12","FIG. 12"],"b":["69","13","22","70","16","22","13","22","70","72","74","32","32","78","72","80","80","32","32","34","74","86","72","80","80","74","13","13","86","88","88","74","13","88","88","80","80","90","90","92","90","90","70","72","80","80","92"]},"Other forms of supports similar to support  discussed above that can be used to form restraint assemblies are illustrated schematically in . It should be noted that elements identified with the same numbers perform the same function and have the same characteristics as that discussed above. Referring to , a support  includes lower extension , upper extension  and end assembly . However in this embodiment, lift actuator  and a positioning actuator  are coupled to a support , which can be fixed or fixable at a selected location. The positioning actuator  displaces a base  in a direction indicated by arrow , where the base  provides support for the pivoting connections A and B. Like the support  discussed above, support  can both lift a vehicle as well as apply downwardly directed forces upon the vehicle through coupler .","A support  illustrated in  is similar to support  of ; however the lift actuator  is coupled to support  with a cable or wire  rather than a stiff rod. Because of the cable or wire , support  and lift actuator  can be used to lift the vehicle, but downwardly directed forces can not be applied through coupler . Struts  as discussed above may need to be used to maintain the frame of the vehicle in a rigid state.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIGS. 15-18","b":["120","13","22","30","16","22","13","22","30","34","58","16","34","56","54","55"]},"In this embodiment, each support  includes a rotatable head  that partially rotates on each associated lift actuator . In addition, one or both supports  can include a length adjuster  that allows the length of the support  relative to the platform  generally and the lift actuator  specifically, to be adjusted. The adjuster  can take many forms. Herein, the adjuster  includes a member  slidable in a guide slot . The guide member  is mounted to the lift actuator , while the guide slot  is formed in the support ; however, if desired, the locations of the guide member and guide slot can be reversed. Locking devices having cooperating engaging members are integrated in the rotatable heads  and the adjusters  to lock the supports  in place.","It should be understood that use of the struts  is not limited to the restraint illustrated in , but rather can be used on any type of restraint such as those discussed above as well as all types of restraints even very simple restraints such as cables or poles (illustrated schematically in  at . As indicated above, struts  can be used to transfer or react vertical forces between the vehicle  (or any test article) and the moving belt , in a wind tunnel or not. In the embodiment illustrated, a longitudinal axis of each strut  is oriented so as to be orthogonal to the surface of the belt  and can be of fixed length or can be of adjustable length either manually or remotely. For instance, each of the struts can include components that can be interchanged with components of different length and\/or manipulated so as to adjust their length such as interlocking threads. Furthermore, one, but typically, two or more of the struts  can include an actuator  () that can be used to adjust the strut remotely. This is particular advantageous for it allows the vehicle height to be adjusted using any of the afore-mentioned restraints. Power to operate the actuator  (e.g. fluid power for pneumatic or hydraulic and\/or electrical power for electric actuators) can be placed in the vehicle and\/or suitable cabling can be provided that can extend from the vehicle to power sources and\/or control devices located outside the wind tunnel. Controller  schematically illustrates a device for controlling the operation of struts  that can be adjusted.","It should also be noted a fluid coupling  is not the only type of coupling that can be used to transfer forces to the belt . In yet other embodiments, one or more wheels or rollers can also be used.","Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For instance, although the foregoing embodiments each included two separate supports on each side of the vehicle, this should not be considered limiting. In further embodiments one or more supports can be provided on each side of the vehicle. In addition, each support may connect to one or more points on the vehicle."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 18"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
