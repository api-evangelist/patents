{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE REFERENCE NUMERALS"],"p":["1. Technical Field","The present invention relates to an electronic part and a connection structure of the electronic part. More particularly, the present invention relates to a connection structure for electrically connecting a terminal of a surface mounting electronic part to a circuit board.","2. Related Art","Various methods have been proposed as methods for electrically connecting a surface mounting part to a circuit board (see, for example, Patent Document 1). As described in, for example, Patent Document 1, a method in which a lead terminal of a transformer is fixed to a conductive pattern on a circuit board by solder and the like has been employed as a method for electrically connecting a surface mounting transformer to a conductive pattern formed on a circuit board. Other known methods include a method in which the lead terminal is laser-welded to the conductive pattern with a metal pad interposed therebetween, and a method in which the lead terminal is joined to the conductive pattern by a conductive adhesive.\n\n","However, in the method in which the surface mounting part is fixed to the circuit board by solder and the method in which the surface mounting part is joined to the circuit board by the conductive adhesive, joint failure may be caused due to warping or bending of the lead terminal that protrudes from the electronic part, and the joint portion is not so reliable. The method in which the surface mounting part is fixed to the circuit board by laser welding requires a metal pad, which increases the cost.","One or more embodiments of the present invention provides an electronic part including an electronic part body, an electrode terminal that protrudes from the electronic part body, and that electrically connects the electronic part to an external electrode when a flexible conductor is joined to an electrode surface, and a holder made of an insulating material, and joined to the electronic part body, characterized in that the holder is interposed between a mounting plate and the electronic part body when the electronic part is mounted to the mounting plate, and the holder is in contact with a surface of the electrode terminal opposite from the electrode surface.","According to such an electronic part, because the surface of the electrode terminal opposite from the electrode surface is in contact with the holder, the electrode terminal is less likely to be warped or bent. Thus, joint failure and the like are less likely to occur when the flexible conductor is joined to the electrode surface using a method such as ultrasonic joining. Since the holder is made of the insulating material, a metal plate having an excellent heat dissipation property can be used as the mounting plate to which the electronic part is mounted.","According to one or more embodiments of the present invention, a restricting portion that restricts movement of the electrode terminal in a direction away from the holder is provided in at least one of the holder and the electrode terminal in the above electronic part.","Thus, warping or bending of the electrode terminal can be more reliably suppressed when the flexible conductor such as a metal wire or a metal ribbon is joined to the electrode surface.","According to one or more embodiments of the present invention, in the above electronic part, the restricting portion is provided integrally with the electrode terminal, and lock the electrode terminal to the holder.","Thus, warping or bending of the electrode terminal can be reliably suppressed by a simple configuration when the flexible conductor such as a metal wire or a metal ribbon is joined to the electrode surface.","According to one or more embodiments of the present invention, in the above electronic part, the restricting portion is provided on a side of the holder, and holds the electrode terminal with the electrode surface being exposed.","Thus, warping or bending of the electrode terminal can be more reliably suppressed by a simple configuration when the flexible conductor such as a metal wire or a metal ribbon is joined to the electrode surface.","One or more embodiments of the present invention provides a connection structure of an electronic part, characterized by including: the electronic part; a mounting plate to which the electronic part is mounted; a circuit board that is mounted to the mounting plate at a different position from the electronic part; and a flexible conductor having its one end electrically connected to the circuit board, and having the other end joined to the electrode surface.","Connecting the above electronic part to the circuit board by this connection structure suppresses joint failure and the like when the flexible conductor is joined to the electrode surface. Moreover, since the holder is made of the insulating material, a metal plate having an excellent heat dissipation property can be used as the mounting plate to which the electronic part is mounted.","Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described. However, the following embodiments are not intended to limit the invention as defined in the claims. Not all the combinations of features described in the embodiments are required. In embodiments of the invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail to avoid obscuring the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIGS. 4 and 5"],"b":["100","100","100","500","200","120","100","400","300","500","210","200","100","500","210","300","500"]},"The electronic part  according to one or more embodiments of the present invention is a surface mounting transformer used in, for example, a control apparatus of a vehicular discharge lamp, and as shown in , includes an electronic part body , a plurality of electrode terminals  extending from a side of the electronic part body , and a holder  that is placed below the electronic part body  and joined to the electronic part body . Note that although this example shows the electronic part body  substantially in the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped, and the electronic part  having the plurality of electrode terminals  protruding from one side surface of the electronic part body , the shape of the electronic part body  and the number of electrode terminals  in the electronic part  are not limited to this example.","Each of the plurality of electrode terminals  is a conductor plate having a substantially rectangular cross section, and protrudes from a lower end of the side surface of the electronic part body  substantially in the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped perpendicularly to the side surface (parallel to a bottom surface). The holder  is made of for example, an insulating resin material, and is joined to the bottom surface of the electronic part body . In this example, the holder  extends to lower surfaces  of the electrode terminals , and is in contact with the lower surfaces .","In the case of using the electronic part  of this example in the control apparatus of the vehicular discharge lamp, the electronic part  is electrically connected to, for example, a circuit board mounted to a common mounting plate. Such a configuration is assembled by, for example, a method shown in . That is, as shown in , the electronic part  is first fixed on the metal base  by the adhesive , and as shown in , the circuit board  fixed on the metal base  at a different position from the electronic part  by the adhesive  is then connected to the electrode terminals  of the electronic part  by the metal ribbon . Note that the metal ribbon  is an example of a flexible conductor according to one or more embodiments of the present invention. The metal base  is an example of the mounting plate according to one or more embodiments of the present invention.","More specifically, as shown in , a tip end of the metal ribbon  pulled out from a ribbon guide  is first placed in contact with upper surfaces  of the electrode terminals , and the metal ribbon  is ultrasonically vibrated by a joining tool  to join the metal ribbon  to the upper surfaces  (electrode surfaces) of the electrode terminals . Then, the metal ribbon  is further pulled out from the ribbon guide , and is joined to a conductive pattern formed on an upper surface of the circuit board , in a manner similar to that described above.","Because the lower surfaces  of the electrode terminals  are in contact with the holder  as described above, the electrode terminals  are supported by the holder  from their lower sides when the metal ribbon  is ultrasonically joined to the upper surfaces  (the electrode surfaces) of the electrode terminals . Thus, the electrode terminals  are less likely to be warped or bent when joined to the metal ribbon , and thus joint failure and the like are less likely to occur. Moreover, since the holder  is made of an insulating material in this example, the electronic part  can be mounted to the metal base  having an excellent heat dissipation property.","The electronic part  in a form in which the electrode terminals  are fixed to the holder  will be described below.  is an enlarged view of a region near the electrode terminals  in the electronic part  in the form in which the electrode terminals  are fixed to the holder . Note that in , the holder  is shown by an imaginary line for convenience to describe a structure of the electrode terminal  (the same applies to ).","In the terminal structure shown in , the electrode terminal  has bifurcated tip ends . When the electronic part  is assembled, as shown in , the bifurcated tip ends  of the electrode terminal  are bent so that one of the bifurcated tip ends  is inserted in a terminal insertion hole  provided in the holder  and that the one of the bifurcated tip ends , together with the other bifurcated tip end , holds the holder .","Thus, the tip ends  of the electrode terminal  function as a restricting portion that restricts movement of the electrode terminal  in a direction (for example, upward) away from the holder . Forming the electrode terminal  of the electronic part  with such a terminal structure can prevent warping or bending of the electrode terminal  even if the electrode terminal  is pulled in the direction (for example, upward) away from the holder  when the metal ribbon  is joined to the upper surface  (the electrode surface) of the electrode terminal , whereby joint failure and the like are less likely to occur.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["120","100","120","130","127","120","110","120","127","132","130","127","132"]},"In the terminal structure shown in , a tip end  of the electrode terminal  is bent so as to contact a side surface of the holder , and the tip end  and the bent portion  of the electrode terminal  sandwich a part of the holder  therebetween. Thus, in the terminal structure of this example, the tip end  and the bent portion  of the electrode terminal  and the terminal insertion groove  of the holder  in which the bent portion  is inserted function as a restricting portion that restricts movement of the electrode terminal  in a direction (for example, upward) away from the holder .","Forming the electrode terminal  of the electronic part  with the terminal structure of this example can prevent warping or bending of the electrode terminal  even if the electrode terminal  is pulled in the direction (for example, upward) away from the holder  when the metal ribbon  is joined to the upper surface  (the electrode surface) of the electrode terminal , as in the above other example.
