The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to broadcast systems. More particularly, the present invention provides methods and apparatus for accessing synchronized data transmitted by a broadcaster in a broadcast system.","2. Description of the Related Art","In a conventional broadcasting system, a broadcaster transmits information in the form of audio, video, data, etc. over a medium such as air, cable, phone line (DSL, for example) that, in turn, can be received by any number of receivers. For example, transmitted radio waves can be received with a radio receiver tuned to a particular transmission channel. Using this conventional arrangement, typical broadcast communication is generally a one way medium since the receiver does not have control over the content nor the time of the broadcast transmission.","In a digital broadcast system, data can be transmitted in the form of data packets. One such data packet form is defined by the Encapsulated IP datagrams protocol, or by Streaming data in MPEG-2 Packetized Elementary Stream (PES). In the latter case, the transmitted data packets also have associated with them timing information indicating when a particular data packet is to be processed. For example, a Presentation Time Stamp (PTS) can be included in a data packet having a value indicating the time at which a unit of data is to be processed (presented). Such PTS values can be defined relative to a System Time Clock (STC), for example, as defined by ISO\/IEC 13818-1.","Data packets could have both internal and external timing requirements. For example, in the MPEG-2 Packetized Elementary Stream (PES) protocol, external timing requirements typically imply that data from one stream must be synchronized with another stream of data. Transmitted broadcast data containing any type of timing information indicating when data should be processed is referred to herein as \u201csynchronized data\u201d. Any type of timing information included in a data packet is referred to herein as a \u201ctime stamp\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","106","102","106","1","3","1","3","102","1","1","102","106"]},"As illustrated in , a broadcast channel  is subdivided into Video subchannel (V), an Audio subchannel (A), and two Data subchannels (Da and Db). A synchronized data packet with video, audio, data information, or any combination thereof, can be transmitted by the broadcaster through the appropriate sub-channel(s) and can be received by a receiver, such as a digital T.V. or analog T.V. with a proper decoder set-top box tuned to the particular broadcast channel. When the receiver is a digital T.V., circuitry within the digital T.V. processes the data portion of a data packet as well as the audio, and video information (if present) is transmitted in the respective subchannels based upon the corresponding time stamp. For example, processing the data packet  having video information (D) requires the T.V. receiver to process the video data in such a way that the corresponding video image is displayed on a monitor coupled to the T.V. receiver during a time interval based upon the associated time stamp (T). Thus, a T.V. receiver tuned to a particular channel must also access the associated synchronized data packet D and process the data included in the packet D all within the time constraints dictated by the time stamp T.","In a similar manner, data is transmitted in a synchronized data packet on a data subchannel such as Da and Db. In many applications, such as interactive T.V., during what is referred to as synchronized processing, one must be able to process the data included in a data packet according to the time constraint indicated by the time stamp. For example, in applications such as interactive T.V., data can be processed by an interactive application program that is running on the digital T.V. and presented with audio and video in a synchronized manner.","Unfortunately, with conventional models, accessing and processing of synchronized data is problematic. This is partly attributed to the fact that a receiver does not have control over the time and the amount of data that can be transmitted by the broadcaster. To elaborate,  illustrates a conventional T.V. receiver . A tuner  included in the T.V. receiver  is tuned to a desired broadcast channel and receives the broadcast information transmitted on that channel. A demultiplexer  is used to divide the broadcast information into subchannels video (V), audio (A), data (D)a, and data (D)b. In this arrangement, synchronized data packets are received by the receiver  via a data subchannel, such as subchannel Da.","Typically, data packets are received as a single stream of data. For example, data packets \u2013 are stored in a buffer . Typically, the receiver  checks the buffer  to determine whether data is available for processing. In conventional models, the receiver  starts accessing data from the buffer  and sequentially accesses data packets , , and  in the order that they are received. To elaborate, the receiver  accesses synchronized data D of data packet  and processes it during a time interval defined by the time stamp T. However, in some situations, data is transmitted at a higher rate than the receiver  can process it, in which case it is possible that the receiver  falls behind in processing. For example, while the receiver  is processing synchronized data packet , it is possible the time stamp T for processing and presentation of synchronized data packet  expires. Thus, the receiver  would be unable to process and present data in a timely manner since the data associated with the data packet  is lost.","One problem with conventional data accessing approaches is that buffer  has to be constantly checked to determine whether data is available for processing. This is an inefficient approach that wastes processing time. Another problem is that there is no mechanism to notify the receiver of loss of data, for example, as a result of buffer overwrite, due to a high transmission rate. Yet another problem is that when a receiver falls behind in processing synchronized data, there is no mechanism to allow the receiver to resynchronize with the broadcast transmission.","In view of the foregoing, there is a need for improved methods and apparatus for keeping track of and accessing synchronized data transmitted by a broadcaster.","Broadly speaking, the invention relates to methods and apparatus for accessing data that is transmitted by a broadcaster. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a receiver capable of accessing selected portions of synchronized data that is transmitted by a broadcaster in a broadcasting system is disclosed. The receiver includes a synchronized data accessing system capable of providing access to synchronized data transmitted by the broadcaster, the synchronized data accessing system providing an interface that can be used by a data requester to access synchronized data, wherein the data requester can initiate a request to access synchronized data using the interface and data can be made available and accessed by the data requester through the interface.","In accordance with another embodiment, a method of accessing synchronized data transmitted by a broadcaster in a broadcast system is disclosed. The method includes acquiring a listener interface, the listener interface providing an interface for a data requester to request access to synchronized data. The method further includes acquiring a point of access interface, the point of access interface allowing the listener to access synchronized data. In addition, the listener interface is linked to the point of access interface, as well as accessing synchronized data through the listener interface via the point of access interface.","The invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a computer system, an apparatus, and a method. Several embodiments of the invention are discussed below.","Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.","The invention relates to methods, apparatus, and data structures suitable for accessing synchronized data in a broadcast system. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a receiver capable of receiving synchronized data transmitted by a broadcaster is disclosed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300"]},"The receiver  includes a synchronized data accessing system  suitable for providing efficient access to synchronized data transmitted by a broadcaster. As illustrated in , the synchronized data accessing system  includes a synchronized data accessor  and a synchronized data provider . The synchronized data accessor  can receive a request  for accessing synchronized data transmitted on a particular broadcast service, e.g., a channel or subchannel. By way of example, the request  can be initiated by an application program that requires access to synchronized data transmitted on a particular channel.","The synchronized data accessor  can, in turn, request the synchronized data from the synchronized data provider . When synchronized data is transmitted and received, the synchronized data provider  can store it in a data storage buffer . After synchronized data is received, the synchronized data provider  notifies the synchronized data accessor  that data is available for access. In this way, synchronized data accessor  does not have to check for the arrival of data, thereby freeing the synchronized data accessor  to receive and initiate additional requests for access to synchronized data.","In the described embodiment, when a data arrival notification is received, the synchronized data accessor  notifies the original data requester (that can be, for example, an application program) that data is available for access. In this manner, a notification can be provided when data is ready for access so that an application program does not waste processing time determining whether data has arrived. Thus, an application program can efficiently access data and devote more time to other tasks.","In accordance with a particular embodiment of the invention using the data arrival notification, synchronized data provider  provides information including the time stamp and length of synchronized data that is available to be accessed. By providing information about the synchronized data that has been received, more flexibility in data access can be achieved. In addition, the information about synchronized data can be used to make more efficient data accessing decisions.","Furthermore, in case when data is unavailable, the synchronized data provider  can send an error notification to the data accessor . This error notification can be sent to a data requester (an application program, for example) so that the error can be handled accordingly. In accordance with one particular embodiment, synchronized data accessor  can also send a request to resynchronize data access. For example, the synchronized data provider  can be asked to send notification of the last synchronized data packet received. Advantageously, this enables a data requester to resynchronize with the broadcast transmission.","Although the synchronized data provider  is depicted to include a data storage buffer , it should be noted that data storage buffer  can reside outside of the synchronized data provider  without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. It should also be noted that besides a data storage device, other suitable mechanisms to store and pass data to synchronized data accessor  may be implemented.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","304","306","402","400","402","402","402"]},"In one embodiment, the synchronized data accessor  is implemented as an application programming interface (API). The API provides a listener interface that can be used to efficiently access synchronized data. The application program  can use the API to initiate one or more listeners, such as listeners  and . A listener, such as listener , can be used to provide access to synchronized data transmitted on a particular broadcast channel via a data subchannel, e.g., Da.","In addition to listeners, one or more points of access can be initiated and used to provide synchronized data access to the application program through a listener. Points of access \u2013 can be provided by synchronized data provider . In this embodiment, synchronized data provider  is implemented as a part of system software and is capable of providing a point of access for a listener.","A point of access, such as the point of access , can be designated and linked to a listener , thereby allowing the listener interface  to access synchronized data via the point of access . When synchronized data is received, it can be provided to the synchronized data provider . In one embodiment, synchronized data provider  can store synchronized data packets and make them available for access upon request. For example, synchronized data requested by listener  is maintained in data storage , and synchronized data requested by listener  is maintained in data storage , and so forth.","Advantageously, upon arrival of data, synchronized data provider  sends a notification to the appropriate listener. For example, when synchronized data packet  is received, a notification is sent to listener . In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the notification can include information such as the time stamp T and length of synchronized data D. The synchronized data accessor  can, in turn, notify the application program  that synchronized data has been received and is available for access through the data provider.","In addition, other information, such as the time stamp T and the length of synchronized data D, can be provided in the notification sent to the application program . This allows the application program  to take appropriate action based on the information that is provided by the synchronized data accessor . For example, the application program  can initiate a data access through the synchronized data accessor  by identifying a desired point of access. The application program  can choose to ignore a data arrival notification for a listener but initiate a data access request for data notified through another listener.","In accordance with one embodiment, the application program  can choose to access a portion of available data by providing an offset and the length of data to be accessed. In this manner, application program  has the flexibility to access data in segments and\/or choose to ignore a portion of data available in a synchronized data packet.","Furthermore, if application program  initiates access for data that is no longer available in the data storage , an error notification can be sent to the application program  so that appropriate error handling actions can be taken. For example, if synchronized data packet  is no longer available for access, perhaps due to a buffer overfill, an error notification can be sent to the application program .","In one embodiment, the application program can resynchronize with the broadcast transmission by sending a request to be notified of the last data available for access on a particular listener. For example, if application program  falls behind in processing synchronized data, it can send a request to receive notification of the last synchronized data packet received. The synchronized data provider  can allow access to the last synchronized data packet  received and continue sending notifications when the next synchronized data packet is available for access. In this way, the application program  can resynchronize with the broadcast transmission.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502"]},"Next, at operation , a point of access is acquired. In one embodiment, this point of access is an access interface defined in an object programming language such as C++, Java, etc. For example, in one particular embodiment, this access interface is a Java public abstract interface that can be provided as an access object to a listener.","The acquired listener interface is linked to the point of access, as noted at . In one particular embodiment, this linking operation is implemented as a Java method that registers the listener interface with the point of access interface to provide the listener with notification indicating the availability of data for access from the point of access.","Next, at , synchronized data is received and is available for access from the point of access interface. Upon arrival of synchronized data, a notification is sent to the appropriate listener to indicate availability of data, as noted in operation . The notification is sent to notify the listener that data can be transferred from the point of access. In one particular embodiment, this notification is implemented as a Java method for reception of a Java event that provides information such as the time stamp and length of a synchronized data packet that is available for access.","Finally, synchronized data is accessed through the point of access at . Synchronized data can be provided via the point of access and made available for access through the listener interface. In one embodiment, data access can be achieved as a read operation of an object programming language, for example, a Java read method.","Method  can be used by an application program or applet running on an operating system. An application program or applet can interface with a Virtual Machine running a Real-Time Operating System. In one embodiment, the application program or applet uses a Java T.V. Application Programming Interface (API) to access synchronized data transmitted by a broadcaster. The JAVA TV API is an extension of the JAVA platform developed by Sun Microsystems of Mountain View, Calif.","Although only a few embodiments of the present invention have been described, it should be understood that the present invention may be embodied in many other specific forms without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. By way of example, although method  has been set forth in terms of a particular sequential order for the purposes of this explanation, it should be apparent that in many cases the ordering is not critical. Some operations may be combined or eliminated and others may be parsed into multiple operations. For example, operation  can be implemented as a series of multiple access operations or may be eliminated since, in some cases, access to synchronized data may not be desired. The same functionality can also be obtained using different operations as well.","The invention has numerous advantages. One advantage is that data arrival notification can be provided to allow efficient access of synchronized data. Another advantage is that error notifications can be sent to allow appropriate error handling actions to be taken. Yet another advantage is that synchronized data can be accessed based on information, such as time stamp and length of synchronized data. Still another advantage is that cost effective and efficient solutions can be implemented to access synchronized data.","The many features and advantages of the present invention are apparent from the written description, and thus, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such features and advantages of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation as illustrated and described. Hence, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to as falling within the scope of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention will be readily understood by the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate like structural elements, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
