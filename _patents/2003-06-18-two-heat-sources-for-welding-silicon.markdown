No. 10\/135,072, filed Apr. 30, 2002 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,583,377, which is division of Ser. No. 09\/879,565, filed Jun. 12, 2001, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,914, which is a division of Ser. No. 09\/708,807, filed Nov. 8, 2000, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,284,997.","Parts of the invention described herein were made by employees of the United States Government and may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates generally to welding. In particular, the invention relates to welding together two silicon workpieces.","Large complex structures composed of semiconductor-grade silicon are being sought for purposes such as a wafer tower  illustrated orthographically in FIG.  and disclosed by Zehavi in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/292,491, filed Apr. 15, 1999, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,225,594. Boyle et al. disclose further details of such towers and their fabrication in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/608,557, filed Jun. 30, 2000, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The tower of the example includes two bases  and four legs  joined to the bases . A plurality of parallel teeth  with intervening slots are machined into each of the legs  to support a plurality of silicon wafers on the wafer tower  during medium or high temperature processing of the wafers, for example, for annealing at high temperatures or thermal chemical vapor deposition at somewhat lower temperatures.","It is desired that the tower and particularly its legs be composed of the same material as the wafers, that is, silicon, and that the silicon be of semiconductor grade, that is, be of very high purity. Semiconductor-grade silicon is available with impurity levels of less than 1 ppm (parts per million atomic), if concentrations of up to 100 ppm of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon are ignored, and sometimes the impurity levels are less than 1 ppb (parts per billion atomic). The impurity levels of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon are far less than 1% atomic, whereby silica, silicon nitride, and silicon carbide are excluded from being characterized as semiconductor-grade silicon. Virgin polysilicon is an especially pure form of silicon grown by thermal chemical vapor deposition using one of several forms of silane as the precursor gas. Silicon has a melting temperature of about 1416\u00b0 C. and remains strong and tough up to nearly that temperature. Thereby, silicon towers can be designed for extended use at high temperatures. The similarity of the materials of the support structure and of the supported workpieces minimizes differential thermal effects and eliminates contamination from non-silicon material. Furthermore, semiconductor-grade silicon with very low impurity levels is widely available at moderate cost in the form of virgin polysilicon. Support fixtures made of high-purity silicon reduce the danger of minute levels of impurities in the support structure diffusing into the semiconductor wafer and degrading its semiconductor characteristics.","Fabricating large complex silicon structures, however, has presented several challenging technical problems, particularly in joining two silicon members. Some type of fusion welding is desired both to maintain the low impurity levels in the joint and to assure that the joint remains joined at the extreme temperatures being contemplated. Zehavi has suggested laser welding. Plasma welding in an inert gas has also been suggested. While these methods have enjoyed some success, the reproducibility of the process and the overall strength of the weldment are still considered deficient.","A fundamental problem is that welding silicon with perhaps a silicon welding rod requires temperatures in excess of silicon's melting point. Tungsten inert gas (TIG) welders and plasma arc welders are well capable of achieving such temperatures at localized areas adjacent to the seam being welded. However, after the local area has been welded and the welding tip is moved further along the seam, the temperature of the region surrounding the already welded spot rapidly decreases. The resultant thermal stresses induced between hot and cold areas of the large silicon workpieces tend to crack the silicon near the welded seam. Although a cracked area does not unacceptably degrade the strength required for a structure supporting light silicon wafers, the cracks introduce a source of particulate contamination and also serve to initiate further fracturing of the assembled structure during repeated thermal cycling.","Ultrasonic welding of silicon solar cells is also known, but this method is not appropriate for the massive silicon bodies required in towers and similar large structures.","Accordingly, it is desired to achieve a method of joining large pieces of silicon that does not crack the silicon. It is further desired to achieve a joining method that can be used with high-purity silicon and does not significantly increase the silicon impurity level.","A method for welding silicon workpieces in which the workpieces are heated to at least 600 and preferably less than 900\u00b0 C. and then a separate welding operation is performed, for example, by electrical welding, plasma welding, or laser welding.","A resistively heated plate is brought into contact with at least one of the workpieces and current is passed through the plate to heat it. A more complexly shaped resistively heated plate may be used to conform to non-planar workpieces. The plate is preferably formed of semiconductor-grade silicon, preferably virgin polysilicon.","The workpieces may advantageously be formed of virgin polysilicon having a very low impurity level.","The welding may be autogenous or use a high-purity silicon filler rod.","A first embodiment of the invention is schematically illustrated in  for joining together two silicon bars ,  butted together along a seam . The support structure is not illustrated but is conventional. Anode contacts ,  are formed on the neighboring ends of the two bars , , and cathode contacts ,  are formed on the other ends of the bars , . The two anode contacts ,  are electrically tied to each other. A first DC heater power supply  has its negative terminal connected to the anode contact  of the first silicon bar , and a second DC heater power supply  has its negative terminal connected to the anode cathode contact  of the second silicon bar . The positive terminals of both power supplies ,  are commonly connected to the two cathode contacts , . Both heater power supplies ,  may be standard commercial DC welding power supplies. A single heater power supply  may be used if proper control is available to assure that nearly equal currents flow through the two silicon bars , . It is also possible in some circumstances to supply current to only one of the bars and rely upon thermal conduction and radiation to also heat the other one. If the bars have smooth sides and are tightly clamped together, sufficient electrical and thermal conductance between the two bars will distribute a single heating current between the bars.","A DC welding power supply  has its positive terminal connected to both the cathode contacts ,  and its negative terminal connected to the tungsten inert gas (TIG) head . The TIG head  has a structure schematically illustrated in  power supply lead  penetrates a shroud  and terminates in a tungsten tip  positioned above the weld spot. When the welding power supply  is electrically biased sufficiently with respect to the underlying workpiece, an arc  is formed between the tungsten tip  and the more positively biased workpiece. The arc  is very hot and can easily melt the underlying workpiece. An inert gas such as argon is supplied from a gas source  into the shroud  and surrounds the arc  with an inert shield to prevent the weld from becoming contaminated.","An alternative but related welding head is configured for plasma arc welding. A small flow of arc gas is flowed through an orifice adjacent the tungsten tip  to form the arc plasma. A shielding gas is flowed through an outer nozzle assembly encircling the tungsten tip  and arc gas orifice to shield the arc and weld zone. The arc gas may be the same as the shielding gas and may include one or more of the noble gases, particularly helium and argon, and may additionally include nitrogen and\/or hydrogen in proportions selected to optimize the weld. The plasma is initiated by an internal low-current pilot arc between the electrode and the arc orifice. The pilot arc ionizes the arc gas to ignite the primary arc between the electrode and the workpiece. The operation of this equipment may be manual or automated.","Plasma arc welding provides a very stable heat source for welding members of most metals having thicknesses in the range of 0.02 to 6 mm. This process offers advantages over other welding processes in its greater energy concentration, improved arc stability, higher heat content, and higher welding speed. However, plasma arc welding requires higher welding skill and more training than do other welding processes.","There are yet other welding processes, most of which are commonly referred to as electric welding. They include shielded metal arc welding, submerged arc welding, gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, electroslag welding, electroglas welding, resistance welding, flash welding, diffusion welding, friction welding, electron beam welding, and laser beam welding.","Returning to , a silicon filler rod  may be fed to the area between the tungsten tip  and the weld seam  to supply any additional silicon needed to fill the seam  and weld its two sides together. The end of the filler rod  is also melted by the TIG head . The silicon filler rod  should have at least the same purity level as the bars ,  being welded together. However, depending upon the geometry of the seam , it may be possible to weld without use of a filler rod and to rely upon excess silicon in the neighborhood of the seam , that is, autogenous welding.","In operation, the heater power supplies ,  supply sufficient current to the bars ,  to resistively heat them to at least 600\u00b0 C. We have found that 50 A of 25V DC power from each of the heater power supplies ,  is sufficient to heat the bars ,  to between 700 and 900\u00b0 C. These temperatures may be monitored either with a thermocouple or with a pyrometer. In practice, the color of the silicon is sufficient to visually indicate the broad range of heating temperatures in which the invention may be practiced. The heating current may produce higher temperatures in the bars ,  but below the silicon melting point. However, temperatures above 900\u00b0 C. subject the welding apparatus to temperatures typically considered to be excessively high. Once the bars ,  have been heated, about 10 to 30 A of current from the welding power supply  is sufficient to raise a localized area around a spot of the seam  above silicon's melting temperature and to thereby weld the bars ,  together. The TIG welder may be a spot welder that is slowly moved along the seam  to heat a localized area along the seam but to form a continuous weld bead as the TIG welder is slowly moved along the seam. The voltage across the welding power supply  depends in large part upon the position of the TIG head  between the cathode contacts ,  and the anode contacts ,  of the stronger heater power supplies , .","The current provided by the TIG head  further heats the neighboring areas of the silicon bars ,  through which it flows, thereby providing a more gradual temperature gradient. Furthermore, when the TIG head  is moved away from the recently welded areas, the weldment and surrounding silicon cools from at least 1416\u00b0 C. only to 600\u00b0 C. as a minimum, rather than to room temperature or thereabout as is typical in the prior art. Only after the seam has been completely welded are the welded bars ,  cooled down to room temperature by turning off the heater power supplies , . Thereby, the welded piece is cooled fairly uniformly, thus reducing the differential thermal expansion in this phase of the cooling.","The high-purity silicon desired for many applications may be a relatively electrically resistive material having a resistivity of usually 1 ohm-cm or greater, which at room temperature corresponds to a p-type boron concentration of about 1.5\u00d710cmor an n-type phosphorous concentration of 4\u00d710cm. However, at 600\u00b0 C., the intrinsic carrier density is already above 10cmand is rapidly climbing with temperature. At these carrier densities, the silicon is highly conductive electrically. Depending upon the impedance characteristics of the heater power supplies, it may however be necessary to externally heat the silicon bars to raise their temperature to a temperature range for which they may be resistively heated with a low-voltage power supply. For silicon with higher doping concentrations, initial heating of the silicon is not typically required.","Although an electrical current welder is preferred, it is possible to use an optical welder such as a laser in place of the TIG head and the second power supply. It is also possible to use AC power supplies rather than DC, but DC current is standard welding practice. The polarities for the welding currents may be rearranged. Yet other types of welders of the type listed above may be used.","The welder of  however suffers some drawbacks. Low-impedance electrical contacts need to be made with the silicon workpieces being welded. The contacting process takes time. Furthermore, the contacts require electrical contact to a metallization such as molybdenum. During the high-temperature processing contemplated, the metallization atoms may thermally diffuse into the bars, thus increasing the levels of impurities in the high-purity silicon bars.","Another embodiment of a silicon welding apparatus schematically illustrated in  includes a silicon heater plate , which supports the silicon bars ,  arranged to have the seam  between them extending along a longitudinal axis of the heating plate . The silicon heater plate  may be a generally uniform block of silicon, which should have a relatively high purity level, such as is available with virgin polysilicon. Depending upon the application, it may be desirable to include a small amount of semiconductor doping in the heating plate  to facilitate its resistive heating. In other applications, such as welding very high-purity virgin silicon for contacting wafers, even dopants are not desired. Other impurities such as heavy or alkali metals should be minimized in the silicon heating plate .","The heating plate  may be supported on two molybdenum rods ,  to provide thermal isolation over the welding table. Electrical isolation may also be required. A cathode contact  and an anode contact  are affixed to opposite ends of the silicon heating plate  along the plate's longitudinal axis. The heater power supply  is connected across the heating plate  through the cathode and anode contacts , . No fixed electrical contacts need to be made to the silicon bars , . The TIG welding apparatus include the TIG head  and welding power supply  and possibly the high-purity, semiconductor-grade silicon filler rod . These elements are positioned similarly as in , but the negative terminal of the welding power supply  is connected to the anode contact  of the heater plate .","To begin the silicon welding, the heater power supply  is turned on to heat the silicon heater plate  and the supported bars ,  to at least 600\u00b0 C. and preferably 700 to 900\u00b0 C. Once the workpiece temperature has equilibrated, the welding power supply  is turned on to commence welding along the seam . The welding current depends on the size of the workpieces; however, a welding current of 30 A has been observed to be generally sufficient. As in the embodiment of , the welding head  raises the local temperature to above 1416\u00b0 C. to weld the two bars ,  together across the seam .","The welding apparatus of  has several advantages. The electrical contacts need to be made only once to the heater plate, and the silicon bars can be quickly placed on and removed from the heater plate. Furthermore, the absence of electrical contact to the bars significantly eliminates contact metallization as a source of contamination. A further advantage of the configuration of  is that the welding current is grounded through the heater plate  and enters the heater plate  through an interface area having a dimension commensurate with the thickness of the bars , . As a result, the area around the weld has a more uniform temperature distribution. In contrast, when the welding current is grounded along the longitudinal axes of the bars, as in , the weld defines a boundary in the bars of a sudden change in longitudinally conveyed welding current. However, the temperatures at the interface between the bars ,  and the heater plate  are far below the temperatures required for welding so that the bars ,  can be easily removed from the heater plate  once they have cooled.","The welding apparatus of  has been successfully used to weld together two virgin polysilicon bars having widths and thicknesses of about 1 cm and lengths of about 10 cm. The resulting weld bead is smooth and continuous. When the bead is polished down to the level of the bars, a continuous, uniform, and crack-free material is observed.","The apparatus of  is relatively simple, but allows welding of planar stock pieces. One use is forming the silicon bases of the tower of  for use with 300 mm (12 inch) wafers. Such bases need to have diameters in the range of at least 325 mm. Czochralski-grown monocrystalline silicon has been grown in such sizes, but its availability is sporadic and it is very expensive. Virgin polysilicon is the preferred form of silicon for such towers, but the diameter of ingots commercially available at present is limited to about 150 mm.","Boyle et al. have disclosed in the above cited reference how virgin polysilicon can be cut and machined. These methods are used to cut the 150 mm-diameter virgin polysilicon rods into plates having the required length and thickness but of width substantially less than 325 mm. The welding apparatus of  may then be used to weld together two or more of these plates to form a base with the required diameter of 325 mm.","The welding of the parts of the silicon tower  of  is facilitated by the use of a somewhat more complex welding apparatus. Typically, the mortise holes formed in the bases  are precision machined to provide only 1 mil (25 \u03bcm) of clearance for the legs  being fit into the holes. As a result, heating of one of the bases  will effectively heat the end of the leg  fit in the base .","In one approach, similar to the welding apparatus of , heating current is supplied directly to each base. For example, four contacts may be made to the sides of the base  in respective areas adjacent to the hole in which the legs  are fit. For the welding of a particular leg , current is supplied to the adjacent contact, and one or more of the other contacts sink the current. The area around the welded joint is fairly uniformly heated.","Another approach is particularly applicable when, as illustrated in the cross-sectional view of , the tower leg  includes a smaller tenon  on its end, and the base  includes a stepped mortise hole  that penetrates through the base  and tightly receives the leg  and its tenon  with a small axially extending gap  therebetween, for example, a 25 \u03bcm gap. A silicon heater collar , additionally illustrated in the cross-sectional view of  taken along line \u2014 of  has a rectangular cross section and extends along a U-shaped axis that allows it to be fit around the leg  while it remains in contact the bottom surface of the base . The collar  may be clamped to the underside of the base  or the base  may rest on and supported by the collar . In either case, the collar  physically contacts the base . The silicon heater collar  is preferably formed of high-purity, semiconductor-grade silicon, just as for the silicon heater plate  of FIG. .","Electrodes ,  are connected to the heater power supply to allow heating of the collar  to an elevated of 600 to 900\u00b0 C. Since the collar  is in intimate contact with the base , the region of the base  around the collar  is similarly heated. Further, since only the narrow gap  exists between the base  and the leg , particularly its tenon , the leg tenon  is heated to nearly the same temperature.","After these bodies have been heated, an electric or plasma welding tip is applied to the area of the gap  at the top surface of the base  to form a weld . The weld  forms as a protruding bead and a portion extending at least 25 \u03bcm below the surface. It is particularly advantageous if, as illustrated, the tenon  is sufficiently long that it protrudes slightly beyond the top surface of the base . The protruding portion can provide a source of silicon to form the weld so that no silicon filler rod is required for the welding. After completion of the welding, the area of the base around the weld is polished to remove the bead and the protruding end of the tenon and to form a smooth surface with the base . Although in the typical worst case only a 25 \u03bcm-deep weld may remain, this depth is sufficient to provide the required rigidity and strength to the structure because the close fit of the leg  into the bottom portion of mortise hole  prevents significant flexing of the leg  relative to the base . However, if desired, the bottom corner  of the base mortise hole  may be similarly welded to the leg  by moving the silicon heater collar  to the top of the base  or employing other means to heat the top of the base .","The welding process of the invention can be applied to joining silicon members to form other structures than wafer towers and boats. Such boats and towers may be supported on silicon pedestals, be surrounded by silicon liners, or be enclosed in silicon tubes. Processing gas may be injected into such thermal processing units from silicon injectors or nozzles, and the gas may be supplied from the bottom of a tall furnace through silicon tubes. Silicon paddles or sleds may be used to transfer wafers to and from such towers or to and from single-wafer pedestals. Another class of structures include showerheads and gas diffusers related to one disclosed by Degner et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,074,456, which may be formed by welding a thin perforated silicon disk to a silicon ring support frame. Plasma processing chambers may be formed with silicon roofs or silicon walls. The susceptors or wafer chucks supporting wafers in thermal or plasma chambers may be formed of silicon parts. Silicon targets used for physical vapor deposition of silicon may be welded to silicon backing plates. Sharp silicon tips may be disposed in clean rooms to drain electrostatic charge.","It is thus seen that fairly standard welding equipment can be used to form a strong, high-purity, high-temperature, crack-free seam between silicon members being permanently joined together."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00015","num":"00015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00016","num":"00016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00017","num":"00017"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00018","num":"00018"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00019","num":"00019"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00020","num":"00020"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["6","6","5"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
