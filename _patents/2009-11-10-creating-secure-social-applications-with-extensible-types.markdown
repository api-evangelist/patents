title: Creating secure social applications with extensible types
abstract: A social environment is provided by creating an object in response to recognition of an entity in a portion of web content, wherein the object represents the entity, the object is associated with a type selected from a set of types, and the type is associated with a schema selected from a set of schemas, where the social environment includes a set of objects including the object, wherein the objects are instances of corresponding types in a rich system of predefined types, the schemas are associated with the types, metadata is associated with the objects, and there is at least one relationship between at least two objects selected from the set of objects, where the set of objects and the metadata are extensible, such that extensions provided by a first user are available for use by a second user. In one example, metadata provided by a first user is only available to a second user having a relationship with the first user.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims benefit to provisional application U.S. Ser. No. 61\/174,392, filed Apr. 30, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","1. Field","The present application relates generally to computer-based systems and applications, and more specifically to online social networking.","2. Related Art","The use of computer-implemented objects to represent items on the World Wide Web is known in the art. An object may represent a real-world item and may have attributes, e.g., associated values, which describe the item. For example, each item for sale on an auction site such as eBay\u00ae may be represented by an object having attributes such as name, price, seller, and the like. As another example, each type of item for sale on an online shopping site, such as Amazon.com\u00ae, may be represented by an object having attributes such as name, price, quantity in stock, customer rating, and the like. As yet another example, each person on a social networking web site may be represented as an object having attributes such as name, email address, interests, location, and friends.","Each object may be unconstrained by a type, or may be an instance of a type that specifies the particular attributes that are associated with objects of the type. Such type information may include a \u201cschema\u201d that, in one aspect, defines a template for the attributes of the type. The schema may be, for example, a list of attribute names and corresponding attribute types. The attribute types may be omitted, in which case the attributes may be represented as string values, or other types of values, and the attributes may all have the same type, or no specific type. For example, an auction listing type may be associated with a schema specifying that a name, price, and seller are to be associated with each object of the auction listing type. The schema may specify types for the name, price, and seller attributes, e.g., string, numeric, and string, respectively. If the schema does not specify types for the attributes, the attributes may be represented as, for example, string values. The schema may be used, for example, in displaying the object and collecting information about the object. The schema may also be used for data validation purposes, e.g., to verify that the necessary attributes are filled in and used for each object of the type. Existing online services allow users to create and modify objects, e.g., items for sale on eBay, or reviews on Yelp\u00ae.","The World Wide Web is evolving into a dynamic repository of information on virtually every topic, including people, and their connections to each other and to online content. Such online content is represented as structured data, which allows users to create, reference, annotate, and interact with objects in a web-site-independent manner to create semantically rich content. Structured data is increasingly the focus of consumption by users, as more and more aspects of daily life migrate online. Exemplary types of structured data include information about entities such as restaurants, products, songs, videos, finance, user profiles, social networks, and the like.","In one example, a method of providing a social environment includes creating an object in response to recognition of an entity in a portion of web content, wherein the object represents the entity, and the web content is presentable to a first user of a web browser. The method further includes associating metadata with the object and with the first user, wherein the metadata is visible to a second user if the second user has a relationship with the first user, and the metadata is not visible to the second user if the second user does not have a relationship with the first user.","For instance, an object may be created in a portion of web content, wherein the object represents the entity, and the web content is presentable to a first user of a web browser. Metadata may be associated with the object and with the first user, wherein the metadata is visible to a second user if the second user has a relationship with the first user. The second user may be determined to have a relationship with the first user if the second user is a friend of the first user in the social environment, member of a common group (e.g., company, school, family, interest group or the like), and so on. The metadata may include ratings, tags, text, and attention data, or a combination thereof.","The object may include or represent a person, place, or thing. The entity may include a first text string, and the web content may include a second text string, and recognition of the entity may occur in response to the first text string matching at least a portion of the second text string.","In one example, the method further includes searching the web content for a reference to the object in response to receipt of the content by the web browser, and causing display of supplemental information in the web browser in response to the reference to the object being present in the content, wherein the supplemental information is based upon metadata associated with the object, and the supplemental information is associated with the object in the web browser. The reference to the object may include a name of the object, an identifier associated with the object, or a combination thereof. Further, the object may include an instance of a corresponding type in a rich system of predefined types, and the object and the metadata may be extensible, such that extensions provided by a first user via a first computer are available for use by a second user via a second computer.","Additionally, in other aspects of the present invention, apparatuses, systems, interfaces, and computer readable storage media having computer readable instructions are provided for providing a social environment as described herein.","The following description is presented to enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of particular applications and their requirements. Various modifications to the embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Moreover, in the following description, numerous details are set forth for the purpose of explanation. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the invention might be practiced without the use of these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order not to obscure the description of the invention with unnecessary detail. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","170","152","184","172","170","102","170","152","103","108","161","184","108","184","108","108"]},"Each object includes one or more attributes, which are, for example, name-value pairs, e.g., \u201cprice=500\u201d, where price is the name and 500 is the value. Users may modify the values of the attributes (e.g., by setting the value of the \u201cprice\u201d attribute to 600) and add additional attributes as long as the attributes conform to the schema.","A \u201ctype\u201d has a name and is associated with a schema that includes one or more attribute names. Each of the objects  is an instance of a type that associates the object with a schema  selected from a set of schemas . For example, objects  that represent cameras may be associated with, i.e., instances of, a \u201ccamera\u201d type. The camera type has a camera schema , which has three elements: model_name, manufacturer, and price. An exemplary object that represents a camera includes the values D60, Nikon, and $999, respectively. This object is an instance of the camera type, which associates the object with the camera schema. Types may be understood as templates for objects, and schema elements may be understood as attributes without particular values, i.e., templates for attributes. Schema elements may be associated with default values. Each element may have an associated type, e.g., string, integer, floating-point, or a type schema-based type. Schemas may also be identified by, for example, global names that are meant to be globally-unique across the Web. A schema may be used, for example, to prompt users for attribute values, and may also be used to validate objects  to ensure that the attributes conform to the schema.","Constraints may be placed on the attributes by a schema associated with the object. An object's schema specifies one or more attributes that may be associated with the object. Schemas may have derived from existing schemas to produce derived schemas that add additional attributes to the existing schemas. For example, a derived schema \u201cdigital_camera\u201d derived from the schema \u201ccamera\u201d may add a \u201cmegapixels\u201d element to the camera schema, so that the digital camera schema includes the attributes model_name, manufacturer, price, and megapixels.","Although the schema and values that have been used to populate the schema are a kind of metadata, the term \u201cmetadata\u201d as used herein refers to particular kinds of information that may be associated with most types of objects. The term metadata as used herein refers to information about objects, and includes ratings, tags, attention information, text, and the like. This metadata may have a schema, which may be associated with a base object type from which most object types are derived (i.e., extended), so that the particular metadata schema, e.g., a rating schema, is shared by most object types. Thus schemas for metadata are extensible by users in the same way that schemas of other types of objects are extensible. In one example, the schemas and metadata are available to other users having a relationship with the user associating the metadata with objects.","With a global object model in place, it becomes possible to associate certain types of metadata with most or all objects. On today's web, there are at least four metadata types that apply broadly to object types, as follows. One type is a rating, e.g., three stars, thumbs up, and related forms of positive or negative feedback on a piece of content. Another type is a tag, which is, for example, a short textual word or phrase associated with an object to support retrieval or sharing. Another type of metadata is user attention data, which indicates that, for example, a particular user viewed an object, clicked on it, or interacted with it so as to imply some level of satisfaction or interest. Another type of metadata is text, such as a review, comment, or other piece of textual information associated with the object.","In one example, users may update, i.e., change or extend, schemas of objects. In particular, users may update the schema of an object, the attribute values of an object, or both. A user interface provides graphical tools for creating and extending types by defining schemas, copying schemas to produce new schemas, and modifying schemas by adding or removing attributes. The user interface shows a list of existing types, and a user may select an existing type to subclass by adding new attributes. Users can create new types and make those types available for use by other users.","The objects  may include representations of users , groups  of users, web pages , local listings , products , lists , guides , and user-defined objects . In one example, the groups  may be groups of objects  or groups of users . Each of the groups  may include multiple users  or objects , and may translate requests and operations on the group to corresponding requests and operations on each of the users or objects in the group. The local listings  may include, for example, names, addresses, ratings, and reviews of businesses, such as restaurants, events, and attractions in a geographical region. The products  may include, for example, names, descriptions, prices, ratings, and reviews of products, such as digital cameras. The lists  may be, for example, lists created by users that list other objects, such as a list of favorite restaurants, or a list of digital camera accessories. The guides  may be, for example, descriptions of a topic that reference other objects, such as a guide to places of interest in a city, or a guide to books written by an author. The user-defined objects  may be objects that represent any type of entity, where the objects  are associated with schemas  defined by users.","In one example, the social environment  also includes social logic , e.g., computer program code, which processes requests from application programming interfaces  and provides the operations necessary to implement the application programming interfaces  by, for example, creating, updating, and retrieving the objects . The social logic  may also generate notifications  that are delivered and\/or displayed to users in response to such creating, updating, retrieving, and other operations for which users may desire to receive notification.","The social environment  provides the objects, users , groups , and metadata  to application programming interfaces  (\u201cAPI's\u201d). The API's  may be used by application programs, such as social application , to access the objects, users, groups, and metadata. The social applications  are shown on the server computer  in this example, but in other examples may be located on other computers, such as the client computer , and may communicate with the social environment through the network  using, for example remote procedure calls (RPC). In another example, the API  may be located on other computers, e.g., co-located with the social applications  on another computer, and the API  may use RPC to communicate with the social environment . In other examples, the components of the social environment may be distributed among multiple computers.","The metadata  includes information about the objects . In one example, the metadata  is provided by or based upon actions of the users . The metadata  may include, for example, ratings (e.g., number of stars), tags, attention (e.g., number of clicks on an object), text (e.g., a review or comment), and routes (e.g., a route between two places).","In one example, the API's  include a login API  for processing user name and passwords to authenticate a user, a Create\/Update objects API  for processing requests to create, update, and delete objects, a subscribe interface  for creating vitality streams that provide notifications  of events and operations on objects, and a search API  that provides a search feature for searching the objects , users , groups , and metadata  for information specified in a search query. The social applications  include a Home application , an Objects application , a Toolbar , a Lists and Guides application , and Third-party applications . The API's  and social applications  are not limited to the particular examples shown here. For example, a user may create additional social applications  by writing program code that invokes the API's  to provide features not described herein.","On the client computer , a web browser  (or other application) executes and interacts with the user  via user interfaces that are, for example, computer program code that displays and receives information to and from the user  using a display device and an input device, respectively, of the client computer . In one example, the user interface code and associated data necessary for presenting the user interfaces, are provided by the server computer  to the client computer  via the network . The user interface code is executed by the client computer  when, for example, the user  request the user interface(s) or visits a web page that includes the interface(s). In the example of , the web browser or application  may provide a Home user interface  for the home application , an Objects user interface  for the objects application , a toolbar user interface , for the toolbar application , a Lists and Guides user interface  for the Lists and Guides application , and a third-party application user interface  for the third-party applications . The user interfaces receive information from the user as needed by the corresponding application, and display information generated by the corresponding application.","In one example, a social environment may be created by creating a set of objects in response to recognition of an entity in a portion of web content, wherein the objects represent the entity, the objects are associated with corresponding types selected from a set of types, and the types are associated with corresponding schemas selected from a set of schemas. The social environment includes the set of objects that are instances of corresponding types in a rich system of predefined types. A set of schemas is associated with the set of types, metadata associated with the set of objects, and at least one relationship between at least two objects selected from the set of objects. The set of objects and the metadata are extensible, such that extensions provided by a first user are available for use by a second user. In one aspect, a first type is an extension of a second type if the second type includes all attributes of the first type. An extended type such as the second type may be substituted for the first type in operations that accept the first type. The extended types are referred to herein as subtypes. Subtypes create a type hierarchy as known to those skilled in the art.","In one example, the object types are members of a rich system of predefined types. A rich system of predefined types is, for example, a set of types that represent entities in particular subject domains, which are also known as \u201cvertical domains\u201d. Examples of vertical domains include particular industries, e.g., finance, energy, transportation, and the like, and more specific subjects within those industries, e.g., banking, oil, and air cargo, respectively. The entities in a domain may be any objects of use in modeling activities or data in that domain, e.g., bank account entities in a banking domain might by represented by a Bank Account type that has a schema with attributes for an account name and an account balance. Users may create objects that are instances of the Bank Account, e.g., a particular user's bank account. Users may also create subtypes of the Bank Account type, e.g., a Checking Account type that extends the Bank Account type and adds attributes specific to checking account to a schema associated with the Checking Account type, e.g., lists of pending and paid checks.","A global name may be associated with an object. A global name may enhance the social interactions that can be achieved by multiple users creating and enhancing meaningful descriptions of these objects. An object may be referred to by a URL, e.g., the URL of a digital camera, but it is considerably more difficult to refer to a digital camera in a way that is common across different web sites. A camera, like many of the objects we wish to interact with online, is not ordinarily a first-class object in today's web. Even if a human correctly interprets a URL object reference, a web search is unlikely to generate all existing references (e.g., all discussions, reviews, and pricing) to the underlying object. The same is true for other types of objects, such as movies, restaurants, and people. With a canonical reference scheme for certain key types of objects, new capabilities would be enabled. For example, a camera object may be referred to by the canonical reference http:\/\/biz.yahoo.com\/e\/070228\/ebay10-k.html.","Objects can aggregate metadata and consumption patterns from across the web. Objects can expose web service calls providing information necessary to display the object on a page in a remote website, and remote applications can benefit from the presence of a repository of structured data. If the display information contains capabilities allowing users viewing the display to potentially contribute ancillary metadata (reviews, ratings, etc) back into the repository, then an ecosystem may merge around the universe of objects. Once the simple objects are in place, it becomes easier to create richer compound objects with embedded references to other objects. A compound object may be as simple as an event object that contains references to a venue, or as sophisticated as a guidebook capturing the HDTV market, with embedded references to relevant models, manufacturers, and distributors.","While individual users may benefit from accessing information about an object, and may in some cases be willing to contribute related information back to the object repository, there are other use cases in which an entire community comes together around a set of objects. This could be an auto enthusiast community referencing object of type vehicle, or a community around tech gizmos, or a community of geographically proximate users who like restaurants.","In one example, a group may be defined that includes multiple objects, wherein a reference to the group refers to all objects in the group. The group may represent a buddy list and\/or a list of people in a social network. In another example, a compound object may be defined that includes multiple objects. The compound object may be a list of objects. The list may represent, for example, a walking tour, a how-to guide, and the like.","In one example, a \u201cvitality stream\u201d of notification messages may be generated for events or operations objects and\/or users. The notification may represent, for example, creation of an object, update of an object, deletion of an object, and\/or a news item. Events related to an object may be delivered to at least one user in response to receiving a subscription request from the user, where the subscription request includes a subscription condition. If the subscription condition is satisfied for a particular event, then that event is to be delivered to each user who subscribed to the event. A subscription processor is created for delivering the at least one event to the receiver in response to the at least one event satisfying the subscription condition and the entitlement condition. The receiver may be, for example, a user. The receiver may be a group, and the subscription processor may deliver the event to a user, where the user is a member of the group.","Content may be searched for a reference to an object in response to receipt of the content by the Web browser. Supplemental information may then be displayed for the object in response to the reference to the object being present in the content, where the supplemental information is based upon metadata associated with the object. The reference to the object may include a name of the object and\/or an identifier associated with the object. The object may represent a person, place, or thing. The metadata may include ratings, reviews, and\/or supplemental text. The searching may be implemented by a browser toolbar that invokes an external search engine.","User-provided information may be associated with at least one object that corresponds to content displayed in a Web browser by receiving selection of a reference to an object, where the reference is displayed in the content, receiving metadata for the object from a user, and associating the metadata with the object. This association method may be implemented by a browser toolbar.","A portable social environment may be implemented by providing to a remote application an interface for accessing objects and groups of objects associated with a user identifier, where the interface includes operations for searching, retrieving, and updating the objects and the groups of objects via network requests, the interface is able to receive the user identifier from the remote application, and the interface is also able to control access to the objects and the groups of objects associated with the user identifier in accordance with an access control rule, and the interface enables a third party to access the objects and group of objects. The interface may provide notification events. The access control rule may grant access to at least one user-specified object. The access control rule may grant access to a user-specified object to a user-specified second user and\/or group. The network requests may be, for example, TCP\/IP messages and\/or HTTP requests.","An interface for creating, updating, and searching for objects in a social environment may include a search component for receiving a search string, performing a search operation, and displaying results of the search operation; a create object component for creating a new object based upon user input, an update object component for updating an existing object based upon user input, and a metadata component for associating metadata with an existing object based upon user input.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["204","206","214","222"]},"The metadata stored in the object repository  is made available to multiple users, including the users associated with the browsers , , , and  (in one example, metadata associated with an object by a first user is available only to other users having a relationship with the first user). The social networking system shown in  includes groups , which are collections of user objects, a browser , e.g., a Web browser, for user interaction, a vitality\/feed server , for generating notifications of changes to data stored in the object repository , an identity server for storing user identification information, and remote browsers , ,  through which users may browse the objects, receive notifications, and create content to be stored in the repository, such as objects, schemas, and metadata.","Multiple different users may add attributes to a schema, and the added attributes appear for use by other users. In one example, users are prevented from removing attributes from schemas, so that schemas remain backward compatible. For example, if a first user named \u201cA\u201d creates the camera schema introduced above, the camera schema will be stored in the object repository . A second user \u201cB\u201d may then retrieve the camera schema from the object repository , e.g., by name, or by receiving a reference to the schema from the first user. The camera schema has three attributes (model_name, manufacturer, and price) and those three attributes are \u201cvisible\u201d, i.e., accessible, to both users. The attributes may have associated data types, e.g., string, string, and integer, respectively, in the camera example. The first user may create an object as an instance of the camera schema. For example, the first user may create an object named CasioExilim with the attributes model_name=Exilim, manufacturer=Casio, and price=199.95. The CasioExilim object is stored in the object repository  and is visible to the second user upon completion of the store operation. The second user may retrieve the CasioExilim object via a search, e.g., by searching for objects that contain the string \u201cCasio\u201d. The second user may also receive the CasioExilim object from another user, or may receive the object in a notification. For example, the second user may subscribe to notifications about objects being created, and the notifications that the second user receives may be constrained to notifications that include the word \u201cCasio\u201d.","In one example, different users may add attributes or metadata to a schema, and the added attributes or metadata only appear or are visible to other users having a relationship or associated with the user adding the attribute or metadata. For instance, an object may be created in a portion of web content, wherein the object represents the entity, and the web content is presentable to a first user of a web browser. Metadata may be associated with the object and with the first user, wherein the metadata is visible to a second user only if the second user has a relationship with the first user and not visible to the second user if the second user does not have a relationship with the first user. The second user may be determined to have a relationship with the first user if the second user is a friend of the first user in the social environment, member of a common group (e.g., company, school, family, interest group or the like).","A user may extend a schema, and the changes, e.g., a new schema that extends the original schema, are visible to all users. For example, if user B creates a new schema named digital_camera, and adds a \u201cmegapixels\u201d attribute to the schema (e.g., of type integer), then the digital_camera schema is stored in the object repository  and made available to other users. Other users may retrieve or be notified of the existence of the digital_camera schema as described above for the camera schema. For example, user A may search for camera schemas (e.g., containing the string \u201ccamera\u201d) or for camera objects. A search for camera schemas will return the camera and digital_camera schemas. A search for camera objects, e.g., objects that are instances of the camera schema, will return any objects that use the camera or digital_camera schema as their schema. For example, if user A retrieves the digital_camera schema from the object repository , and creates an instance named CanonElph, with the megapixels attribute set to 12, then the CanonElph object will be stored in the object repository , where it may be retrieved by other users, such as user A. User A, or another user, may then extend the camera schema by adding more attributes, and may also extend the digital_camera schema by adding more attributes. Objects that are instances of a previous version of a schema have empty or undefined values for attributes that were added after the schema was created. In one example, a version number is associated with each version of a schema, and each object includes the version number of the schema from which the object was created. The version numbers may optionally be used to enable modifications of schemas beyond addition of attributes (e.g., to enable deletion and modification of attributes), in which case an object uses only the schema version for which the object is created, or a derived schema that is compatible (i.e., has no changed or removed attributes) with the schema version for which the object is created.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3D","FIG. 3A"],"b":["302","302","304","310","306","306","302","308"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["310","310","304","310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 3C","b":["312","312","306","312","312"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 3D","b":["314","314","308","314","314"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-4C","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B"],"b":["402","409","402","408","402","408","404","402","406","408","408","408","408"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":["402","412","410","402","412"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 4C","b":["402","422","420","402","422"]},"While the invention has been described in terms of particular embodiments and illustrative figures, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the invention is not limited to the embodiments or figures described.

Examples of communications interface  can include a modem, a network interface (such as an Ethernet or other NIC card), a communications port (such as for example, a USB port), a PCMCIA slot and card, etc. Software and data transferred via communications interface  are in the form of signals which can be electronic, electromagnetic, optical or other signals capable of being received by communications interface . These signals are provided to communications interface  via a channel . This channel  may carry signals and may be implemented using a wireless medium, wire or cable, fiber optics, or other communications medium. Some examples of a channel include a phone line, a cellular phone link, an RF link, a network interface, a local or wide area network, and other communications channels.","In this document, the terms \u201ccomputer program product,\u201d \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d and the like may be used generally to refer to media such as, for example, memory , storage device , or storage unit . These and other forms of computer-readable media may be involved in storing one or more instructions for use by processor , to cause the processor to perform specified operations. Such instructions, generally referred to as \u201ccomputer program code\u201d (which may be grouped in the form of computer programs or other groupings), when executed, enable the computing system  to perform features or functions of embodiments of the present invention. Note that the code may directly cause the processor to perform specified operations, be compiled to do so, and\/or be combined with other software, hardware, and\/or firmware elements (e.g., libraries for performing standard functions) to do so.","In an embodiment where the elements are implemented using software, the software may be stored in a computer-readable medium and loaded into computing system  using, for example, removable storage drive , drive  or communications interface . The control logic (in this example, software instructions or computer program code), when executed by the processor , causes the processor  to perform the functions of the invention as described herein.","It will be appreciated that, for clarity purposes, the above description has described embodiments of the invention with reference to different functional units and processors. However, it will be apparent that any suitable distribution of functionality between different functional units, processors or domains may be used without detracting from the invention. For example, functionality illustrated to be performed by separate processors or controllers may be performed by the same processor or controller. Hence, references to specific functional units are only to be seen as references to suitable means for providing the described functionality, rather than indicative of a strict logical or physical structure or organization.","Although the present invention has been described in connection with some embodiments, it is not intended to be limited to the specific form set forth herein. Rather, the scope of the present invention is limited only by the claims. Additionally, although a feature may appear to be described in connection with particular embodiments, one skilled in the art would recognize that various features of the described embodiments may be combined in accordance with the invention.","Furthermore, although individually listed, a plurality of means, elements or method steps may be implemented by, for example, a single unit or processor. Additionally, although individual features may be included in different claims, these may possibly be advantageously combined, and the inclusion in different claims does not imply that a combination of features is not feasible and\/or advantageous. Also, the inclusion of a feature in one category of claims does not imply a limitation to this category, but rather the feature may be equally applicable to other claim categories, as appropriate.","Moreover, it will be appreciated that various modifications and alterations may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The invention is not to be limited by the foregoing illustrative details, but is to be defined according to the claims.","Although only certain exemplary embodiments have been described in detail above, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of this invention. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present application can be best understood by reference to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing figures, in which like parts may be referred to by like numerals:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A-3D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A-4C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
