title: Rendering aligned perspective images
abstract: Techniques and systems are disclosed for navigating human scale image data using aligned perspective images. A consecutive sequence of digital images is stacked together by aligning consecutive images laterally with an image offset between edges of consecutive images corresponding to a distance between respective view windows of the consecutive images. A view window of an image in the sequence is rendered, where the view window of the image corresponds to a desired location. Offset portions of the view window of a desired number of images in the sequence are rendered, for example, alongside the full view of the image at the desired location.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Digital photography can allow for a sequence of images to be stitched or glued together to provide for a relatively seamless transition between perspectives of consecutive images from a common location. Often, users can collect digital images of a three-hundred and sixty degree view from a location, and stitch the images together to form a sort of panoramic image from that location. Further, images can be collected from a side-view while traveling along a route, such as a street. Stitching these side-view images together can provide a relatively seamless lateral-view of a traveled route from a sideways perspective.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","A lateral-view of a panoramic image may comprise a series of photos stitched\/glued together to form a somewhat seamless view of the lateral-view panorama. This type of lateral-view panorama typically shows all of the stitched together images all at once. Currently, images stitched together in this manner are utilized in conjunction with digital mapping services, where a user may view lateral-view panorama-type images of a street associate with a map they may be viewing. Moving laterally along a lateral-view panorama one might see some different perspective of objects in the panorama; however, there is no movement, as the image is static.","Further, some current systems merely display panoramic bubble-views from a location, in a type of three-hundred and sixty degree view from a location, comprised of stitched\/glued together images. These systems typically allow a user to move from a view of one bubble to a view of its direct neighbors. However, this type of navigation is limited because if a user searches for a specific location, such as from a mapping service, the location may not be visible from a given bubble-view. Further, the user may need to take many steps to go from one end of the road to the other end, thereby necessitating movement from bubble to bubble.","Techniques and systems are disclosed for navigating image data sets, such as consecutive sequences of panoramic bubble-view images, by representing the data set in an alternative approach that allows for easier navigation. Further, the techniques and systems provide for more natural representation of objects in the views, in a three-dimensional-type perspective, and also provides a parallax movement in the perspective of objects in the images. Additionally, transitions between a panoramic bubble-view and a panoramic lateral-view are provided.","In one embodiment, a consecutive sequence of digital images, such as panoramic bubble-view images, can be stacked together. Stacking the images can comprise aligning consecutive images laterally having an image offset between edges of consecutive images, where the offset amount corresponds to a distance between respective view windows of the consecutive images. For example, were images are collected every two meters, the offset between images can be relative to the two meter distance in the view windows of the consecutive images. Further, a view window of an image in the sequence can be rendered, where the view window of the image corresponds to a desired location, such as a location chosen to be viewed by a user. Additionally, offset portions of the other images in the sequence can be rendered, corresponding to a desired number of images, such as those that fit within a display.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","A method may be devised that can provide for navigating images of a location in human scale datasets, such as panoramic bubbles that are collected of the location at short intervals showing street-level imagery. Navigating in human scale, where human scale can comprise street-level imagery, can allow the images of the location to be viewed as one might view the location while walking down a street, for example, turning around to view in a three-hundred and sixty degree scale, and viewing objects in the images with a natural three dimensional-type image perspective.  is a flow chart diagram of an exemplary method  for navigating human scale data using aligned perspective images.","The exemplary method  begins at  and involves stacking a consecutive sequence of digital images (e.g., digital photographs), which comprises aligning consecutive images laterally with an image offset between edges of the consecutive images that corresponds to a distance between respective view windows of the consecutive images, at . As an example, in the exemplary embodiment  of , a consecutive sequence of images  ( through ) has been stacked where image number  is situated on top of the stack (e.g., exposed in full view).","In this exemplary embodiment , the images are of approximately a same dimension, comprising a view of a location at desired intervals (e.g., two meters). Further, the images  through  are stacked underneath number image  to the left, and images  through  are stacked under image number  to the right. Additionally, the images stacked underneath image number  are offset  from the image on top and from each other, where the offset corresponds to the desired interval (e.g., two meters) as viewed in the images.","Returning to , at , the exemplary method  comprises rendering a view window of an image, where the image's view window corresponds to a desired location. For example, image number  in the exemplary embodiment  comprises the image that is rendered on top of the stack of consecutive images . In this example, image number  in the sequence  corresponds to a desired location , such as a segment of the sequence that a user desires to view. Therefore, in this example, the entire view of image number  can be viewed by the user, corresponding to their desired location.","At , in the exemplary method , the image offset portion of the view window of a desired number of images in the sequence is also rendered. For example, in the exemplary embodiment , image number  is viewed entirely, while merely the offset portion of the remaining images is rendered for the sequence, to be viewed by the user. In this way, for example, a view of the sequence  from the desired location  can comprise a continuous lateral view of a desired area, such as one side of a street, where an entire view of the image at the desired location is rendered, and merely offset portions  of the remaining images are rendered at desired intervals.","Having rendered the sequence of consecutive images, the exemplary method  ends at .","In one embodiment, the consecutive sequence of images can be aligned along a top and bottom edge of the respective images. For example, where the sequence is collected from a series of digital photographs taken at desired images from a same distance and height, aligning the top and bottom of the images can allow for stitching together the views smoothly. Further, in this embodiment, stacking the images in the sequence can comprise aligning objects in the images that traverse consecutive images. For example, where two consecutive images both capture a same portion of a same building, the images can be aligned based on details from the building so that they can be stitched together while mitigating viewable seems between the images.","In one embodiment, the consecutive images in the sequence can comprise perspective from desired location at a desired distance from each other. For example, one may collect digital photographs of a view of one side of a street as they travel down that street. The photographs can be collected a desired intervals, such as every two meters, from a similar height and a similar distance from the side of the street, pointing in a same direction (e.g., a camera can be mounted on a vehicle to collect photographs of a right side of a street, as it is driven down the street in a right hand lane).","In this example, respective photographs comprise the perspective of the side of the street from the location where the photograph is taken. In this way, a first photograph may capture a front of an object, and a consecutive photograph taken from a desired distance may capture a portion of a side of the object, for example. In this embodiment, when these images are stitched together, a natural three-dimensional type perspective can be rendered to a viewer of the sequence.","In one embodiment, representations of edges of images in the stacked sequence can be rendered. For example, a sequence of consecutive stacked images can be viewed as a lateral perspective of a location, comprising images from the sequence stitched together to provide a relatively seamless view. In this embodiment, as seen in the sequence , of , edges of the respective images can be rendered in the view, for example, to delineate boundaries of the images.","In one embodiment, a sequence of stacked images may comprise a desired number of selected images. For example, as described above, a sequence of consecutive images can be collected from a vehicle mounted camera as the vehicle travels down a street. In this example, the camera may be programmed to collect an image based on a vehicles speed, timing, distance, or a combination of these. Occasionally, consecutive images may overlap each other by more than a desired offset threshold, such as merely having an offset of half a meter where the threshold is one to three meters. In this embodiment, images that fail to meet an offset threshold can be discarded from the stack, and merely a desired number of images can be selected, such as those meeting the threshold.","In one aspect, collecting a sequence of images may comprise collecting panoramic bubble-views, such as three-hundred and sixty degree views, from a desired location. In this way, in one embodiment, the digital images in the sequence can comprise a panoramic bubble-view from the desired location. For example, in the exemplary embodiment  of , a sequence of panoramic bubble-views  can be stacked, such as was done for the lateral-view images in . In one embodiment, the panoramic bubble-view images can be stacked using an offset  for aligning consecutive images in the sequence. In this embodiment, the offset  can correspond to a desired distance between consecutive panoramic bubble-view images.","In another embodiment, the view window of an image in a sequence, such as a lateral-view, can comprise a cropped portion of the panoramic bubble-view from a desired location rendered as a perspective projection. For example, in , the sequence of panoramic bubble-view images  may represent a top-down view of the respective images  through , which have been collected in sequence while traveling in a line from  to .","In this example , a cropped portion of the panoramic bubble-view images can be rendered for the respective sideways lateral-views  and  of the sequence of panoramic bubble-view images. Respective cropped view images can be stacked in a same sequence as the panoramic bubble-view images, for example, as shown in the sequences , , and , where images A, , and B represent the image displayed from a desired location. In this way, for example, a display may render a view of a street ahead, as a user moves through the images, and views of details on either side of the line of travel, creating a continuous panoramic view in human scale (e.g., street-level).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["104","250"]},"In one embodiment, the offset vector can be computed based on a view distance to objects in scenes in the images from a point of view of the desired location (e.g., from a cameral). In this embodiment, images can be viewed from different distances from objects that are found in scenes of the images. For example, a virtual camera may comprise a desired location, which can be moved toward and away from the objects in the images.","At , the images in the sequence are aligned. As an example, in , the images can be aligned according to the offset vector, creating an image offset  between respective images in the sequence. Further, images may be aligned at a top and bottom of the images, and\/or according to features from object in images that may traverse consecutive images, to generate a sequence of stacked and aligned images .","At , in order to render the sequence of images , a desired location in the sequence is selected, at . For example, in , the desired location  is selected, which can correspond to a location a user wishes to view. At , an image of a perspective from the desired location is rendered, such as for image number  in the sequence , of . Further, the offset views of the remaining images in the viewable sequence are rendered, at . For example, , the offset views for the images  through  and  through  can be rendered on either side of image number . In this exemplary embodiment , the sequence of viewable images  is rendered on a display , viewable by a user, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","256","350","352","354","302","350","304"]},"At , in order to pan the lateral-view, the sequence  is moved at . For example, the sequence  can be slid from left to right and from right to left (e.g., by mouse clicking on the sequence and dragging the mouse left or right). When panning , the view window of a next consecutive image in the sequence  is rendered, where the next image corresponds to a direction the sequence  is panned from the desired location. Further, the view window of the next consecutive image in the sequence  is rendered when the rendering of the sequence  corresponds to a next image position in the sequence.","For example, in , when panning from the location  to the location , image number  is rendered in full view and merely the offset portion of image number  is rendered, in sequence . As the sequence is panned further from the location  to , in sequence , and again from  to , in sequence , the images at the pan location are rendered in full view and merely the offset portion of the other images are rendered.","Returning to , panning the rendering of the sequence  can comprise adding images to the rendering of the sequence of stacked images at a first end of the sequence opposite of the lateral direction, at , and removing images from the rendering of the sequence at a second end of the sequence corresponding to the lateral direction, at . For example, if the sequence  were panned toward the left side , so that a center of the view of the sequence  comprises a view of the image rendered in full, images can be added to the right side  in the stack, and removed from the left side  from the stack.","At , the view window of the image rendered for the desired location can be adjusted according to a view distance from objects that can be found in image scenes (e.g., to account for different distances a camera may have been from an object when respective images of the object are acquired). Further, the size of the adjacent view windows can be adjusted in accordance with the view distance. For example, view windows of images can comprise merely a portion of the image, where the portion comprises a field of view from a view distance. In this example, an image view window from the desired location (e.g.,  showing image  of , in ) may comprise a smaller view angle (e.g., field of view) than adjacent image view windows (e.g., images  and  of , in ), which can have wider view angles. In this way, for example, the image viewed at the center of the sequence is changed according to the direction of panning, and the field of view can be adjusted to account for a parallax effect from various view distances. Offset views of images are rendered at the first side, at , and removed from the second side.","At , zooming can comprise zooming out from the view of the sequence  of images, at , and zooming into the view of the sequence  of images, at . In one embodiment, zooming can comprise changing the view distance from the desired location to objects in the image scenes. As described above, for example, a virtual camera can move toward the objects or away from the objects, essentially \u201cdollying\u201d the view distance for the virtual camera.","Zooming out the rendering of the sequence, at , can comprise rendering the image offset portion of a higher number of images in the sequence, where the higher number of images corresponds to a zoom level. Therefore, in this embodiment, when zooming out, images are added to the stack at either side  and  to accommodate the zoom level. Further, the offset portions of the added images are rendered in the sequence, at .","Zooming into the rendering of the sequence, at , can comprise rendering the image offset portion of a lower number of images in the sequence, the lower number of images corresponding to the zoom level. Therefore, in this embodiment, as the sequence  is zoomed into, images can be removed, at , from both sides of the rendering of the sequence  and , according to a level zoomed into. In one embodiment, the rendering of a lateral-view of the sequence can be enlarged to accommodate the zoom level, while the offset portions of the images at either end  and  are no longer rendered in the view display .","At , zooming out can comprise reducing a field of view of the images rendered  in the display . For example, in , a display may comprise a lateral view of the sequence , with a desired location corresponding to the image A. In this example, the rendered images in the lateral view  can comprise portions  of panoramic bubble-view images . In this example, the portion  of the bubble image  that is display in the lateral view  corresponds to a view angle  (e.g., field of view). The view angle can be determined, for example, by the view distance  from the view perspective point  to objects in the image scenes, for example, as viewed from a virtual camera moving (or \u201cdollying\u201d) in and out of the image.","In this embodiment, when the image sequence is zoomed out, the view distance  can be increased (e.g., the view perspective point is moved back ). Further, when the image sequence is zoomed in, the view distance  can be decreased. As an example, in , , the image's view window  comprises a portion of the bubble-view image , determined by the view location  and field of view . As the view location  is moved back, in , the field of view  increases in size to accommodate a zoomed out view  of a portion of the bubble-view image , for example.","In this embodiment, continually increasing a field of view can distort the view window at the edges of the image view, for example. Therefore, when the field of view exceeds a desired view angle (e.g., one-hundred and ten degrees), as in , adjacent image offsets  can be rendered with the central image  to accommodate the zoomed out view point , for example. In this example, the view angle  for the image rendered at the desired location  can be reduced to accommodate the parallax effect that can occur when zooming out. Further, when the view distance is increased, as in , additional adjacent image offsets can be rendered. In this example, the image view  from the desired location  is further reduced, as the view angle  is reduced for the central image, and adjacent images to account for the parallax effect.","In one embodiment, zooming in can comprise transitioning from a rendering of the lateral view of the sequence at a desired location to a rendering of the panoramic bubble-view from the desired location. For example, in , in one embodiment, when lateral view of the sequence  is zoomed into, the view can transition from the lateral-view of the sequence  to a panoramic bubble-view of the image number , in the panoramic bubble-view . In this way, for example, a user may see an overview perspective of one side of a street in a zoomed out view, and then zoom into the image A to transition to a more detailed and three-hundred and sixty degree panoramic view of the image number  at that desired location.","Further, zooming out can comprise transitioning from the rendering of the panoramic bubble-view from the desired location to the rendering of the lateral view of the sequence at a desired location. For example, one may step through a sequence of panoramic bubble-views, such as  in , to see details and the three-hundred and sixty degree panoramic views, and then zoom out to see an overview of the area in a lateral-view, such as . That is, in this example, zooming out comprises going from a bubble-view to a lateral view, and zooming in comprises going from a lateral view to a bubble-view.","In one embodiment, transitioning can comprise mapping between image objects in the rendering of the lateral view of the sequence at a desired location and the rendering of the panoramic bubble-view from the desired location. For example, in order to provide a type of seamless transition between the panoramic bubble-view and the lateral-view of the sequence, details of objects in the images that traverse the images can be mapped between the images, and be used to provide for image stitching when transitioning between the two perspectives.","In one aspect, the smooth transitions can be appreciated when transitioning between streets at an intersection, for example. In one embodiment, the stacked sequence of consecutive images may comprise a view of roadways, for example, from a map.  is an illustration of an exemplary embodiment  where human scale data (e.g., street-level imagery) using aligned perspective images can be utilized.","In an overview map  a user may wish to view images of the roadway when moving from point A to point B, where north is indicated . In this example, the user may view a sequence of stacked images  of either side of the street, as they pan from point A to point B. Upon reaching point B in the sequence , an intersection is indication in the map overview . In this embodiment , the user may wish to begin moving (panning) down one of the intersecting streets (either heading north or south) at point B. The rendered view of the images can zoom in and transition to the panoramic bubble-view  of the intersection. At which point, the user may move the rendered view around the panorama  to view various areas of the intersection, and\/or begin moving north or south down the intersecting roadway, for example, transitioning back to a lateral-view. It will be appreciated that such transition (from a lateral view (e.g., ) to a bubble view (e.g., )) can occur somewhat automatically when a user encounters an intersection. For example, when a user clicks on the intersection, a transition from lateral view to bubble view may occur.","In one aspect, a rendering of a lateral-view of a sequence of images comprise a view of one side of the line of travel of the sequence, such as down a street. In this aspect, a user may wish to switch their view to a rendering of the opposite side of the street, for example. In one embodiment, switching lateral views can comprise transitioning between a rendering of a first lateral view of a first sequence (e.g., one side of the street) from a desired location to a rendering of a second lateral view of a second sequence (e.g., the other side) from the desired location, where the first sequence represents a different perspective from the desired location than the perspective of the second sequence. In one embodiment, the transition between the rendering of the sequence may comprise zooming into a panoramic bubble-view from the desired location, and panning around the bubble-view to the other side, then zooming out the lateral-view of the other side.","In one aspect, navigating human scale data using aligned perspective images can be utilized in digital maps, such as online or in a vehicle navigation system. In this aspect, one may wish to identify particular objects, street addresses, street names, and other locations. In one embodiment, annotations can be rendered along with the sequence of images, where the annotations correspond to areas in the images of the sequence. The annotations can comprise a descriptor for a street address, an object identifier (e.g., point of interest, historical marker), a location identifier (e.g., a retailer, or building name), and a street name. In one embodiment, a user may merely click on the annotation to zoom the rendering of the sequence into an image of the desired location marked by the annotation.","A system may be devised that provides an immersive navigation experience of sequences of images that can represent a collection taken while traveling.  is a component block diagram of an exemplary system  for navigating human scale data, such as street-level imagery, using aligned perspective images. An image aligning component  can be configured to aligning a consecutive sequence of images  of perspectives at desired distances from each other.","The image aligning component  comprises an offset determination component  that is configured calculate an image offset vector between boundaries of consecutive images  that corresponds to a distance between desired locations of the consecutive images . Further, image aligning component  comprises an image offset alignment component , which is configured to align the consecutive images  at respective image offsets based on the image offset vector. The image aligning component  can generate data that comprises an aligned sequence of consecutive images .","A sequence rendering component  utilizes a location image rendering component , which is configured to render the image from a perspective of the desired location, and an image offset rendering component , which is configured to render the one or more image offset portions of the images from perspectives not from the desired location, to render the sequence of the consecutive images . In one embodiment, the sequence of images can be rendered on a computer display, where the image from the desired location perspective  is rendered in full view, and the offset portions  of the remaining images in the rendered sequence are also displayed.","In one embodiment, a system for navigating human scale data using aligned perspective images may comprise a panning component.  is an illustration of an exemplary panning component . In this embodiment, the panning component  can be configured to render a next consecutive image in the sequence corresponding to a direction the sequence is panned. For example, where a lateral-view of the sequence of images is rendered in a display , the sequence can be panned  to the left  and right . In this embodiment, for example, when the sequence is panned left , the panning component is configured to \u201cflip\u201d out to a full view, the next image in the sequence to the left, and render merely the offset portions of the remaining images in the rendered portion of the sequence.","In one embodiment, a system for navigating human scale data using aligned perspective images may comprise a zooming component.  is a component block diagram of an exemplary zooming component . In this embodiment, the zooming component  can comprise a transition component  that is configured to transition between a lateral-view  of the sequence and a bubble-view  of the desired location. Further, the zooming component  can comprise a lateral zooming component  can be configured to zoom a rendering of the sequence in  or zoom the rendering of the sequence out .","Additionally, the zooming component  can comprise a bubble zooming component  can be configured to zoom in to a rendering of a bubble-view  from a desired location or zooming out  from a rendering of a bubble-view from a desired location. For example, a bubble-view  can comprise a panoramic three-hundred and sixty degree view from a desired location, comprising views from the location stitched into a relatively seamless rendering. In this example, the bubble zooming component  can be used to zoom into a portion of the bubble-view, to a detailed image of a particular portion  of the three-hundred and sixty degree view.","Still another embodiment involves a computer-readable medium comprising processor-executable instructions configured to implement one or more of the techniques presented herein.
