{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to the process of selecting a service provider and, more particularly, relates to programmatically (automatically) selecting a service provider based on assured (or attested to) quality of service attributes.","Consumers who have access to computer networks such as the Internet can select from a number of different service providers to meet their need for services. These service providers assert many different requirements, both functional and nonfunctional. A functional requirement describes how something is executed while a nonfunctional requirement describes the qualities around execution. Nonfunctional requirements may also be referred to as quality of service requirements.","Currently, there is no efficient way for a consumer to interrogate multiple different service providers over the Internet and be assured of the ability of the service providers to fulfill the functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements of a proposed request for services.","The various advantages and purposes of the exemplary embodiments as described above and hereafter are achieved by providing, according to a first aspect of the exemplary embodiments, a method. The method includes querying a service provider for functional and nonfunctional qualifications of the service provider to provide a service having functional and nonfunctional requirements; responsive to input from the service provider, receiving by a requestor the functional qualifications and nonfunctional qualifications of the service provider including attesting by a third party, not the service provider or requestor, to at least the nonfunctional qualifications of the service provider; evaluating the functional qualifications and attested to nonfunctional qualifications of the service provider; and selecting a service provider having functional and attested to nonfunctional qualifications complying with the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the requestor. The method may be performed on one or more computing devices.","According to a second aspect of the exemplary embodiments, there is provided a method. The method includes determining by a requestor functional and nonfunctional requirements of a service to be provided by a service provider; querying a first plurality of service providers for functional qualifications of the first plurality of service providers to provide the service; responsive to input from the first plurality of service providers, receiving by the requestor the functional qualifications of the first plurality of service providers; querying a second plurality of service providers for nonfunctional qualifications of the second plurality of service providers to provide the service; responsive to input from the second plurality of service providers, receiving by the requestor the nonfunctional qualifications of the second plurality of service providers including attesting by a third party, not the service provider or requestor, to at least the nonfunctional qualifications of the second plurality of service providers; evaluating the functional qualifications of the first plurality of service providers and attested to nonfunctional qualifications of the second plurality of service providers; and selecting a service provider from the first and second plurality of service providers having functional qualifications and attested to nonfunctional qualifications complying with the fuiictional and nonfunctional requirements of the requestor. The method may be performed on one or more computing devices.","According to a third aspect of the exemplary embodiments, there is provided a computer program product for programmatically determining a cloud computing provider based on functional and nonfunctional requirements for a service to be provided by a service provider. The computer program product including a computer readable storage medium having computer readable program code embodied therewith. The computer readable program code including computer readable program code configured to query a first plurality of service providers for functional qualifications of the service provider to provide the service; responsive to input from the first plurality of service providers, computer readable program code configured to receive by a requestor the functional qualifications of the first plurality of service providers; computer readable program code configured to query a second plurality of service providers for nonfunctional qualifications of the second plurality of service providers to provide the service; responsive to input from the second plurality of service providers, computer readable program code configured to receive by the requestor the nonfunctional qualifications of the second plurality of service providers including to attest by a third party, not the service provider or requestor, to at least the nonfunctional qualifications of the second plurality of service providers; computer readable program code configured to evaluate the functional qualifications of the first plurality of service providers and attested to nonfunctional qualifications of the second plurality of service providers; and computer readable program code configured to select a service provider from the first and second plurality of service providers having functional qualifications and attested to nonfunctional qualifications complying with the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the requestor.","The exemplary embodiments pertain to a programmatic methodology for a consumer to interrogate multiple different service providers over a computer network such as the Internet and be assured of the ability of the service providers to fulfill the functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements of a proposed request for services. The consumer may also be referred to hereafter as a requestor of services and both terms, consumer and requestor of services, may be used interchangeably herein. It is contemplated that once a requestor of services decides on the desired functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements of a proposed request for services, the exemplary embodiments, without requestor intervention, will seek out service providers having qualifications complying with the desired functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements of the proposed request for services.","It is most preferred that the exemplary embodiments operate in a cloud computing environment. Cloud computing permits transactional access to computing resources from a service provider for a discrete period of time. Cloud computing opens the possibility for consumers to eventually enter a free market model where the consumer might query many different service providers providing the same service and programmatically (i.e., automatically) select the best, cheapest and fastest service provider.","It is understood that although the exemplary embodiments include a detailed description on cloud computing, implementation of the teachings recited herein are not limited to a cloud computing environment. Rather, embodiments of the present invention are capable of being implemented in conjunction with any other type of computing environment now known or later developed.","Cloud computing is a model of service delivery for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. networks, network bandwidth, servers, processing, memory, storage, applications, virtual machines, and services) that can be rapidly, provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with a provider of the service. This cloud computing model may include at least five characteristics as follows:","On-demand self-service: a cloud consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with the service's provider.","Broad network access: capabilities are available over a network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, laptops, and PDAs).","Resource pooling: the provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the consumer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter).","Rapid elasticity: capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned, in some cases automatically, to quickly scale out and rapidly released to quickly scale in. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time.","Measured service: cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.","At the heart of cloud computing is an infrastructure comprising a network of interconnected nodes.","Referring now to , illustrative cloud computing environment  is depicted. As shown, cloud computing environment  comprises one or more cloud computing nodes  with which local computing devices used by cloud consumers, such as, for example, personal digital assistant (PDA) or cellular telephone A, desktop computer B, laptop computer C, and\/or automobile computer system N may communicate. Nodes  may communicate with one another. They may be grouped (not shown) physically or virtually, in one or more networks, such as Private, Community, Public, or Hybrid clouds as described hereinabove, or a combination thereof. This allows cloud computing environment  to offer infrastructure, platforms and\/or software as services for which a cloud consumer does not need to maintain resources on a local computing device. It is understood that the types of computing devices A-N shown in  are intended to be illustrative only and that computing nodes  and cloud computing environment  can communicate with any type of computerized device over any type of network and\/or network addressable connection (e.g., using a web browser).","Referring now to , a schematic of an example of a cloud computing node is shown. Cloud computing node  is only one example of a suitable cloud computing node and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of embodiments of the invention described herein. Regardless, cloud computing node is capable of being implemented and\/or performing any of the functionality set forth hereinabove.","In cloud computing node  there is a computer system\/server , which is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations. Examples of well-known computing systems, environments, and\/or configurations that may be suitable for use with computer system\/server  include, but are not limited to, personal computer systems, server computer systems, thin clients, thick clients, hand-held or laptop devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based systems, set top boxes, programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputer systems, mainframe computer systems, and distributed cloud computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.","As shown in , computer system\/server  in cloudiconputing node  is shown in the form of a general-purpose computing device. The components of computer system\/server  may include, but are not limited to, one or more processors or processing units , a system memory , and a bus  that couples various system components including system memory  to processor .","Computer system\/server  typically includes a variety of computer system readable media. Such media may be any available media that is accessible by computer system\/server , and it includes both volatile and non-volatile media, removable and non-removable media.","System memory  can include computer system readable media in the form of volatile memory, such as random access memory (RAM)  and\/or cache memory . Computer system\/server  may further include other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/non-volatile computer system storage media. By way of example only, storage system  can be provided for reading from and writing to a non-removable, non-volatile magnetic media (not shown and typically called a \u201chard drive\u201d). Although not shown, a magnetic disk drive for reading from and writing to a removable, non-volatile magnetic disk (e.g., a \u201cfloppy disk\u201d), and an optical disk drive for reading from or writing to a removable, non-volatile optical disk such as a CD-ROM, DVD-ROM or other optical media can be provided. In such instances, each can be connected to bus  by one or more data media interfaces. As will be further depicted and described below, memory  may include at least one program product having a set (e.g., at least one) of program modules that are configured to carry out the functions of embodiments of the invention.","Program\/utility , having a set (at least one) of program modules , may be stored in memory  by way of example, and not limitation, as well as an operating system, one or more application programs, other program modules, and program data. Each of the operating system, one or more application programs, other program modules, and program data or some combination thereof, may include an implementation of a networking environment. Program modules  generally carry out the functions and\/or methodologies of embodiments of the invention as described herein.","Computer system\/server  may also communicate with one or more external devices  such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a display , etc.; one or more devices that enable a user to interact with computer system\/server ; and\/or any devices (e.g., network card, modem, etc.) that enable computer system\/server  to communicate with one or more other computing devices. Such communication can occur via Input\/Output (I\/O) interfaces . Still yet, computer system\/server  can communicate with one or more networks such as a local area network (LAN), a general wide area network (WAN), and\/or a public network (e.g., the Internet) via network adapter . As depicted, network adapter  communicates with the other components of computer system\/server  via bus . It should be understood that although not shown, other hardware and\/or software components could be used in conjunction with computer system\/server . Examples, include, but are not limited to: microcode, device drivers, redundant processing units, external disk drive arrays, RAID systems, tape drives, and data archival storage systems, etc.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product. Accordingly, aspects of the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, residentsoftware, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a \u201ccircuit,\u201d \u201cmodule\u201d or \u201csystem.\u201d Furthermore, aspects of the present invention may take the form of a computer program product embodied in one or more computer readable medium(s) having computer readable program code embodied thereon.","Any combination of one or more computer readable medium(s) may be utilized. The computer readable medium may be a computer readable signal medium or a computer readable storage medium. A computer readable storage medium may be, for example, but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, or device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing. More specific examples (a non-exhaustive list) of the computer readable storage medium would include the following: an electrical connection having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), an optical fiber, a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), an optical storage device, a magnetic storage device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing. In the context of this document, a computer readable storage medium may be any tangible medium that can contain, or store a program for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.","A computer readable signal medium may include a propagated data signal with computer readable program code embodied therein, for example, in baseband or as part of a carrier wave. Such a propagated signal may take any of a variety of forms, including, but not limited to, electro-magnetic, optical, or any suitable combination thereof. A computer readable signal medium may be any computer readable medium that is not a computer readable storage medium and that can communicate, propagate, or transport a program for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.","Program code embodied on a computer readable medium may be transmitted using any appropriate medium, including but not limited to wireless, wireline, optical fiber cable, RF, etc., or any suitable combination of the foregoing.","Computer program code for carrying out operations for aspects of the present invention may be written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language such as Java, Smalltalk, C++ or the like and conventional procedural programming languages, such as the \u201cC\u201d programming language or similar programming languages. The program code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone-software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).","Aspects of the present invention are described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer readable medium that can direct a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instructions which implement the function\/act specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagramr block or blocks.","The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer, other programmable apparatus or other devices to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","Referring now to , a method of the exemplary embodiments is illustrated. The method begins by a requestor determining the functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements of a service to be provided to the requestor by a service provider, box . Functional requirements define a function that a service provider's computing system is to accomplish. Functional requirements may be calculations, technical details, data manipulation and processing and other specific functionality that define what a system is supposed to accomplish. Another example of functional requirements is an application programming interface (API). Nonfunctional requirements define a quality of service of a service provider's computing system. Nonfunctional requirements may include, for example, performance, capacity, scalability, availability, maintainability, integrity, confidentiality, manageability, environmental, system usability and data integrity.","It is straight forward to determine a service provider's ability to comply with a functional requirement. However, it is much more difficult to determine a service provider's ability to comply with nonfunctional requirements.","The exemplary embodiments provide a methodology for determining a service provider's ability to comply with a requestor's functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements.","The requestor may query a service provider for the qualifications of the service provider to comply with the functional requirements of the requestor, box . This is straight forward as the requestor may request the service provider's computing system to comply with a particular functional requirement.","Responsive to input from the service provider responding to the query, the requestor may then receive the functional qualifications from the service provider box .","The requestor may query the service provider for the qualifications of the service provider to comply with the nonfunctional requirements of the requestor, box .","Responsive to input from the service provider responding, to the query, the requestor may receive the nonfunctional qualifications of the service provider, box . The nonfunctional qualifications in the exemplary embodiments are attested to by a third party so the requestor knows that the nonfunctional qualifications of the service provider can be trusted. The third party must not be either the service provider or the requestor.","In one exemplary embodiment, the third party may be a party trusted by the requestor that endorses the nonfunctional qualifications of the service provider. As examples, for purposes of illustration and not limitation, the third party may be an industry certifying group, an industry standards group, an auditor, a business partner or a colleague company. Thus, when the third party attests to the ability of the service provider to meet the nonfunctional requirements of the requestor, the requestor can trust that assertion.","In another exemplary embodiment, the third party may be reputation-based and accumulates endorsed evaluations by previous customers of the service provided by the service provider. As an example for purposes of illustration and not limitation, the third party may be a web site that accumulates the endorsed evaluations and the web site may be accessible by the requestor. The requestor of the service may view these previous evaluations as the trusted assertion of the service provider's ability to comply with the nonfunctional requirements of the requestor.","The requestor may evaluate the received functional qualifications and attested to nonfunctional qualifications for compliance with the functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements of the requestor, box . Resulting from the evaluation will be a determination of whether the service provider can meet the functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements of the requestor.","It should be understood that the requestor may evaluate the ability of the service provider to meet the functional requirements of the requestor after they have been received, as noted above with respect to box , or the requestor may evaluate the ability of the service provider to meet the functional requirements of the requestor at the same time as the requestor may evaluate the ability of the service provider to meet the nonfunctional requirements of the requester.","If the service provider can meet the functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements of the requestor, the requestor may select the service provider to provide the service, box .","In the method described above with respect to , a plurality of service providers may be queried for their ability to comply with the functional requirements of the requestor. Due to the number of cloud computing providers available, the described method is particularly suited to a programmatic determination of a suitable service provider meeting the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the requestor.","In an exemplary embodiment, only those service providers complying with the functional requirements of the requestor may be queried for their ability to comply with the nonfunctional requirements of the requestor. For this exemplary embodiment, the requestor may evaluate the ability of the service provider to meet the functional requirements of the requestor after they have been received, as noted above with respect to box , and before service providers are queried for their ability to meet the nonfunctional requirements of the requestor. In this way, a smaller universe of service providers may be queried for their ability to meet the nonfunctional requirements of the requestor. Thus, in this exemplary embodiment, the service providers queried for their ability to comply with the nonfunctional requirements of the requestor may be a subset of the service providers queried for their ability to comply with the functional requirements of the requestor.","Further to the method described above, a plurality of service providers may be queried for their ability to comply with the functional requirements of the requestor and a plurality of service providers may be separately queried for their ability to comply with the nonfunctional requirements of the requestor. During the evaluating step, the two pluralities of service providers may be evaluated to find common service providers that have the ability to comply with both the functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements of the requestor.","Referring now to , a variation of the method illustrated in  is illustrated. The method begins by a requestor determining the functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements of a service to be provided to the requestor by a service provider, box .","In this exemplary embodiment of the method, the requestor may query a service provider for the qualifications of the service provider to comply with the functional requirements of the requestor and for the qualifications of the service provider to comply with the nonfunctional requirements of the requestor, box . This methodology may not be as efficient as the methodology with respect to  since the querying will uncover service providers who may be able to comply with the functional requirements of the requestor but not the nonfunctional requirements and vice versa. However, there would only be one querying process involved which may simplify the method.","Responsive to input from the service provider responding to the query, the requestor may then receive the functional qualifications and nonfunctional qualifications from the service provider, box . As in the previous exemplary embodiment, the nonfunctional qualifications of the service provider are attested to by a third party so the requestor knows that the nonfunctional qualifications of the service provider can be trusted. The third party must not be either the service provider or the requestor.","The requestor may evaluate the received functional qualifications and attested to nonfunctional qualifications for compliance with the functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements of the requestor, box . Resulting from the evaluation will be a determination of whether the service provider can meet the functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements of the requestor.","If the service provider can meet the functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements of the requestor, the requestor may select the service provider to provide the service, box .","In the method described above with respect to , a plurality of service providers may be queried for their ability to comply with the functional requirements of the requestor. Due to the number of cloud computing providers available, the described method is particularly suited to a programmatic determination of a suitable service provider meeting the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the requestor.","In the above-described methods in , the nonfunctional qualifications in the exemplary embodiments are attested to by a third party so the requestor knows that the nonfunctional qualifications of the service provider can be trusted. The attestation may be conveniently provided in a number of ways. In one way, the attestation may be encrypted by an authenticating authority and provided to the requestor. Through public\/private key technology, the requestor may be given a public key so as to be able to read the attestation.","In a second way of third party attestation, the requestor may be provided with a digital certificate that contains an assertion with respect to the service provider. For example, when requestor's computing system communicates with the service provider's computing system, there may be a secure socket layer (SSL) handshake during which the requestor computing system and service provider computing system are authenticated to each other. As part of the SSL handshake, the service provider computing system may provide the requestor computing system with an x.509 digital certificate. The x.509 is a standardized certification that allows computing systems to authenticate one another. X.509 is an ITU-T standard for a public key infrastructure (PKI) for single sign-on (SSO) and Privilege Management Infrastructure (PMI). X.509 specifies, amongst other things, standard formats for public key certificates, certificate revocation lists, attribute certificates, and a certification path validation algorithm.","An x.509 certificate  is illustrated in . The x.509 certificate  is divided into two parts,  and . Part  is the typical x.509 certificate containing a multiple of different fields, none of which are germane to the present invention.","Part  is an exemplary embodiment of an inventive extension to part  of the x.509 certificate. Part  includes a Markup Type field  for the type of markup language in the extension, a Markup Version field  for the version of the markup language, an Assertion field  which contains the assertion by the third party and a Signature field  which contains the digital signature of the third party and asserts that all of the fields in the part  are valid.","The extension shown in  as part  may be present as an extension to the x.509 certificate or it may form a digital certificate in and of itself as shown in .","Two implementations are presented which use the digital certificate shown in  for third party attestation. It should be understood that the following implementations are for purposes of illustration only and are not meant to be limiting of the exemplary embodiments.","Third Party Trusted by the Requestor:","The first implementation is illustrated in .","The requestor begins an SSL tunnel to the service provider as indicated by . Using the SSL tunnel is not a requirement of the present invention but is merely a convenient way to implement the exemplary embodiments.","Coincident with this implementation or separately from it, the requestor would determine the ability of the service provider to comply with the requestor's functional requirements.","The service provider through its server or computing system sends its x.509 certificate  to the requestor as indicated by  as part of the SSL handshake. The x.509 certificate  is similar to that illustrated in  and contains an extension having the fields noted in part  in . That is, the extension in x.509 certificate  contains the Markup Type:  indicating the ACEML markup language, its version  as 1.0, an assertion  that the service provider is PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliant (i.e., complies with the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council) as of Sep. 3, 2010 and a digital signature  indicating that the digital signature is qsa@ibm.com. Thus, PCI is a trusted third party so when the x.509 certificate is passed to the requestor, the requestor can rely on the fact that the service provider is PCI compliant.","It is noted that the use of an x.509 certificate is not a requirement of the invention but is a convenient way to implement the exemplary embodiments. In a variation of this implementation, a typical x.509 certificate (without the inventive extension) may be sent by the service provider to the requestor and then separately, perhaps at the request of the requestor, the inventive certificate shown in  may be sent to the requestor.","The requestor reviews the x.509 certificate as indicated by  and evaluates (validates)  the service provider's nonfunctional qualification of being PCI compliant as of Sep. 3, 2010 and determines if this complies with the requestor's functional requirements.","If the nonfunctional requirements are met, the requestor continues to validate  the digital signature in the extension. Validation of the digital signature may be by, for example, a public key infrastructure (PKI) .","In the implementation shown in , the functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements have been met, the signature has been determined to be valid and the requestor completes the SSL handshake . The SSL handshake process may then end .","The requestor may then select the service provider to begin invocation of the service.","Third Party Reputation Based:","The second implementation is illustrated in .","The requestor begins an SSL tunnel to the service provider as indicated by . Again, using the SSL tunnel is not a requirement of the present invention but is merely a convenient way to implement the exemplary embodiments.","Coincident with this implementation or separately from it, the requestor would determine the ability of the service provider to comply with the requestor's functional requirements.","The service provider through its server or computing system ends its x.509 certificate  to the requestor as indicated by  as part of the SSL handshake. The x.509 certificate  is similar to that illustrated in  and contains an extension having the fields noted in part  in . That is, the extension in x.509 certificate  contains the Markup Type:  as URL indicating it is a URL, its version  as 1.0, an assertion  that refers to a URL to a reputation-based assertion of uptime and a digital signature  indicating the digital signature as qs@ibm.com. The URL leads to a third party website having evaluations of previous engagement with the service, provider and can be trusted so when the x.509 certificate is passed to the requestor, the requestor can rely on the service provider's assertions of uptime.","Again, it is noted that the use of an x.509 certificate is not a requirement of the invention but is a convenient way to implement the exemplary embodiments. In a variation of this implementation, a typical x.509 certificate (without the inventive extension) may be sent by the service provider to the requestor and then separately, perhaps at the request of the requestor, the inventive certificate shown in  may be sent to the requestor.","The requestor reviews the x.509 certificate as indicated by  and accesses the URL  and the uptime-based information is transmitted .","The requestor evaluates (validates)  the service provider's nonfunctional qualification regarding uptime and determines if this complies with the requestor's functional requirements.","If the nonfunctional requirements are met, the requestor continues to validate  the digital signature in the extension of the x.509 certificate . Validation of the digital signature may be by, for example, a public key infrastructure (PKI) .","In the implementation shown in , the nonfunctional requirements have been met, the signature has been determined to be valid and the requestor completes the SSL handshake . The SSL handshake process may then end .","The requestor may then select the service provider to begin invocation if the service.","It will be apparent to those skilled in the art having regard to this disclosure that other modifications of the exemplary embodiments beyond those embodiments specifically described here may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention.
