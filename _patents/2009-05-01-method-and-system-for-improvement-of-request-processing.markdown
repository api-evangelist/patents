Jones, et al., titled \u201cMETHOD AND SYSTEM FOR SHARING RESOURCES\u201d, filed May 16, 2008, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention is related to search system(s) including human-assisted search system(s), and more specifically related to assisting with search system operation(s) including improving utilization of resource(s) employed by a human assisted search system. A system and method whereby information conversion may be optimized utilizing a human assistant are described.","2. Description of the Related Art","In general search systems are keyword driven systems. Keywords included in a request for information may be used in various ways to index items such as URL's, advertisements, etc. which may be provided to a user responsive to a request for information. In order to perform an information search based on other types of information such as a spoken request, an image, a natural language request, or a request which requires translation, it may be desirable to convert information received as part of a request from one form to another. Software and systems have been developed to convert speech to text, to extract information from an image, to convert natural language queries into a form which may be more amenable to an automated search, to translate from a source language to a target language, etc. Technologies created by companies such as TellMe\u00ae, Nuance\u2122, and Vlingo\u2122 have been deployed to convert spoken information into text. Image recognition systems from companies such as Eyealike\u2122, Esker\u00ae, etc. have been deployed in order to search images to associate keywords and\/or tags with the images. Audio recognition systems such as Gracenote's Mobile MusicID\u2122 system have been deployed to compare audio recordings to a database of known recordings.","These types of technologies have allowed automated conversion of information to find a large and growing marketplace. However, there are limitations associated with such systems. Without feedback, the systems and software are not able to progressively improve the system capability. In some instances, speaker dependent voice recognition has been found to be more effective than speaker independent voice recognition, but it may be burdensome for a user to provide feedback to the system. In particular, correction of errors may become annoying to a user, and may cause a low acceptance rate of the system by customers. There is no known system and method whereby a human assistant may be provided to improve utilization of a resource such as a recognition system, an interpretation system, a translation system, or other system which may benefit from information provided by a human assistant(s).","Many people would benefit from and appreciate automated systems for speech, image, music, and handwriting recognition, or speech synthesis, translation, etc. However, error rates of such systems may exceed a user tolerance level. Learning algorithms may reduce error rates over time, but a user may not tolerate the learning curve, or user dependent information may not be available to a resource performing a conversion process.","In light of this and other limitations, a scalable method and system for making a human assistant available to improve utilization of system resources would be greatly appreciated.","A system is provided whereby a user may submit a request for information using any or all communication services available to the user and a request handling system. A request is analyzed to determine any type of processing which may be required to respond to the request. A number of categories are associated with the request which may identify processing associated with providing a response to the request. A number of resources associated with a category associated with a request are identified and may be provided with information of the request. A response from any or all of the resources may be received by a request processing system. If it is determined that a human assistant is required, the request processing system may select a number of human assistants responsive to a request. A human assistant may review results provided by any number of resources. Information of a review may be recorded. A response may be provided to a user based on information obtained from the resources and the human assistants. A human assistant may be selected based on a category, keyword, or other information associated with a query.","The disclosed invention includes a system and method including generating a response for a query from a user, transferring the response to be reviewed by a human searcher, and presenting the response to the user in accordance with the review.","These together with other aspects and advantages which will be subsequently apparent, reside in the details of construction and operation as more fully hereinafter described, reference being had to the accompanying drawings forming a part hereof, wherein like numerals refer to like parts throughout.","Reference will now be made in detail to the present embodiments discussed herein, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below to explain the disclosed system and method by referring to the figures. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope is thereby intended, such alterations and further modifications in the illustrated device, and such further applications of the principles as illustrated therein being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the embodiments relate. As used herein words importing the singular shall include the plural and vice versa unless specifically counter indicated.","A method and system are disclosed to improve operation(s) of a search system including utilization of system resource(s) by providing a human assistant to respond to a request. A user may submit a request which may require a process(es) and\/or operation(s) to be performed. For example, a user might submit a spoken request which is to be converted to a text query, the text may be converted from a natural language query to a structured query which is amenable to automated processing or indexing, which may produce a search result, which may be converted from a text message to an audio file, which may be presented to the user. A request processing system may be able to receive information in various formats using various communication services. A request received by the request processing system may require conversion of elements of a request from one form to another in order that a response may be provided to a user. Human assistants also called \u201cguides\u201d or \u201csearchers\u201d may be associated with a request processing system and may perform various tasks. Various sources of information and\/or processing facilities or \u201cresources\u201d may be available to the request processing system","If a request is received, a unique identifier is associated with the request and a user submitting the request. A determination is made as to whether a resource(s) may be utilized to respond to a request. If a resource is identified which may perform a process associated with a request, information required to perform the process may be provided to the resource. A human assistant may review result(s) provided by a resource(s) and\/or may perform a process before, in parallel with and\/or after a resource performs the process. Information may be provided to a resource based on a review by a human assistant, which may improve future performance of a task. A resource(s) may be rated based at least in part on a result(s) provided by the resource and\/or information provided by a human assistant. Any number of human assistants may be provided and\/or utilized based on information associated with a request. By selectively providing a human assistant(s), and continuously evaluating the performance of a resource(s), utilization of resources by the system may be improved.","A system is provided which allows a user or InfoSeeker\u2122 who may be any person or entity to submit a request to a \u201csearch service\u201d or request processing system and receive a response or \u201csearch result\u201d or \u201cresult\u201d. A system is implemented which may establish communication between a user, a guide, a resource, and\/or a search system allows requests to be processed. A database comprising information regarding a number of users, guides, resources, requests advertisements, categories, keywords, tags, profiles, etc. is provided.","A request submitted by a user may receive a response which is produced automatically and\/or utilizing assistance of a number of guides. In at least one embodiment, a request submitted by a user is compared to a database in order to determine if a matching request exists in the database. If a matching request is found, a result(s) associated with the matching request(s) may be presented to a user(s) responsive to a request(s).","A user request(s) may require various types of processing to be performed. A user request might include information which requires conversion from one form to another, and\/or be processed in order that a response may be provided to the user. For example, a user request might be submitted as a spoken query in a natural language, which might require audio information to be converted to text information, might require natural language text to be converted to a structured query, and might require a search result(s) obtained in text form to be converted to audible speech. A user request may require any number and\/or types of processing.","Various types of resources may be made available to perform information processing. A resource may be a completely automated system which receives information in a prescribed format, and returns a result in a prescribed format. For example, a web service, or an Application Program Interface (API), or other interface for exchanging information may be defined which does not include a human assistant and\/or may employ the assistance of a human in order to produce a result. A human assistant may be provided by a search system in order to review, correct a result(s) produced by a resource, etc. Review results provided by a human assistant may be provided to a resource(s). Review result(s) may be associated with a user(s), a guide(s), a resource(s), a profile(s), a location(s), and\/or other information associated with a user(s) and\/or a guide(s) individually, and\/or in aggregate.","A resource(s) may be rated and\/or ranked based at least in part on information provided by a human assistant(s). A result(s) associated with a resource may be presented to a human assistant, and\/or a human assistant may provide a result which is compared to a result provided by a resource(s) automatically and\/or utilizing a human assistant(s). Methods and systems for optimizing the performance of a resource(s) and for providing a human assistant(s) are described further herein. The human assistant(s) may improve usability of the system, and resource(s) available to the system. Further, information of a resource(s), a request(s), a user(s), and\/or a guide(s) may be provided to third parties for purposes such as targeting information such as services, advertising and\/or other content, and\/or for recruitment, compensation, etc.","A \u201cuser\u201d is any person or entity which may submit a request or search request. A \u201crequest\u201d or \u201csearch request\u201d or \u201cquery\u201d is any request for information which may be originated by a person and\/or a device or system. A user may be referred to as a \u201crequester\u201d, information seeker or InfoSeeker\u2122.","A \u201cguide\u201d is any person who may be compensated and\/or may be a volunteer who may respond to and\/or assist with a request. An \u201cambassador\u201d is a guide who may perform processing of a request and\/or a search result(s). A \u201csearcher\u201d is a guide who may perform an information search responsive to a request. A \u201ctranscriber\u201d who may also be a guide may convert a spoken portion of a request into text, and\/or may otherwise convert information of a request from one form to another. A guide may be referred to as a \u201chuman assistant\u201d or \u201chuman searcher\u201d or \u201csearcher\u201d. A guide may perform any type of task. Any guide may act in any defined guide role. However, a human assistant who performs a task and a guide who conducts a search may not necessarily be the same. For example, a human assistant may perform a task to facilitate a search which is conducted by another person who is registered as a guide.","An \u201cidentifier\u201d or ID may include character(s), number(s) and\/or other type(s) of information which may be used to identify an item including item(s) of a database. Items may include but are not limited to a guide(s), a user(s), a resource(s), an advertisement(s), a keyword(s), a category(ies), a search result(s), a search request(s), a query(ies), a rating(s), ranking(s), a message(s) and\/or a profile(s).","A \u201cguided request\u201d is a request which uses the assistance of one or more guides.","A \u201cresult\u201d or \u201csearch result\u201d or \u201canswer\u201d is any information which may be provided responsive to a request.

For example, any or all of the operations may be executed by a multiprocessor computer.","A method and system are described for improving utilization of system resource(s). A resource may be identified which may perform any type of information processing. Access information and a category(ies) may be associated with a resource(s), which may indicate a type of information processing which a resource may perform. A rating of a resource(s) may be obtained using information provided by a guide(s), a user(s), a resource(s) and\/or a management system.

Such information may be used to improve performance and\/or utilization of a resource by for example, personalizing a result provided by a resource based on information provided. Personalization may be based on information associated with an individual and\/or any group of persons. For example, a group of guides and\/or users might be created and\/or designated based on any information indicated in the database  ().","A user may submit any type of information as any or all of a request. The system may provide an architecture whereby any types of resources which may be required to perform a type of information processing may be identified.

The system might be implemented to provide any type of information to any user, resource, guide, etc. in various embodiments. For example, the system  might be a transaction processing system for a financial institution which would provide the ability to process customer requests via any available access system, while preserving the anonymity and security of information associated with the customer.","Similarly, the system  () might provide translation services to various customers. A query history, demographic information, spoken query and translation information might be provided by guides skilled in one or more languages which could be used as a basis for continuous improvement and training of automated resources which might augment the human translators and provide human translation services whenever needed on an ad-hoc basis. Likewise, the database  () might be used to assist users in learning a new language by providing practical examples, interactions and corrections using a blend of human interpreters\/transcribers and automated resources. The information provided is highly valuable to the learner, who may increase his rating and may thus be certified at a given level of proficiency versus native speakers, etc.","As previously discussed the use of system resources in a human-assisted search system is an essential element of success. Systems which utilize humans to respond to user requests have found general acceptance due to the user friendly nature of human interaction. However, the high cost of human interaction has driven many businesses to seek automation at the expense of user experience. In order to achieve a balance between user experience and cost, it is important that persons utilized to respond to user requests are provided with a toolset which may improve the speed and efficiency of processing a user request. Manpower costs may be a major component of cost in a human powered system. For this reason, a tool which allows a result to be provided with minimal time and effort would be greatly appreciated.","A tool for query processing which may improve utilization of resources is described. The query processing tool assists a person to provide a response to request rapidly while ensuring that a request is routed to an appropriate resource as the request is processed.","In a human assisted search system, a search request or search query is directed to a person who may perform an information search responsive to the search request and provide a result(s) to a user. Human assisted search systems have been implemented by companies such as AskMeNow, AnyQueryAnswered, ChaCha\u2122 and others. For example, US Published application 20050289130 by Cohen et. al., describes a system whereby a query is received from a user device, transcribed, and a response provided to a user as a text message on the user device. Likewise US Published application 20070219987 by Meyers describes a system whereby text queries may be processed and answers returned to a user. These systems may require use of templates or other types of question formatting by users and transcribers in order to increase the percentage of queries which may be answered automatically. In particular, information contained in a query may be compared to a database of previously answered queries in order to determine whether a query may be answered automatically. In instances wherein a query is determined not to match a database of previous queries, a selection of one or more possibly related previous answers may be ranked and presented to a searcher who may select a previously provided answer or perform a search.","Such a system may locate a previous query(ies) using a matching of a raw or unprocessed query with information of previous queries and\/or answers which are indicated in a system database. However, this sort of system may face difficulties. A natural language query which is a free-form request may not be easily matched to a database of previous queries. Various elements of a natural language query which may or may not be deduced from the syntax and\/or equivalence tables of a target language may prevent a suitable matching of a raw user request to a result with the consequence that the efficiency, accuracy and timeliness of a response may be adversely affected.","In light of the above and other problems existing in human powered search systems, there is a need for a method, system and tools for creating and classifying a search query based on a user search request.","A method and system are disclosed whereby a human searcher or \u2018guide\u2019 may construct a search query based upon a user request. A structured query or \u2018succinct\u2019 query or \u2018vetted\u2019 query may be formed using a specific grammar or syntax for construction(s) of a query which is used to index queries in a database. A system for construction of a search query may assist in locating and utilizing a result(s), resource(s), searcher(s), advertisement(s), and\/or other information. A search request is received and compared to a database of requests. If no matching request is located, a request is directed to a human searcher or guide, who may then review the request and construct a search query based on the request. Any number of search queries, searchers, results, resources, advertisements, categorizations, and\/or other items indicated in a database which may be relevant to a request are presented to a searcher along with a request in order that the searcher may select items to be associated with the request.","A structured query conforming to a defined grammar syntax is constructed using the assistance of a guide which may be used to index a database of queries, which may improve matching of queries, searchers, results, resources, advertisements, categorizations, and\/or other items indicated in a database to the user request. A system embodiment, methods, data structures and interfaces for operating the embodiments are disclosed.","A request which may include a keyword(s), a phrase, and\/or a fully formed sentence, and\/or information such as images, audio, video, or any type of media is received by a search system selectively utilizing the assistance of human searchers or \u2018guides\u2019. A result(s) is provided to a user responsive to a request. A result(s) may be produced using any resource(s) and\/or other information which may be accessible to a guide(s) and\/or a search system. A request may be compared to a database of requests and\/or queries in order to determine whether a matching query exists. If a matching query or request is determined to exist, a result(s) associated with the matching query may be automatically presented to a user(s) responsive to a request. If a match to a request is determined not to exist, a request may be routed to a searcher who may process the request. A guide may process a user request to construct a search query which conforms to a specific sentence structure or syntax. A structured query may be used to index a database of requests and\/or queries. A structured and\/or categorized query may improve selection of results and\/or resources. A guide performing a query analysis role may be referred to as an \u201cambassador guide\u201d or \u201cambassador\u201d.","A query formation tool is provided to assist in the formation and disambiguation of a search query and may provide information in order that a categorization(s), a result(s), a resource(s), an advertisement(s), and\/or a searcher(s) may be associated with a request. A person may provide information which associates a query with an existing search query or request, which information may be stored in a database. Information of equivalence relationships between any or all elements of a request and information in a database may be recorded. A query which may be formed using the tool may be associated with an automated and\/or human resource(s) based on content of the query or request. Recorded information may be used to associate queries which have a common syntax with a resource(s), category(ies), and\/or information which may be used to produce a result(s) and\/or information which may be returned responsive to a request.","A database is provided which may include records which indicate a result(s) associated with a structured query or a \u2018vetted query\u2019 constructed according to a particular syntax, and other forms of a request which have been associated with the structured query. Matching of a search query may be evaluated based on equivalence of structure and\/or one or more elements contained in a search query. For example, a meaning of a keyword(s) may be determined based on a number of categories, tags, profiles, locations, etc. associated with a request, a location and\/or profile may provide additional information regarding a query, etc.","The terms voice and speech are used interchangeably herein. As mentioned above, a user, a resource, and\/or a guide may establish a communication session using a voice service, a messaging service such as Short Messaging Service (SMS), Enhanced Messaging Service (EMS), Multi-media Messaging Service (MMS), Instant Messaging (IM), email, an internet portal or web page, a web service, an API, regular mail or any other type of communication.

Alternatively, a guide may use any part of a provided answer and\/or his or her own text as a response to a user submitted query by entering such text into the answer building text box . The text remaining indicator  may display the number of characters a guide has remaining to provide in the answer building text box  based on a total number of characters and\/or words that a guide is allowed to use in building his or her answer. The number of characters may be based on a user device constraint, or any system constraints.","The \u2018Send Answer\u2019 button  may be selected if a guide has completed the assembly, formation, selection or otherwise an answer in response to the user submitted query. A guide may alternatively select from the user controls . The \u2018Customer Clarify\u2019 user control may be selected to obtain clarification of a user submitted query and\/or obtain additional information from a user that may be advantageous in forming an answer. The \u2018Abort\u2019 user control may be used to cancel the current session and close the GUI . The \u2018Abuse\u2019 user control may be used to report abuse or other prohibited behavior of a user to the search system. In addition, a guide may select the status selection tool  to indicate that the guide desires to change his or her status to \u2018Away\u2019 and not accept additional queries after completion of the current session.","An ambassador may act as a \u2018first line\u2019 responder to a user request. An ambassador guide is trained and provided with a toolset which allows the ambassador to construct a vetted query. A vetted query is categorized, formatted to remove spelling, grammar, structure or other natural-language ambiguities or errors, and may be associated with information such as a location, or attributes of a user who submitted a query. Utilizing an ambassador, who may spend a few seconds to at most a few minutes to process a query, the cost to serve a customer is greatly reduced.","An ambassador may respond to a user request which does not require a rigorous search using a tool which provides a selection of approved response options. By responding with a standardized set of responses which may be targeted by the search system, efficiency of the ambassador may be improved while retaining the human touch and avoiding unstructured replies. As a query which is not requesting information is not directed to a searcher, the quality of such a response is improved, and searchers are not occupied with irrelevant queries. By providing an ambassador, the cost and speed of response to a user request is improved. An ambassador may create a query which may be mapped to a query in a database which may be associated with a search result(s). The more effective categorization and systematic formulation of a query may greatly increase the reuse of previous answers, reducing cost and improving answer quality.","Pre-processing of a query by an ambassador may reduce the time required by a searcher to provide a response, as a searcher receives a request which is clear, concise and is directed to or forwarded to an appropriate searcher. A less experienced or lower cost searcher may be selected which may reduce the overall cost to serve a customer. A better targeted advertisement may be delivered to a user more rapidly, which may be provided to the user during a search process.","As a raw query is mapped to a vetted or structured query, the re-use of search results may be improved. The mapping of a raw query to a structured query may be personalized to a user, as an ambassador may indicate relevance of location, and may categorize a request, and may include information based on a history record obtained by the search system","An ambassador guide may be presented with information regarding availability of system resources. An ambassador guide may be able to view information regarding search result(s), available searcher(s), rating information, etc. which may be used to respond to a user search request. An ambassador guide may respond to a user request, may transfer a search request to a searcher or other guide, and\/or may utilize an automated search resource to respond to a user. An ambassador guide may select one or more communication services which may be used to provide information to a user responsive to a search request(s).","When a search result(s) is available, an ambassador guide may review a result(s) and may determine whether and\/or how a search result(s) is provided to a user. An ambassador guide may interact with a user to determine how information responsive to a search request is transmitted to a user. An ambassador guide may process a search result(s) so that it is suited to a user device(s) and\/or communication service(s). An ambassador may be provided with a tool set which may be used to perform formatting or other processing of information provided responsive to a search request. An ambassador guide may select an advertisement and\/or other information to be provided to a user responsive to a search request.","Information of activity by ambassador guides may be used to improve automated matching of requests to resources. For example, a database of requests which have been associated with vetted queries may be used to improve automated categorization, structuring of a query, etc. in order that a query may be answered automatically and\/or may be automatically routed to a suitable searcher without the intervention of an ambassador. The ambassador activity may be preformed more rapidly than a free-form search activity. As a result, the compensation of an ambassador per activity may be lower than that for a searcher. If the percentage of queries which can receive either an automated response or a response from an ambassador is increased, overall system costs and efficiency may be improved. Likewise, as a vetted query may be directed to a more knowledgeable searcher, response time of the searcher, quality of a search result, and user experience may be improved.","While the ambassador role has been described in the context of a search request, it may be applied in other types of human-assisted information processing. For example, an ambassador might determine that a request included a request for a product, service, or item. An ambassador might obtain additional information from a user and route the user to a guide or other person who might fulfill the user request.","In order to efficiently serve users of a human assisted search system multiple technologies must be deployed to ensure the best use of system resources. As previously discussed, the cost of manpower may be the largest element of cost. Likewise it is highly desirable to provide a robust infrastructure to the human elements of a human assisted search service. However, the task is more complex than it might appear, particularly in light of the need to have a scalable system of providing information to a community which may be continuously changing. As most workers in a distributed work environment are independent contractors, the work hours will be irregular and contractors will join and leave the community at will.","In such an environment, it is necessary that workers be provided with domain specific training information in order to acquire expertise associated with a new domain rapidly. For example, methods and resources for finding information of restaurants and hotels would be completely different than those for finding information of scientific research regarding recombinant DNA. In order to process such a diversity of queries people with generalized skills must not only be provided with training, but tools which may provide access to needed information sources. The conventional approach has been to provide training materials which are directed to generic searching, and to provide a few recommendations of search engines or websites which are most likely to produce a result. However such systems suffer from a lack of scalability as the resource tree is homogeneous and undirected to a particular area of interest. In light of these and other problems a scalable system for targeting support information would be greatly appreciated.","A method and system are disclosed to improve the accessibility and relevance of support information. The support information may be provided to human searchers or \u201cguides\u201d who may respond to a user request. A user may be provided with support information and\/or resources which may enable a user to perform a search more effectively when a guide is not used to assist with a search. Guides are associated with a number of categories and a \u2018common area\u2019 is created which may be accessible to guides associated with a category. Access to resources, search tools, guidance, and relevant information may be provided based on various privileges. If a guide is associated with a category the guide may be able to create and\/or modify items which may be associated with the category. Resources may include any source of information such as websites, software programs, documents, databases, persons, any type of media, and\/or combinations thereof. Search tools may include items such as data feeds, custom search engines (CSE's), etc. which may index resources of any sort, Guidance may include media which may explain use of resources, search tools, domain specific information and\/or general techniques for performing a search.","Content and\/or other information associated with a category may be associated with a common area which may be a \u2018wiki\u2019 which is shared and editable by a group of persons which may include guides. Items may be added to the common area based on use and\/or recommendation of items by guides, addition of items by guides and\/or system administrators, processing and analysis of historical search data, and\/or importing information provided by a database such as DMOZ. Content associated with a category may be indexed in various ways. Keywords may be extracted from content associated with a category, which may then be matched with keywords contained in a request. For example, if a keyword occurs with high frequency in resources associated with a category, a query including the keyword may be more likely to be associated with the category. In at least one embodiment, a guide may select a category to be associated with a request, which may cause items associated with the category to be ranked based on keywords of the request. In at least one embodiment, keywords may be associated with a category which may be used to rank the category based on keywords indicated in a request, and resources associated with the category may be ranked based on keywords associated with the category.","If a request is associated with a category, an interface including items associated with the category may be provided. In at least one embodiment, at least a portion of the request may be submitted to a search tool, a resource, or other information associated with a category. An interface presented responsive to a request may be customized based on content of the request, which may include combining information associated with multiple categories in order that relevant information may be provided if a categorization associated with a request is not certain, etc.","An index of information associated with categories may be edited in various ways. An index may be created and\/or modified by a human editor or taxonomist, who may be able to create associations between categories as further described herein with respect to  and .

A guide(s) and\/or a user(s) may be able to associate information with a category(ies) and\/or other elements of an index such as \u2018tags\u2019 and\/or keywords. For example, a \u2018wiki\u2019 of any sort may be associated with a category(ies). A guide(s) and\/or user(s) may have various rights to add, remove, and\/or review information which may be associated with a category(ies), which may be based on information associated with a guide(s) and\/or user(s) such as rating or ranking information. For example, a permission level may be based experience, qualification, quality rating, and\/or other criteria.","A search tool may be associated with a category(ies). For example, a custom search engine may be associated with a category(ies) which may be customized by a person(s), who may be a guide(s), which may be used to locate information related to the category(ies). A search tool may be dynamically updated. A database may be created and\/or modified which may be used to modify the performance of a search tool(s).","Information associated with a category or index may be used to provide assistance with using a search facility associated with the category. For example a frequently asked questions (FAQ) list might be associated with a category, which might assist first time users to be better able to use information presented. In at least one embodiment, video, audio and\/or other media which might be relevant to use of a resource(s), tool(s), and\/or other information associated with an index. News feeds, information finders such as dictionaries, etc. may be provided which may assist with a search.","The terms voice and speech are used interchangeably herein.

Top-level elements or nodes of the tree represent broad categories of information (also referred to as \u2018path root terms\u2019) which are intended to encompass as much information as possible without overlapping each other. Path root terms such as the path root terms \u201carts\u201d , \u201cgeography\u201d  and \u201cshopping\u201d  may be a limited set of words and\/or phrases which may be used to classify or categorize information such as a search request, a guide, an advertisement, a search result, etc.","A word(s) or phrase(s) associated with lower-level nodes may appear in multiple locations within an index or database. Such words and\/or phrases may be referred to as \u2018topics\u2019. For example, words and\/or phrases such as the topics \u201cmusic\u201d , \u201cjazz\u201d \u201d, \u201cpainting\u201d , \u201cclothing\u201d , \u201crock\u201d , \u201cclassical\u201d , \u201cartists\u201d  and\/or others may be utilized in any path defined in the database relationship . A subset of information is defined by specifying topics (or \u2018path terms\u2019) which may follow a subset relationship (i.e., any added word and\/or phrase defines a more specific type of information which is contained within the preceding set of information). An example of this relationship is designated by the notation \u201carts>music>jazz\u201d indicating that \u201cjazz\u201d is a subset of \u201cmusic\u201d which is a subset of \u201carts\u201d. This may for example designate the path \u201carts>music>jazz\u201d . Such a subset relationship is represented in . The selected subset of information is contained within a perimeter of the set . Thus a guide and\/or information associated with a more specific subject, which may correspond to a longer path (e.g., the path \u201carts>music>jazz\u201d  ()) may be more likely to be relevant to a query associated with the path than a guide and\/or information associated with a shorter path (e.g., the path \u201carts>music\u201d ).","A path which begins with a path root term, such as the path \u201carts>music\u201d , or the path \u201cshopping>music>jazz\u201d  may be referred to as a \u2018proper path\u2019. A path which does not begin with a path root term such as the path \u201cmusic>jazz>artists\u201d  may be referred to as a \u2018path snippet\u2019. A path snippet may occur in multiple locations within the database . The presence of such a path snippet may indicate that proper paths which contain identical path snippets may be related.","As illustrated in , an overlap in relevant information associated within any given set(s) of information defined by a path root term may exist. For example, the information included in the root term set \u201carts\u201d , and the topic subset \u201cmusic\u201d , and the topic subset \u201cjazz\u201d  (i.e., associated with the path \u201carts>music>jazz\u201d  () may also be relevant to the information included in the root term set \u201cshopping\u201d , and the topic subset \u201cmusic\u201d , and the topic subset \u201cjazz\u201d  (i.e., associated with the path \u201cshopping>music>jazz\u201d  (). If a hierarchical approach is used to rank guide(s) and\/or information such as resources, or advertisements, a guide and\/or information associated with the \u201cshopping>music>jazz\u201d subset it is unlikely it is going to be ranked highly when selecting a guide and\/or information to respond to a request associated with the classification \u201carts>music>jazz\u201d.","The presence of a shared path snippet (e.g., \u201cmusic>jazz\u201d) may be identified by the system  (). In order to improve effectiveness of a taxonomic classification, a link may be established between proper paths. For example, a link may be established between the proper path \u201carts>music>jazz\u201d  () and the proper path \u201cshopping>music>jazz\u201d . Such a link may be established based on automatic detection of a relationship between the paths by the search system  () and\/or may be based on a judgment of a human taxonomist operating a taxonomist system such as the taxonomist systems , . Such a link may be unidirectional (i.e., \u201carts>music>jazz\u201d is equivalent to \u201cshopping>music>jazz\u201d, but \u201cshopping>music>jazz\u201d is not equivalent to \u201carts>music>jazz\u201d), or bidirectional (i.e., \u201carts>music>jazz\u201d is equivalent to \u201cshopping>music>jazz\u201d and vice-versa). A method and system for creating and maintaining linkages between proper paths is described further herein below.","While the data structure  () is illustrated with only a few levels (i.e., short paths), any number of levels and\/or length of paths may exist within the data structure . As such it is possible that paths which contain multiple topics in common may exist. For example, a proper path such as \u201carts>music>jazz>artists>1960\u201d and a proper path \u201carts>music>jazz>1960>artists\u201d might exist. Such a condition may be identified, and a human taxonomist and\/or the system  () may determine that one or more proper paths are equivalent. The system  () may determine association between paths based on a similarity of information identifying categories. In such a case, a linkage may be established which associates guides and\/or information associated with a proper path with any equivalent proper path. Using a different example, a proper path such as \u201carts>music>songwriters>baby boomers\u201d might exist. Such a path might be determined to be more strongly related to a path such as \u201carts>music>artists>1960s\u201d because the first path terms are common, and the path snippet \u201csongwriters>baby boomers\u201d is related to the snippet \u201cartists>1960s\u201d. A taxonomist and\/or other elements of the system  () may determine if a linkage should be established between a proper path(s). Alternatively, a linkage between path(s) may also be established based on usage information.","Various types of information may be associated with any proper path within a data structure such as the data structure  (). Any proper path designates a unique element within the data structure . Using the example in , the node designated by the proper path \u201carts>music\u201d  is different than the node designated by the proper path \u201carts>music>jazz\u201d  and the node designated by the proper path \u201cshopping>music>jazz\u201d . Each element within the data structure  may be associated with one or more records such as the categorization record  illustrated in . A categorization record may be used to associate any type of information with a node within a data structure which may be used to index the information.
