abstract: The present invention relates to a system and methodology providing an Application Programming Interface (API) and framework that supports a meta-object model for application design and operating system interactions. The API includes an input component that receives data and/or instructions. The input component processes a meta-data model that interrelates data via a class hierarchy, wherein the class hierarchy includes relationship descriptions between class objects, attributes, rules, and/or behavioral descriptions. Another aspect includes a data management system that includes a component to receive an item having meta-data annotations. An analysis component determines at runtime a structure for the item via deployment of the meta-data annotations. The system can also include a framework component that defines meta-data class derivations, meta-data classes, meta-data integrity rules, and/or meta-data class behavior.

No. 10\/666,977, filed on Sep. 18, 2003, entitled EXTENSIBILITY APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE AND FRAMEWORK FOR META-MODEL, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates generally to computer systems, and more particularly to a system and method that facilitates application development via a meta-model object and framework supporting meta-classes, meta-attributes, meta-relationships, rules and behavior.","Modern operating systems are required to support many diverse applications having complex interrelationships with the system. Such applications include word processors, spreadsheets, development tools, communications applications, graphical applications, and processing applications to name but a few examples. One innovation for implementing such applications has been through employment of object oriented programming techniques. Object oriented programming shifts the emphasis of software development away from function decomposition and towards the recognition of units of software called \u201cobjects\u201d which encapsulate both data and functions. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) objects are software entities comprising data structures and operations on data. Together, these elements enable objects to model virtually any real-world entity in terms of its characteristics, represented by its data elements, and its behavior represented by its data manipulation functions. In this way, objects can model concrete things like people and computers, and they can model abstract concepts like numbers or geometrical concepts. For example, an \u201cobject-oriented\u201d computer scientist would be mostly concerned with an application under design, and secondarily with the tools used to develop it\u2014whereas a \u201cnon-object-oriented\u201d scientist would think primarily of his or her tools.","The benefit of object technology arises out of three basic principles: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance. Objects hide or encapsulate the internal structure of their data and the algorithms by which their functions work. Instead of exposing these implementation details, objects present interfaces that represent their abstractions cleanly with no extraneous information. Polymorphism takes encapsulation one step further\u2014the idea being many shapes, one interface. A software component can make a request of another component without knowing exactly what that component is. The component that receives the request interprets it and figures out according to its variables and data how to execute the request. The third principle is inheritance, which allows developers to reuse pre-existing design and code. This capability allows developers to avoid creating software from scratch. Rather, through inheritance, developers derive subclasses that inherit behaviors which the developer then customizes to meet particular needs.","In particular, an object includes, and is characterized by, a set of data (e.g., image data) and a set of operations (e.g., methods), that can operate on the data. Generally, an object's data is ideally changed only through the operation of the object's methods. Methods in an object are invoked by passing a message to the object (e.g., message passing). The message specifies a method name and an argument list. When the object receives the message, code associated with the named method is executed with the formal parameters of the method bound to the corresponding values in the argument list. Methods and message passing in OOP are analogous to procedures and procedure calls in procedure-oriented software environments.","However, while procedures operate to modify and return passed parameters, methods operate to modify the internal state of the associated objects (by modifying the data contained therein). The combination of data and methods in objects is called encapsulation. Encapsulation provides for the state of an object to only be changed by well-defined methods associated with the object. When the behavior of an object is confined to such well-defined locations and interfaces, changes (e.g., code modifications) in the object will have minimal impact on the other objects and elements in the system.","Each object is an instance of some class. A class includes a set of data attributes plus a set of allowable operations (e.g., methods) on the data attributes. As mentioned above, OOP supports inheritance\u2014a class (called a subclass) may be derived from another class (called a base class, parent class, etc.), where the subclass inherits the data attributes and methods of the base class. The subclass may specialize the base class by adding code which overrides the data and\/or methods of the base class, or which adds new data attributes and methods. Thus, inheritance represents a mechanism by which abstractions are made increasingly concrete as subclasses are created for greater levels of specialization.","Although object-oriented programming techniques are still widely employed, newer systems and applications have evolved. One such system includes a managed object system whereby the operating system itself is involved in the determination and management of the lifetime of an object (e.g., automatically reclaiming an object from system memory via a garbage collector versus internal reference counting on the object). These systems also support different types of data such as meta-data, for example, that provide data and corresponding descriptions for such data. When newer applications are developed for these type data structures and systems however, object-oriented models are at a minimum are problematic. For example, such models may require application designers to maintain and manage operating system states and events in order to successfully implement an application. Thus, with traditional approaches, even simple changes to an application document or item can require very complex code to maintain internal document structure and to support corresponding changes.","The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key\/critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","The present invention relates to systems and methods that facilitate application development by providing an Application Programming Interface (API) and framework supporting meta-data manipulations and interactions. A meta-model object is provided that supports a higher-level abstraction for data classes operating in context of meta-data than is provided by conventional object models. This abstraction includes a description for the types of classes that may be involved during application development, deployment, and execution. These descriptions also enable developers to describe attributes, relationships, and respective constraints for meta-data that simplifies program development and operating system interactions.","In one aspect, the API is provided as an extensibility framework that reduces the effort required to build and maintain applications (e.g., software modeling tools). Users of the API can create assemblies that contain annotated classes that derive from classes defined by the associated framework. The framework reads meta-data from respective component assemblies to determine at runtime the structure of an item such as a document, for example. Thus, users of the API may extend the structure of a base item or document with new meta-classes, meta-attributes, meta-relationships, integrity rules, and behavior, for example. Also, the API supports base-level functionality such as undo\/redo, transactions, and lightweight events, thereby relieving developers from coding and managing such tasks.","As noted above, the present invention defines and supports meta-model objects to facilitate efficient application development and mitigate complexities associated with operating system interactions. Such models can include meta-classes that are abstract entities that make up an item (e.g., relational table). These classes correspond in general to classes in an object model. Thus, meta-classes may inherit from other meta-classes. Other aspects of the model include meta-attributes that are values associated with the meta-class (e.g., the name of a table) and generally correspond to the fields of a class. Meta-relationships, which are also part of the model, include descriptions of relationships that may exist between various model classes (e.g., associating a relational table column with a bounded default for the column).","Another aspect of the present invention in conjunction with the API is to provide a set of basic services that are required to implement software design tools and editors for items such as documents having complex structure. Such items can be managed within components such as stores and sub-stores. These basic services support for example:\n\n","The API enables developers to manipulate complex documents in a straightforward and natural manner. In contrast with traditional approaches, even simple changes to a document can require very complex code to maintain internal document structure and suitably handle undo\/redo functionality, for example. A typical use of the API is to create a set of interrelated classes that inherit from base classes in a core meta-model. These classes are then able to leverage the base classes for services such as state management. Typically, class implementers wrap calls to a lower level API with properties and events that call lower level APIs. Thus, a broad range of high quality design tools for developers can be supported. The extensibility API significantly reduces the cost of development and increases the quality of design tools that are constructed therewith.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative aspects of the invention are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative of various ways in which the invention may be practiced, all of which are intended to be covered by the present invention. Other advantages and novel features of the invention may become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","The present invention relates to a system and methodology providing an Application Programming Interface (API) and framework that supports a meta-model object for application design and operating system interactions. In one aspect of the present invention, an API is provided having an input component that receives data and\/or instructions. The input component processes a meta-data model that interrelates data via a class hierarchy, wherein the class hierarchy includes relationship descriptions between class objects, attributes, rules, and\/or behavioral descriptions. Another aspect includes a data management system or engine that includes a component to receive an item having meta-data annotations. An analysis component determines at runtime a structure for the item via deployment of the meta-data annotations. The system can also include a framework component that defines meta-data class derivations, meta-data classes, meta-data integrity rules, and\/or meta-data class behavior.","As used in this application, the terms \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201cframework,\u201d \u201cassembly,\u201d \u201capplication,\u201d \u201csystem,\u201d and the like are intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and\/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers.","Referring initially to , a system  illustrates an application programming interface and framework for processing meta-model objects in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. The system  includes an Application Programming Interface (API)  and associated services that operate in conjunction with an operating system framework . The API  enables one or more applications  to utilize base functionality of the operating system framework  while mitigating management and design of complex code to interact with the system. For example, applications  often need to be aware of system level states and events that may impact operation of the applications. The API  relieves the applications  from processing such states and events by providing functionality, services, and interfaces that can be called by the applications in lieu of designing and managing code for such services. In one specific example, applications  often need to undo and\/or redo a previous action such as when a user attempts to undo a graphics or text action in a document (e.g., undo is often implemented as a control-z action in the application). The API  enables the application  to call basic interfaces that support\/process such actions without causing any given application to replicate and manage code. As can be appreciated, a plurality of such functionality can be provided by the API  as will be described in more detail below.","In general, the API provides an extension to the framework  that reduces the effort required to build and maintain applications  such as software modeling tools, editor tools, design tools, graphics tools, word processors, and so forth. Users of the API  can create one or more assemblies  that contain annotated classes that derive from classes defined by the associated framework . The framework  reads meta-data from respective component assemblies  to determine at runtime the structure of an item such as a document, for example. Consequently, users of the API  may extend the structure of a base item or document with new meta-classes, meta-attributes, meta-relationships, integrity rules, and behavior, for example. Also, the API  supports base-level functionality such as undo\/redo operations, basic file operations, other transactions, and lightweight events, thereby relieving developers from coding and managing such tasks.","The system  defines and supports meta-model objects to facilitate efficient application development and mitigate complexities associated with operating system interactions. Such models can include meta-classes  that are abstract entities that make up an item such as a relational table or other item component. These classes correspond in general to classes in an object model. Thus, meta-classes  may inherit from other meta-classes and\/or from base functionality provided by the framework . Other aspects of the model include meta-attributes  that are values associated with the meta-class  (e.g., the name of a table) and generally correspond to the fields of a class. Meta-relationships , which are also part of the model, include descriptions of relationships that may exist between various model classes and are described in more detail below with other properties and behaviors illustrated at .","Before proceeding, it is noted that the following discussion includes example code implementations. These implementations may employ such example coding aspects as utilizing C# code or SQL statements. It is to be appreciated however, that the meta-model objects, framework, and associated API functionality can be applied to substantially any type of code mechanism (e.g., X#, Pearl, Ruby, Python, other dynamic languages, and so forth), component, and\/or system that is operative with meta-data and\/or managed operating systems.","The following discussion describes various aspects of meta-model objects in accordance with the present invention. Meta-data is data describing the structure of classes and relationships between the classes. Meta-data can be logically decomposed into several types of meta-data including meta-models (information about models, such as a Relational Model or a Process Model), meta-classes (information about classes), and meta-relationships (relationships between meta-classes). While each type of meta-data generally has specialized information content, some information content is shared between meta-data classes. Typically, all classes storing model meta-data need to be uniquely identified. Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) are guaranteed to be globally unique, so they are a good choice for a unique identifier.","GUIDs are often difficult for humans to remember, associate with a particular idea, or even type without error. Because of this, the system  can attach non-unique (not-guaranteed-unique) textual labels to meta-data classes. These labels are sometimes referred to as \u201cNames.\u201d Meta-data classes' identities can be exposed in a user interface (UI), especially in property pages, as the class of the model elements. Names are generally not appropriate here because they tend to be developer-centric and they are not localized. In lieu of the Name property, a localized friendly tag can be employed which is called a \u201cCaption.\u201d","A meta-model is type of meta-data describing a model's structure. Examples of models include a UML model and an SQL Server Schema model. The model's structure is composed of the meta-classes and meta-relationships of the model. Each meta-model can be associated with a partition of a database (e.g., SQL server database), which is called a schema.","The meta-class  is a class encapsulating data employed to represent another class. For example, the meta-class for a relational database table class may have operations to describe the type of the table class, the column structure of the table, and so forth. The classes that meta-classes  describe may have inheritance relationships with other classes. Attributes of the meta-class  are contained in an ordered set of meta-attributes. As noted above, meta-classes  may have relationships with other meta-classes. For example, relational tables have a relationship with relational table columns, which may be named \u201cTableColumn,\u201d for example.","The meta-attributes  are the attributes of the meta-class . For example, the meta-attributes for a relational table column might include data-type, length, and default value, for example. Meta-classes  can be represented as a table in a Working Store (described below) and the meta-attributes  associated with the meta-class are represented as the columns of that table. Meta-relationships  include various types of relationships between various model classes. For example, relational tables contain relational table columns, and relational table columns may be associated with a bound default. The descriptions of these relationships are contained in meta-relationships . One example way to capture relationship data in a database is to use a join table, which allows various cardinality combinations to be modeled uniformly. The meta-classes that are participating in the relationship are said to play a role in the relationship. The information about these roles is called a meta-role. Each meta-relationship typically contains an ordered set of meta-roles.","Meta-roles are data about the participation of meta-classes  in a meta-relationship. Meta-roles have a reference to the meta-class playing the role. This is used to determine which meta-class instances can be allowed to participate in a particular meta-relationship instance. Meta-roles may be optional in a relationship. This information is used when validating a meta-class instance\u2014a meta-class instance is generally invalid if it is required to participate in a relationship with another meta-class instance, but no such instance is defined. Meta-class instances may be logically composed of other meta-class instances. For example, relational table instances may contain (be composed of) its columns. Meta-roles have an associated cardinality, which is the maximum number of meta-class instances that may play the role in a given meta-relationship instance. This cardinality may be \u201cone\u201d or \u201cmany.\u201d This information is used to determine whether a single meta-relationship instance reference or an array of meta-relationship instances is to store relationship instance data for a particular meta-class instance.","Referring now to , a model store  (also referred to as store) is illustrated in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. Model data is typically stored in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure. This allows for the existence of a well-known root from which model data may be located by traversing the DAG. The top-level nodes in this DAG are called Stores . Stores contain data and meta-data for a particular application (e.g., Visual Studio Solution). More than one Store  may exist in the application at a time. Store objects are contained in a static array of Stores contained by the Store class. This allows the Store class to act as the \u201cwell-known root\u201d of the model data DAG. Associated with the Store  is optionally a database catalog, which can be unambiguously specified by indicating a server, catalog pair.","Generally, Stores  can contain the following objects:\n\n","The following discussion describes the store  and associated components in more detail. Working Store Proxies  encapsulate a physical database that contains a Working Store. When a Working Store Proxy connects to a Working Store instance, it should check to make sure that the versions of the schema in the Working Store match current versions. If the versions in the Working Store are more recent than those known by the Proxy , an exception should be raised and no further interaction should be possible with the database. If the versions in the Working Store are out-of-date, the Proxy should create a new database catalog and invoke methods on the Substores  to migrate the model data to the new database. After the migration, the Proxy  will use the new database as the Working Store for the model.","Substores  contain meta-data for a particular meta-model. When a database is loaded that contains a model, the system or framework generally checks the version status of the model. There are at least four possible results: current, updateable, transformable, and non-transformable. A current model is a database that contains a Working Store where each schema in the database has the same version that the C# code (or other type) is designed to work with. An updateable model is a model where one or more schemas have a previous version stamp, but there are no schema changes required; the schemas can be brought up-to-date by simply changing the version stamps. A transformable model is a model that contains one or more schemas that have a previous version stamp and require a schema change to be brought up-to-date. A non-transformable model is a database that either contains a future version of a meta-model, or one that does not contain a meta-model at all.","The models described above may be much larger than the physical memory. This necessitates the use of a database management system to hold working data models. Information stored in databases is difficult to manipulate directly, thus, a scheme can be adopted where the database is hidden from the modeling classes, and load a subset of the model into memory for manipulation using code in a natural manner. The amount of model data that can be in memory at any time is generally limited to a specific size based on the size of physical memory, the size of code, the size of the system software and other factors. The Model Data Cache Manager  has the responsibility to determine which data needs to be in memory at any given time and loading or unloading data to match those needs.","The Element Class Factory  is responsible for managing the lifetimes of Elements. The Element Class Factory  provides methods to create new Elements, load existing Elements from the Working Store, and remove Elements from the Working Store. The first category of functionality is creating new Elements. New Elements can be created by specifying the C# Type (class) of the Element or by specifying the meta-class for the new Element. New Relationships can be created by specifying the C# Type or the meta-relationship to be instantiated, along with a list of role-players. When a new Element is created, the Element Class Factory  inserts default data rows into the appropriate tables in the working store, creates an Attribute Bag for the Element (e.g., memory location that selectively exposes data members), creates the Element (passing the Attribute Bag to the constructor), and returns the new Element to the caller.","When a new Relationship is created, the Element Class Factory  inserts data rows into the appropriate relationship tables. The role-player data can be set in the Working Store at this time. The Element Class Factory  then creates a Role Bag or location for the Relationship, creates the Relationship (passing the Role Bag to the constructor), and returns the new Relationship to the caller.","The second category of functionality for the Element Class Factory  is loading existing Elements. A subset of Elements to load can be specified:\n\n","The Transaction Manager  is responsible for creating transaction objects and keeping track of open transactions and their transaction level. Creating a new transaction when there is already an open transaction creates a new nested transaction with the current most-nested transaction as the parent. Client code determines whether the database connection has any open transactions and the current transaction depth. A depth of zero indicates that there are no open transactions. Client code will likely need access to the current inner-most transaction, so the Transaction Manager  should provide a way to access it.","Outermost transactions are used to track actions on the store for undo\/redo purposes. Transactions that are outermost need to have ID's and a localized string description (e.g., \u201cdelete class CSeamWelder\u201d) useful for displaying in undo\/redo UI. As a convenience to client code, the Transaction Manager  provides a method to perform an arbitrary store operation in a transaction. The DoAsTransaction method creates a new transaction with a name specified by the caller, and then calls an input delegate. If the delegate throws an exception, the exception is caught, the transaction rolled back, and the exception is re-thrown.","The Undo Manager  is responsible for manipulating Undo\/Redo mechanisms in a Working Store. The Undo Manager  provides methods to Undo the last action and Redo the last Undo. Multiple Redo's are supported, so when an action is undone, and Undo is called, the previous action is undone, ad infinitum.","In addition it is often helpful to allow user to undo multiple steps at once. The Undo Manager  provides a method to undo all actions back to a specified transaction ID in a redo stack. Similarly, the Undo Manager  allows clients to redo undone actions up to a specified transaction ID in the redo stack. An associated user interface (UI) can display a list of transactions to be undone or redone. The Undo manager  can provide this functionality. It is conceivable that the undo or redo stack might need to be truncated at some point. The Undo Manager  provides methods to remove transaction ID's from bottom of the undo or redo stack to a particular transaction ID (e.g., from the beginning to transaction 21199).","Another aspect relating to the store  involves transactions. A Transaction object encapsulates a store transaction. Transactions have an ID, which is a GUID, a Name, and a Caption. A Name is a human readable string appropriate for use with the Undo Manager  and for debugging purposes. A Caption is a localized version of the Name. Transactions may be nested. Nested transactions are named in order that an SQL Server can distinguish between nested transactions. The SQL Server transaction name will not be seen by users, so the transaction name need not match the Transaction object name. Client code determines whether a particular Transaction object is outermost or, if not outermost, its transaction depth. An outermost Transaction has a transaction depth of one.","Transactions can be committed, which makes the work done in the transaction durable. In the presence of nested transactions, committing an outer transaction implicitly commits inner transactions. When a nested transaction is committed, the SQL Server transaction name is specified so SQL Server knows what the client code is trying to commit. When a nested Transaction is committed, its parent Transaction becomes the new innermost transaction. The Transaction Manager  keeps track of the current innermost transaction, so Transactions need to notify the Transaction when they are committed. Transactions also provide a way for the Transaction Manager  to find their parent Transaction. Transactions may also be rolled back, which abandons any changes made during the transaction. A Transaction is considered to be \u201cactive\u201d until it is committed or rolled back. When the transaction has been committed or rolled back, the transaction is \u201cinactive.\u201d It is an error to attempt to commit or roll back an inactive transaction.","Turning now to , additional system components  that can be employed with meta-model objects are illustrated in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. These components can include elements , events , domains , and\/or model schema . The Element  is an instance of a meta-class stored in a model. Element  can also be super-class of all model classes. Elements  provide a mechanism for the classes derived from Element to access their attribute data. Attribute data is generally exposed to clients of Element objects as CLR properties (or other type). Elements  are generally identified by a GUID. This identifier is typically exposed publicly so that certain operations, such as navigating relationships, can be performed. Elements may also be removed from the model.","The Events  are raised to keep various objects up-to-date with changes in the state of the system. For example, object-added events are raised to notify interested listeners when objects are added. The events  generally contain two (or more) other objects\u2014the object raising the event and the event arguments. Composition of the event arguments varies with the type of the event, but is intended to be enough information to meaningfully respond to the event. For example, the event arguments for an object-added event contain a reference to the object that was added.","Events  can be raised at several levels. Store level events supply notifications of events that occur in a solution. Substore level events supply notifications for events that occur within a particular meta-model. Meta-class events provide notifications for instances of that meta-class or derived meta-class. Element events provide information on changes to an individual object.","Generally, there are two broad categories of events\u2014Transactional and Atomic. Transactional events are events associated with a series of actions, generally caused by the operation of a database transaction. Atomic events are events for a single action. Transactional events have both \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d variants. Before-events are largely used to allow listeners to pre-empt an action by throwing an exception. After-events are mostly used to allow listeners to respond to a change. Transactional events include the following types:\n\n","The event arguments for transaction events contain a reference to the Transaction object associated with the event.","Atomic events are notifications that some occurrence has happened. Atomic events include the following types:\n\n","Event arguments for object-added and object-removed events contain a reference to the element that was added or removed. Event arguments for object-changed events contain a reference to the changed element, a reference to the meta-attribute that was changed, and the old and new values of the attribute.","The domain  of an attribute is the definition of values that the attribute may take. For example, the length of an nvarchar column in SQL Server is an integer between 1 and 4000, so the domain for a SQL Server Column Length attribute is integers between 1 and 4000. Each domain typically has a default value. This is employed to populate attribute values when more restrictive constructors are not used to create the model class. This also provides a cue to the user as to what reasonable values for the attribute might be, for example the default length for nvarchar columns in a VS7 database designer is 50.","Domains  used by models are subsets of integers, unsigned integers, datetimes, or strings. While any value expressed as an integer, unsigned integer, or datetime would necessarily be a member of those respective Domains, in practice Domains used by model classes will typically have a value restriction. Minimum value, maximum value, or both with be specified for Domains derived from these value types. Strings, of course, are unlikely to have value restrictions in the same way integers may, but they can be restricted for string length and validation constraints may be applicable. For example, legal SQL Server identifiers start with a letter, underscore, dollar sign, or hash (#) character and are less than 129 characters in length. Regular expressions may be used to define the constraint.","Another type of domain  is an enumeration domain. Enumeration domains are analogous to C# enums. Enumeration domains are defined as explicit sets of integers, unsigned integers, or strings. The \u201cbase domain\u201d for an enumeration domain is the domain which underlies the values of the domain\u2014integers, unsigned integers, or strings. The base domain is used to determine what type of data should be used to store the value in the Working Store. String-Enumeration Domains conceptually combine the features of Enumeration Domain and String Domain. The additional feature String-Enumeration Domain supports is a method to get to the members of the domain. Restricted Length String Domain is a String Domain that restricts the lengths of strings in the domain.","The Model Schema  is an object which creates and maintains the structure of a schema in the Working Store. The Model Schema  creates the schema and the tables, triggers, constraints, and so forth contained in the schema. There are two types of model updates that might need to occur. A trivial update is one that does not involve structure changes. In this case, a version stamp is updated. A non-trivial update is one that involves a schema migration. In this case, a new database is created, the new schema is created, and the old data is migrated to the new database.
