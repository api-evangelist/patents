No. 11\/393,664 filed Mar. 31, 2006, now abandoned, which claims priority of Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-127976, filed on Apr. 26, 2005. The contents of all of the aforementioned applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to an electrophotographic belt (belt for electrophotography) such as a transfer material transport belt or an intermediate transfer belt, used in image forming apparatus which utilize electrophotographic systems, i.e., what are called electrophotographic apparatus, and also relates to an electrophotographic apparatus having the electrophotographic belt, and a process for producing the electrophotographic belt. Monochrome or color (inclusive of full-color) copying machines and printers (such as LBPs) are available as electrophotographic apparatus having electrophotographic belts.","2. Related Background Art","In order to stably reproduce high-grade images by using an electrophotographic apparatus having an electrophotographic belt, it is important to balance the volume resistivity of the electrophotographic belt and the surface resistivity of the surface of the electrophotographic belt on which a toner image or a transfer material is held.","Specifically, taking as an example the case of an intermediate transfer belt, the intermediate transfer belt is required to surely hold on its surface toner images primarily transferred from an electrophotographic photosensitive member, and is further required to allow the toner images held on its surface to be secondarily transferred to a transfer material such as paper in a good efficiency. In order to render such conflicting performances compatible with each other at a high level, it is effective to take into account the balance between volume resistivity and surface resistivity of the intermediate transfer belt.","For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H10-228188 discloses that where the surface resistivity and volume resistivity of an intermediate transfer member (such as an intermediate transfer belt) are represented respectively by 10\u03a9\/square and 10\u03a9cm, these are so set as to be 10\u2266x\u226614, y\u226613 and x\u2267y. Then, it discloses that by controlling the volume resistivity and surface resistivity in this way, toner images primarily transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt do not scatter and discharge naturally occurs before subsequent toner images are primarily transferred. It also discloses that the constitution of the intermediate transfer belt may be either of a single-layer structure and a multi-layer structure.","In addition, t is demanded for the electrophotographic belt to have excellent flexing resistance in order to secure good handling properties in the electrophotographic apparatus. It is also demanded for the belt to have excellent wear resistance so that as a result of wear, the surface of the electrophotographic belt for holding toner images or a transfer material is not changed in physical properties or in electrical properties required as the electrophotographic belt. As a material that may satisfy the above at a high level, for example, curable polyimide may be cited.","The curable polyimide, however, is commonly expensive. Accordingly, in order to obtain a lower-cost electrophotographic belt, the present inventors have made studies on an electrophotographic belt comprising a base layer having a good flexibility, containing a thermoplastic resin, and formed on the base layer a surface layer having good wear resistance. Specifically, they have studied how a cured resin film having a uniform thickness and good adherence to the base layer can be used as the surface layer.","As a result of the studies, the present inventors have realized that the surface layer must be formed in a thickness of 3.0 \u03bcm or less in order to prevent the surface layer from, e.g., becoming cracked when the electrophotographic belt is flexed. On the basis of such realization, the present inventors have studied how such preferable electrical properties as disclosed in the above Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H10-228188 can be imparted to an electrophotographic belt having on the base layer containing a thermoplastic resin a surface layer composed of a thin cured resin film. Therefore, the present inventors have attempted to add conductive particles to the surface layer so as to balance the volume resistivity and surface resistivity of the electrophotographic belt.","However, the surface resistivity of the surface layer has come to be too low (specifically, 10\u03a9\/square). Thus, they have failed to impart to the electrophotographic belt the preferable electrical properties disclosed in the above Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H10-228188.","An object of the present invention is to provide an electrophotographic belt having superior flexing resistance and superior surface wear resistance and also having good electrical properties, an electrophotographic apparatus having such an electrophotographic belt, and a process for producing the electrophotographic belt.","Another object of the present invention is to provide an intermediate transfer belt having superior flexing resistance and superior surface wear resistance and also having good electrical properties.","More specifically, the present invention is an electrophotographic belt which includes a base layer containing a thermoplastic resin and having a mass loss (or \u201closs in mass\u201d) percentage of 0.30% or more after a Taber abrasion test (ASTM D-1175; at a load of 4.9 N and 500 revolutions) and a cured resin film formed on the base layer by coating, containing conductive particles and having a thickness of from 0.5 \u03bcm or more to 3.0 \u03bcm or less;","the cured resin film having at its surface a mass loss percentage of 0.050% or less after a Taber abrasion test (ASTM D-1175; at a load of 4.9 N and 500 revolutions); and","the electrophotographic belt having volume resistivity \u03c1v (\u03a9cm) and, at the surface of the cured resin film, surface resistivity \u03c1s (\u03a9\/square) which satisfy the following expressions (1), (2) and (3):\n\n10\u2266\u03c1v\u226610\u2003\u2003(1),\n\n10\u2266\u03c1s\u226610\u2003\u2003(2),\n\n\u03c1s\/\u03c1v\u226710\u2003\u2003(3).\n","The present invention is also an electrophotographic apparatus which comprises the above electrophotographic belt.","The present invention is still also a process for producing the above electrophotographic belt; the process including:","a base layer forming step of forming the base layer by using a thermoplastic resin; and","a surface layer forming step of applying on the base layer formed by the base layer forming step a surface layer forming coating fluid which contains a monomer and\/or oligomer component as a raw material for the cured resin film, conductive particles and a solvent, followed by drying and curing to form the surface layer.","The present invention is still also an intermediate transfer belt which includes a base layer containing a thermoplastic resin and having a mass loss percentage of 0.30% or more after a Taber abrasion test (ASTM D-1175; at a load of 4.9 N and 500 revolutions) and a cured resin film formed on the base layer by coating, containing conductive particles and having a thickness of from 0.5 \u03bcm or more to 3.0 \u03bcm or less;","the cured resin film having at its surface a mass loss percentage of 0.050% or less after a Taber abrasion test (ASTM D-1175; at a load of 4.9 N and 500 revolutions); and","the intermediate transfer belt having volume resistivity \u03c1v (\u03a9cm) and, at the surface of the cured resin film, surface resistivity \u03c1s (\u03a9\/square) which satisfy the following expressions (1), (2) and (3):\n\n10\u2266\u03c1v\u226610\u2003\u2003(1),\n\n10\u2266\u03c1s\u226610\u2003\u2003(2),\n\n\u03c1s\/\u03c1v\u226710\u2003\u2003(3).\n","(Basic Constitution)","The electrophotographic belt of the present invention is described below in detail with reference to the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["15","16"],"br":[{},{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{},{},{},{},{}],"sup":["6","10","8","13","2"]},"As stated previously, according to studies made by the present inventors before arriving at the present invention, they have failed to impart electrical properties that may satisfy all the above expressions (1), (2) and (3), to the electrophotographic belt having a base layer and, formed on the base layer by coating, a surface layer composed of a cured resin film and having a thickness of 3.0 \u03bcm or less.","As to the cause thereof, the present inventors made studies in detail and, as a result of the studies, were able to have the following findings. That is, the surface resistivity of the electrophotographic belt was found to be very low because a greater part of conductive particles migrated to the vicinity of the surface of the surface layer as the solvent evaporated from a thin wet coating formed of a surface layer forming coating fluid which contained the conductive particles and was applied on the base layer.","Accordingly, the present inventors controlled the rate of evaporation of the solvent from the coating fluid applied on the base layer, so as to prevent the conductive particles from migrating to the surface of the surface layer. As a result, they found that such control kept the surface resistivity from lowering vastly and made obtainable the electrophotographic belt satisfying all the above expressions (1), (2) and (3). Thus, they have accomplished the present invention.","The constituents of the electrophotographic belt are described below in order.","(Base Layer)","The base layer may preferably be one having good flexing resistance, which may cause no cracking at its surface even when flexed. Materials usable for such a base layer may include thermoplastic resin materials as shown below, mixtures of any of these, and thermoplastic elastomers formed by any of the mixtures: Polycarbonate, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyethylene, polypropylene, polymethylpentene-1, polystyrene, polyamide, polysulfone, polyarylate, polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyphenylene sulfide, polyether sulfone, polyether nitrile, thermoplastic polyimide materials, polyether ether ketone, thermotropic liquid-crystal polymers, and polyamic acid.","The base layers having good flexing resistance, formed from the above materials may often have a surface having relatively low wear resistance, which has a mass loss percentage of 0.30% or more after a Taber abrasion test (ASTM D-1175; at a load of 4.9 N and 500 revolutions).","However, the formation of a surface layer described later can improve surface wear resistance required as an electrophotographic belt.","In the electrophotographic belt, in order for all the above expressions (1), (2) and (3) to be satisfied, the base layer may preferably have a volume resistivity of from 1.0\u00d710\u03a9cm or more to 1.0\u00d710\u03a9cm or less, and more preferably from 1.0\u00d710\u03a9cm or more to 3.0\u00d710\u03a9cm or less. Similarly, the base layer may also preferably have a surface resistivity of from 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\/square or more to 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\/square or less, and more preferably from 5.0\u00d710\u03a9\/square or more to 3.0\u00d710\u03a9\/square or less.","The base layer having such volume resistivity and surface resistivity may be obtained by, e.g., incorporating known conductive particles or a known ionic conducting agent in the base layer.","The base layer may also be incorporated with at least one fine powder of an organic material or an inorganic material for the purposes of effecting mechanical reinforcement, providing thermal conductivity, and so forth. As the fine powder of an organic material, for example, a condensation polyimide powder and an ionic conductor are usable. As the fine powder of an inorganic material, it is possible to use, for example, inorganic spherical fine powders such as carbon black powder, magnesium oxide powder, magnesium fluoride powder, silicon oxide powder, aluminum oxide powder, boron nitride powder, aluminum nitride powder and titanium nitride powder. As the fine powder of an inorganic material, it is also possible to use fibrous powders such as carbon fibers and glass fibers, and whiskery powders such as potassium titanate powder, silicon carbide powder and silicon nitride powder. There are no particular limitations on the particle shape, particle diameter, content and so forth of such fine powders, and these may preferably be so selected that the volume resistivity and surface resistivity of the base layer may not deviate from the above preferable range. However, taking into account the flexing resistance, strength and thermal conductivity of the base layer, the amount of any of these powders to be incorporated may preferably be from 5% by mass or more to 70% by mass or less in total, and more preferably from 5% by mass or more to 10% by mass or less, based on the mass of the binder resin thermoplastic resin material. The base layer may have a thickness of from 80 \u03bcm or more to 150 \u03bcm or less, taking into account the strength required for an electrophotographic belt.","(Surface Layer)","From the viewpoint of adherence to the base layer and thickness uniformity, the surface layer is comprised of the cured resin film formed on the base layer by coating. The surface layer provides the surface of the electrophotographic belt with good wear resistance such that the mass loss percentage after the Taber abrasion test (ASTM D-1175; at a load of 4.9 N and 500 revolutions) of the electrophotographic belt is 0.050% or less.","Such a cured resin film may be obtained by applying on the base layer a coating fluid containing an acrylic monomer (such as dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate) or a prepolymer of an acrylic resin, followed by curing. In the present invention, the cured resin film may have a thickness of from 0.5 \u03bcm or more to 3.0 \u03bcm or less, and preferably from 1.0 \u03bcm or more to 3.0 \u03bcm or less, in order that the electrophotographic belt can be provided with the given wear resistance and can fully follow the flexing of the base layer.","(Conductive Particles)","In the present invention, conductive particles are added in order that the surface layer comprised of the cured resin film can be provided with the given resistivity. As the conductive particles, any particles may be used as long as they are resistance-controllable, and may include the following: Powders such as carbon black, PAN-based carbon fibers and an expanded-graphite pulverized product; powdery, fibrous or flaky carbon-based conducting agents; powdery, fibrous or flaky metal-based conducting agents of metals such as silver, nickel, copper, zinc, aluminum, stainless steel and iron; and fine particulate metal-oxide-based conducting agents such as antimony-doped tin oxide, tin-doped indium oxide and aluminum-doped zinc oxide.","Of these, in the present invention, fine particulate metal-oxide-based conducting agents are preferred, which is effective in a small quantity and can provide the surface layer with surface smoothness. It is more preferable that the outermost particle surfaces of the fine particulate metal-oxide-based conducting agent are subjected to surface treatment with an insulating inorganic compound such as Si02 and Al203 to form thin shells thereon.","(Electrical Properties)","In the electrophotographic belt of the present invention, where its volume resistivity and surface resistivity are represented by \u03c1v (\u03a9cm) and \u03c1s (\u03a9\/square), respectively, \u03c1v and \u03c1s satisfy the following expressions (1), (2) and (3):\n\n10\u2266\u03c1v\u226610\u2003\u2003(1),\n\n10\u2266\u03c1s\u226610\u2003\u2003(2),\n\n\u03c1s\/\u03c1v\u226710\u2003\u2003(3).\n","In order to impart the electrical properties that may satisfy all the above expressions (1), (2) and (3), to the electrophotographic belt having the base layer and, formed on the base layer by coating, the surface layer including a thermoplastic resin and having a thickness of from 0.5 \u03bcm or more to 3.0 \u03bcm or less, it is necessary to control, in conjunction with the addition of the conductive particles to the surface layer, the rate of evaporation of the solvent from the surface layer forming coating fluid coated on the base layer, so as to keep the conductive particles from migrating to the vicinity of the surface of the surface layer (hereinafter also referred to simply as \u201csurface migration\u201d) in the course of drying when the surface layer is formed.","As a method for controlling the rate of evaporation of the solvent, the following may be exemplified: In a high-temperature and low-humidity environment, the surface layer forming coating fluid is applied on the base layer and the wet coating formed is dried, where the solvent can be evaporated very rapidly, thereby effectively suppressing the surface migration of the conductive particles. The high-temperature and low-humidity environment refers specifically to an environment of 35 to 45\u00b0 C. and 5 to 20% RH. Also, as the surface layer forming coating fluid, it may be exemplified by a coating fluid containing, e.g., 50% by mass of an acrylic monomer, 12% by mass of conductive particles and 38% by mass of methyl isobutyl ketone.","Where methyl ethyl ketone is used as a chief solvent in the surface layer forming coating fluid, methyl ethyl ketone evaporates very rapidly even in a normal-temperature and normal-humidity environment, and hence the surface migration of the conductive particles can effectively be suppressed. The normal-temperature and normal-humidity environment refers specifically to an environment of 20 to 30\u00b0 C. and 30 to 50% RH.","Thus, a low-cost electrophotographic belt can be obtained which has superior surface wear resistance and also superior electrical properties. Of course, both the temperature and humidity environment at the time of drying and the composition of the surface layer forming coating fluid may be controlled so as to suppress the surface migration of the conductive particles.","(Surface Layer Forming Coating Fluid)","The surface layer forming coating fluid used to form the surface layer contains a raw material of the cured resin film, such as an acrylic monomer or an acrylic oligomer, in order to improve the wear resistance of the surface of the electrophotographic belt, and also contains in its basic composition the conductive particles for controlling the electrical properties of the surface layer and a solvent. As described previously, in order to suppress the surface migration of the conductive particles after the surface layer forming coating fluid has been coated on the base layer, the surface layer forming coating fluid may preferably be so composed as to dry rapidly. As the solvent, it may include, e.g., isopropyl alcohol, methyl ethyl ketone, ethanol and isobutanol. In particular, in the case where the surface layer forming coating fluid coated on the base layer is dried (and cured) in an environment which is not the high-temperature and low-humidity environment, for example, the normal-temperature and normal-humidity environment, it is preferable to use methyl ethyl ketone as a chief solvent as stated above.","As the composition of the surface layer forming coating fluid, taking into account the coating properties on the base layer and the stability of the coating fluid, it is preferable that the content of the monomer and\/or oligomer component, which is the raw material of the cured resin film, is from 30 to 60% by mass based on the total mass of the surface layer forming coating fluid, the content of the conductive particles is from 10 to 20% by mass based on the total mass of the surface layer forming coating fluid, and the content of the solvent is from 30 to 60% by mass based on the total mass of the surface layer forming coating fluid.","(Electrophotographic Apparatus)","Use embodiments of the electrophotographic belt of the present invention are described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"More specifically, in , reference numeral  denotes a drum-shaped electrophotographic photosensitive member (hereinafter also referred to as \u201cphotosensitive drum\u201d), which is rotatively driven at a given peripheral speed in the direction of an arrow.

Thus, an electrostatic latent image is formed which corresponds to a first color component image (e.g., a yellow toner image) of the intended color image.","Next, the electrostatic latent image formed is developed by means of a first developing assembly  (yellow Y developing assembly) into the first-color component image (yellow toner image). At this stage, second, third and fourth developing assemblies, i.e., a magenta M developing assembly , a cyan C developing assembly  and a black BK developing assembly , are not operated and do not act on the photosensitive drum .

Further, since the surface resistivity of the electrophotographic belt had a great difference as compared with the volume resistivity, the toner constituting toner images on the surface of the transfer material carried on the transfer material transport belt was not scattered, and high definition images were obtained.","Moreover, in the electrophotographic apparatus of Example 1 in which the electrophotographic belt of Example 1 was set as the transfer material transport belt, any cracking or the like was not seen to occur on the transfer material carrying surface of the electrophotographic belt even after 200,000 sheets of paper were run (extensive operation).","An electrophotographic belt was produced in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the application of the surface layer forming coating fluid on the base layer and the drying were carried out in an environment of 25\u00b0 C.\/40% RH.","The volume resistivity \u03c1v and surface resistivity \u03c1s of the electrophotographic belt thus produced were as shown below.

As a result of visual comparison with the images in Example 1, the image quality was clearly inferior.","An electrophotographic belt was produced in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the surface layer (cured resin film) was formed in a thickness of 3.0 \u03bcm. Evaluation was made in the same way as in Example 1.","The mass loss percentage of the electrophotographic belt of Example 2 after the Taber abrasion test was 0%. The volume resistivity \u03c1v and surface resistivity \u03c1s of the electrophotographic belt of Example 2 were as shown below, and the surface resistivity was kept from vastly lowering, as with the electrophotographic belt of Example 1.\n\n\u03c16.5\u00d710\u03a9\/cm,\n\n\u03c11.5\u00d710\u03a9\/square,\n\n\u03c12.3\u00d710.\n","Next, the electrophotographic belt of Example 2 was used as the transfer material transport belt of the same electrophotographic apparatus as used in Example 1, and images were formed under the same conditions as in Example 1.","As a result, as with Example 1, the toner constituting toner images on the surface of the transfer material carried on the transfer material transport belt was not scattered, and high definition images were obtained.","In the electrophotographic apparatus of Example 2, any cracking or the like was not seen to occur on the transfer material carrying surface of the electrophotographic belt even after 200,000 sheets of paper were run.","An electrophotographic belt of Example 3 was produced in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the surface layer forming coating fluid, the application of the surface layer forming coating fluid on the base layer and the conditions for drying were as shown below.","(i) Preparation of Surface Layer Forming Coating Fluid:","12 parts by mass of an isopropyl alcohol sol of zinc antimonate as conductive particles (trade name of the sol: CELLNAX, available from Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was mixed with 50 parts by mass of an acrylic ultraviolet-curable hard coat material containing dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate (trade name of the coat material: DESOLITE; available from JSR Corporation). Thereafter, 38 parts by mass of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) was added to obtain an ultraviolet-curable resin composition.","(ii) Production of Electrophotographic Belt:","In an environment of 25\u00b0 C.\/40% RH, the surface layer forming coating fluid prepared in the above (i) was applied on the surface of the base layer produced in the same way as in the procedure (i) in Example 1. The wet coating formed was dried, and thereafter the coating dried was irradiated with ultraviolet rays to form a surface layer (cured resin film), obtaining the electrophotographic belt of Example 3.","Wearability of the surface of the electrophotographic belt of Example 3 was evaluated by the Taber abrasion test.

In virtue of this solvent, the thin wet film of the surface layer forming coating fluid applied on the base layer dried rapidly even in the same environment of 25\u00b0 C.\/40% RH as in the case of the application of the surface layer forming coating fluid and the drying conditions in Comparative Example 1. As a result, the surface migration of the conductive particles was suppressed in the course of the drying of the wet coating of the surface layer forming coating fluid, and the surface resistivity of the electrophotographic belt was able to be effectively kept from vastly lowering as seen in Comparative Example 1.","Next, the electrophotographic belt of Example 3 was used as the transfer material transport belt of the same electrophotographic apparatus as used in Example 1, and images were formed under the same conditions as in Example 1.","As a result, as with Example 1, the toner constituting toner images on the surface of the transfer material carried on the transfer material transport belt was not scattered, and high definition images were obtained.","In the electrophotographic apparatus of Example 3, any cracking or the like was not seen to occur on the transfer material carrying surface of the electrophotographic belt even after 200,000 sheets of paper were run.","An electrophotographic belt was produced in the same manner as in Comparative Example 1 except that the surface layer (cured resin film) of 1.0 pm in thickness was formed in a thickness of 10.0 pm.","Wearability of the surface of the electrophotographic belt of Comparative Example 2 was evaluated by the Taber abrasion test. As a result, the mass loss percentage of this electrophotographic belt was 0%.","Since the thickness of the surface layer (cured resin film) of the electrophotographic belt of Comparative Example 2 was as large as 10 \u03bcm, the conductive particles in the thin wet coating of the surface layer forming coating fluid were not able to migrate to the vicinity of the surface of the surface layer (cured resin film) even in the environment of 25\u00b0 C.\/40% RH, so that as far as the volume resistivity \u03c1v and the surface resistivity \u03c1s were concerned, as shown below, the electrophotographic belt produced was provided with all the electrical properties required for the electrophotographic belt of the present invention.\n\n\u03c18.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm,\n\n\u03c12.0\u00d710\u03a9\/square,\n\n\u03c12.5\u00d710.\n","The electrophotographic belt of Comparative Example 2 was used as the transfer material transport belt of the same electrophotographic apparatus as used in Example 1, and images were formed under the same conditions as in Example 1.","As a result, the transfer material carrying surface of the transfer material transport belt was seen to become cracked after 500 sheets of paper were run.
