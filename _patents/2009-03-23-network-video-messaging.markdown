{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Messaging systems facilitate communication between two or more computing devices on a network. Electronic mail is one example of a messaging system that facilitates network communication. Some messaging systems enable a message, including media attachments such as pictures, video, or audio that has been transmitted to a given recipient to be forwarded to other recipients, thereby increasing dissemination of the message.","Accordingly, various embodiments related to a network video messaging system are disclosed herein. For example, one disclosed embodiment provides a method in a network video messaging system. The method comprises receiving a video message from a client application of a source client. The video message includes video content and associated meta data. The associated meta data indicates a recipient client and a download condition for the video content imposed by the source client. The method further comprises storing the video content at a storage server and associating a navigation link with the video message. The navigation link provides access to the video content stored at the storage server. The method further comprises transmitting a notification message to the recipient client indicated by the associated meta data, where the notification message includes the navigation link. The method further comprises receiving a retrieval request from the recipient client to access the video content via the navigation link. The method further comprises transmitting the video content to the recipient client responsive to receiving the retrieval request by providing a persistent download of the video content from the storage server by the recipient client if the download condition indicates that a persistent download of the video content is permissible and providing a transient download of the video content to the recipient client while prohibiting a persistent download of the video content by the recipient client if the download condition indicates that a persistent download of the video content is not permissible.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Furthermore, the claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in any part of this disclosure.","Various embodiments are disclosed herein that relate to the operation of a network video messaging system. This network video messaging system enables two or more client users to communicate with each other by sending and receiving video content in the form of a video message. As mentioned above, many general purpose messaging systems are not configured to provide sufficient control to the author of the message. The network video messaging system described herein increases the breadth and ease of use of video communications by providing client users with greater flexibility and control over the video content that they create or transmit.","Before discussing the various methods for facilitating video messaging, an example network video messaging environment is described.  shows a block diagram of an example embodiment of a computing network . Computing network  may represent one or more of a local area network (LAN) and a wide area network (WAN) (e.g., the Internet). Computing network  may comprise two or more communication layers. In this particular embodiment, computing network  includes a client layer , a system layer , and a storage layer , each of which will be described in greater detail.","Client layer  includes one or more of a client side web portal, stand-alone application, or a dedicated device (e.g., an electronic picture frame, video messaging device, etc.) that enables client users to send and receive video messages, and to also define usage criteria for their video messages. Client layer  may include one or more clients. For example, client layer  may include a source client  and a recipient client . In at least one embodiment, the source client  and the recipient client  are computing devices, including personal computers, mobile devices, notebook computers, etc.","Source client  includes a client logic subsystem , client memory , input devices , and output devices . The client logic subsystem  may comprise one or more processors. The input devices  may include one or more of a video camera, a static image camera, a mouse, a keyboard, a controller, a microphone, etc. The output devices  may include one or more of a graphical display (e.g., monitor), an audio speaker, a tactile feedback device, etc.","The client memory  may comprise instructions (e.g., one or more programs) executable by the client logic subsystem  to operate the various components of source client . For example, as shown in , client memory  includes a client application . The client application  may comprise one or more tools or modules. For example, client application  may include one or more of a user interface , an account management module , a mail management module , a video capture module , a video upload module , a video playback module , and a client communication interface .

As such, it should be appreciated that client application  may include a web browser in at least some embodiments.","The user interface  may include controls that enable the source client user to interact with the network video messaging service to perform tasks that facilitate video messaging. For example, the client application enables the source client user to create or record a video message via the video capture module , upload video messages via the video upload module , receive video messages from other client users via mail management module , view video messages received from other client users via video playback module , manage the sent and received video messages via the mail management module , and manage account settings via the account management module .","Recipient client  may similarly include one or more of the components of source client  as previously described. For example, recipient client  may include a client logic subsystem and client memory. However, it should be appreciated that the network video messaging system described herein may facilitate video communications without necessarily requiring recipient client  to have access to a special purpose client application. For example, the client memory of recipient client  may comprise instructions that provide a general purpose video player application that may be used to play video content that is received from the source client. In some examples, recipient client  may be one of a plurality of recipient clients.","The system layer  may include a network video messaging system  that exposes a variety of video messaging services to the source and recipient clients. The network video messaging system  of the system layer  is responsible for storing, retrieving, and transmitting video messages on behalf of the source and recipient clients, and interacts with the storage layer  to facilitate the servicing of requests from the clients.","The network video messaging system  may include a system logic subsystem  and system memory . The system logic subsystem  may comprise one or more processors. The system memory  may comprise instructions (e.g., one or more programs) executable by the system logic subsystem  to operate the various components of the network video messaging system . For example, system memory  may comprise instructions executable by the system logic subsystem  to perform one or more of the methods described herein with respect to , , and .","In some embodiments, system memory  may comprise one or more tools or services, including: a service interface , an account management service , a mail management service , a video management service , a notification service , a storage management service , an operating management service , a security service , and a system communication interface .","The account management service  provides client user account services, including client user registration, contact list management, and client user settings. The mail management service  provides mailbox management for the client users as well as video message content and attribute management services for the video messages which may be handled by the network video messaging system . The video management service may validate video content contained in the video messages, adjust the quality of the video content, and\/or store the video message at one or more of a storage server  and a database . The notification service  is responsible for transmitting notification messages to the client users. The storage management service provides a common interface for storing and retrieving video messages from one or more of the storage server  and database .","The storage layer  is responsible for storing the video messages and may include one or more of database , an identification server , and storage server . Storage server  may comprise a server logic subsystem  and server memory . The server logic subsystem  may comprise one or more processors. The server memory  may comprise instructions (e.g., one or more programs) executable by the server logic subsystem  to operate the various components of the storage server . In some embodiments, server memory  may comprise storage . While the components of storage layer  are shown separately from the network video messaging system  in , it should be appreciated that the network video messaging system  may comprise one or more of storage server , database , and identification server  in at least some embodiments.","In some embodiments, the source client  and the recipient client  may interact with the network video messaging system  via a client application programming interface (API) , as schematically shown in . Developers may use the client API to create custom client applications and user interfaces that provide custom user experiences to the client users. In some embodiments, the network video messaging system  may interact with components of the storage layer  via storage API , as schematically shown in . In this way, the network video messaging system  may communicate with third party servers that provide content storage services for the video messages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","152","100","200"]},"At , the client application of a source client may be operated by a source client user to initiate the creation and upload of a video message. For example, referring to the example embodiment of , the source client user may record video content via a video camera of input devices  using the video capture module . The source client user may use the mail management module to add a contextual note, a subject, and one or more recipient client addresses to the video message. The source client user may further initiate authentication with the network video messaging system  using account management module . For example, the source client user may submit a username and\/or passcode to the account management module that may be authenticated by the network video messaging system . In each case, the source client user may interact with each of the modules via the user interface . The communication interface of source client  may transmit (e.g., upload) the video message to the network video messaging system  via video upload module .","At , the method includes receiving a video message from a client application of a source client. For example, the network video messaging system  may receive the video message from the video upload module of the source client at service interface . In at least some embodiments, the video message includes video content and associated meta data. For example, referring also to , a block diagram of an example embodiment of a video message  is provided. The video message  includes video content  and meta data . The video content  may include a video portion  and an audio portion . In some embodiments, video content  may include two or more video portions, where video portion  is one of a plurality of video portions comprising video content . It should be appreciated that video portion  may include only a single static image in some examples, and the audio portion  may be omitted in some examples.","The associated meta data received at  of  may indicate one or more recipient clients. For example, associated meta data  of  includes a recipient client identifier  indicating the recipient client, and a download condition . The meta data may include a plurality of recipient client identifiers where the meta data indicates a plurality of recipient clients. The download condition may indicate whether the recipient client is permitted to perform a persistent download of the video content for playback and storage (e.g., \u201cdownload\u201d the video content) or whether the recipient client is permitted to perform a transient download of the video content for playback without persistent storage of the video content (e.g., \u201cstream\u201d the video content).","Hence, the source client may grant permission to the video messaging system to provide a persistent download of the video content, which enables the recipient client to store and potentially disseminate the video content by re-transmission. Alternatively, the source client may withhold permission to provide a persistent download of the video content, whereby the video content may be instead provided to the recipient client as a transient download. The transient download may be transiently stored at the recipient client to enable playback of the video content, but may not permit the recipient client to disseminate the video content that has been obtained by the transient download. As such, the transient download of the video content does not enable the recipient client to re-transmit the video content, while the persistent download of the video content enables the recipient client to re-transmit the video content.","In some embodiments, the meta data may include a download condition for each recipient client of a plurality of recipient clients. Hence, a source client may provide permission to some of the recipient clients to access the video content by a persistent download while also enabling the source client to withhold permission from some of the recipient clients to access the video content by a persistent download. The associated meta data  may also include one or more of a source client identifier  indicating the source client, a message subject , a contextual note , and other suitable data .","In some embodiments, the network video messaging system may support multi-threaded video upload by receiving the video message in two or more separate portions, enabling the client application of the source client to issue two or more video message upload requests to the network video messaging system. For example, the process of receiving the video message from the client application at  of  may include receiving an introductory portion of the video message and one or more subsequent portions of the video message. The process of receiving the video message at  may further include associating a content identification tag with the introductory portion of the video message that is received from the client application and transmitting the content identification tag to the client application. For example, a content identification tag  may be associated with the associated meta data  of . In some embodiments, the client application may be configured to transmit the video message to the network video messaging system with the content identification tag already associated with the video message.","Thereafter, each of the one or more subsequent portions of the video message received from the client application may include the content identification tag. For example, the client application may be configured to receive the content identification tag from the network video messaging system and subsequently include the content identification tag with each of the one or more subsequent portions of the video message that are transmitted to the network video messaging system. Additionally, the one or more subsequent portions of the video message may include a final portion of the video message, where the final portion of the video message that is received from the client application further includes a concluding identification tag in addition to the content identification tag. For example, as shown in , meta data  may include a first\/last identifier  that serves as the concluding identification tag.","Further, in some embodiments, the initial portion of the video message may include an initial identification tag that is included in the associated meta data as the first\/last identifier . In some embodiments, each portion of a multi-portion video message that is received by the network video messaging system may include a sequence tag (e.g., sequence  in ) that identifies a relative location of the portion within a sequence of the multiple portions of the video message. In some embodiments, an offset tag may be used as an alternative to or in addition to the sequence tag to facilitate upload of video content in two or more portions. The content identification tag, the sequence tag, the concluding identification tag, and the initial identification tag may be used by the network video messaging system to assemble the multi-portion video message that is received from the client application into a common video message.","At  of , method  includes storing the video content of the video message at a storage server. Where the video message is received in multiple portions, the process at  may include storing the introductory portion of the video message at the storage server and storing each of the one or more subsequent portions of the video message at the storage server based on the content identification tag. For example, if a load balancer of the network is between the network video messaging system and the storage server, the content identification tag of each portion of the video message may be used to direct each portion of the video message to the appropriate storage server where the other portions of the video message are stored.","In some embodiments, the process at  may further include storing the associated meta data at the storage server. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the method may further include storing the associated meta data at a database that is separate from the storage server. For example, the video content may be stored at storage server  and the associated meta data may be stored at database  in at least some embodiments. By storing the associated meta data separately from the video content, the network video messaging system may leverage content distribution networks that are suitable for storing and managing video content.","In some embodiments, a data container may be maintained at storage server  and\/or database  for each client user of the network video messaging system. For example, a data container may be created for a client user when the client user registers with the network video messaging system for the first time. In some embodiments, the client user is registered with the network video messaging system the first time that the client user is authenticated. As another example, a data container may be created for a client user when a video message that is received by the network video messaging system indicates the client user as a recipient client.","For each source client user, a copy of the associated meta data that is received from the source client as part of the video message may be added to the data container of the source client user stored at the database and\/or storage server. For each recipient client user, a content identification tag of each video message that is indicated by the associated meta data may be added to the data container for the recipient client. The network video messaging system may reference this content identification tag when the recipient client submits a retrieval request at  of method  in order to retrieve video messages.","At  of , the method includes associating a navigation link with the video message. In some embodiments, the navigation link provides access to the video content stored at the storage server. For example, the navigation link may include a uniform resource locator (URL) or other suitable uniform resource identifier (URI). The process of \u201cassociating\u201d the navigation link with the video message may include adding or appending the navigation link to the video content or the associated meta data. For example, as shown in , the associated meta data may include a navigation link .","At  of , method  includes transmitting a notification message to a recipient client. The notification message may be transmitted to the one or more recipient clients indicated by the associated meta data (e.g., via the recipient client identifier  of ). In some embodiments, the recipient client identifier may include an email address, a telephone number, or other suitable identifier. The notification message may be transmitted to a recipient client (e.g., recipient client  of ) or each of the indicated recipient clients by email, short message service (SMS), or other suitable communication protocol. In some embodiments, the notification message includes the navigation link that was associated with the video message at  of . For example, the recipient client user of the recipient client may receive an email that includes the navigation link as well as one or more of the message subject, source client identifier, and contextual note.","In some embodiments, the process of transmitting the notification message to the recipient client includes transmitting the associated meta data stored at the database to the recipient client, including the navigation link. For example, referring to , the storage management service  may retrieve the associated meta data from the database , including the navigation link. The notification service  may in turn format the notification message according to the appropriate communication protocol and may then transmit the notification message to the recipient client  by the service interface .","At  of , method  includes receiving a retrieval request from the recipient client. For example, the recipient client user, upon receiving the notification message, may utilize the recipient client to transmit the retrieval request by selecting or executing the navigation link contained in the notification message. Hence, the retrieval request may be received via the navigation link included in the notification message.","In some embodiments, the process of receiving the retrieval request includes receiving the retrieval request from the recipient client and forwarding the retrieval request to the storage server. For example, the retrieval request may be received by the service interface  of the network video messaging system  of  where it may be forwarded to one or more of storage server  and database . In some embodiments, reception of the retrieval request at the storage server may cause the storage server to transmit the video content stored at the storage server to the recipient client.","At  of , method  includes transmitting an authentication request to the recipient client. As shown in , the authentication request may be transmitted to the recipient client before transmitting the video content to the recipient client. As will be described in greater detail below, authentication of the recipient client may be used by the network video messaging system to control access to the video content. In some embodiments, the authentication request prompts the recipient client to provide the authentication response. For example, the authentication request may cause the recipient client to prompt the recipient client user to register or, if the recipient client is already registered, to login by transmitting a username and\/or passcode of the recipient client user.","At , method  includes receiving an authentication response from the recipient client. The authentication response may be received responsive to the authentication request. In some embodiments, the authentication response indicates whether the recipient client is an authenticated user. For example, referring to , security service  may compare the authentication response received at process  to authentication data stored at identification server  of  via the system communication interface  to determine whether the recipient client is authenticated.","At  of , it may be judged whether the authentication response indicates that the recipient client is an authenticated user. If the answer at  is judged no, the process flow may proceed to . At , method  includes limiting a number of times that the video content is transmitted if the authentication response does not indicate that the recipient client is an authenticated user. In some embodiments, the number of times that the video content is allowed to be transmitted may be limited to zero, thereby enabling the recipient client to access the video content only after the authentication response indicates that the recipient client is an authorized user. In other embodiments, the number of times that the video content is allowed to be transmitted may be limited to a positive number (e.g., 5 transmissions).","In some embodiments, the number of times that the video content is transmitted may be limited by updating a transmission counter each time the video content is transmitted, and prohibiting transmission of the video content if the transmission counter exceeds a transmission limit (e.g., 0 or 5 transmissions). Referring to , the transmission counter may be stored at database  or may be associated with the associated meta data or video content of the video message stored at the storage layer.","In some embodiments, video messages that indicate a recipient client that is not authenticated may be treated as a public video message by the network video messaging system, whereby the video message may be accessible to any client user (including the recipient client) via the navigation link. As such, limiting the number of times that the video content portion of the video message is transmitted to one or more of these client users may serve to protect the source client user from wide-spread dissemination of the video message. In contrast to other content management approaches that seek to prevent dissemination of content after the content is transmitted to the recipient client, the network video messaging system may limit the number of times the video content is transmitted to any client user, including the recipient client user.","If the recipient client is registered or authenticated, then the video message may be treated as a private video message that is accessible only to the authenticated recipient client and is not subject to a limitation on the number of times the video message may be transmitted. By limiting the number of times the video content may be transmitted when the recipient client is not authenticated and by limiting transmission of the video content to only the recipient client when the recipient client is authenticated, dissemination of the video content may be controlled by the network video messaging system. Furthermore, since a data container may be created for the recipient client before the recipient client has been registered or authenticated by the network video messaging system, the recipient client may overcome the limitation on the number of times the video content may be transmitted by the network video messaging system at a later time upon registration or authentication. In this way, the network video messaging system provides the recipient client with access to all of the video messages that were addressed to the recipient client before being registered with the network video messaging system.","Alternatively, if the answer at  of method  is judged yes, the process flow may instead proceed to . At , it may be judged whether providing a persistent download of the video content by the recipient client is permissible. For example, the download condition contained in the associated meta data stored at the database may indicate that a persistent download of the video content is permissible. Where the video message has been sent to a plurality of recipient clients, the download condition may be evaluated by the network video messaging system for each recipient client of the plurality of recipient clients. Hence, the download condition may indicate whether the network video messaging system is to provide the video content to some of the recipient by a persistent download of the video content and may indicate some recipient client that are not permitted to persistently download the video content.","If the answer at  is judged yes, the process flow may proceed to . At , method  may include transmitting the video content to the recipient client responsive to receiving the retrieval request by providing a persistent download of the video content from the storage server by the recipient client if the download condition indicates that a persistent download of the video content is permissible.","Alternatively, if the answer at  is judged no, the process flow may instead proceed to . At , method  may include transmitting the video content to the recipient client responsive to receiving the retrieval request by providing a transient download of the video content to the recipient client while prohibiting a persistent download of the video content by the recipient client if the download condition indicates that a persistent download of the video content is not permissible. The transient download of the video content may be performed progressively for playback of the video content.","By restricting transmission of the video content to a transient download while prohibiting a persistent download of the video content, the limitation at  imposed on the number of times that the video content is transmitted or retransmitted may serve to limit dissemination of the video content. Hence, download limitations can be enforced on the client application side of the network video messaging system as defined by the source client via the download condition. In this way, the recipient client may enforce the download condition via the network video messaging system.","For example, under some scenarios, the recipient client performs a transient download from the network video messaging system for playback of the video content based on permissions received from the source client, thereby limiting or precluding re-transmission of the video content by the recipient client. In other scenarios, the recipient client performs a persistent download, enabling storage and re-transmission of the video content (e.g., via a video message) by the recipient client. A persistent download of the video content may permit the video content to be stored at a storage location that is defined by the recipient client user.","It is to be understood that in at least some embodiments the same video content data may be transmitted to a recipient client for both a transient download and a persistent download, and the recipient client may enforce the limitation on whether the video content data may be saved and retransmitted at a later time. Such enforcement may be carried out in accordance with the download condition associated with the video content data. Furthermore, such enforcement need not be contingent on further instruction from and\/or interaction with the network video messaging system.","In some embodiments, the ability to re-transmit (e.g., forward) video content to other clients may be defined independently of the download condition imposed by the source client. For example, the meta data of the video message may further include a re-transmission condition (e.g., as indicated at other data  of ). The re-transmission condition may be set or defined by the source client user before or after the video content is uploaded to the network video messaging system.","In some embodiments, a re-transmission condition may be set for each recipient client that is indicated by the meta data, thereby enabling the source client to define which recipient clients may re-transmit the video content and which recipient clients may not re-transmit the video content. The recipient client may enforce the re-transmission condition by prohibiting re-transmission of the video content if the re-transmission condition indicates that re-transmission of the video content is prohibited. If the re-transmission condition indicates that re-transmission of the video content is permitted, then the recipient client may permit re-transmission of the video content (e.g., via a video message within the video messaging system or as an attachment or other form of payload outside of the video messaging system) to one or more other clients or non-client recipients.","From  or  the process flow may return or end. For example, it should be understood that the process flow of method  may return to perform some or all of the processes of method  to facilitate content delivery to each recipient client of a plurality of recipient clients indicated by the source client.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","200"]},"At , method  includes updating a quota for the source client based on a size of the video content received from the client application. In some embodiments, referring again to , the quota for the source client may be stored at database , where it may be retrieved and updated by the video management service  responsive to receiving the video content from the client application based on the size of the video content. For example, the quota for the source client may represent a cumulative amount of video content uploaded to the network video messaging system by the client application of the source client. In some embodiments, the quota is updated only for the source client that transmits the video message to the network video messaging system, and the quota is not updated for the recipient client that receives the video message.","At  of , it may be judged whether the quota updated at  is less than a quota limit. For example, the quota that was updated at  may be compared to the quota limit by the video management service. If the answer at  is judged no, the process flow may proceed to .","At , the method may include transmitting a quota limit message to the source client. In some embodiments, the quota limit message may indicate that the video content received from the client application exceeds the quota limit. For example, referring to , notification service  may format and transmit the quota limit message to the source client responsive to the quota limit being exceeded.","At , method  may include prohibiting transmission of the notification message and the video message to the recipient client if the quota limit of the source client has been exceeded. Alternatively, if the answer at  is judged yes, the process flow may instead proceed to . At , the method  may include permitting transmission of the notification message and the video message to the recipient client.

The recall request indicates one or more video messages to be recalled by the network video messaging system before being transmitted to the recipient client. The recall request may additionally indicate some or all of the recipient clients from which the video message is to be recalled. For example, referring to , the source client user may operate the mail management module  via user interface  to recall the video message from one or more of the recipient clients even after the video message has been transmitted to the network video messaging system. In some embodiments, a recall request includes the content identification tag of the video message that is to be recalled.","At  of , the method includes prohibiting transmission of the notification message and\/or video message to the recipient client indicated by the recall request. For example, if the notification message has not yet been transmitted to the recipient client, the transmission of the notification message may be prohibited in response to the recall request. Where the recall request indicates only some of the recipient clients, the notification message may be prohibited for the recipient clients indicated by the recall request. If the notification message has already been transmitted to the recipient client, the transmission of the video message (e.g., the video content) to the recipient client may be prohibited. For example, process  may include prohibiting access to the video content stored at the storage server via the navigation link responsive to receiving the recall request. In some embodiments, the content identification tag stored in the data container for the recipient client indicated by the recall request may be removed from the data container, thereby removing the video content indicated by the recall request from the video messages that may be transmitted to the recipient client. From , the process flow may return or end.","It will be appreciated that the computing devices described herein may be any suitable computing device configured to execute the programs described herein.
