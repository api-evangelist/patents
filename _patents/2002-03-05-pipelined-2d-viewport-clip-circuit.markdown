title: Pipelined 2D viewport clip circuit
abstract: A system and method for performing viewport clipping for multiple viewports using a pipeline. The pixel address coordinates are compared against boundaries of a first viewport window. The results of this comparison, along with the pixel address coordinates, are registered and passed on to the next pipeline stage. There, the pixel address coordinates are compared against the boundaries of a second viewport window. The comparison results are combined with those passed from the previous stage, and the results are again registered. This scheme is repeated until the pixel has been tested against all the viewport window boundaries, with the intermediate results being combined into a single result indicative of whether the pixel is to be passed to the subsequent stages of the graphics pipeline or clipped.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to the field of computer graphics and, more particularly, to a system for performing clipping for multiple windows using a pipeline.","2. Description of the Related Art","A computer system typically relies upon its graphics system for producing visual output on the computer screen or display device. Early graphics systems were only responsible for taking what the processor produced as output and displaying it on the screen. In essence, they acted as simple translators or interfaces. Modern graphics systems, however, incorporate graphics processors with a great deal of processing power. They now act more like coprocessors rather than simple translators. This change is due to the recent increase in both the complexity and amount of data being sent to the display device. For example, modern computer displays have many more pixels, greater color depth, and are able to display more complex images with higher refresh rates than earlier models. Similarly, the images displayed are now more complex and may involve advanced techniques such as anti-aliasing and texture mapping.","As a result, without considerable processing power in the graphics system, the CPU would spend a great deal of time performing graphics calculations. This could rob the computer system of the processing power needed for performing other tasks associated with program execution and thereby dramatically reduce overall system performance. With a powerful graphics system, however, when the CPU is instructed to draw a box on the screen, the CPU is freed from having to compute the position and color of each pixel. Instead, the CPU may send a request to the video card stating \u201cdraw a box at these coordinates.\u201d The graphics system then draws the box, freeing the processor to perform other tasks.","Generally, a graphics system in a computer (also referred to as a graphics system) is a type of video adapter that contains its own processor to boost performance levels. These processors are specialized for computing graphical transformations, so they tend to achieve better results than the general-purpose CPU used by the computer system. In addition, they free up the computer's CPU to execute other commands while the graphics system is handling graphics computations. The popularity of graphical applications, and especially multimedia applications, has made high performance graphics systems a common feature of computer systems. Most computer manufacturers now bundle a high performance graphics system with their systems.","Since graphics systems typically perform only a limited set of functions, they may be customized and therefore far more efficient at graphics operations than the computer's general-purpose central processor. While early graphics systems were limited to performing two-dimensional (2D) graphics, their functionality has increased to support three-dimensional (3D) wire-frame graphics, 3D solids, and now includes support for three-dimensional (3D) graphics with textures and special effects such as advanced shading, fogging, alpha-blending, and specular highlighting.","A modern graphics system may generally operate as follows. First, graphics data is initially read from a computer system's main memory into the graphics system. The graphics data may include geometric primitives such as polygons (e.g., triangles), NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines), sub-division surfaces, voxels (volume elements) and other types of data. The various types of data are typically converted into triangles (e.g., three vertices having at least position and color information). Then, transform and lighting calculation units receive and process the triangles. Transform calculations typically include changing a triangle's coordinate axis, while lighting calculations typically determine what effect, if any, lighting has on the color of triangle's vertices. The transformed and lit triangles may then be conveyed to a clip test\/back face culling unit that determines which triangles are outside the current parameters for visibility (e.g., triangles that are off screen). These triangles are typically discarded to prevent additional system resources from being spent on non-visible triangles.","Next, the triangles that pass the clip test and back-face culling may be translated into screen space. The screen space triangles may then be forwarded to the set-up and draw processor for rasterization. Rasterization typically refers to the process of generating actual pixels (or samples) by interpolation from the vertices. The rendering process may include interpolating slopes of edges of the polygon or triangle, and then calculating pixels or samples on these edges based on these interpolated slopes. Pixels or samples may also be calculated in the interior of the polygon or triangle.","As noted above, in some cases samples are generated by the rasterization process instead of pixels. A pixel typically has a one-to-one correlation with the hardware pixels present in a display device, while samples are typically more numerous than the hardware pixel elements and need not have any direct correlation to the display device. Where pixels are generated, the pixels may be stored into a frame buffer, or possibly provided directly to refresh the display. Where samples are generated, the samples may be stored into a sample buffer or frame buffer. The samples may later be accessed and filtered to generate pixels, which may then be stored into a frame buffer, or the samples may possibly filtered to form pixels that are provided directly to refresh the display without any intervening frame buffer storage of the pixels.","The pixels are converted into an analog video signal by digital-to-analog converters. If samples are used, the samples may be read out of sample buffer or frame buffer and filtered to generate pixels, which may be stored and later conveyed to digital to analog converters. The video signal from converters is conveyed to a display device such as a computer monitor, LCD display, or projector.","A typical screen may display a plurality of windows, also referred to as \u201cviewport windows\u201d or simply \u201cviewports\u201d. Each window may correspond to a different application, or a different instance of the same application. Pixels may be mapped to 2-D windows on the screen. To aid in the acceleration of window system processing, circuitry for 2-D viewport clipping may be included in a hardware graphics rendering pipeline. Using programmable values, this circuit may determine whether or not a pixel falls within the boundaries of a window. If it does, the pixel may be propagated on to subsequent stages of the rendering pipeline for eventual display within the window. If not, the pixel may be clipped and dropped from the pipeline.","This 2-D viewport clipping function can be implemented in hardware with a set of subtractors that compare the X and Y address coordinates of the pixel to be rendered with the X and Y address coordinates of the vertices that define the 2-D viewport clipping windows. However, when it is necessary for the hardware to support multiple viewport clipping windows, feeding the address coordinates of the pixel to a large set of subtractors can result in timing and routing problems when laying out the circuit. It would be advantageous to eliminate the timing and routing problems in implementing the 2-D viewport clipping function in hardware.","The problems set forth above may at least in part be solved in some embodiments by a system or method for using a pipeline circuit for viewport window clipping.","The method comprises passing the pixel through the pipeline. The pipeline may comprise two or more pipeline segments (for example: the pipeline may comprise a series of 2D viewport clip circuits as shown in -and ). The number of pipeline segments may vary depending on implementation of the pipeline.","The method may further comprise computing a window result in each one of the two or more pipeline segments. Each one of the two or more pipeline segments corresponds to one of one or more windows. The window result comprises an indication of inclusion of the pixel within the corresponding one of the one or more windows.","The method may further comprise outputting a window word from each one of the two or more pipeline segments. In one embodiment, outputting the window word comprises, for each of the two or more pipeline segments, except for a last pipeline segment, passing the window word to a next pipeline segment. The window word comprises the window result from the current pipeline segment and from previous pipeline segments.","The method may also comprise examining the window word available in the last pipeline segment. The window word may be examined to determine if the pixel is included in the one or more windows.","While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.

More particularly, host bus  may allow a host processor to send commands to the graphics system . In one embodiment, host bus  may be a bi-directional bus.","Media Processor\u2014",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["14","14","112","80","80","112","14"]},"Transformation refers to the spatial manipulation of objects (or portions of objects) and includes translation, scaling (e.g. stretching or shrinking), rotation, reflection, or combinations thereof. More generally, transformation may include linear mappings (e.g. matrix multiplications), nonlinear mappings, and combinations thereof.","Lighting refers to calculating the illumination of the objects within the displayed image to determine what color values and\/or brightness values each individual object will have. Depending upon the shading algorithm being used (e.g., constant, Gourand, or Phong), lighting may be evaluated at a number of different spatial locations.","As illustrated, media processor  may be configured to receive graphics data via host interface . A graphics queue  may be included in media processor  to buffer a stream of data received via the accelerated port of host interface . The received graphics data may include one or more graphics primitives. As used herein, the term graphics primitive may include polygons, parametric surfaces, splines, NURBS (non-uniform rational B-splines), sub-divisions surfaces, fractals, volume primitives, voxels (i.e., three-dimensional pixels), and particle systems.

Media processor  may also include a direct interface such as bus interface unit (BIU) . Bus interface unit  provides a path to memory  and a path to hardware accelerator  and video output processor  via controller .","Hardware Accelerator\u2014","One or more hardware accelerators  may be configured to receive graphics instructions and data from media processor  and to perform a number of functions on the received data according to the received instructions. For example, hardware accelerator  may be configured to perform rasterization, 2D and\/or 3D texturing, pixel transfers, imaging, fragment processing, clipping, depth cueing, transparency processing, set-up, and\/or screen space rendering of various graphics primitives occurring within the graphics data.","Clipping refers to the elimination of graphics primitives or portions of graphics primitives that lie outside of a 3D view volume in world space. The 3D view volume may represent that portion of world space that is visible to a virtual observer (or virtual camera) situated in world space. For example, the view volume may be a solid truncated pyramid generated by a 2D view window, a viewpoint located in world space, a front clipping plane and a back clipping plane. The viewpoint may represent the world space location of the virtual observer. In most cases, primitives or portions of primitives that lie outside the 3D view volume are not currently visible and may be eliminated from further processing. Primitives or portions of primitives that lie inside the 3D view volume are candidates for projection onto the 2D view window.","Set-up refers to mapping primitives to a three-dimensional viewport. This involves translating and transforming the objects from their original \u201cworld-coordinate\u201d system to the established viewport's coordinates. This creates the correct perspective for three-dimensional objects displayed on the screen.","Screen-space rendering refers to the calculations performed to generate the data used to form each pixel that will be displayed. For example, hardware accelerator  may calculate \u201csamples.\u201d Samples are points that have color information but no real area. Samples allow hardware accelerator  to \u201csuper-sample,\u201d or calculate more than one sample per pixel. Super-sampling may result in a higher quality image.","Hardware accelerator  may also include several interfaces. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, hardware accelerator  has four interfaces. Hardware accelerator  has an interface  (referred to as the \u201cNorth Interface\u201d) to communicate with media processor . Hardware accelerator  may receive commands and\/or data from media processor  through interface . Additionally, hardware accelerator  may include an interface  to bus . Bus  may connect hardware accelerator  to boot PROM  and\/or video output processor . Boot PROM  may be configured to store system initialization data and\/or control code for frame buffer . Hardware accelerator  may also include an interface to a texture buffer . For example, hardware accelerator  may interface to texture buffer  using an eight-way interleaved texel bus that allows hardware accelerator  to read from and write to texture buffer . Hardware accelerator  may also interface to a frame buffer . For example, hardware accelerator  may be configured to read from and\/or write to frame buffer  using a four-way interleaved pixel bus.","The vertex processor  may be configured to use the vertex tags received from the media processor  to perform ordered assembly of the vertex data from the MPUs . Vertices may be saved in and\/or retrieved from a mesh buffer .","The render pipeline  may be configured to rasterize 2D window system primitives and 3D primitives into fragments. A fragment may contain one or more samples. Each sample may contain a vector of color data and perhaps other data such as alpha and control tags. 2D primitives include objects such as dots, fonts, Bresenham lines and 2D polygons. 3D primitives include objects such as smooth and large dots, smooth and wide DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) lines and 3D polygons (e.g. 3D triangles).","For example, the render pipeline  may be configured to receive vertices defining a triangle, to identify fragments that intersect the triangle.","The render pipeline  may be configured to handle full-screen size primitives, to calculate plane and edge slopes, and to interpolate data (such as color) down to tile resolution (or fragment resolution) using interpolants or components such as:","r, g, b (i.e., red, green, and blue vertex color);","r2, g2, b2 (i.e., red, green, and blue specular color from lit textures);","alpha (i.e. transparency);","z (i.e. depth); and","s, t, r, and w (i.e. texture components).","In embodiments using super-sampling, the sample generator  may be configured to generate samples from the fragments output by the render pipeline  and to determine which samples are inside the rasterization edge. Sample positions may be defined by user-loadable tables to enable stochastic sample-positioning patterns.","Hardware accelerator  may be configured to write textured fragments from 3D primitives to frame buffer . The render pipeline  may send pixel tiles defining r, s, t and w to the texture address unit . The texture address unit  may use the r, s, t and w texture coordinates to compute texel addresses (e.g. addresses for a set of neighboring texels) and to determine interpolation coefficients for the texture filter . The texel addresses are used to access texture data (i.e. texels) from texture buffer . The texture buffer  may be interleaved to obtain as many neighboring texels as possible in each clock. The texture filter  may perform bilinear, trilinear or quadlinear interpolation. The pixel transfer unit  may also scale and bias and\/or lookup texels. The texture environment  may apply texels to samples produced by the sample generator . The texture environment  may also be used to perform geometric transformations on images (e.g., bilinear scale, rotate, flip) as well as to perform other image filtering operations on texture buffer image data (e.g., bicubic scale and convolutions).","In the illustrated embodiment, the pixel transfer MUX  controls the input to the pixel transfer unit . The pixel transfer unit  may selectively unpack pixel data received via north interface , select channels from either the frame buffer  or the texture buffer , or select data received from the texture filter  or sample filter .","The pixel transfer unit  may be used to perform scale, bias, and\/or color matrix operations, color lookup operations, histogram operations, accumulation operations, normalization operations, and\/or min\/max functions. Depending on the source of (and operations performed on) the processed data, the pixel transfer unit  may output the processed data to the texture buffer  (via the texture buffer MUX ), the frame buffer  (via the texture environment unit  and the fragment processor ), or to the host (via north interface ). For example, in one embodiment, when the pixel transfer unit  receives pixel data from the host via the pixel transfer MUX , the pixel transfer unit  may be used to perform a scale and bias or color matrix operation, followed by a color lookup or histogram operation, followed by a min\/max function. The pixel transfer unit  may then output data to either the texture buffer  or the frame buffer .","Fragment processor  may be used to perform standard fragment processing operations such as the OpenGL\u00ae fragment processing operations. For example, the fragment processor  may be configured to perform the following operations: fog, area pattern, scissor, alpha\/color test, ownership test (WID), stencil test, depth test, alpha blends or logic ops (ROP), plane masking, buffer selection, pick hit\/occlusion detection, and\/or auxiliary clipping in order to accelerate overlapping windows.","Texture Buffer ","Texture buffer  may include several SDRAMs. Texture buffer  may be configured to store texture maps, image processing buffers, and accumulation buffers for hardware accelerator . Texture buffer  may have many different capacities (e.g., depending on the type of SDRAM included in texture buffer ). In some embodiments, each pair of SDRAMs may be independently row and column addressable.","Frame Buffer ","Graphics system  may also include a frame buffer . In one embodiment, frame buffer  may include multiple memory devices such as 3D-RAM memory devices manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation. Frame buffer  may be configured as a display pixel buffer, an offscreen pixel buffer, and\/or a super-sample buffer. Furthermore, in one embodiment, certain portions of frame buffer  may be used as a display pixel buffer, while other portions may be used as an offscreen pixel buffer and sample buffer.","Video Output Processor\u2014","A video output processor  may also be included within graphics system . Video output processor  may buffer and process pixels output from frame buffer . For example, video output processor  may be configured to read bursts of pixels from frame buffer . Video output processor  may also be configured to perform double buffer selection (dbsel) if the frame buffer  is double-buffered, overlay transparency (using transparency\/overlay unit ), plane group extraction, gamma correction, psuedocolor or color lookup or bypass, and\/or cursor generation. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the output processor  includes WID (Window ID) lookup tables (WLUTs)  and gamma and color map lookup tables (GLUTs, CLUTs) . In one embodiment, frame buffer  may include multiple 3DRAM64s  that include the transparency overlay  and all or some of the WLUTs . Video output processor  may also be configured to support two video output streams to two displays using the two independent video raster timing generators . For example, one raster (e.g., A) may drive a 1280\u00d71024 CRT while the other (e.g., B) may drive a NTSC or PAL device with encoded television video.","DAC  may operate as the final output stage of graphics system . The DAC  translates the digital pixel data received from GLUT\/CLUTs\/Cursor unit  into analog video signals that are then sent to a display device. In one embodiment, DAC  may be bypassed or omitted completely in order to output digital pixel data in lieu of analog video signals. This may be useful when a display device is based on a digital technology (e.g., an LCD-type display or a digital micro-mirror display).","DAC  may be a red-green-blue digital-to-analog converter configured to provide an analog video output to a display device such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor. In one embodiment, DAC  may be configured to provide a high resolution RGB analog video output at dot rates of 240 MHz. Similarly, encoder  may be configured to supply an encoded video signal to a display. For example, encoder  may provide encoded NTSC or PAL video to an S-Video or composite video television monitor or recording device.","In other embodiments, the video output processor  may output pixel data to other combinations of displays. For example, by outputting pixel data to two DACs  (instead of one DAC  and one encoder ), video output processor  may drive two CRTs. Alternately, by using two encoders , video output processor  may supply appropriate video input to two television monitors. Generally, many different combinations of display devices may be supported by supplying the proper output device and\/or converter for that display device.","Sample-to-Pixel Processing Flow","In one set of embodiments, hardware accelerator  may receive geometric parameters defining primitives such as triangles from media processor , and render the primitives in terms of samples. The samples may be stored in a sample storage area (also referred to as the sample buffer) of frame buffer . The samples are then read from the sample storage area of frame buffer  and filtered by sample filter  to generate pixels. The pixels are stored in a pixel storage area of frame buffer . The pixel storage area may be double-buffered. Video output processor  reads the pixels from the pixel storage area of frame buffer  and generates a video stream from the pixels. The video stream may be provided to one or more display devices (e.g. monitors, projectors, head-mounted displays, and so forth) through DAC  and\/or video encoder .","The samples are computed at positions in a two-dimensional sample space (also referred to as rendering space). The sample space may be partitioned into an array of bins (also referred to herein as fragments). The storage of samples in the sample storage area of frame buffer  may be organized according to bins as illustrated in . Each bin may contain one or more samples. The number of samples per bin may be a programmable parameter.","FIG. \u20142-D Viewport Clipping Windows",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["200","200","200"]},"In one embodiment, objects such as objects A and B may be located in various windows A, B, and C.

In one embodiment, the result of the comparison A-D may be output to a multi-input AND gate , or an equivalent. In one embodiment, the AND gate  may perform a logical AND operation on the comparison inputs A-D, and may output the window result , which may comprise an indication of inclusion of a pixel in a window, i.e., whether or not the pixel is included in the window. The horizontal and vertical pixel coordinates may be expressed using N bits. The first and second vertical and horizontal window boundaries may be expressed using M bits.","In one embodiment, a first subtraction\/comparison unit A may compute if the horizontal pixel coordinate  is located on the positive side of the first vertical coordinate of the window A. In one embodiment, a second subtraction\/comparison unit B may compute if the horizontal pixel coordinate  is located on the negative side the second vertical coordinate of the window B. In one embodiment, a third subtraction\/comparison unit C may compute if the vertical pixel coordinate  is located on the positive side of the first vertical coordinate of the window A. In one embodiment, a fourth subtraction\/comparison unit D may compute if the vertical pixel coordinate  is located on the negative side of the first vertical coordinate of the window B.","As a result of the AND gate  operation, the indication of inclusion of the pixel may be set to positive if the horizontal and vertical inclusions are true. Alternatively, the indication of inclusion of the pixel may be set to negative if one or more of the horizontal and vertical inclusions are false.","Although the embodiments above have been described in considerable detail, other versions are possible.
