{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","INTRODUCTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to a method and system for secure operation of a virtual machine application on a mobile device. The present invention further relates to controlling access by the virtual machine application to application programming interfaces.","Java\u00ae Platform, Micro Edition (ME) is a subset of the Java specification directed towards resource-constrained environments, such as mobile computing devices, mobile telephones, handheld computers, and similar portable devices. One specification for the Java ME\u00ae is a mobile information device profile (MIDP). A virtual machine under the MIDP for mobile computing devices, referred to as a MIDlet, may be downloaded onto a mobile computing device. Including a signed electronic certificate may increase the security of executing these MIDlets.","A method, apparatus, and electronic device with secure operation based on geography are disclosed. A positioning mechanism may determine a geographic location. A processor may identify a secure domain for a virtual machine application. The processor may determine an availability of an application programming interface for the virtual machine application based on the geographic location.","Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The features and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.

A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other components and configurations may be used without parting from the spirit and scope of the invention.","The present invention comprises a variety of embodiments, such as a method, an apparatus, and an electronic device, and other embodiments that relate to the basic concepts of the invention. The electronic device may be any manner of computer, mobile device, or wireless communication device.","A method, apparatus, and electronic device with secure operation based on geography are disclosed. A positioning mechanism may determine a geographic location for the apparatus or electronic device. A processor may identify a secure domain for a virtual machine application. The processor may determine an availability of an application programming interface for the virtual machine application based on the geographic location.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100","100","100","100","102"]},"The handheld device  may include a controller or processor  that executes stored programs. The controller or processor  may be any programmed processor known to one of skill in the art. However, the decision support method may also be implemented on a general-purpose or a special purpose computer, a programmed microprocessor or microcontroller, peripheral integrated circuit elements, an application-specific integrated circuit or other integrated circuits, hardware\/electronic logic circuits, such as a discrete element circuit, a programmable logic device, such as a programmable logic array, field programmable gate-array, or the like. In general, any device or devices capable of implementing the decision support method as described herein can be used to implement the decision support system functions of this invention.","The handheld device  may also include a volatile memory  and a nonvolatile memory  to be used by the processor . The volatile  and nonvolatile data memory storage  may include one or more electrical, magnetic or optical memories such as a random access memory (RAM), cache, hard drive, or other memory device. The memory may have a cache to speed access to specific data. The memory may also be connected to a compact disc-read only memory (CD-ROM), digital video disc-read only memory DVD-ROM), DVD read write input, tape drive or other removable memory device that allows media content to be directly uploaded into the system.","The handheld device  may include a user input interface  that may comprise elements such as a keypad, display, touch screen, or any other device that accepts input. The handheld device  may also include a user output device that may comprise a display screen and an audio interface  that may comprise elements such as a microphone, earphone, and speaker. The handheld device  also may include a component interface  to which additional elements may be attached, for example, a universal serial bus (USB) interface or an audio-video capture mechanism. Finally, the handheld device  may include a power supply .","Client software and databases may be accessed by the controller or processor  from the memory, and may include, for example, database applications, word processing applications, video processing applications as well as components that embody the decision support functionality of the present invention. The user access data may be stored in either a database accessible through a database interface or in the memory. The handheld device  may implement any operating system, such as Windows or UNIX, for example. Client and server software may be written in any programming language, such as ABAP, C, C++, Java or Visual Basic, for example.","A mobile computing device (MCD)  may download a virtual machine application to be executed on the MCD . The MCD  may be running a Java\u00ae Micro Edition (ME) with a mobile information device profile (MIDP) specification, allowing it to use mobile information device (MID) virtual machine applications called MIDlets. By using electronically signed certificates with the MIDlets, the MCD  may be assured of a higher level of security on the machine. Unsigned MIDlets may be used, but may be granted a lower level of access to various functions of the MCD .","The security of the MIDlet may be further increased by limiting the availability of a native function of the MCD  to the MIDlet, such as an application programming interface (API). A MCD  may improve security while using a MIDlet by employing a secure domain, a set of permissions regarding various functions or APIs that may be assigned to a MIDlet. The secure domains may have an allowed permission, granting unfettered access to an API; user permission, granting access upon user approval; or denial, barring the MIDlet from using that API. The user permissions may be set at various level of interaction modes, such as blanket, wherein the MIDlet has access to that API for the length of installation; session, wherein the MIDlet has access to that API for as long as the MIDlet is running; or one shot, wherein the MIDlet must ask permission for each use of the API.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","202","204","206","204","204","100","206","204","206","100","206","208"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","100","302","100","302","302","304","306","304","310","312","314","316","310","318","312","314","308","320","322","322","320","320","322","324","308","326","308","328","330"]},"The use of such a configuration may create a greater flexibility with which to use a MCD . Secure domains may be used to control the access that MIDlets downloaded onto MCD  may have to various APIs. These secure domains may be expanded to take into account environmental factors. One such factor that may be used to adjust a secure domain on a continuing basis is location. Other environmental factors that may be used to determine the scope of a secure domain include communication signal strength, communication signal encryption strength, device temperature, power level, or other environmental factors that may have an effect on the security or stability of the device as the MIDlet uses the API.","A sensor may be used to determine if the correct environmental factor is present for the MIDlet to be present in the secure domain, using a specified API. For example, a positioning mechanism may be integrated into a MCD , particularly through the component interface .  illustrates in a block diagram one embodiment of a system  for locating a MCD . An MCD  that is in regular contact with telecommunication cells  may use those cells to triangulate a position for the MCD . Additionally, a global positioning system (GPS) locator device  connected to the component interface  of the MCD  may connect with GPS satellites  to determine a position of the MCD .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","100","502","100","504","506","100","100","508","506","100","100","510","100","100","512","100","514"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","100","602","100","100","100","604","100","606","100","608","610","100","612","610","100","614"]},"Embodiments may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by local and remote processing devices that are linked (either by hardwired links, wireless links, or by a combination thereof through a communications network.","Embodiments within the scope of the present invention may also include computer-readable media for carrying or having computer-executable instructions or data structures stored thereon. Such computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to carry or store desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures. When information is transferred or provided over a network or another communications connection (either hardwired, wireless, or combination thereof to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a computer-readable medium. Thus, any such connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of the computer-readable media.","Computer-executable instructions include, for example, instructions and data which cause a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions. Computer-executable instructions also include program modules that are executed by computers in stand-alone or network environments. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, and data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Computer-executable instructions, associated data structures, and program modules represent examples of the program code means for executing steps of the methods disclosed herein. The particular sequence of such executable instructions or associated data structures represents examples of corresponding acts for implementing the functions described in such steps.","Although the above description may contain specific details, they should not be construed as limiting the claims in any way. Other configurations of the described embodiments of the invention are part of the scope of this invention. For example, the principles of the invention may be applied to each individual user where each user may individually deploy such a system. This enables each user to utilize the benefits of the invention even if any one of the large number of possible applications do not need the functionality described herein.
