Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an information transmission apparatus that transmits information about the apparatus to an external device, a control method thereof, and a recording medium that stores a computer program.","2. Description of the Related Art","Conventionally, there is an image processing apparatus that includes a web server function. Such an image processing apparatus generates as a web page, information about a job status of the image processing apparatus and image data stored in a storing device included in the image processing apparatus. The image processing apparatus then transmits the generated web page to a client personal computer (PC) connected via a network, so that the information can be browsed on a web browser in the client PC (for example, refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-007095). Hereinafter, such a web page will be referred to as a remote user interface (UI). If a user browses the remote UI, the user can acquire information about the job executed by the image processing apparatus, the information about the image data, or the status of the apparatus, even when located away from the image processing apparatus.","In the case of the conventional remote UI, the web server in the apparatus which provides the remote UI generates a dedicated page for the remote UI, so that various types of information such as the status of the job or the apparatus are notified to the client PC. In other words, a screen which is in common with the screen displayed on a display unit in an operation panel attached to the image processing apparatus (hereinafter referred to as a local UI) is not generated in the conventional remote UI.","In contrast, if the screen displayed on the local UI is simply captured, and the captured screen is displayed on the remote UI, the following problem occurs. A display language of the local UI is set to the apparatus itself. On the other hand, the display language of the remote UI is set according to a request from the browser every time there is access. In other words, each of the display languages is independently set. As a result, the display language types of the display screens of the local UI and the remote UI may become different. For example, the local UI may be set to be displayed in Japanese, and the remote UI may be set to be displayed in English. In such a case, it may be difficult for the user to understand the captured screen of the local UI displayed on the remote UI.","The present invention is directed to providing an apparatus and a control method for solving the above-described problems.","According to an aspect of the present invention, an information transmission apparatus includes a receiving unit configured to received from an information processing apparatus, information indicating a display language type of a web page to be displayed on a web browser included in the information processing apparatus, a first determination unit configured to determine whether a display language type of a screen displayed on a display unit included in an information transmission apparatus matches a display language type indicated by information received by the receiving unit, a changing unit configured to change, if a display language type of a screen displayed on the display unit does not match a display language type indicated by information received by the receiving unit, a display language type of a screen displayed on the display unit to a display language type indicated by the received information, a generation unit configured to generate a web page including image data indicating a screen that is in common with a screen displayed on a display unit included in the information transmission apparatus and indicating a screen of a display language type changed by the changing unit, and a transmission unit configured to transmit to the information processing apparatus a web page generated by the generation unit.","Further features and aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.","Various exemplary embodiments, features, and aspects of the invention will be described in detail below with reference to the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Referring to , an image processing apparatus  includes a scanner unit , a printer unit , a controller unit , and a display-operation unit , i.e., a local UI.","The scanner unit , the printer unit , a sheet feed unit , a sheet discharge unit , and the display-operation unit  are each connected to the controller unit .

Further, the user can operate the image processing apparatus by pressing an operation menu button displayed on the display-operation unit  using the touch panel and the hard key buttons. According to the present exemplary embodiment, the image processing apparatus  operates as the information transmission apparatus that transmits to the client PC, requested information according to the request from the client PC. It is only necessary for the information transmission apparatus to include a function for transmitting the requested information. The information transmission apparatus is thus not limited to the image processing apparatus such as a printer, a scanner, a copying machine, or a facsimile, and may include other apparatuses.","A computer  includes a display device, a keyboard, a pointing device, and a computer main body (not illustrated). Further, the computer  includes a function for loading to a random access memory (RAM), an operating system (OS) from a storage device included in the computer main body, and executing various application programs. Furthermore, the computer  can communicate with the image processing apparatus  via the network using a network interface (not illustrated), and can display on the display device, information acquired by communicating therewith. Moreover, a web browser is stored in the storage device to be executable in the computer . The computer  can thus use the web browser and a predetermined protocol to communicate with the image processing apparatus that can operate as the web server to be described below, and display the remote UI on the display device. The computer  operates as the information processing apparatus, i.e., the client PC, that requests the information transmission apparatus for information and displays the acquired information. According to the present exemplary embodiment, the computer  is described as an example of the information processing apparatus. However, the information processing apparatus may be other apparatuses, such as a cellular phone.","Referring to , the image processing apparatus  and the computer  are connected to be communicable with each other via the LAN . In such a system, if there is an information acquisition request from the web browser included in the computer  to the image processing apparatus , the image processing apparatus  transmits the requested information to the computer . The connection between the image processing apparatus  and the computer  is not limited to the LAN and may be realized by other connection methods such as the Internet and wireless communication. Further, only the computer  and the image processing apparatus  are connected to the LAN  in the example illustrated in . However, other apparatuses may be connected to the LAN .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":"2000"},"Referring to , a central processing unit (CPU)  is a controller that controls the entire system. The CPU  collectively controls access to various devices connected to a system bus , based on control programs stored in a program read-only memory (ROM)  and a hard disk drive (HDD) . Further, the CPU  issues instructions to the various devices, so that printing is performed and display image data to be displayed on the display-operation unit  is generated. Furthermore, the CPU  generates the web page to be displayed on the remote UI, based on the CGI program to be described below. Moreover, the CPU  reads input information from the scanner  connected via a device interface . Further, the CPU  outputs an image signal as output information to the printer  connected via the device interface .","The ROM  stores the control program, the software modules, and the CGI program corresponding to a process illustrated in the flowchart of . The CPU  performs processing and calculations of the various types of information, controls the various devices, and generates the web page to be displayed on the remote UI, based on the CGI program. Further, the ROM  stores a boot program of the system and functions as a boot ROM.","The RAM  is a system work memory for the CPU  to operate. The RAM  temporarily stores the image data and a screen information table to be described below.","The HDD  stores the system software, and resources for displaying the display-operation unit , i.e., the image data and message data. Further, the HDD  stores a resource file and a template file to be used in generating the web page.","The storage device in the image processing apparatus, such as the HDD , stores the screen information table that defines screen information. An example of the screen information table will be described below with reference to . The screen information table is expanded in the RAM  by performing each of the steps illustrated in  or as necessary, so that the CPU  can refer to the screen information table.","Referring to , screen information  corresponding to the number of screens displayed on the operation unit  in the image processing apparatus is stored inside image information . Each screen is configured by parts including the images and the messages that form one screen, coordinates information, and language type information . The language designated in the language type information  is referred to in the message resources of each of the languages stored in a message resource storing unit . In the example illustrated in , since the language type information  of a screen   refers to a Japanese message resource  in the message resource storing unit , the screen  is displayed in Japanese. If the language of the screen  is to be changed to English, the language type information  refers to an English message resource  in the message resource .","As described above, the display language type of the screen to be displayed on the display-operation unit  can be defined using the screen information table. According to the present exemplary embodiment, the language type can be set to each message in the screen. However, a configuration in which only a uniform language type can be set to the entire operation screen may be adopted.","Referring to , an operation unit interface (I\/F)  functions as an interface to the display-operation unit . The operation unit I\/F  transmits to the CPU , information that the user has input to the system using the menu button displayed on the touch panel and the hard keys included in the display-operation unit .","Further, the operation unit I\/F  receives the user input from the hard keys and the touch panel included in the display-operation unit , and acquires the operation content.","The CPU  generates the display screen data of the screen to be displayed on the display-operation unit , based on the operation content acquired from the operation unit I\/F  and the above-described control program. The CPU  then stores the display screen data in a video (V) RAM . The display screen data stored in the VRAM  is output as the display screen to the display-operation unit  via the operation unit I\/F .","The VRAM  is a memory for storing the display screen data generated by the CPU . THE CPU  generates the display data acquired from the HDD  into a screen to be displayed on the display-operation unit . The VRAM  stores the image data laid out to be displayed on the display-operation unit .","A network I\/F  connects to the LAN  and inputs and outputs information. A modem  connects to a public line  and inputs and outputs information. The image processing apparatus  connects to the LAN  and a wide area network (WAN)  via the network I\/F  to input from and output to the external devices, the image information and device information. The above-described devices are disposed on the system bus .","An image bus I\/F  is a bus bridge that connects the system bus  to an image bus  that transfers the image data at high speed and performs conversion of data structures.","The image bus  is configured by a protocol control information (PCI) bus or an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1394. The devices to be described below are disposed on the image bus .","A raster image processor (RIP)  rasterizes a page description language (PDL) code to a bit map image.","A device I\/F  connects to the controller unit , the scanner unit  and the printer unit , i.e., the image input\/output devices of each device in the apparatus, identifies the status of each device, and performs synchronous\/asynchronous conversion of the image data. Further, the device I\/F  connects to the sheet feed unit  that feeds the sheets, and the sheet discharge unit  that discharges the printed sheets. The device I\/F  thus identifies and detects the status of feeding and discharging of the sheets, error information of the connected devices, and remaining amounts of consumables.","A scanner image processing unit  corrects, processes, and edits the input image data. A printer image processing unit  corrects the printer and performs resolution conversion with respect to the print output image data.","An image rotation unit  rotates the image data. An image compression unit  performs the following compression and decompression: joint photographic experts group (JPEG) compression and decompression of multi-value image data, joint bi-level image experts group (JBIG) compression and decompression of binarized image data, modified modified relative element address designate (MMR) compression and decompression, and modified huffman (MH) compression and decompression.","Various software modules which are recorded in the ROM  or the HDD  in the image processing apparatus, loaded as appropriate to the RAM , and executed by the CPU  according to the present exemplary embodiment will be described below with reference to a block diagram illustrated in .","Referring to , a UI  is a module that acts as an intermediary for the devices when an operator performs various operations and settings with respect to the image processing apparatus using the display-operation unit  in the image processing apparatus. The UI  transfers the input information to the various modules to be described below via the operation unit I\/F , and requests processes to be performed, or sets the data, according to the operation of the operator.","A web server module  is used for generating the display data that allows the information to be displayed to a web client according to a request from the web client connected to the LAN . Further, the web server module  is used for notifying of management information to be employed in performing various types of image processing, and of information about the image processing apparatus such as the job status. The image processing apparatus is notified of the request from the web client via the network I\/F . On the other hand, the management information of the image processing apparatus is read via a control application programming interface (API) . The management information is then notified via a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) module , a transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP) module , and a network driver , to the web client connected to the image processing apparatus via the network I\/F .","The web server module  generates information such as an object including images, and text, as the display data that can be displayed by the web client. For example, the web server module  creates web page format of a hypertext markup language (HTML) format as the display data, using the CGI program to be described below. The image processing apparatus thus operates, using the web server module , as the information transmission apparatus that can transmit and provide information to the information processing apparatus, i.e., a client.","The HTTP module  is used when the present multifunction image processing apparatus communicates using the HTTP. The HTTP module  provides the communication function to the web server module  using the TCP\/IP module  to be described below.","The TCP\/IP communication module  provides a network communication function to the various modules using a network driver . The network driver  controls the network I\/F  physically connected to the network.","The control API  provides to the higher level modules, an interface with the lower level modules.","A job manager  interprets the processes instructed from the various modules via the control API , and issues the instruction to each module. Further, the job manager  functions as a job control unit which collectively manages hardware processing performed in the multifunctional image processing apparatus. In such a case, the job manager  can control as necessary, reception and transmission of the information between the various processing units via the image bus I\/F .","The operation of the above-described image processing apparatus  will be described below with reference to drawings. In particular, the remote UI which is a characteristic function of the image processing apparatus according to the present exemplary embodiment will be described below.","The remote UI is a function for providing a user interface used for acquiring and setting the information such as the status of the apparatus, and for causing operations such as printing and transmission (i.e., Universal-Send) to be performed from the external device. The remote UI may thus be defined as the display screen that is displayed on the external device. The user can use the functions of the remote UI by accessing the image processing apparatus using the web browser in the computer connected to the network.","As illustrated in , the web server module  operates inside the image processing apparatus, so that HTTP communication can be performed. The web server module  can execute the CGI program activated according to the request from the client.","The HDD  illustrated in  stores a resource file group and a template file group of a page that are used in the remote UI. The resource file is an HTML file or an image file used in displaying the page. The resource file is not limited to the HTML file, and may also be the display data that expresses the screen indicating the information about the resource, and may be a file written in other languages. Further, the template file is a file referred to from the CGI program and used for generating the page.","The user directly inputs a uniform resource locator (URL) to the web browser or selects a link in which the URL is embedded to access the image processing apparatus. The web browser then transmits via the network, the HTTP command designating the URL input by the user.","The web server module  receives and analyzes the HTTP command, and performs an operation according to the analyzed HTTP command. For example, the web server  instructs the main body to set, acquire, or print the information of the image processing apparatus according to the request of the HTTP command. Further, the web server module  generates the web page according to the request using the template file, and transmits the generated web page to the web browser in the client.","The web browser then displays the web page returned from the image processing apparatus. As a result, the user operating the computer can acquire and set the functions, status, and stored information about the image processing apparatus by using the web browser to access the apparatus. Further, the user can operate the image processing apparatus. Furthermore, since the display data of the remote UI is provided in the HTML data, the computer does not require dedicated software for displaying the remote UI, and only general software such as the web browser becomes necessary.","The basic operation of the remote UI will be described below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["11","200"]},"Referring to , the processes illustrated in step S to step S, and step S are performed by the computer , and the processes illustrated in step S to step S, step S, and step S are performed by the image processing apparatus . Further, broken line arrows illustrated in  indicate transmission and reception of information. Each of the steps illustrated in  is performed by the CPU in the computer  or the image processing apparatus  expanding in the RAM and executing the program stored in the memory such as the ROM.","The processes performed by the computer  will be described below. The flow of the processes performed by the computer  starts when the web browser receives the user input. In step S, the computer  stands by for the user to input the URL. If the user inputs the URL (YES in step S), the process proceeds to step S. In step S, the computer  executing the web browser transmits to the image processing apparatus  via a communication path such as the LAN , the HTTP command designating the input URL. The HTTP command is a command for requesting the HTML data corresponding to the input URL. The command also includes a command designating the display language. If the user has not input the URL (NO in step S), the computer  stands by to receive the user input.","In step S, the computer  stands by to receive an HTTP response as a reply from the image processing apparatus . The HTTP response includes the HTML data corresponding to the URL designated by the HTTP command in step S. If the computer  receives the HTTP response (YES in step S), the process proceeds to step S. In step S, the web browser analyzes the HTML data included in the HTTP response, and determines whether there is a link to the image data to determine whether it is necessary to request for data when editing and displaying an HTML document. If the web browser determines that it is necessary to request for the data when editing and displaying the HTML document (YES in step S), the web browser requests the image processing apparatus  for the image data. If the necessary data is then acquired, the process proceeds to step S. In step S, the web browser edits and displays the HTML document. One session thus ends. If there is no link to the image data, and it is not necessary to request for the data when editing and displaying the received HTML document (NO in step S), the process then performed in step S is omitted, and the process proceeds to step S.","The image processing apparatus  stands by until the HTTP command is received from the computer . In step S, the CPU  in the image processing apparatus  determines whether the HTTP command is received via the network I\/F . If the CPU  determines that the HTTP command is received (YES in step S), the process proceeds to step S.","In step S, the CPU  determines whether the request from the web browser is a request to activate the CGI program. If the request is to activate the CGI program (YES in step S), the process proceeds to step S. In step S, the CPU  analyzes CGI parameters and determines the CGI program to be performed. The CPU  then stores the parameter in the RAM . In step S, the CPU  activates the determined CGI program.","In step S, the CPU  performs the CGI program. In step S, the CPU  transmits to the computer  as the HTTP response, the result acquired in step S. The HTTP response includes the HTML data generated by performing the CGI program to be described below.","In step S, the CPU  determines whether there is a request for the data from the computer  via the network I\/F . If the CPU  determines that there is such a request (YES in step S), the process proceeds to step S. In step S, the CPU  transmits the requested data, and one session ends. If the CPU  determines that there is no request for the data from the computer  (NO in step S), the session ends. The processes for receiving the data request in step S and transmitting the data in step S may be performed a plurality of times.","The CGI program activated in step S requests to the image processing apparatus (i.e., the job manager ) to acquire and set the apparatus information, or perform printing, according to the request from the computer . Further, the CGI program generates the HTML page to be transmitted, using the template file corresponding to the page. The template file includes a portion in which a description of the HTML to be generated is changed using the acquired apparatus information. As a result, the page content can be dynamically generated according to the current status of the image processing apparatus . The image generation instruction that is necessary for generating the page content is also issued when the CGI program is executed.","On the other hand, if the request is not a request for activating the CGI program (NO in step S), the process proceeds to step S. In step S, the CPU  returns the designated resource file as the response, and the session ends.","The process procedure performed by the CGI program in step S illustrated in  according to the present exemplary embodiment will be described below with reference to the flowchart illustrated in . Each of the steps illustrated in  is performed by the CPU  in the image processing apparatus  expanding in the RAM and executing the program stored in the memory such as the ROM.","In step S, the CPU  receives the parameter analyzed in step S illustrated in . In step S, the CPU  determines whether the parameter request received in step S is a request for generating a capture screen of the local UI.","If the parameter request is not a request for generating the capture screen (NO in step S), the process proceeds to step S. In step S, the CPU  performs the process according to the content of the parameter request. According to the present exemplary embodiment, the description of the process will be omitted.","If the parameter request is a request for generating the capture screen (YES in step S), the process proceeds to step S. In step S, the CPU  acquires browser display language type information from the HTTP command received in step S illustrated in . In step S, the CPU  then determines whether the browser display language type matches the language type information of the screen currently displayed on the local UI. More specifically, the CPU  refers to the screen information table illustrated in , and identifies the language type information  of the display screen data currently stored in the VRAM . The CPU  then compares the identified language type information and the browser display language type information acquired from the HTTP command received in step S illustrated in . The CPU  thus determines whether the identified language type information matches the browser display language type information acquired from the HTTP command.","If the language types do not match (NO in step S), the process proceeds to step S. In step S, the CPU  determines whether the message resource of the language type that matches the browser display language type is stored in the message resource storing unit . If the matching message resource is stored in the message resource storing unit  (YES in step S), the process proceeds to step S. In step S, the CPU  acquires from the message resource storing unit , the message resource corresponding to the browser display language type as a designated language type.","In step S, the CPU  changes the message resource portion of the display image data currently stored in the VRAM  to the message resource acquired in step S. The CPU  then expands and stores in the VRAM the display image data in which the message resource portion is changed. In step S, the CPU  performs capture processing on the display image data stored in the VRAM in step S. The VRAM according to the present exemplary embodiment includes a region for expanding the screen data to be captured for the remote UI, in addition to the screen data to be actually displayed on the local UI. The capture screen data is expanded in the region for expanding the capture screen data in the VRAM, and the screen data expanded in such a region is not displayed on the local UI. According to the present exemplary embodiment, such screen data is expanded in the VRAM. However, the screen data may be expanded and stored in other memories (e.g., the HDD and the ROM).","On the other hand, if the browser display language type matches the language type information of the screen that is currently displayed on the local UI (YES in step S), the process proceeds to step S. Further, if the message resource of the language type matching the browser display language type is not stored in the message resource storing unit  (NO in step S), the process proceeds to step S. In step S, the CPU  performs capture processing on the display screen data stored in the VRAM.","In step S, the CPU  generates a bit map image of the display screen data acquired by performing capturing processing, and generates the web page including the bit map image. More specifically, the CPU  generates the HTML data including the link to the generated bit map image.","The process of the CGI program performed in step S illustrated in  is as described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["200","11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"Referring to , the user presses (i.e., clicks) an \u201cerror information\u201d button  in an index area  in a top page of the remote UI. The HTTP command for displaying the error information page is then transmitted to the image processing apparatus  (i.e., corresponding to step S illustrated in ). In such a case, the information about the display language type of the web page is described in the HTTP command to be transmitted. The example illustrated in  describes the information indicating that the display language type is English. Upon receiving the HTTP command, the image processing apparatus  performs the process to satisfy the request, and transmits the HTML data describing the display content illustrated in  (i.e., corresponding to step S illustrated in ). A main area  in the remote UI screen includes error information , detailed error information , and a capture screen . Since the display language type of the web browser is English in the example illustrated in , the capture screen  of the image processing apparatus operation unit  displayed on the web browser is also displayed in English.","As described above, according to the present exemplary embodiment, the process of step S illustrated in  replaces the message resource portion of the display image data of the local UI with the message resource corresponding to the display language type of the web browser. As a result, the display language type of the capture screen in the local UI of the image processing apparatus  can be matched to the display language type of the remote UI.","According to the present exemplary embodiment, the user can view the display screen of the image processing apparatus on the computer used by the user by matching the display language types of the web page to be displayed on the web browser in the computer with the display screen of the image processing apparatus. A display that is more easily understandable for the user can be realized.","In general, the image processing apparatus on the network is shared by various users, and the display screen is usually displayed in the display language type determined by an administrator. On the other hand, the computer which is personally used by the user is set to display in the display language type that is easily understandable by the user, and the web page displayed on the web browser included in the computer is similarly set. In other words, according to the present exemplary embodiment, the user can be provided with the web page that is easy to use, even when the display language type of the display screen in the image processing apparatus is different from the display language type of the web page displayed on the computer in such a state.","According to the above-described exemplary embodiment, the present invention is applied to an image processing apparatus that can operate as the information transmission apparatus. However, this is not a limitation. Further, the present invention may be applied to a system configured by a plurality of apparatuses. For example, a plurality of CPUs included in one apparatus can cooperatively perform the process of each flowchart illustrated in the above-described exemplary embodiment, or the CPU included in each of the plurality of apparatuses can cooperatively perform the process.
