{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention relates to a system and method of multidimensional query results processing.","Data warehouses store data in one of two primary locations\u2014relational databases and multi-dimensional, on-line analytical processing (OLAP) data sources. Typically, reporting tools that generate tabular\/grouped list, or cross-tabulated reports work with relational databases, or extract data from an OLAP data source and process the data locally. This sort of product architecture is imposed due to the semantic differences between the relational and OLAP data models and the query languages used to access each type of data source. Whereas the relational query language, SQL, is well suited to producing tabular and grouped-list reports, multi-dimensional query languages are more suited to producing cross-tabulated reports for the purpose of analysis and exploration.","Processing OLAP data locally to provide the data for a particular report introduces several less than ideal side effects, including:\n\n","Authoring tabular and cross-tabulated reports based upon OLAP (dimensional) metadata is problematic as well since it introduces concepts not apparent in more common tabular\/relational data sources. These concepts include dimensions, hierarchies, levels, properties, and measures.","From the end user's point of view, it is desirable to deal with the more familiar entity\/relationship (or the relational) concepts of entities (tables), attributes (columns), and relationships (joins) instead of the more complex dimensional constructs. The entity\/relationship model provides a simpler and easier to understand paradigm, as well as consistency in representation regardless of the type of underlying data source.","It is an object of the present invention to solve one or more of the problems described above.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a multidimensional query results processing system for translating output of an execution of a multidimensional query into a data result set that reflects the semantics of an entity\/relationship schema report specification. The system comprises a result set description generation module for producing a result set description that reflects the semantics of the report specification, a tabular row generation module for converting the results of the single multidimensional query into a collection of rows of data, a tabular summary level calculation module for calculating a summarization level of a row a data, a tabular header row generation module for producing a header row to include in the row of data, and a cross-tabulated result generation module for converting the results of the single multi-dimensional query into a result set that matches the semantics of the report specification.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method of transforming results of a multidimensional query into results having the semantics of an entity\/relationship schema report specification. The method comprises the steps of combining a result set description of a multi-dimensional query and rules of the entity\/relationship schema to produce a final result set description, converting results of the multi-dimensional query result set into a collection of rows of data, producing headers for inclusion into the rows of data, and converting results of the multi-dimensional query into a result set that matches the semantics of the entity\/relationship report specification.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a computer data signal embodied in a carrier wave and representing sequences of instructions which, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform a method of transforming results of a multidimensional query into results having the semantics of an entity\/relationship schema report specification. The method comprises the steps of combining a result set description of a multi-dimensional query and rules of the entity\/relationship schema to produce a final result set description, converting results of the multi-dimensional query result set into a collection of rows of data, producing headers for inclusion into the rows of data, and converting results of the multi-dimensional query into a result set that matches the semantics of the entity\/relationship report specification.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a computer-readable medium having computer readable code embodied therein for use in the execution in a computer of a method of transforming results of a multidimensional query into results having the semantics of an entity\/relationship schema report specification. The method comprising the steps of combining a result set description of a multi-dimensional query and rules of the entity\/relationship schema to produce a final result set description, converting results of the multi-dimensional query result set into a collection of rows of data, producing headers for inclusion into the rows of data, and converting results of the multi-dimensional query into a result set that matches the semantics of the entity\/relationship report specification.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a computer program product for use in the execution in a computer of a multidimensional query results processing system for translating output of an execution of a multidimensional query into a data result set that reflects the semantics of an entity\/relationship schema report specification. The computer program product comprises a result set description generation module for producing a result set description that reflects the semantics of the report specification, a tabular row generation module for converting the results of the single multi-dimensional query into a collection of rows of data, a tabular summary level calculation module for calculating a summarization level of a row a data, a tabular header row generation module for producing a header row to include in the row of data, and a cross-tabulated result generation module for converting the results of the single multi-dimensional query into a result set that matches the semantics of the report specification.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","11","12","11","12","12","11","14","13","13","15"]},"One embodiment of the present invention provides a mechanism by which the results of a multidimensional query are processed such that their format and contents accurately reflect the semantics of an entity\/relationship (E\/R) report specification.
