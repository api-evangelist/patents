{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED GASES APPLICATION(S)","TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/151,747 filed on May 17, 2002, which application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/298,239, filed Jun. 14, 2001, which applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.","This invention relates generally to communications between devices over a computer network, and more particularly to the integration of a security mechanism, such as one based on the Kerberos authentication protocol, into network communications that use the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as the signaling protocol for establishing a communication session.","The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signaling protocol that provides a mechanism for a computing device to locate another device it wants to communicate with over a computer network and to establish a communication session therewith. SIP is a versatile protocol and has been used for establishing communication sessions in many different scenarios. For instance, SIP is used for Internet conferencing, telephony, presence, event notification, and instant messaging. An important strength of SIP is its support of personal mobility by providing the ability to reach a called party (user) under a single, location-independent address even when the called party has moved to a different computer.","One common mode of session initiation operation under the SIP is the \u201cproxy mode.\u201d By way of example, a SIP client (the \u201ccaller\u201d) may send a SIP request message, such as an INVITE message, identifying the intended recipient (the \u201ccallee\u201d) by an e-mail like address. This request message is typically first sent to an outbound SIP proxy of the sending SIP client. The outbound SIP proxy then forwards the request message, often through other intermediate SIP proxies, to an SIP proxy with which the intended recipient client has registered, which then sends the INVITE to the recipient. The acceptance message (\u201c200 OK\u201d) of the recipient client is returned through the signaling chain to the caller, which can then communicate with the callee through a media channel that is typically different from the signaling channel. Besides communicating with another SIP client, a SIP client may also talk to SIP servers for purposes such as registering itself with a SIP registrar by sending a REGISTER request.","Although SIP has been widely implemented for various applications, it was designed mainly for signaling operations. It does not explicitly provide or require a security mechanism for protecting the security and privacy of the communication sessions. In many cases, however, it is desirable to require a SIP client that sends a request to authenticate its user to an outbound SIP proxy, and to also require the proxy to authenticate itself to the SIP client. Moreover, it is also often necessary to protect the integrity of the SIP request messages. Both the client-proxy authentication and message integrity require the use of a reliable security mechanism. Thus, there is a need to combine a reliable security mechanism with the SIP signaling operation to allow authentication between a SIP client and an outbound SIP proxy. The technical challenge is, however, how to fit the desired security mechanism into the SIP signaling framework so that the two mechanisms for different purposes can be performed together effectively.","In view of the foregoing, the present invention provides a scheme to integrate a security mechanism, such as the Kerberos protocol or the NTLM protocol, into the message flow of the SIP signaling operation to allow a SIP client and a SIP proxy to authenticate each other. In accordance with the invention, when the proxy receives a SIP request message from the SIP client, it responds with a challenge message indicating that authentication according to a pre-selected security mechanism is required. In response, the SIP client sends a second, or revised, version of the request message with a proxy authorization header that includes authentication data for authenticating the client to the server according to the security mechanism. In the case where the Kerberos security mechanism is used, the proxy authorization header includes data representing a Kerberos server ticket obtained by the client for accessing the proxy. If the authentication of the client's user based on the proxy authorization header data is successful, the SIP proxy forwards the request through the SIP message signaling path between the SIP client and the intended recipient of the request message. If the SIP client requires mutual authentication, the SIP proxy adds a proxy authentication information header to the next message it sends to the client. This message may be, for example, a \u201c200 OK\u201d SIP response generated by a callee SIP client in response to an INVITE request or a \u201c200 OK\u201d response generated by a SIP registrar server in response to a REGISTER message. The proxy authentication information header contains the authentication data for the client to authenticate the SIP proxy.","Turning to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements, the invention is illustrated as being implemented in a suitable computing environment. Although not required, the invention will be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a personal computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types.

In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.","The following description begins with a description of a general-purpose computing device that may be used in an exemplary system for implementing the invention, and the invention will be described in greater detail with reference to . Turning now to , a general purpose computing device is shown in the form of a conventional personal computer , including a processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory to the processing unit . The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. The system memory includes read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system (BIOS) , containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the personal computer , such as during start-up, is stored in ROM .

In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the personal computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","In the description that follows, the invention will be described with reference to acts and symbolic representations of operations that are performed by one or more computers, unless indicated otherwise. As such, it will be understood that such acts and operations, which are at times referred to as being computer-executed, include the manipulation by the processing unit of the computer of electrical signals representing data in a structured form. This manipulation transforms the data or maintains it at locations in the memory system of the computer, which reconfigures or otherwise alters the operation of the computer in a manner well understood by those skilled in the art. The data structures where data is maintained are physical locations of the memory that have particular properties defined by the format of the data. However, while the invention is being described in the foregoing context, it is not meant to be limiting as those of skill in the art will appreciate that various of the acts and operations described hereinafter may also be implemented in hardware.","Referring now to , the present invention is directed to a way to integrate a security mechanism, especially one implementing the Kerberos authentication protocol, into the request messages under the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to enable a SIP client  and a SIP proxy server  to authenticate each other and for protecting the integrity of the signaling messages. The SIP is defined in Request For Comments (RFC) 2543, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","By way of example, as shown in , in a typical session initiation operation, a user  (e.g., \u201cAnn\u201d) of a SIP client  (the \u201ccaller\u201d) that wants to talk to another user  (e.g., \u201cBob\u201d) sends an INVITE message  that identifies Bob as the intended recipient for the INVITE. This INVITE is sent to an outbound proxy server  for the caller SIP client's domain. As shown in , the INVITE message may be passed through multiple SIP proxies involved in the signaling operation before it reaches the SIP client  (the callee) of Bob's computer . In a preferred embodiment, the security of the SIP signaling messages being transferred between the SIP proxies in the signaling path is protected by sending the messages under the IPSec protocol or through a pipe under the Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. It will be appreciated that although in this example the SIP request is an INVITE request, the authentication scheme described below can also be used for other types of SIP requests, such as REGISTER, MESSAGE, SUBSCRIBE, SERVICE, etc.","For ensuring the security of the signaling operation and the integrity of the signaling messages, the outbound SIP proxy server  may require authentication of the user  of the caller SIP client  before forwarding the INVITE message  through the signaling path . In accordance with the invention, referring now to , the proxy server  responds by sending a challenge message  to the SIP client . The challenge message  contains the status code \u201c407 Proxy Authentication Required\u201d as defined in the SIP specification for indicating that the client  has to first authenticate the user with the proxy . Pursuant to the SIP specification, the challenge message  (referred to hereinafter as the \u201c407 message\u201d) includes a \u201cProxy-Authenticate\u201d header field  that contains data indicating the security mechanism the client should use for authentication. The syntax and contents of the Proxy-Authenticate header is described in greater detail below. In a preferred embodiment, Kerberos is the preferred security mechanism, but the SIP framework also allows the use of the security mechanism based on the NTLM protocol. In the following description, it is assumed that a security mechanism based on the Kerberos protocol is used unless otherwise indicated.","Still referring to , when the SIP client  receives the 407 message  from the proxy server  in response to the INVITE message , it decides from the Proxy-Authenticate header  that the proxy server requires authentication of the user by means of the Kerberos mechanism. The client  then obtains a server ticket  from a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC)  for the SIP proxy server  if it has not already obtained one. In one implementation, the KDC  is part of the domain controller  for the proxy server . After obtaining the server ticket , the client  sends another INVITE message . This time, however, the INVITE message  includes a Proxy-Authorization header field , pursuant to the SIP specification. The Proxy-Authorization header field  includes the server ticket  for accessing the proxy, which includes the session key  to be used. The syntax and contents of the Proxy-Authorization header field is described in greater detail below. Optionally, the Proxy-Authorization header may also include a request for mutual-authentication, i.e., asking the proxy server  to authenticate itself to the client .","When the SIP proxy server  receives the resent INVITE message  with the Kerberos server ticket embedded therein, it extracts the server ticket and verifies the validity of the ticket by decrypting it with its long-term key shared with the KDC . If the ticket is valid, the user  is authenticated, and the SIP proxy server  forwards the INVITE message  to the next proxy  on the signaling path. If the client  has requested mutual authentication in the Proxy-Authorization header  of the INVITE message , the proxy server  will sign future packets from the server to the client using a session key associated with the Kerberos server ticket. This message includes a Proxy-Authentication Information header  that contains the credentials of the proxy  to allow the client  to authenticate the proxy.","Ultimately, the INVITE message  reaches the callee, i.e., the SIP client  of Bob's computer . If the callee accepts the call invitation, it returns a \u201c200 OK\u201d message , which is then routed back to the caller. Once the call connection is established, the caller can communicate with the callee directly without having to go through the SIP proxies involved in the signaling phase.","Referring now to , in accordance with the invention, the operation of establishing the authentication security association (SA) with between the SIP client  and the SIP proxy server  can be viewed as a state machine . In the embodiment shown in , the preferred security mechanism is Kerberos, but optionally the NTLM security mechanism can also be used, and the state machine diagram reflects the inclusion of that option.","In , the states are shown in circles, and the operations performed in connection with the states are shown in rectangular blocks. As shown in , one state in the state machine is the \u201cSECURITY_STATE_NONE\u201d state , in which no security SA has been established. When the client  receives a 407 challenge from the proxy  in response to an INVITE sent by the client or when the client decides to do a pre-authentication with the proxy, the client enters into a \u201cSECURITY_STATE_ACQUIRING_SA\u201d state , in which the client acquires the security association data required for authentication, which depends on the security mechanism selected.","Generally, the security association is defined as a state in which the client and the SIP proxy have exchanged a shared secret in a secure manner such that this secret can be used to authenticate and protect the integrity of any subsequent messages exchanged by the client and the proxy. If the security mechanism is Kerberos, the security association includes the Kerberos server ticket for the proxy and the session key. In the case of Kerberos, the obtained SA is complete, i.e., it is sufficient for the proxy to authenticate the user of the SIP client. The client then sends this SA-related information (e.g., Kerberos session key encrypted with the server's secret) to the proxy (step ). If the proxy sends back a signed 200 OK message (step ), the authentication is successful and the security association is established, i.e., the client is in the SA Established state . If, however, the proxy sends a 407 challenge instead (step ), the client assumes that the proxy is in a bad state so that it cannot validate the client's good credentials. The client then waits for a \u201cback-off\u201d time (e.g., 5 minutes) before trying to send SIP messages again (step ).","After entering the SA Established state , the client can send further messages to the proxy without having to do the authentication again, as long as the security association has not expired. If, however, the proxy sends a 407 challenge (step ), the client assumes that the proxy has for some reason dropped the established security association. As a result, the client enters the SA Dropped state , and moves back to the SECURITY_STATE_ACQUIRING_SA state  to acquire a new SA for redoing the authentication with the proxy.","As mentioned above, the NTLM mechanism can be optionally selected for user authentication. The state migration for NTLM is largely identical to that for Kerberos, but with the difference that the NTLM acquires only a partial SA the first time (step ), and sends the incomplete SA to the proxy in a first message. More specifically, in the case of NTLM, the first request from the client with the SA related information carries the client's security related capabilities (e.g., the version of the protocol it supports, the signing algorithms it supports, etc.) In response, the server sends a second  challenge (step ) that contains its a own authentication data, including its NTLM related capabilities and a random byte string typically called \u201cnonce\u201d. In response, the client signs a hash of its own name and the \u201cnonce\u201d value sent by the proxy using its credentials. This is handled internally by the NTLM implementation. The server verifies the client's authentication data and gets the session key with the help of the domain controller. If the SIP proxy is not the intended recipient, it then forwards the SIP request to the next hop in the signaling path, and signs the next message (e.g., a 200 OK message from the recipient) to the sender SIP client (step ).","The syntax of the various SIP headers involved in the message exchange between the SIP client and the SIP proxy for authentication purposes is described below.","The 407 Response","As mentioned above, if the SIP proxy server  wants to challenge the identity of the SIP client (or its user) that sent an INVITE message, it sends a 407 message with a Proxy-Authenticate header back to the client.

The optional parameters \u201calgorithm\u201d and \u201cstale\u201d have been dropped. The \u201cscheme\u201d field of the header allows the client to choose which authentication mechanism among the ones proposed by the server it wants to use to authenticate itself to the server. The client preferably chooses the Kerberos mechanism if it can support that mechanism, and otherwise chooses the NTLM authentication mechanism.","The realm parameter is the unique identifier of the SIP service provider to which the SIP proxy belongs and the client is trying to access. The realm string is displayed to the user to help her identify the correct set of credentials she needs to provide in order to authenticate. The \u201ctargetname\u201d parameter is a always required and is used to carry the FQDN for the SIP proxy. The actual contents of this parameter help the client to keep track of which proxy it is establishing an SA with. It helps the proxy to determine whether the response is meant for itself or some other proxy. The \u201copaque\u201d parameter is used by the server to index the particular SA being established and has to be echoed in any future Proxy-Authorization header the client generates for the SA, as will be described below.","In this embodiment, it is assumed that the Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface (GSS-API) as defined in IETF RFC 2078 (which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety) has been implemented and is used for securely exchanging messages between communicating applications.

The gssapi-data field in the Proxy-Authenticate header and the Proxy-Authorization header described below is for holding the data returned during the SA negotiation phase by the Security APIs that implement NTLM and Kerberos security packages. These APIs return the gssapi data that need to be sent from the client to the proxy and vice versa. The gssapi data are opaque to the SIP client and proxy implementation and are interpreted only by the security API. The qop parameter tells the client the level of security the server wants to client to adhere to.

The registration allows the SIP client to receive messages from the SIP proxy. When the SIP client registers with the SIP proxy, it can at the same time authenticate its user with the SIP proxy server by sending the authentication data, such as a Kerberos ticket, along in the REGISTER message. If the SIP client has already registered and authenticated itself with the SIP proxy, when the client sends a SIP request, such as an INVITE, the request message from the client will be signed using the Kerberos session key exchanged during the SA establishing process.","Nevertheless, a SIP client is not required to register with the server before it can send out a request message to the SIP proxy. In the case where the caller has not authenticated itself with the proxy (even if the SIP client has already registered with the proxy), the SIP proxy does not forward the request to the next hop. Instead, the proxy sends a challenge to the SIP client.","The challenge indicates that the client needs to establish a security association with this SIP server. The client can establish the SA by resending the request with the security association data, or alternatively it can do so by refreshing its registration with this server if one is already in place but the SA has not been established. Establishing the SA using the registration refresh and then sending the SIP request with a valid signature has the advantage that it also makes sure that the registration is in a good state.","Also, every time a SIP client un-registers with SIP proxy, the security association (SA) between the two is lost and a new security association has to be negotiated again. Moreover, when the registration of a SIP client expires, the proxy server will remove its corresponding security context from its list of SAs. Every time a SIP client refreshes its registration it has to refresh the authentication security association.","In a preferred embodiment that uses a security mechanism based on the Kerberos protocol, a Kerberos ticket is requested from a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) every time the SIP client registers with the SIP proxy if the authentication of the user of the sending SIP client is required by the SIP proxy\/registrar. When the SIP client receives the Kerberos ticket, it decrypts this ticket. The decrypted ticket contains the session key and some other properties of this Kerberos session. This ticket also contains the session key and other session related parameters encrypted with the server's credentials. This part is returned in a pOutput parameter in the gssapi-data field and is sent in the re-INVITE request to the proxy.","To facilitate a clear understanding of the operation of the security mechanism within the framework of SIP, a particular example of client-to-proxy Kerberos authentication is described below with reference to . In this example, it is assumed that the SIP proxy server  has created a shared secret key with the KDC  in the domain \u201cdomainA.Microsoft.com: S_server1\u201d, where \u201cserver1\u201d is used in this example as the code name for a SIP proxy\/registrar. The KDC  knows the proxy server  as server_ID=server1.domainB.microsoft.com. The proxy server  also acquires a credentials handle to be ready to respond to an incoming authentication request from the client. Server credentials are used to authenticate the proxy server  to the SIP client  in security protocols that support server authentication or mutual authentication. The proxy server  obtains a handle to its credentials defined by the service account used to start the server. It does so by calling the function AcquireCredentialsHandle of the Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI).","In the example of , the user  of the SIP client  is Ann.

Ann indicates that she wants to talk to bob@microsoft.com. Her SIP client  then sends an INVITE message  to Server1.domainB.Microsoft.com.

The SIP proxy server  has been configured to require that all INVITE requests be authenticated for calls made to the Microsoft.com user name space.

To that end, the proxy server  calls the function AcceptSecurityContext at this time and returns in opaque the base64 encoded result of pOutput. The opaque value is used by the client and server to identify a security context to use for a particular server for the purposes of authentication continuation or re-authentication of subsequent requests to the same server using the Authorization request header.","When the SIP client  on Ann's workstation gets the 407 message  indicating that authentication is required, it checks if it has a valid session key for talking to Server1.domainB.Microsoft.com. If it does not have one yet, it needs to contact the KDC in its domain to get a session key for accessing the outbound SIP proxy. In this example, the client knows from the realm specified in the 407 message that the proxy is in a different domain than its own.","To establish a secured connection to the proxy server , the client  acquires an outbound credentials handle before sending an authentication request to the proxy. This is performed by calling functions of SSPI. The SSPI provides the means for networked applications to call one of several security support providers (SSP) to establish authenticated connections and to exchange data securely over those connections. There are two client-side SSPI functions involved in the authentication setup. The AcquireCredentialsHandle function obtains a reference to previously obtained logon credentials. The function InitializeSecurityContext creates the initial authentication request security tokens. The call to initializeSecurityContext passes in the pInput the opaque value obtained from the 407 message. The client sets a tfContextReq parameter of the function to request MUTUAL_AUTH. A pfContextAttr pointer is the way the Kerberos module  tells the client that mutual-auth has been \u201crequested\u201d. This information is part of the KERB_AS_REQ created by the Kerberos module  of the client and passed in a secBuffer (pOutput) that tells the server (here the SIP proxy) the client wants mutual authentication. Since this is part of the KERB request, there is no need for a SIP mechanism (header\/parameter) to request mutual authentication.","In the example shown in , calling the API function InitializeSecurityContext causes the following Kerberos logic to happen. First, the client  asks the KDC  for the domainA.Microsoft.com domain to give it a server ticket to the Proxy server  in DomainB. The KDC  for domainA.Microsoft.com sends the client  a referral ticket to the KDC  for corp.Microsoft.com. This referral ticket is encrypted in the inter-domain key shared by the two KDCs. With the referral ticket, the client asks the KDC  for corp.Microsoft.com to give it a server ticket to the server in DomainB.","In response, the KDC  sends the client a referral ticket to the KDC  for DomainB. This ticket is encrypted in the inter-domain key the KDC  shares with the DomainB KDC . The client then asks the KDC  for DomainB to give it a ticket to the proxy server  in DomainB. The KDC  sends back a server ticket  for accessing the proxy server . The KDC  encrypts one copy of this session key with Ann's logon session key, and embeds another copy of the session key in the server ticket, along with Ann's authorization data, and encrypts the server ticket with the proxy server's long-term key. The KDC  then sends these credentials back to the client  in a Kerberos Ticket-Granting Service Reply (KRB_TGS_REP).","The call to InitializeSecurityContext thus causes the Kerberos module  of the client machine to initiate a TGS exchange with the KDC. The value returned by this exchange is the session key for signing messages to be sent to the proxy.","Thereafter, the SIP client  creates a new INVITE message  (also called the \u201cre-INVITE\u201d message) to be sent to the SIP proxy. This new INVITE message  includes a proxy-authorization header as described above, with the GSS-API data therein containing the server ticket the client received from the KDC . The session key is the value returned in the pOutput buffer returned by the InitializeSecurityContext call. Thus, the new INVITE message  includes the following data:","INVITE bob@microsoft.com","From: ann@microsoft.com","To: bob@microsoft.com","Proxy-authorization: gss-scheme opaque gssapi-rdata","Opaque=someopaquedata","Gssapi-rdata=base64{pOutput}=session key to the proxy","This INVITE does the equivalent of a KRB_AP_REQ to the proxy server.","To protect the integrity of the messages and authenticate itself (i.e., prove the source of the message), the client signs the INVITE message  with the session key. Otherwise a third party could sniff the INVITE, get the Opaque and Gssapi-data values and send a bogus INVITE to the same server to make a call between itself and whatever destination it chooses. This means a client's authentication could be \u201cstolen\u201d for as long as the session key to the server is valid (8 hrs by default). Signing the INVITE doesn't stop a third party from grabbing the Opaque and Gssapi-rdata, but it can stop that party from creating a new INVITE to call whomever it wants. The server would have to be configured to only accept signed requests for this problem to be avoided.","The client  uses the MakeSignature API and calls it for setting the phContext to the security context used in this call (the one identify in the opaque of the 407) and passing the content to sign in pMessage. The output of this call is the signed message returned in pMessage. The client adds the signature to the INVITE . When the proxy server  receives the resent INVITE message , it checks the opaque value in the Proxy-Authorization header and correlates it with a given phContext value (handle to a given security context). It takes the gssapi-rdata out and passes it to its Kerberos module  by calling the AcceptSecurityContext API function and passing the gssapi-rdata value obtained from the proxy-authorization header in the pInput component of the API function. The Kerberos module  decrypts the server ticket using the long-term key of the proxy, and extracts Ann's authorization data and the session key. It uses the session key to decrypt Ann's authenticator and then evaluates the timestamp inside.","If the authenticator passes the test, the Kerberos module  looks for a mutual authentication flag in the client's request. If the flag is set, the Kerberos module  uses the session key to encrypt the time from Ann's authenticator and returns the result in a Kerberos Application Reply (KRB_AP_REP). This causes the call to AcceptSecurityContext to return a SEC_E_OK return value with the authenticator passed through the API using the pOutput buffer. Once the user is authenticated, the SIP proxy\/registrar will process the request and forward the INVITE message to the next hop in the SIP signaling path.","The SIP component of the Proxy then uses the next message it forwards to the SIP client to pass to the client the proxy's authenticator so that the client can authenticate the server. In the illustrated example, the message is a \u201c200 OK\u201d message. This message is not originated by the SIP proxy. Rather, the 200 response is generated by the callee in response to the INVITE request. The SIP proxy merely signs it with the session key before forwarding this response to the caller.","As described above, the authenticator is in the Proxy-Authentication-Information header. The header also includes the opaque value for the client to match this response to the right security context.","When the SIP client  on Ann's workstation receives the \u201c200 OK\u201d message, it extracts the Proxy-Authentication-Information header and calls InitializeSecurityContext with the phContext value set top the value in opaque and the pInput buffer set to response-digest. The Kerberos module  on the client decrypts the proxy's authenticator with the session key it shares with proxy and compares the time returned by the proxy with the time in the client's original authenticator. If the times match, the call to InitializeSecurityContext will return a SEC_E_OK and the client knows that the proxy is genuine. Else, the client should drop the call. There is no point in sending a CANCEL to kill the call since the client cannot trust the server to do anything it asks it to do.","In the example described above, the authentication occurs in a scenario in which the SIP first sends an INVITE without authentication, and then sends the authentication data in another INVITE in response to a 407 message from the proxy indicating that authentication is required. Alternatively, the client can include the required authentication data in the first INVITE sent to the proxy. To that end, the client  obtains the server ticket for the proxy from the KDC  before it is used by the user to make a call under SIP. The authentication data required are then put in the Proxy-Authorization request header as described above. Doing this avoids the need for the proxy to send the 407 challenge to the client to ask for authentication data. Also, even though only one SIP proxy is involved in the example of authentication operation described above, there are typically multiple SIP proxies in the SIP signaling path between the caller and the callee, and more than one of them may require the caller's client for authentication. For instance, in the simplified case shown in , there is another SIP proxy server  in additional to the outbound proxy server  of the SIP client, and both proxies require client authentication before forwarding the INVITE message. In this case, the client  first goes through the same process as described above in connection with  to authenticate itself with the outbound SIP server . After the proxy server  authenticates the client, it sends the INVITE to the second proxy , which then sends a 407 challenge  to the client.","In response, the client sends another new INVITE  with a Proxy-Authorization header containing a Kerberos server ticket for the second Proxy server . After authenticating the client, the second proxy passes the INVITE  to the callee.","The following description provides additional examples of how the Proxy Authenticate, Proxy Authorization, and Proxy-Authentication Information headers are used in scenarios of different message flows for performing authentication based on the Kerberos or NTLM security mechanism. Turning to , in this case, the SIP client  performs a Kerberos-based pre-authentication when the client registers with the proxy server. The client sends a REGISTER request  that includes a Proxy-Authorization header containing the Kerberos server ticket for the proxy and a request for mutual authentication as described above. After authenticating the client based on the server ticket, the proxy returns a 200 OK message  with a Proxy Authentication Information header containing the proxy's authentication data that the client can use to authenticate the proxy.
