{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to implements for removing microbiological matter from surfaces to which the matter is adhered, and particularly to an implement which dislodges the matter from the surface, draws the dislodged matter into the implement, and stores the drawn-in matter for subsequent examination.","2. Description of the Prior Art","Devices for the collection of microbiological matter from surfaces, such as surfaces in food preparation areas, and on food itself, and on surfaces in medical areas, and the like, are known. Typically, swabs are used to scrub off the microbiological matter and are thereafter examined for harmful bacteria. In many instances, tough films of matter accumulate and harden on a surface, such that soft swabs, such as cotton, sponge, and other resilient materials, are of limited effectiveness in removing the matter from the surface.","Swabs may be soaked in a liquid adapted to aid in the removal of encrusted biological matter and\/or may be rough textured to mechanically scrape away such material. Such measures have met with only limited success.","It has been found that sonic waves are effective in breaking up layers of microbiological matter which may then be swabbed up using an ordinary swab. While this represents an improvement in many instances over chemical and\/or abrasive mediums, it is not convenient to utilize sonics and mechanical swabs requiring a two step operation followed by still having to test the accumulated matter on the swab, or alternatively, adding still another step of removing the matter from the swab and placing the matter in a test dish or other vehicle.","There is thus a need for an implement which is adapted to loosen microbiological matter adhered to a surface, swab up the loosened matter, and remove the swabbed-up matter from the swab and direct the matter to a collection point at which the matter is stored for handling and subsequent examination.","An object of the invention is, therefore, to provide an implement having facility for loosening microbiological matter adhered to a surface, for swabbing up the loosened matter, and for transporting the matter from the swab to a collection point thereon at which the swabbed matter can be held for subsequent examination.","With the above and other objects in view, a feature of the present invention is the provision of a hand-held implement for removing microbiological matter from a surface to which the matter is adhered, and storing the matter for subsequent examination, the implement including a sonic wave generator for producing sonic waves for breaking up a film of the microbiological matter on the surface, a swab for contact with the surface and collecting the microbiological matter, a suction producing means for drawing the microbiological matter from the swab and into the implement, and a trap for receiving and retaining the drawn biological matter for subsequent examination thereof.","In accordance with a further feature of the invention, there is provided a sonic swab implement including a housing configured and sized for hand-held operation, a sonic wave generator mounted on the implement and adapted to produce sonic waves for breaking up microbiological material adhered to a surface, a swab mounted on the implement and adapted for engagement with the surface for removal of microbiological material from the surface, a suction producing means mounted on the implement and adapted to draw the microbiological material from the swab, and a trap mounted on the implement and adapted to receive the microbiological material for storage and subsequent examination thereof.","The above and other features of the invention, including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts, will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular device embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.","Referring to , it will be seen that an illustrative implement  includes a handle  adapted to be hand-held by an operator. The handle  may be generally conically shaped, as illustrated in , and may be provided with textured surface areas (not shown) to assist in gripping the handle. The handle  may, alternatively, be provided with a \u201cpistol\u201d grip, not shown but well known in conjunction with hand-held devices.","On a distal end  of the handle  there is mounted a sonic horn  adapted to emit sound-wave energy for breaking up encrusted or caked layers of microbiological matter disposed on surfaces.","A battery  is disposed in a battery compartment  in the handle . A sonic horn switch  is mounted on the handle  and is in electrical communication with the battery  and the sonic horn  for selectively energizing the sonic horn .","A disposable swab assembly  is adapted to be removably mounted on the sonic horn . The swab assembly  includes an elongated hollow wand  having a proximal portion  for connection to the sonic horn , as shown in , and a distal portion  having mounted thereon a swab .","Disposed within the proximal portion  of the wand  is a capture filter  which extends in circumferential abutment with the internal walls of the proximal portion  of the wand .","The wand  is provided with a weakened juncture  between the wand proximal portion  and distal portion . The weakened juncture  is essentially a break point, that is, a point at which the portions ,  of the wand  may be easily separated from each other by manual operation.","The swab  may be any type commonly used, varying from soft, absorbing, material to a rough-textured material, or a brush. In use, the swab is saturated at least in part with a suitable liquid, such as is currently used in such operations.","The handle  includes a further compartment  for housing a syringe . A tube  extends from the syringe  to the core of the sonic horn  which is provided with a passageway  () extending therethrough and interconnecting the tube  and the wand .","Referring to , it will be seen that in an exemplary embodiment the swab assembly  includes a flaired annular portion  of the hollow wand proximal portion  and a cylindrically-shaped portion . The sonic horn  is provided with a flexible distal end portion  configured to snugly receive and removably retain the wand proximal end portion . The wand proximal annular flaired portion  is provided with internal inwardly-directed threads  which are engageable with the internal wall of the flaired annular portion of the wand proximal end .","The sonic horn  is provided proximate the distal end thereof with a cylindrically-shaped barrel portion  and, distally thereof, a frusto-conically shaped portion .","In affixing the swab assembly  to the handle , the proximal end portion  is pushed onto the barrel portion  and frusto-conical portion  of the sonic horn , as shown in . The cylindrically-shaped portion  of the swab assembly proximal end portion  slides onto the sonic horn barrel portion  and the threads  engage the frusto-conically shaped portion of the sonic horn conical portion .","The tube  extends from the syringe  to the sonic horn  and is attached thereto by being fitted over a threaded protrusion  extending from the sonic horn  and in alignment with the sonic horn core passageway .","In use, a selected swab  is mounted on the distal end of the distal end portion  of the wand . The swab is soaked with an appropriate liquid. The wand  is mounted on the handle .","In the collection of microbiological matter, an operator grasps the implement  by the handle  and manipulates the implement such that the swab, soaked in a liquid, is drawn over the surface from which the microbiological matter is to be taken.","The switch  is turned on by the operator and the combination of sonics directed from the sonic horn , through the swab assembly hollow wand  and through the swab , and engagement by the wetted swab causes microbiological matter to be dislodged from the surface being tested and taken into the swab .","The operator then manipulates the syringe  to draw the liquid, along with the newly acquired matter therein and\/or thereon, through the wand . The microbiological matter in the drawn liquid is, to a large extent, captured by the capture filter , while the drawn liquid continues on through the tube  and into the syringe .","The swab assembly  is then plucked from the sonic horn , or handle distal end . Pressure applied to the juncture  snaps the wand  into two portions, permitting easy handling of the proximal portion  of the wand  and removal of the capture filter  therefrom.","The capture filter , or the proximal portion  of the wand  with the capture filter therein, can be moved to an examination and\/or analysis location.","Optionally, the syringe  may be provided initially with the liquid desired for use with the swab . Operation of the syringe forces the liquid through the tube  and into the wand  and thence into the swab . Thus, the syringe may be used to wet the swab, as well as to draw in and hold microbiological matter-bearing liquid.","There is thus provided a hand-held implement which serves to capture microbiological matter off of a surface and retain the matter for subsequent examination.","It will be understood that changes in the details, steps, and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to establish the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which is shown an illustrative embodiment of the invention, from which its novel features and advantages will be apparent.","In the drawings:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
