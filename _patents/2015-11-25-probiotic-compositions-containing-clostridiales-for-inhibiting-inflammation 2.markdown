Said ASCII copy, created on Nov. 25, 2015, is named 126383_02102_SL.txt and is 4,147,425 bytes in size.","Humans and other mammals have numerous microbial niches, and interventions to modulate the microbiota thereof have been focused on antibiotics (which effect largely non-specific eradication of the microbiota in an effort to target a pathogen), probiotics (largely in the form of lactic acid-producing bacteria in food products), prebiotics (stimulatory materials, primarily carbohydrates, that increase bacterial growth and\/or activity), and synbiotics (combinations of prebiotics and probiotics) (see, e.g., WO 2011\/022542). Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases are characterized by an inappropriate immunological intolerance or an abnormal immune response, and affect up to 50 million Americans. Current treatments for such conditions, such as immunosuppressant drugs, carry a risk of dangerous systemic side effects such as infection, organ damage, and the development of new autoimmunities. There is therefore a need for improved diagnostic and prognostic measures, preventative measures, and treatments for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.","A healthy microbiota provides the host with multiple benefits, including colonization resistance to a broad spectrum of pathogens, essential nutrient biosynthesis and absorption, and immune stimulation that maintains a healthy gut epithelium and an appropriately controlled systemic immunity. In settings of \u2018dysbiosis\u2019 or disrupted symbiosis, microbiota functions can be lost or deranged, resulting in increased susceptibility to pathogens, altered metabolic profiles, or induction of proinflammatory signals that can result in local or systemic inflammation or autoimmunity. Thus, the intestinal microbiota plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of many diseases and disorders, including a variety of pathogenic infections distal to the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, in response to the need for durable, efficient, and effective compositions and methods for treatment of immune and inflammatory diseases by way of restoring or enhancing microbiota functions, the present invention provides compositions and methods for treatment and prevention of immune and inflammatory conditions associated with dysbiosis, including dysbiosis distal to the gastrointestinal tract.","Disclosed herein are therapeutic compositions containing probiotic, non-pathogenic bacterial populations and networks thereof, for the prevention, control, and treatment of diseases, disorders and conditions, in particular immune and inflammatory diseases. In some embodiments, the therapeutic compositions contain prebiotics, e.g., carbohydrates, in conjunction with microbial populations and\/or networks thereof. These compositions are advantageous in being suitable for safe administration to humans and other mammalian subjects and are efficacious in numerous dysbiotic diseases, disorders and conditions, such as immune and inflammatory disease.","In one aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an isolated population of anti-inflammatory bacterial cells of the order Clostridiales capable of decreasing the secretion of a pro-inflammatory cytokine and\/or increasing the secretion of an anti-inflammatory cytokine by a population of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.

Clade membership of bacterial OTUs is based on 16S sequence data. Clades are defined based on the topology of a phylogenetic tree that is constructed from full-length 16S sequences using maximum likelihood methods familiar to individuals with ordinary skill in the art of phylogenetics. Clades are constructed to ensure that all OTUs in a given clade are: (i) within a specified number of bootstrap supported nodes from one another, and (ii) within 5% genetic similarity. OTUs that are within the same clade can be distinguished as genetically and phylogenetically distinct from OTUs in a different clade based on 16S-V4 sequence data, while OTUs falling within the same clade are closely related. OTUs falling within the same clade are evolutionarily closely related and may or may not be distinguishable from one another using 16S-V4 sequence data. Members of the same clade, due to their evolutionary relatedness, play similar functional roles in a microbial ecology such as that found in the human gut. Compositions substituting one species with another from the same clade are likely to have conserved ecological function and therefore are useful in the present invention. All OTUs are denoted as to their putative capacity to form spores and whether they are a Pathogen or Pathobiont (see Definitions for description of \u201cPathobiont\u201d). NIAID Priority Pathogens are denoted as \u2018Category-A\u2019, \u2018Category-B\u2019, or \u2018Category-C\u2019, and Opportunistic Pathogens are denoted as \u2018OP\u2019. OTUs that are not pathogenic or for which their ability to exist as a pathogen is unknown are denoted as \u2018N\u2019. The \u2018SEQ ID Number\u2019 denotes the identifier of the OTU in the Sequence Listing File and \u2018Public DB Accession\u2019 denotes the identifier of the OTU in a public sequence repository. See, e.g., WO 2014\/121304.","Table 1A provides a list of exemplary bacteria useful in the present invention.","Table 1B provides a list of exemplary bacteria useful in the present invention.","Table 1C provides a list of exemplary bacteria useful in the present invention.","Table 1D provides a list of exemplary bacteria useful in the present invention.","Table 1E provides a list of exemplary bacteria useful in the present invention. These bacteria are preferably down-modulated in a subject.","Table 1F provides a list of exemplary bacteria that may be used in the invention. These bacteria are preferably up-modulated in a subject.","Table 2A lists species identified as \u201cgerminable\u201d and \u201csporulatable\u201d by colony picking approach.","Table 2B lists species identified as \u201cgerminable\u201d using 16S colony picking approach.","Table 2C lists species identified as \u201csporulatable\u201d using 16s-V4 NGS approach. See, e.g., WO 2014\/121304.","Table 3 lists anaerobic bacterial species tested for carbon source usage (Biolog plates).","Table 4 lists exemplary prebiotics\/carbon sources.","Table 5 provides bacterial species detected at low frequency in vaginal samples from vancomycin-treated mice (day 6) that were not present in untreated mice (day 0).","Disclosed herein are therapeutic compositions (e.g., pharmaceutical compositions) containing bacterial entities (e.g., anti-inflammatory bacterial cells) and optionally containing a prebiotic for the prevention, control, and treatment of immune and inflammatory diseases, disorders and conditions. These compositions are advantageous in being suitable for safe administration to humans and other mammalian subjects and are efficacious in treating or preventing numerous immune and inflammatory diseases and gastrointestinal diseases, disorders and conditions associated with a dysbiosis.","The microbes that inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract, skin, lungs, vagina, and other niches are starting to be understood and appreciated for their roles in human health and disease (see, e.g., Human Microbiome Project Consortium (2012) NATURE 486(7402): 207-14). Aspects of the invention are based, in part, on the realization that, although autoimmune and inflammatory diseases are often attributed to genetic mutations, these conditions are also influenced by microbes. It is also appreciated that, because microbes not only interact with the host but with one another, the immunomodulatory behavior of microbes can depend on relationships between microbes. For example, a microbial network in a given niche may comprise diverse microbes that all accomplish one or more of the same functions, or may instead comprise diverse microbes that all individually contribute to accomplish one or more functions. For example, microbes in a given niche may influence and\/or regulate the immunomodulatory behavior of other microbes in the same niche, or in a distal niche. In another example, microbes in a given niche may compete with one another for nutrients or space.","Microbes may influence the risk, progression, or treatment efficacy of an autoimmune or inflammatory disease. In certain aspects, microbes play a role in the prevention of an autoimmune or inflammatory disease or in the suppression of an innate or adaptive immune response. Microbes may also stimulate an inflammatory immune response to contribute to, increase the risk of, or worsen the symptoms of an autoimmune or inflammatory disease. Some microbes may be associated with lower disease severity or mortality.","Also disclosed herein are compositions and methods for the prevention and\/or treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in human subjects.","As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, \u201ca compound\u201d includes mixtures of compounds.","The term \u201cabout\u201d or \u201capproximately\u201d means within an acceptable r range for the particular value as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, which will depend in part on how the value is measured or determined, i.e., the limitations of the measurement system. For example, \u201cabout\u201d can mean within 3 or more than 3 standard deviations, per the practice in the art. Alternatively, \u201cabout\u201d can mean a range of up to 20%, or up to 10%, or up to 5%, or up to 1% of a given value. Alternatively, particularly with respect to biological systems or processes, the term can mean within an order of magnitude, or within 5-fold, or within 2-fold, of a value.","As used herein, the term \u201cpurified bacterial preparation\u201d refers to a preparation that includes \u201cisolated\u201d bacteria or bacteria that have been separated from at least one associated substance found in a source material or any material associated with the bacteria in any process used to produce the preparation.","A \u201cbacterial entity\u201d includes one or more bacteria.

In some embodiments, a prebiotic can be a comestible food or beverage or ingredient thereof. Prebiotics may include complex carbohydrates, amino acids, peptides, minerals, or other essential nutritional components for the survival of the bacterial composition. Prebiotics include, but are not limited to, amino acids, biotin, fructooligosaccharide, galactooligosaccharides, hemicelluloses (e.g., arabinoxylan, xylan, xyloglucan, and glucomannan), inulin, chitin, lactulose, mannan oligosaccharides, oligofructose-enriched inulin, gums (e.g., guar gum, gum arabic and carregenaan), oligofructose, oligodextrose, tagatose, resistant maltodextrins (e.g., resistant starch), trans-galactooligosaccharide, pectins (e.g., xylogalactouronan, citrus pectin, apple pectin, and rhamnogalacturonan-I), dietary fibers (e.g., soy fiber, sugarbeet fiber, pea fiber, corn bran, and oat fiber) and xylooligosaccharides.","As used herein, \u201cpredetermined ratios\u201d refer to ran determined or selected in advance.","As used herein, \u201cgerminable bacterial spores\u201d are spores capable of forming vegetative cells in response to a particular cue (e.g., an environmental condition or a small. molecule).","As used herein, \u201cdetectably present\u201d refers to presence in an amount that can be detected using assays provided herein or otherwise known in the art that exist as of the filing date.","As used herein, \u201caugmented\u201d refers to an increase in amount and\/or localization within to a point where it becomes detectably present.","As used herein, \u201cfecal material\u201d refers to a solid waste product of digested food and includes feces or bowel washes.","As used herein, the phrase \u201chost cell response\u201d refers to a response produced by a cell of a host organism.","As used herein, a \u201cmammalian subject protein\u201d refers to a protein produced by a mammalian subject and encoded by the mammalian subject genome. The term mammalian subject protein includes proteins that have been post-translationally processed and\/or modified.","As used herein, the term \u201cfood-derived\u201d refers to a protein or carbohydrate found in a consumed food.","As used herein, the term \u201cbiological material\u201d refers to a material produced by a biological organism.","As used herein, the term \u201cdetection moiety\u201d refers to an assay component that functions to detect an analyte.","As used herein, the term \u201cincomplete network\u201d refers to a partial network that lacks at least one of the entire set of components needed to carry out one or more network functions.","As used herein, the term \u201csupplemental\u201d refers to something that is additional and non-identical.","As used herein, a composition is \u201csubstantially free\u201d of microbes when microbes are absent or undetectable as determined by the use of standard genomic and microbiological techniques. A composition is \u201csubstantially free\u201d of a prebiotic or immunostimulatory carbohydrate when non-microbial carbohydrates are absent or undetectable as determined by the use of standard biochemical techniques (e.g., dye-based assays).","Microbial agents (individual or populations of microbes, microbial networks or parts of networks, or microbial metabolites) are considered to be \u201cexogenous\u201d to a subject (e.g., a human or non-human animal), a cell, tissue, organ or other environment of a human or non-human animal, if said subject, or said cell, tissue, organ or other environment of the subject, does not contain detectable levels of the microbial agent.","A microbial agent or population thereof is \u201cheterologous\u201d or \u201cheterologously contained\u201d on or in a host environment when, e.g., the microbial agent or population is administered or disposed on, or in the host, or host environment in a number, concentration, form or other modality that is not found in the host prior to administration of the microbial agent or population, or when the microbial agent or population contains an activity or structural component different from a host that does not naturally have the microbial agent within the target environment to which the microbe is administered or thereafter disposed.","As used herein, the term \u201cantioxidant\u201d is understood to include any one or more of various substances such as beta-carotene (a vitamin. A precursor), vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium) that inhibit oxidation or reactions promoted by Reactive Oxygen Species (\u201cROS\u201d) and other radical and non-radical species. Additionally, antioxidants are molecules capable of slowing or preventing the oxidation of other molecules. Non-limiting examples of antioxidants include astaxanthin, carotenoids, coenzyme Q10 (\u201cCoQ10\u201d), flavonoids, glutathione, Goji (wolfberry), hesperidin, lactowolfberry, lignan, lutein, lycopene, polyphenols, selenium, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, zeaxanthin, or combinations thereof.","\u201cBackbone network ecology\u201d or simply \u201cbackbone network\u201d or \u201cbackbone\u201d are compositions of microbes that form a foundational composition that can be built upon or subtracted from to optimize a network ecology or functional network ecology to have specific biological characteristics or to comprise desired functional properties, respectively. Microbiome therapeutics can be comprised of these \u201cbackbone networks ecologies\u201d in their entirety, or the \u201cbackbone networks\u201d can be modified by the addition or subtraction of \u201cR-groups\u201d to give the network ecology desired characteristics and properties. \u201cR-groups\u201d can be defined in multiple terms including, but not limited to: individual OTUs, individual or multiple OTUs derived from a specific phylogenetic clade or a desired phenotype such as the ability to form spores, or functional bacterial compositions that comprise. \u201cBackbone networks\u201d can comprise a computationally derived network ecology in its entirety, or can comprise subsets of the computationally-derived network ecology that represent key nodes in the network that contribute to efficacy such as but not limited to a composition of Keystone OTUs. The number of organisms in a human gastrointestinal tract, is indicative of the functional redundancy of a healthy gut microbiome ecology (see, e.g., The Human Microbiome Consortia (2012). This redundancy makes it highly likely that non-obvious subsets of OTUs or functional pathways (i.e., \u201cbackbone networks\u201d) are critical to maintaining states of health and\/or catalyzing a shift from a dysbiotic state to one of health. One way of exploiting this redundancy is through the substitution of OTUs that share a given clade (see below) or by adding members of a clade not found in the backbone network.","\u201cBacterial composition\u201d refers to a consortium of microbes comprising two or more OTUs. Backbone network ecologies, functional network ecologies, network classes, and core ecologies are all types of bacterial compositions. As used herein, bacterial composition includes a therapeutic microbial composition, a prophylactic microbial composition, a spore population, a purified spore population, or an ethanol treated spore population.","\u201cBacterial translocation\u201d refers to the passage of one or more bacteria across the epithelial layer of any organ of a human or non-human animal.","\u201cNetwork ecology\u201d refers to a consortium of clades or OTUs that co-occur in some number of subjects. As used herein, a \u201cnetwork\u201d is defined mathematically by a graph delineating how specific nodes (i.e., clades or OTUs) and edges (connections between specific clades or OTUs) relate to one another to define the structural ecology of a consortium of clades or OTUs. Any given network ecology will possess inherent phylogenetic diversity and functional properties.","A network ecology can also be defined in terms of its functional capabilities where for example the nodes would be comprised of elements such as, but not limited to, enzymes, clusters of orthologous groups (COGS; http.\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov books\/NBK21090\/), or KEGG Orthology Pathways (www.genome.jp\/kegg\/); these networks are referred to as a \u201cfunctional network ecology\u201d. Functional network ecologies can be reduced to practice by defining the group of OTUs that together comprise the functions defined by the functional network ecology.","The terms \u201cnetwork class\u201d \u201ccore network\u201d and \u201cnetwork class ecology\u201d refer to a group of network ecologies that in general are computationally determined to comprise ecologies with similar phylogenetic and\/or functional characteristics. A network class therefore contains important biological features, defined either phylogenetically or functionally, of a group (i.e., a cluster) of related network ecologies. One representation of a core network ecology is a designed consortium of microbes, typically non-pathogenic bacteria, that represents core features of a set of phylogenetically or functionally related network ecologies seen in many different subjects. In many occurrences, a core network, while designed as described herein, exists as a network ecology observed in one or more subjects. Core network ecologies are useful for reversing or reducing a dysbiosis in subjects where the underlying, related network ecology has been disrupted.","\u201cBacterial translocation\u201d refers to the passage of one or more bacteria across the epithelial layer of any organ of a human or non-human animal.","\u201cClade\u201d refers to the OTUs or members of a phylogenetic tree that are downstream of a statistically valid node in a phylogenetic tree. The clade comprises a set of terminal leaves in the phylogenetic tree (i.e., tips of the tree) that are a distinct monophyletic evolutionary unit and that share some extent of sequence similarity. Clades are hierarchical, in one embodiment, the node in a phylogenetic tree that is selected to define a clade is dependent on the level of resolution suitable for the underlying data used to compute the tree topology.","The \u201ccolonization\u201d of a host organism includes the non-transitory residence of a bacterium or other microscopic organism. As used herein, \u201creducing colonization\u201d of a host subject's gastrointestinal tract or vagina (or any other microbiota niche) by a pathogenic or non-pathogenic bacterium includes a reduction in the residence time of the bacterium in the gastrointestinal tract or vagina, as well as a reduction in the number o concentration) of the bacterium in the gastrointestinal tract or vagina, or adhered to the luminal surface of the gastrointestinal tract. The reduction in colonization can be permanent or occur during a transient period of time. Measuring reductions of adherent pathogens can be demonstrated directly, e.g., by determining pathogenic burden in a biopsy sample, or reductions may be measured indirectly, e.g., by measuring the pathogenic burden in the stool of a mammalian host.","A \u201ccombination\u201d of two or more bacteria includes the physical co-existence of the two bacteria, either in the same material or product or in physically connected products, as well as the temporal co-administration or co-localization of the two bacteria.","\u201cCytotoxic\u201d activity of bacterium includes the ability of a bacterium kill a cell (e.g., a host cell or a bacterial cell). A \u201ccytostatic\u201d activity of a bacterium includes the ability to inhibit (e.g., partially or fully) the growth, metabolism, and\/or proliferation of a cell (e.g., a bacterial cell or a host cell).","\u201cDysbiosis\u201d refers to a state of the microbiota or microbiome of the gut or other body area, including mucosal or skin surfaces (or any other microbiota niche) in which the normal diversity and\/or function of the ecological network is disrupted. Any disruption from the preferred (e.g., ideal.) state of the microbiota can be considered a dysbiosis, even if such dysbiosis does not result in a detectable decrease in health. This state of dysbiosis may be unhealthy (e.g., result in a diseased state), it may be unhealthy under only certain conditions, or it may prevent a subject from becoming healthier. Dysbiosis may be due to a decrease in diversity of the microbiota population composition, the overgrowth of one or more population of pathogens (e.g., a population of pathogenic bacteria) or pathobionts, the presence of and\/or overgrowth of symbiotic organisms able to cause disease only when certain genetic and\/or environmental conditions are present in a patient, or a shift to an ecological. network that no longer provides a beneficial function to the host and therefore no longer promotes health. A state of dysbiosis may lead to a disease or disorder (e.g. a gastrointestinal disease, disorder or condition), or the state of dysbiosis may lead to a disease or disorder (e.g., a gastrointestinal disease, disorder or condition) only under certain conditions, or the state of dysbiosis may prevent a subject from responding to treatment or recovering from a disease or disorder (e.g., a gastrointestinal disease, disorder or condition).","The term \u201cdistal\u201d generally is used in relation to the gastrointestinal tract, specifically the intestinal lumen, of a human or other mammal. Thus, a \u201cdistal dysbiosis\u201d includes a dysbiosis outside of the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, and a \u201cdistal microbiota\u201d includes a microbiota outside of the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. In specified instances, the term \u201cdistal\u201d may be used in relation to the site of administration, engraftment, or colonization of a composition, e.g., a probiotic composition, of the invention. For example, if a probiotic composition is administered vaginally, a \u201cdistal\u201d effect of the composition would occur outside the vagina.","\u201cGastrointestinal dysbiosis\u201d refers to a state of the microbiota or microbiome of the gut in which the normal diversity and\/or function of the ecological network or niche is disrupted.

In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition contains defined quantities of each bacterial species. In an exemplary embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition contains isolated bacterial populations that are not isolated from fecal matter.","\u201cKeystone OTU\u201d or \u201ckeystone function\u201d refers to one or more OTUs or functional pathways (e.g., KEGG or COG pathways) that are common to many network ecologies or functional network ecologies and are members of networks that occur in many subjects (i.e.,\u2033are pervasive). Due to the ubiquitous nature of keystone OTUs and their associated functional pathways, they are central to the function of network ecologies in healthy subjects and are often missing, or at reduced levels, in subjects with disease. Keystone OTUs and their associated functions may exist in low, moderate, or high abundance in subjects. A \u201cnon-keystone OTU\u201d or non-keystone function refers to an OTU or function that is observed in a network ecology or a functional network ecology, that is not observed in a keystone OTU or function.","\u201cMicrobiota\u201d refers to the community of microorganisms that occur (sustainably or transiently) in and\/or on a subject, (e.g, a mammal such as a human), including, but not limited to, eukaryotes (e.g., protozoa), archaea, bacteria, and viruses (including bacterial viruses, i.e., a phage).","\u201cMicrobiome\u201d refers to the genetic content of the communities of microbes that live in and on the human body, both sustainably and transiently, including eukaryotes, archaea, bacteria, and viruses (including, e.g., bacterial viruses (i.e., phage)), wherein \u201cgenetic content\u201d includes genomic DNA, RNA such as ribosomal RNA, the epigenome, plasmids, and all other types of genetic information.","\u201cMicrobial carriage\u201d or simply \u201ccarriage\u201d refers to the population of microbes inhabiting a niche within or on a subject (e.g., a human subject). Carriage is often defined in terms of relative abundance. For example, OTU1 comprises 60% of the total microbial carriage, meaning that OTU1 has a relative abundance of 60% compared to the other OTUs in the sample from which the measurement is made. Carriage is most often based on genomic sequencing data where the relative abundance or carriage of a single OTU or group of OTUs is defined by the number of sequencing reads that are assigned to that OTU\/s relative to the total number of sequencing reads for the sample.","\u201cMicrobial augmentation\u201d refers to the establishment or significant increase of a population of microbes that are (i) absent or undetectable (as determined by the use of standard genomic, biochemical and\/or microbiological techniques) from the administered therapeutic microbial composition, (ii) absent, undetectable, or present at low frequencies in the host niche (as an example: gastrointestinal tract, skin, anterior-nares, or vagina) before the delivery of the microbial composition, and (iii) are found, i.e., detectable, after the administration of the microbial composition or significantly increase, for instance 2-fold, 5-fold, 1\u00d710, 1\u00d710, 1\u00d710, 1\u00d710, 1\u00d710, 1\u00d710, or greater than 1\u00d710, in cases where they are present at low frequencies. The microbes that comprise an augmented ecology can be derived from exogenous sources, such as food and the environment, or grow out from micro-niches within the host where they reside at low frequency.","The administration of the therapeutic composition (e.g., pharmaceutical composition) can induce an environmental shift in the target niche that promotes favorable conditions for the growth of commensal microbes. In the absence of treatment with a therapeutic microbial composition (e.g., a pharmaceutical composition comprising a bacterial cell population), with or without one or more prebiotics, the host can be constantly exposed to these microbes; however, sustained growth and the positive health effects associated with the stable population of increased levels of the microbes comprising the augmented ecology are not observed.","\u201cMicrobial engraftment\u201d or simply \u201cengraftment\u201d refers to the establishment of OTUs comprising a therapeutic microbial composition in a target niche. In one embodiment, the OTUs are absent in the treated host prior to treatment. The microbes that comprise the engrafted ecology are found in the therapeutic microbial composition and establish as constituents of the host microbial ecology upon treatment. Engrafted OTUs can establish for a transient period of time, or demonstrate long-term stability in the microbial ecology that populates the host post-treatment with a therapeutic microbial composition. The engrafted ecology can induce an environmental shift in the target niche that promotes favorable conditions for the growth of commensal microbes capable of catalyzing a shift from a dysbiotic ecology to one representative of a healthy state.","\u201cEcological niche\u201d or simply \u201cniche\u201d refers to the ecological space that an organism or group of organisms (e.g., a bacterial population) occupies. Niche describes how an organism or population or organisms responds to the distribution of resources, physical parameters (e.g., host tissue space) and competitors (e.g., by growing when resources are abundant, and\/or when predators, parasites and pathogens are scarce) and how it in turn alters those same factors (e.g., by limiting access to resources by other organisms, acting as a food source for predators and\/or as a consumer of prey).","\u201cPathobionts\u201d or \u201copportunistic pathogens\u201d refers to symbiotic organisms able to cause disease only when certain genetic and\/or environmental conditions are present in a subject.","\u201cPhylogenetic tree\u201d refers to a graphical representation of the evolutionary relationships of one genetic sequence to another that is generated using a defined set of phylogenetic reconstruction algorithms (e.g., parsimony, maximum likelihood, or Bayesian). Nodes in the tree represent distinct ancestral sequences and the confidence of any node is provided by a bootstrap or Bayesian posterior probability, which measures branch uncertainty.","As used herein, the term minerals is understood to include boron, calcium, chromium, copper, iodine, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, silicon, tin, vanadium, zinc, or combinations thereof.","To be free of \u201cnon-comestible products\u201d means that a bacterial composition or other material provided herein does not have a substantial amount of a non-comestible product, e.g., a product or material that is inedible, harmful or otherwise undesired in a product suitable for administration, e.g., oral administration, to a human subject. Non-comestible products are often found in preparations of bacteria from the prior art.","\u201cOperational taxonomic units,\u201d \u201cOTU\u201d (or plural \u201cOTUs\u201d) refer to a terminal leaf in a phylogenetic tree and is defined by a nucleic acid sequence, e.g., the entire genome, or a specific genetic sequence, and all sequences that share sequence identity to this nucleic acid sequence at the level of species. In some embodiments the specific genetic sequence may be the 16S sequence or a portion of the 16S sequence. In other embodiments, the entire genomes of two entities are sequenced and compared. In another embodiment, select regions such as multilocus sequence tags (MLST), specific genes, or sets of genes may be genetically compared. In 16S embodiments, OTUs that share \u226797% average nucleotide identity across the entire 16S or some variable region of the 16S are considered the same OTU (see, e.g., Claesson et al. (2010) NUCLEIC ACIDS RES. . 38: e200; Konstantinidis et al. (2006) PHILOS. TRANS. R. SOC. LOND. B. BIOL. SCI. 361: 1929-1940). In embodiments involving the complete genome, MLSTs, specific genes, or sets of genes OTUs that share \u226795% average nucleotide identity are considered the same OTU (see, e.g., Achtman and Wagner (2008) NAT. REV. MICROBIOL. 6: 431-440; Konstantinidis et al. (2006)). OTUs are frequently defined by comparing sequences between organisms. Generally, sequences with less than 95% sequence identity are not considered to form part of the same OTU. OTUs may also be characterized by any combination of nucleotide markers or genes, in particular highly conserved genes (e.g., \u201chouse-keeping\u201d genes), or a combination thereof. Such characterization employs, e.g., WGS data or a whole genome sequence.","The term \u201cphylogenetic diversity\u201d refers to the biodiversity present in a given network ecology, core network ecology or network class ecology based on the OTUs that comprise the network. Phylogenetic diversity is a relative term, meaning that a network ecology, core network or network class that is comparatively more phylogenetically diverse than another network contains a greater number of unique species, genera, and taxonomic families. Uniqueness of a species, genera, or taxonomic family is generally defined using a phylogenetic tree that represents the genetic diversity all species, genera, or taxonomic families relative to one another. In another embodiment phylogenetic diversity may be measured using the total branch length or average branch length of a phylogenetic tree.","Phylogenetic diversity may be optimized in a bacterial composition by including a wide range of biodiversity.","\u201cPhylogenetic tree\u201d, \u201crDNA\u201d, \u201crRNA\u201d, \u201c16S-rDNA\u201d, \u201c16S-rRNA\u201d, \u201c16S\u201d, \u201c16S sequencing\u201d, \u201c16S-NGS\u201d, \u201c18S\u201d, \u201c18S-rRNA\u201d, \u201c18S-rDNA\u201d, \u201c18S sequencing\u201d, and \u201c18S-NGS\u201d refer to the nucleic acids that encode for the RNA subunits of the ribosome, rDNA refers to the gene that encodes the rRNA that comprises the RNA subunits. There are two RNA subunits in the ribosome termed the small subunit (SSU) and large subunit (LSU); the RNA genetic sequences (rRNA) of these subunits are related to the gene that encodes them (rDNA) by the genetic code. rDNA genes and their complementary RNA sequences are widely used for determination of the evolutionary relationships amount organisms as they are variable, yet sufficiently conserved to allow cross organism molecular comparisons.","Typically 16S rDNA sequence (approximately 1542 nucleotides in length) of the 30S SSU is used for molecular-based taxonomic assignments of prokaryotes and the 18S rDNA sequence (approximately 1869 nucleotides in length) of 40S SSU is used for eukaryotes. The bacterial 16S rDNA is used in reconstructing the evolutionary relationships and sequence similarity of one bacterial isolate to another using phylogenetic approaches. 16S sequences are used for phylogenetic reconstruction as they are in general highly conserved, but contain specific hypervariable regions that harbor sufficient nucleotide diversity to differentiate genera and species of most bacteria.","The \u201cV1-V9 regions\u201d of the 16S rRNA refers to the first through ninth hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene that are used for genetic typing of bacterial samples. These regions in bacteria are defined by nucleotides 69-99, 137-242, 433-497, 576-682, 822-879, 986-1043, 1117-1173, 1243-1294 and 1435-1465 respectively using numbering based on the system of nomenclature (see, e.g., Brosius et al. (1978) PROC. NAT'L. ACAD. SCI. USA 75(10): 4801-4805). In some embodiments, at least one of the V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, and V9 regions are used to characterize an OTU. In one embodiment, the V1, V2, and V3 regions are used to characterize an OTU. In another embodiment, the V3, V4, and V5 regions are used to characterize an OTU. In another embodiment, the V4 region is used to characterize an OTU. A person of ordinary skill in the art can identify the specific hypervariable regions of a candidate 16S rRNA by comparing the candidate sequence in question to a reference sequence and identifying the hypervariable regions based on similarity to the reference hypervariable regions, or alternatively, one can employ Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) sequence characterization of microbes or a microbial community.","\u201cResidual habitat products\u201d refers to material derived from the habitat for microbiota within or on a human or animal. For example, microbiota live in feces in the gastrointestinal tract, on the skin itself, in saliva, mucus of the respiratory tract, or secretions of the genitourinary tract (i.e., biological matter associated with the microbial community). Substantially free of residual habitat products means that the bacterial composition no longer contains the biological matter associated with the microbial environment on or in the human or animal subject and is 100% free, 99% free, 98% free, 97% free, 96% free, 95% free, 94% free, 93% free, 92% free, 91% free, 90% free, 85% free, 80% free, 75% free, 70% free, 65% free, or 60% free of any contaminating biological matter associated with the microbial community. Residual habitat products can include abiotic materials (including undigested food) or it can include unwanted microorganisms. Substantially free of residual habitat products may also mean that the bacterial composition contains no detectable cells from a human or animal and that only microbial cells are detectable. In one embodiment, substantially free of residual habitat products may also mean that the bacterial composition contains no detectable viral (e.g., bacterial viruses (i.e., phage)), fungal, or mycoplasmal contaminants. In another embodiment, it means that fewer than 1\u00d710%, 1\u00d710%, 1\u00d710%, 1\u00d710%, 1\u00d710%, 1\u00d710%, 1\u00d710% of the viable cells in the bacterial composition are human or animal, as compared to microbial cells. There are multiple ways to accomplish this degree of purity, none of which are limiting. For example, contamination may be reduced by isolating desired constituents through multiple steps of streaking to single colonies on solid media until replicate (such as, but not limited to, two) streaks from serial single colonies have shown only a single colony morphology. Alternatively, reduction of contamination can be accomplished by multiple rounds of serial dilutions to single desired cells (e.g., a dilution of 10or 10), such as through multiple 10-fold serial dilutions. This can further be confirmed by showing that multiple isolated colonies have similar cell shapes and Gram staining behavior. Other methods for confirming adequate purity include genetic analysis (e.g., PCR and DNA sequencing), serology and antigen analysis, enzymatic and metabolic analysis, and methods using instrumentation such as flow cytometry with reagents that distinguish desired constituents from contaminants.","The term \u201csubject\u201d refers to any organism or animal subject that is an object of a method or material, including mammals, e.g., humans, laboratory animals (e.g., primates, rats, mice, rabbits), livestock (e.g., cows, sheep, goats, pigs, turkeys, and chickens), household pets (e.g., dogs, cats, and rodents), horses, kangaroos, and transgenic non-human animals. The subject may be suffering from a dysbiosis, including, but not limited to, an infection due to a gastrointestinal pathogen or may be at risk of developing or transmitting to others an infection due to a gastrointestinal pathogen. Synonyms used herein include \u201cpatient\u201d and \u201canimal.\u201d In some embodiments, the subject or host may be suffering from a dysbiosis, that contributes to or causes a condition classified as graft-versus-host disease, Crohn's disease, Celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, or type I diabetes. In some embodiments, the host may be suffering from metabolic endotoxemia, altered metabolism of primary bile acids, immune system activation, or an imbalance or reduced production of short chain fatty acids including, for example, butyrate, propionate, acetate, and a branched chain fatty acid.","The term \u201cphenotype\u201d refers to a set of observable characteristics of an individual entity. As example an individual subject may have a phenotype of \u201chealth\u201d or \u201cdisease\u201d. Phenotypes describe the state of an entity and all entities within a phenotype share the same set of characteristics that describe the phenotype. The phenotype of an individual results in part, or in whole, from the interaction of the entities genome and\/or microbiome with the environment.","\u201cSpore\u201d or \u201cendospore\u201d refers to an entity, particularly a bacterial entity, which is in a dormant, non-vegetative and non-reproductive stage.

This can include but is not limited to the complete ablation of the activity, response, condition, or disease. This may also include, for example, a 10% reduction in the activity, response, condition, or disease as compared to the native or control level. Thus, the reduction can be a 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100%, or any amount of reduction in between as compared to native or control levels.","\u201cTreatment\u201d, \u201ctreat\u201d, or \u201ctreating\u201d, mean a method of reducing the effects of a disease or condition. Treatment can also refer to a method of reducing the disease or condition itself rather than just the symptoms. The treatment can be any reduction from native levels and can be but is not limited to the complete ablation of the disease, condition, or the symptoms of the disease or condition. Therefore, in the disclosed methods, treatment\u2033 can refer to a 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100% reduction in the severity of an established disease or the disease progression. For example, a disclosed method for reducing the effects of GVHD is considered to be a treatment if there is a 10% reduction in one or more symptoms of the disease in a subject with GVHD when compared to native levels in the same subject or control subjects. Thus, the reduction can be a 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100%, or any amount of reduction in between, as compared to native or control levels.

In exemplary embodiments, the immunomodulatory bacterial cells are capable of reducing inflammation in a mammalian subject. Such immunomodulatory bacterial cells are referred to herein as \u201canti-inflammatory bacteria\u201d or \u201canti-inflammatory bacterial cells\u201d. Immunomodulatory bacterial cells can act to alter the immune activity of a subject directly or indirectly. For example, immunomodulatory bacteria can act directly on immune cells through receptors for bacterial components (e.g. Toll-like receptors) or by producing metabolites such as immunomodulatory short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Such SCFAs can have many positive impacts on the health of the subject, by, for example, reducing inflammation, or improving intestinal barrier integrity. Immunomodulatory bacterial cells can also impact the immune activity of a subject by producing glutathione or gamma-glutamylcysteine.","Pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., probiotic compositions) containing immunomodulatory bacteria (i.e., bacterial cells) can additionally or alternatively impact the immune activity of a subject indirectly by modulating the activity of immune cells in the subject. For example, immunomodulatory bacteria may alter cytokine expression by host immune cells (e.g., macrophages, B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, mast cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), etc.) or other types of host cells capable of cytokine secretion (e.g., endothelial cells, fibroblasts, stromal cells, etc.). In an exemplary embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., probiotic compositions) contain a population of anti-inflammatory bacterial cells that are capable of inducing secretion of a anti-inflammatory cytokine by host cells (e.g., host immune cells). For example, anti-inflammatory bacterial cells can induce secretion of one or more anti-inflammatory cytokines such as, but not limited to, IL-10, IL-13, IL-9, IL-4, IL-5, TGF\u03b2, and combinations thereof, by host cells (e.g., host immune cells). In another exemplary embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., probiotic compositions) contain anti-inflammatory bacterial cells that are capable of reducing secretion of one or more pro-inflammatory cytokines by a host cell (e.g., by a host immune cell). For example, anti-inflammatory bacterial cells can reduce secretion of one or more pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as, but not limited to, IFN\u03b3, IL-12p70, IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, MCP1, MIP1\u03b1, MIP1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, and combinations thereof, by host cells (e.g., host immune cells). In some embodiments, the induction and\/or secretion of said pro-inflammatory cytokines may be induced by (e.g., in response to, either directly or indirectly) a bacteria (e.g., ). Other cytokines that may be modulated by immunomodulatory bacterial cells include, for example, IL-17A, IL-2, and IL-9.","In some embodiments, immunomodulatory bacteria (i.e., immunomodulatory bacterial cells) are selected for inclusion in a pharmaceutical composition (e.g., probiotic composition) of the invention based on the desired effect of the immunomodulatory bacteria on cytokine secretion by a host cell or a population of host cells (e.g., a host immune cell (e.g., a PBMC)). In some embodiments, said effect of the immunomodulatory bacteria is assessed in vitro using a population of host cells (e.g., a population of isolated host immune cells). For example, in one embodiment, a probiotic composition contains anti-inflammatory bacteria that increase secretion of a anti-inflammatory cytokine, for example, IL-10, IL-13, IL-9, IL-4, IL-5, TGF\u03b2, and combinations thereof, by a host cell (e.g., a host immune cell (e.g., PBMCs, macrophages, B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, mast cells). In some embodiments, the anti-inflammatory bacteria increase secretion of two or more anti-inflammatory cytokines. In some embodiments, the anti-inflammatory bacteria increase secretion of three or more anti-inflammatory cytokines. In some embodiments, the anti-inflammatory bacteria increase secretion of four or more anti-inflammatory cytokines. In some embodiments, the anti-inflammatory bacteria increase secretion of five or more anti-inflammatory cytokines. In exemplary embodiments, the increase is an increase of at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 80%, 100%, 200%, 300%, 500% or more. In other embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition contains anti-inflammatory bacteria that decrease secretion of a pro-inflammatory cytokine, for example, IFN\u03b3, IL-12p70, IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, MCP1, MIP1\u03b1, MIP1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, and combinations thereof, by a host cell. In some embodiments, the anti-inflammatory bacteria decrease secretion of five or more pro-inflammatory cytokines. In exemplary embodiments, the decrease is a decrease of at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 80%, 100%, 200%, 300%, 500% or more. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition contains anti-inflammatory bacterial cells that increase secretion of one or more anti-inflammatory cytokines and reduce secretion of one or more pro-inflammatory cytokines by a host cell (e.g., a host immune cell). Alterations in cytokine expression may occur locally, e.g., in the gastrointestinal tract of a subject, or at a site distal to a microbial niche, e.g., distal to the gastrointestinal tract. In some embodiments, the induction and\/or secretion of said pro-inflammatory cytokines may be induced by (e.g., in response to, either directly or indirectly) a bacteria (e.g., Enterococcus faecalis).","In some aspects, the pharmaceutical compositions described herein and\/or a prebiotic (e.g., a carbohydrate) modulate the release of immune stimulatory cytokines by host cells (e.g., host immune cells). In preferred embodiments, the administered immunomodulatory bacterial cells (e.g., anti-inflammatory bacterial cells) and\/or a prebiotic (e.g., a carbohydrate) inhibit or reduce the release of immune stimulatory cytokines.

In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that decrease the proportion of Th17 cells in a subject. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that increase the proportion of Th1 cells in a subject (e.g., by inducing expansion of Th1 cells in the subject). In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that decrease the proportion of Th1 cells in a subject. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that increase the proportion of Th2 cells in a subject (e.g., by inducing expansion of Th2 cells in the subject). In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that decrease the proportion of Th2 cells in a subject. The increase or decrease in the proportion of immune cell subpopulations may be systemic, or it may be localized to a site of action of the probiotic, e.g., in the gastrointestinal tract or at a site of distal dysbiosis.","In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition (e.g., a probiotic composition) contains immunomodulatory bacteria capable of modulating the proportion of one or more populations of Treg cells, Th17 cells, Th1 cells, Th2 cells, and combinations thereof, in a subject. Certain immune cell profiles may be particularly desirable to treat or prevent particular disorders associated with a dysbiosis. For example, treatment or prevention of an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder (e.g., GVHD) can be promoted by increasing the quantity of Treg cells and Th2 cells, and decreasing the quantity of Th17 cells and Th1 cells. Accordingly, pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., probiotic compositions) for the treatment or prevention of an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder (e.g., GVHD) contain immunomodulatory bacteria capable of promoting the differentiation and\/or expansion of Treg cells and Th2 cells, and reducing Th17 and Th1 cells in the subject.","In one embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., a therapeutic probiotic compositions) containing a purified population of immunomodulatory microbes, e.g., immunomodulatory bacterial cells, are provided, with or without one or more prebiotics, in an amount effective to: i) treat or prevent dysbiosis, e.g., gastrointestinal or distal dysbiosis, inflammation, or an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder; and\/or ii) augment at least one type of microbe, e.g., a bacterium, not present in the therapeutic composition in a mammalian recipient subject to whom the pharmaceutical composition is administered; and\/or iii) engraft at least one type of microbe, e.g., an anti-inflammatory bacterial cell, present in the therapeutic composition but not present in a mammalian subject prior to treatment.","In another embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions containing a purified population of immunomodulatory bacteria (e.g., anti-inflammatory bacterial cells) are provided, in an amount effective to i) augment the microbiota diversity present in the mammalian recipient and\/or ii) treat or prevent dysbiosis, e.g., gastrointestinal or distal dysbiosis, inflammation, or an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder in a mammalian recipient subject to whom the therapeutic composition is administered, wherein the purified population of immunomodulatory bacteria is obtained by separating the population from at least one residual habitat product in a fecal material obtained from one or a plurality of mammalian donor subjects. In some embodiments, individual bacterial strains can be cultured from fecal material. These strains can then be purified or otherwise isolated and used singly or in combination. In one embodiment, the probiotic composition does not contain a fecal extract.","In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be used to treat or correct a dysbiosis in a subject. The dysbiosis may be, for example, a local dysbiosis, or a distal dysbiosis. In another embodiment, the probiotic compositions described herein may be used to prevent a dysbiosis in a subject at risk for developing a dysbiosis.","In another embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions containing a purified population of immunomodulatory bacteria (e.g., anti-inflammatory bacterial cells) are provided, in an amount effective to i) augment the microbiota diversity present in the mammalian recipient and\/or ii) treat or prevent dysbiosis, e.g., gastrointestinal or distal dysbiosis, inflammation, or an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder in a mammalian recipient subject to whom the therapeutic composition is administered, wherein the purified population of immunomodulatory bacteria is obtained by separating the population from a non-fecal material source.","In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition containing a purified population of immunomodulatory bacterial cells (e.g., anti-inflammatory bacterial cells) described above is co-administered or co-formulated with one or more prebiotics, e.g., carbohydrates. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition is administered before one or more prebiotics is administered to a subject. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is administered after one or more prebiotics is administered to a subject. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition containing a purified population of immunomodulatory bacterial cells is administered concurrently with one or more prebiotics. In other embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition containing a purified population of immunomodulatory bacterial cells is administered sequentially with one or more prebiotics. In some embodiments, a purified population of immunomodulatory bacterial cells is administered in a pharmaceutical composition formulated to contain one or more pharmaceutical excipients, and optionally one or more prebiotics.","Immunomodulatory bacterial cells (e.g., anti-inflammatory bacterial cells) involved in modulation of the host immune system i) may be human commensals; ii) may be part of an organ's healthy-state microbiome; ii) may be part of a distal organ's healthy-state microbiome; iv) may be exogenous microbes; v) may be innocuous; vi) may be pathobionts; vii) may be pathogens; viii) may be opportunistic pathogens; or ix) any combination thereof. In some aspects, microbes are not required to be actively proliferating (e.g., spores, dormant cells, cells with reduced metabolic rate, or heat-killed cells) to have an immunomodulatory effect. In certain aspects, microbial cell components, rather than whole microbial cells, may have immunomodulatory effects. Non-limiting examples of microbial components are lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules.","The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein, may optionally further comprise a prebiotic, a non-microbial immunomodulatory carbohydrates, or a microbial immunomodulatory cell component, that are effective for the prevention or treatment of an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including, but not limited to, ulterative colitis and Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type I diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, and Celiac disease, or dysbiosis.","In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions comprise at least one type of immunomodulatory bacterial cells (e.g., at least one type of anti-inflammatory bacterial cell) and, optionally, at least one prebiotic (e.g., a carbohydrate), and optionally further comprise a microbial immunomodulatory cell component or substrate for the production of immunomodulatory metabolites, that are effective for the prevention or treatment of an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder. Methods for the prevention and\/or treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in human subjects are also disclosed herein.","In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions, e.g., probiotic compositions, of the invention comprise purified spore populations of anti-inflammatory bacterial cells. In one embodiment, the purified spore populations can engraft in the host and remain present for 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10 days, 14 days, 21 days, 25 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, or longer than 90 days. Additionally, the purified spore populations can induce other healthy commensal bacteria found in a healthy gut to engraft in the host that are not present in the purified spore populations or present at lesser levels. Therefore, these species are considered to \u201caugment\u201d the delivered spore populations. In this manner, commensal species augmentation of the purified spore population in the recipient's gut leads to a more diverse population of gut microbiota than present initially.","Preferred bacterial cells for use in the present invention include bacterial cells of the genera , Clostridiaceae, Clostridiales, , Lachnospiraceae, , and ","Preferred bacterial cells also include bacterial cells of the genera (.), , and ","In another embodiment, a probiotic composition of the invention consists essentially of ","In one embodiment, a probiotic composition of the invention does not comprise alone.","As provided herein, the pharmaceutical compositions comprise, or in the alternative, modulate, the colonization and\/or engraftment, of the following exemplary bacterial entities (e.g., bacterial cells belonging to particular bacterial strains, bacterial species, or bacterial genera): sp.

In other embodiments, the purified populations of bacterial cells have reduced sensory components as compared to fecal material, such as reduced odor, taste, appearance, and umami.","In another embodiment, the invention provides purified populations of bacterial cells that are substantially free of residual habitat products. In certain embodiments, this means that the bacterial composition no longer contains a substantial amount of the biological matter associated with the microbial community while living on or in the human or animal subject, and the purified population of bacterial cells (e.g., bacterial spores or vegetative cells) may be 100% free, 99% free, 98% free, 97% free, 96% free, 95% free, 94% free, 93% free, 92% free, 91% free, 90% free, 85% free, 80% free, 75% free, 70% free, 60% free, or 50% free, of any contamination of the biological matter associated with the microbial community.

For example, 5 mls of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) is added to 1 mg of frozen stool sample and homogenized by vortexing in an anaerobic chamber for isolation of anaerobic bacteria. The suspension is then serially diluted ten-fold (e.g., 10to 10dilutions) and 100 \u03bcl aliquots of each dilution are spread evenly over the surface of agar plates containing different formulations e.g., anaerobic blood agar plates, bile esculin plates, laked kanamycin vancomycin plates, egg yolk agar plates and de Man Rogosa and Sharpe agar plates. Inverted plates are incubated in an anaerobic chamber for 48 hr+\/\u22124 hours. Colonies with different morphologies are picked and replated on anaerobic blood agar plates for further testing, PCR analysis and 16 S sequencing. Selected bacterial strains can be grown for therapeutic use singly or in combination.","In one embodiment, a probiotic composition of the invention is not a fecal transplant.

In one embodiment, each of the populations of bacterial cells are independently cultured and purified, e.g., each population is cultured separately and subsequently mixed together. In one embodiment, one or more of the populations of bacterial cells in the composition are co-cultured.","Identification of Immunomodulatory Bacteria.","In some embodiments, immunomodulatory bacteria are identified by screening bacteria to determine whether the bacteria induce secretion of a pro-inflammatory or a anti-inflammatory cytokines by a host cell (e.g., a host immune cell). In some embodiments, the immunomodulatory bacteria are screened in vitro. For example, human or mammalian cells capable of cytokine secretion, such as immune cells (e.g., PBMCs, macrophages, T cells, etc.) can be exposed to candidate immunomodulatory bacteria, or supernatants obtained from cultures of candidate immunomodulatory bacteria, and changes in cytokine expression or secretion can be measured using standard techniques, such as ELISA, immunoblot, Luminex, antibody array, quantitative PCR, microarray, etc. Bacteria for inclusion in a pharmaceutical composition (e.g., a probiotic composition) can be selected based on the ability to induce a desired cytokine profile in human or mammalian cells (e.g., immune cells). For example, anti-inflammatory bacteria can be selected for inclusion in a pharmaceutical composition based on the ability to induce secretion of one or more anti-inflammatory cytokines, and\/or the ability to reduce secretion of one or more pro-inflammatory cytokines. Anti-inflammatory cytokines include, for example, IL-10, IL-13, IL-9, IL-4, IL-5, TGF\u03b2, and combinations thereof. Pro-inflammatory cytokines include, for example, IFN\u03b3, IL-12p70, IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, MCP1, MIP1\u03b1, MIP1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, anti-inflammatory bacteria may be selected for inclusion in a pharmaceutical compositions based on the ability to modulate the secretion of one or more anti-inflammatory cytokines and\/or that ability to reduce secretion of one or pro-inflammatory cytokines that have been induced by a bacterial cell of a different bacteria type. In some embodiments, the different bacterial cell is of a different bacterial genus. In some embodiments, the different bacterial cell is of a different bacterial species. In some embodiments, the different bacterial cell is of a different bacterial strain.","In other embodiments, immunomodulatory bacteria are identified by screening bacteria to determine whether the bacteria impact the differentiation and\/or expansion of particular subpopulations of immune cells. For example, candidate bacteria can be screened for the ability to promote differentiation and\/or expansion of Treg cells, Th17 cells, Th1 cells and\/or Th2 cells from precursor cells, e.g., naive T cells. By way of example, na\u00efve T cells can be cultured in the presence of candidate bacteria or supernatants obtained from cultures of candidate bacteria, and the quantity of Treg cells, Th17 cells, Th1 cells and\/or Th2 cells can be determined using standard techniques, such as FACS analysis. Markers indicative of Treg cells include, for example, CD25CD127. Markers indicative of Th17 cells include, for example, CXCR3CCR6. Markers indicative of Th1 cells include, for example, CXCR3CCR6. Markers indicative of Th2 cells include, for example, CXCR3CCR6. Other markers indicative of particular T cell subpopulations are known in the art, and may be used in the assays described herein, e.g., to identify populations of immune cells impacted by candidate immunomodulatory bacteria. Bacteria can be selected for inclusion in a pharmaceutical composition based on the ability to promote differentiation and\/or expansion of a desired immune cell subpopulation.","In other embodiments, immunomodulatory bacteria are identified by screening bacteria to determine whether the bacteria secrete short chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as, for example, butyrate, acetate, propionate, or valerate, or combinations thereof. For example, secretion of short chain fatty acids into bacterial supernatants can be measured using standard techniques. In one embodiment, bacterial supernatants can be screened to measure the level of one or more short chain fatty acids using NMR, mass spectrometry (e.g., GC-MS, tandem mass spectrometry, matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization, etc.), ELISA, or immunoblot. Expression of bacterial genes responsible for production of short chain fatty acids can also be determined by standard techniques, such as Northern blot, microarray, or quantitative PCR.","In some embodiments, provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions comprising a population of bacterial cells (e.g., bacterial cells of the order Clostridiales) containing one type of bacteria.

Transgalactooligosaccharides (TOS) are for example sold under the trademark Vivinal\u2122 (Borculo Domo Ingredients, Netherlands). Indigestible dextrin, which may be produced by pyrolysis of corn starch, comprises \u03b1(1\u21924) and \u03b1(1\u21926) glucosidic bonds, as are present in the native starch, and contains 1\u21922 and 1\u21923 linkages and levoglucosan. Due to these structural characteristics, indigestible dextrin contains well-developed, branched particles that are partially hydrolysed by human digestive enzymes. Numerous other commercial sources of indigestible oligosaccharides are readily available and known to skilled persons in the art. For example, transgalactooligosaccharide is available from Yakult Honsha Co., Tokyo, Japan. Soybean oligosaccharide is available from Calpis Corporation distributed by Ajinomoto U.S.A. Inc., Teaneck, N.J.","In a further preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition contains a prebiotic mixture of an acid oligosaccharide with a DP between 1 and 5000, prepared from pectin, alginate, and mixtures thereof; and a neutral oligosaccharide, selected from the group of fructans, fructooligosaccharides, indigestible dextrins, galactooligosaccharides including transgalacto-oligosaccharides, xylooligosaccharides, arabinooligosaccharides, glucooligosaccharides, manno-oligosaccharides, fucooligosaccharides, and mixtures thereof.","In certain embodiments, the prebiotic mixture comprises xylose. In other embodiments, the prebiotic mixture comprises a xylose polymer (i.e. xylan). In some embodiments, the prebiotic comprises xylose derivatives, such as xylitol, a sugar alcohol generated by reduction of xylose by catalytic hydrogenation of xylose, and also xylose oligomers (e.g., xylooligosaccharide). While xylose can be digested by humans, via xylosyltransferase activity, most xylose ingested by humans is excreted in urine. In contrast, some microorganisms are efficient at xylose metabolism or may be selected for enhanced xylose metabolism. Microbial xylose metabolism may occur by at least four pathways, including the isomerase pathway, the Weimburg pathway, the Dahms pathway, and, for eukaryotic microorganisms, the oxido-reductase pathway.","The xylose isomerase pathway involves the direct conversion of D-xylose into D-xylulose by xylose isomerase, after which D-xylulose is phosphorylated by xylulose kinase to yield D-xylolose-5-phosphate, an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway.","In the Weimberg pathway, D-xylose is oxidized to D-xylono-lactone by a D-xylose dehydrogenase. Then D-xylose dehydrogenase is hydrolyzed by a lactonase to yield D-xylonic acid, and xylonate dehydratase activity then yields 2-keto-3-deoxy-xylonate. The final steps of the Weimberg pathway are a dehydratase reaction to form 2-keto glutarate semialdehyde and an oxidizing reaction to form 2-ketoglutarate, an intermediate of the Krebs cycle.","The Dahms pathway follows the same mechanism as the Weimberg pathway but diverges once it has yielded 2-keto-3-deoxy-xylonate. In the Dahms pathway, an aldolase splits 2-keto-3-deoxy-xylonate into pyruvate and glycolaldehyde.","The xylose oxido-reductase pathway, also known as the xylose reductase-xylitol dehydrogenase pathway, begins by the reduction of D-xylose to xylitol by xylose reductase followed by the oxidation of xylitol to D-xylulose by xylitol dehydrogenase. As in the isomerase pathway, the next step in the oxido-reductase pathway is the phosphorylation of D-xylulose by xylulose kinase to yield D-xylolose-5-phosphate.","Xylose is present in foods like fruits and vegetables and other plants such as trees for wood and pulp production. Thus, xylose can be obtained in the extracts of such plants. Xylose can be obtained from various plant sources using known processes including acid hydrolysis followed by various types of chromatography. Examples of such methods to produce xylose include those described in Maurelli, L. et al. (2013), Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 170:1104-1118; Hooi H. T et al. (2013), Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 170:1602-1613; Zhang H-J. et al. (2014), Bioprocess Biosyst. Eng. 37:2425-2436.","Preferably, the metabolism of xylose and\/or the shift in microbiota due to the metabolism of the xylose provided in a pharmaceutical composition of the invention confers a benefit to a host, e.g. immunological tolerance. For example, in aspects in which the patient is at risk or suffering from GVHD, the immunological tolerance may reduce graft-versus-host activity while maintaining graft-versus-leukemia activity. In another example, in aspects in which the patient suffers from Celiac disease, the immunological tolerance prevents an inappropriate immune response to gluten. The xylose may be, e.g. i) cytotoxic for an autoimmune disease- and\/or inflammatory disease-associated associated pathogen or pathobiont, ii) cytostatic for an autoimmune disease- and\/or inflammatory disease-associated pathogen or pathobiont, iii) capable of decreasing the growth of autoimmune disease- and\/or inflammatory disease-associated pathogen or pathobiont, iv) capable of inhibiting the growth of an autoimmune disease- and\/or inflammatory disease-associated pathogen or pathobiont, v) capable of decreasing the colonization of an autoimmune disease- and\/or inflammatory disease-associated pathogen or pathobiont, vi) capable of inhibiting the colonization of an autoimmune disease- and\/or inflammatory disease-associated pathogen or pathobiont, vii) capable of eliciting an immunomodulatory response in the host that reduces the risk of an autoimmune and\/or inflammatory disorder, viii), capable of eliciting an immunomodulatory response in the host that reduces the severity of an autoimmune and\/or inflammatory disorder, ix) capable of promoting barrier integrity directly or indirectly through its impact on microbiota, or x) any combination of i)-ix).","In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form comprises a bacterial population and xylose in an amount effective to promote the growth of select bacteria of the family Clostridiacea, including members of the genus , or or relatives thereof in a host. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form is further effective to promote the proliferation of select bacteria of the family Clostridiacea, including members of the genus , or or relatives thereof in a host. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form comprises a bacterial population and xylose in an amount effective to promote the colonization and\/or engraftment of select bacteria of the family Clostridiacea, including members of the genus , or or relatives thereof in a host. In preferred embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form is further capable of altering a dysbiotic state such that the growth, proliferation, colonization, and\/or engraftment of a host by a pathogen, pathobiont, disease-associated microbe, or a combination thereof such that the population of at least one pathogen, pathobiont, or disease-associated microbe is decreased 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 50-fold, 100-fold, 200-fold, 500-fold, 1000-fold, 10000-fold, or over 10000-fold. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form is capable of locally or systemically eliminating at least one pathogen, pathobiont, or disease-associated microbe from a host.","In some embodiments, the prebiotic comprises a carbohydrate monomer or polymer that has been modified i.e., substituted with other substituents (e.g., acetyl group, glucuronic acid residue, arabinose residue, or the like) (see US Patent Application 20090148573, hereby incorporated by reference). The term \u201cmodified\u201d, as used herein, refers to a molecule modified from a reference molecule, and includes not only artificially produced molecules but also naturally occurring molecules. In preferred embodiments, the modification occurs at one or more hydroxyl groups of the reference carbohydrate. In some embodiments, the modification occurs at carbon-2 (C2), the modification occurs at carbon-6 (C6), or a combination thereof.","In some embodiments, a carbohydrate (a monomer or, preferably, a polymer) is modified with one or more hydrophilic groups. Nonlimiting examples of the hydrophilic groups include an acetyl group, a 4-O-methyl-\u03b1-D-glucuronic acid residue, an L-arabinofuranose residue, an L-arabinose residue, and an a-D-glucuronic acid residue. In some embodiments, the modification is the replacement of one or more hydroxyl groups with \u2014H, \u2014CHOH, \u2014CH, or \u2014NH.","In some embodiments, the composition comprises at least one carbohydrate that elicits an immunomodulatory response. Exemplary immunomodulary carbohydrates include (but are not limited to) fructo-oligosaccharides, glycosaminoglycans (e.g., heparin sulfate, chondroitin sulfate A, hyaluronan), 0-glycans, and carrageenan oligosaccharides, and galacto-oligosaccharides. Immunomodulatory carbohydrates may be purified from plants or microbes or may be synthetically derived. Immunomodulatory carbohydrates may be effective to, for example, prevent disease, suppress symptoms, treat disease, or any combination thereof.","In some embodiments, immunomodulatory carbohydrates are C-type lectin receptor ligands. In preferred embodiments, the C-type lectin receptor ligands are produced by one or more fungal species. In other embodiments, the immunomodulatory carbohydrates are bacterial exopolysaccharides, such as (but not limited to) the exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by , or . In some aspects, immunomodulatory carbohydrates are zwitterionic polysaccharides. In some aspects, immunomodulatory carbohydrates modulate toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and\/or toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) responses in a host. For example, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases characterized by intestinal inflammation may be prevented by a TLR4 agonist such as but not limited to EPS (see, e.g., Jones et al. (2014) J. IMMUNOL. 192: 4813-4820). Immunomodulatory carbohydrates may also activate CD4+ T cells and\/or lead to an upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (Mazmanian and Kasper (2006) NAT. REV. IMMUNOL. 6: 849-858). Immunomodulatory carbohydrates may be selected for administration to a patient based on the presence, abundance, distribution, modification and\/or linkages of sugar residues. For example, immunomodulatory carbohydrates used in the prevention of intestinal disorders or autoimmune conditions that manifest in the gut (non-limiting examples being IBD and GVHD) may be selected based on i) a high abundance of mannose residues; ii) the presence of terminal mannopyransosyl (t-Man) residues and\/or 2,6 linked mannopyranosyl residues (2,6-Man), iii) a ratio of mannose to glucose residues in the approximate range of 8:2 to 9:1, iv) the presence of galactose residues, v) areas of positive charge, or vi) a combination thereof.","Carbohydrates may be selected according to the fermentation or metabolic preferences of a microbe (e.g., an anti-inflammatory bacterial cell) selected for administration to a mammalian subject. Selection criteria include but are not limited to sugar complexity (e.g., monosaccharides, including but not limited to glucose, versus oligosaccharides or starches) as well as by desired end-product. Non-liming examples include the fermentation products ethanol and carbon dioxide (CO) (e.g., via ethanol fermentation by sp. sp.), lactate (e.g., via homolactic acid fermentation by sp., sp., sp., sp. and some species ), lactate, ethanol, and CO(e.g., via heterolactic acid fermentation (which includes the phosphoketolase pathway) by some species of as well as sp., sp., and sp.), butanol, acetone, COand H(via acetone-butanol fermentation by some sp.), and short chain fatty acids (with or without the production of other products) (see, e.g., Muller (2011) Bacterial Fermentation. Encyclopedia of Life Sciences). Examples of fermentation leading to short chain fatty acid production include homoacetic acid fermentation (e.g., by Acetobacterium sp., and resulting in acetate), propionic acid fermentation (e.g., by sp., and resulting in propionate, acetate and CO) mixed acid fermentation (e.g., by sp., and resulting in ethanol, lactate, acetate, succinate, formate, CO, and H), butyrate fermentation (e.g., by some sp., resulting in butyrate, CO, and H), and 2,3-butanediol fermentation (e.g., by sp., resulting in ethanol, butanediol, lactate, formate, CO, and H). In some embodiments, selection of carbohydrates for co-formulation of co-administration with a type of microbe or types of microbe may be achieved by computational analysis of microbial enzymatic pathways, including but not limited to the presence of metabolic\/fermentation pathway enzymes.","Other prebiotics include molecules capable of selective or semi-selective utilization by microbes (e.g., bacterial cells) of the compositions contained herein. The ability of a microbe to utilize a metabolite of interest is determined by the genomic capacity of that microbe. Public databases have characterized many microbes and automate the annotation of the genome to allow a computational analysis of the metabolites a microbe is potentially able to utilize. Databases such as the Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COGs) database characterize genomes from a variety of species in this manner and are capable of characterizing newly sequenced genomes as well (e.g. see in this fashion (Tatusov et al. (2000) NUCL. ACID RES. 28(1): 33-36). Furthermore, pathway analysis classifies COGs into different categories with associated one letter codes including J, translation; L replication, recombination, and repair, K transcription; 0 molecular chaperones and related functions, M, cell wall structure and biogenesis and outer membrane, N secretion motility and chemotaxis; T signal Transduction; P inorganic ion transport and metabolism; C energy production and conversion; G, carbohydrate metabolism and transport; E amino acid metabolism and transport; F, nueclotide metabolism and transport; D cell Division and chromosome partitioning; R general functional prediction. In preferred embodiments, COGs of the categories, N, M, P, C, G, E, and F are selected as preferred COGs to both provide enhanced growth on specific substrates and modified behaviors relevant for anti-tumor properties.","COGs are selected to be specific or semi enriched in the host or other microbes within a host by searching for specific functions present in the microbe of interest but absent from a large set of other competition organisms. Tissue specific analysis of the host for enzymes expressed within a tissue is performed to identify tissue specific enzymatic activities in the host. Specific functions are absent from at least 90%, at least 80%, at least 70%, at least 60%, at least 50%, at least 40%, at least 30% at least 20% or at least 10% of the other organisms selected from the group of the host, the host tissue, the disease-associated microbiota, the host gut microbiota, the host niche specific to the engraftment of the microbial composition (e.g., GI tract, skin).","Once these COGs are identified, databases like KEGG are used to link the enzymatic functions to identify the metabolites that are substrates for these selective COGs. Furthermore, the selective analysis to generate selective metabolites is repeated on the set of substrate of COGs to validate that the pathways and metabolites are selective to the desired microbial composition.","Methods of the Invention","In one aspect, the invention provides methods for modulating an immune response in a subject in need thereof, the method comprising administering a pharmaceutical composition of the invention to thereby modulate the immune response in the subject.

microbes described herein may additively or synergistically reduce the number of types of autoimmune disease- or inflammatory disease-associated pathogens or pathobionts either distally\u2014e.g., orally-administered microbes reduce the total microbial burden in an organ not in the gastrointestinal tract, or intravaginally-administered microbes reduce the total microbial burden in an organ that is not the vagina\u2014or locally, e.g., the intestines or vagina, respectively. Distal sites include but are not limited to the liver, spleen, fallopian tubes and uterus.","Similarly, the microbes described herein may additively or synergistically elicit an immunomodulatory response either distally, e.g., in which enteral administration of microbes results in altering the immune response at the skin or liver, or locally, e.g., the enteral administration of microbes results in altering the immune response in the intestines.","In some situations, the recipient subject is immunocompromised or immunosuppressed, or is at risk of developing an immune or inflammatory disorder.","In embodiments, the microbial composition is administered enterically, with or without prebiotics. This preferentially includes oral administration, or by an oral or nasal tube (including nasogastric, nasojejunal, oral gastric, or oral jejunal). In other embodiments, administration includes rectal administration (including enema, suppository, or colonoscopy). The pharmaceutical composition may be administered to at least one region of the gastrointestinal tract, including the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and rectum. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is administered to all regions of the gastrointestinal tract. The pharmaceutical compositions may be administered orally in the form of medicaments such as powders, capsules, tablets, gels or liquids. The pharmaceutical compositions may also be administered in gel or liquid form by the oral route or through a nasogastric tube, or by the rectal route in a gel or liquid form, by enema or instillation through a colonoscope or by a suppository. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention is administered enterically with one ore more prebiotics.","If the composition is administered colonoscopically and, optionally, if the microbial composition, with or without one or more prebiotics, is administered by other rectal routes (such as an enema or suppository) or even if the subject has an oral administration, the subject may have a colonic-cleansing preparation. The colon-cleansing preparation can facilitate proper use of the colonoscope or other administration devices, but even when it does not serve a mechanical purpose it can also maximize the proportion of bacteria from the pharmaceutical composition relative to the other organisms previously residing in the gastrointestinal tract of the subject. Any ordinarily acceptable colonic-cleansing preparation may be used such as those typically provided when a subject undergoes a colonoscopy.","Pretreatment Protocols. Prior to administration of the pharmaceutical composition, with or without one or more prebiotics, the subject can optionally have a pretreatment protocol to prepare the gastrointestinal tract or vagina to receive the pharmaceutical composition. In these instances, the pretreatment protocol can enhance the ability of the pharmaceutical composition to affect the patient's microbiome.","As one way of preparing the patient for administration of the microbial ecosystem, at least one antibiotic can be administered to alter the bacteria in the patient. As another way of preparing the patient for administration of the microbial ecosystem, a standard colon-cleansing preparation can be administered to the patient to substantially empty the contents of the colon, such as used to prepare a patient for a colonscopy. By \u201csubstantially emptying the contents of the colon,\u201d this application means removing at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or about 100% of the contents of the ordinary volume of colon contents. Antibiotic treatment can precede the colon-cleansing protocol.","If a patient has received an antibiotic for treatment of an infection, or if a patient has received an antibiotic as part of a specific pretreatment protocol, in one embodiment, the antibiotic can be stopped in sufficient time to allow the antibiotic to be substantially reduced in concentration in the gut or vagina before the pharmaceutical composition is administered. In one embodiment, the antibiotic can be discontinued 1, 2, or 3 days before the administration of the pharmaceutical composition. In another embodiment, the antibiotic can be discontinued 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 antibiotic half-lives before administration of the pharmaceutical composition. In another embodiment, the antibiotic can be chosen so the bacterial constituents in the pharmaceutical composition have an MIC50 that is higher than the concentration of the antibiotic in the gut or vagina.","MIC50 of the bacterial constituents in the pharmaceutical composition can be determined by methods well known in the art (see, e.g., Reller et al. (2009) CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES 49(11):1749-1755). In such an embodiment, the additional time between antibiotic administration and administration of the pharmaceutical composition is not necessary. If the pretreatment protocol is part of treatment of an acute infection, the antibiotic can be chosen so that the infection is sensitive to the antibiotic, but the bacterial constituents in the pharmaceutical composition are not sensitive to the antibiotic.","Routes of Administration. Compositions can be administered by any route suitable for the delivery of disclosed compositions for treating, inhibiting, or preventing a dysbiosis, or an diseases and disorders associated with a dysbiosis, include, but are not limited to orally, sublingually, rectally, parentally (e.g., intravenous injection (i.v.), intracranial injection (i.e.); intramuscular injection (i.m.), intraperitoneal injection (i.p.), and subcutaneous injection (s.c.) and intraosseous infusion (i.o.)), transdermally, extracorporeally, inhalation, topically or the like, including topical intranasal administration or administration by inhalant.","In some embodiments, the subject is fed a meal within one hour of administration of the pharmaceutical composition. In another embodiment, the subject is fed a meal concurrently with administration of the pharmaceutical composition.","In some embodiments, the therapeutic composition is administered at intervals greater than two days, such as once every three, four, five or six days, or every week or less frequently than every week. In other embodiments, the preparation is administered intermittently according to a set schedule, e.g., once a day, once weekly, or once monthly, or when the subject relapses from the primary illness.","In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is administered enterically. This preferentially includes oral administration, or by an oral or nasal tube (including nasogastric, nasojejunal, oral gastric, or oral jejunal). In other embodiments, administration includes rectal administration (including enema, suppository, or colonoscopy). The pharmaceutical composition can be administered to at least one region of the gastrointestinal tract, including the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and rectum. In some embodiments, it is administered to all regions of the gastrointestinal tract. The pharmaceutical compositions can be administered orally in the form of medicaments such as powders, capsules, tablets, gels or liquids. The bacterial compositions can also be administered in gel or liquid form by the oral route or through a nasogastric tube, or by the rectal route in a gel or liquid form, by enema or instillation through a colonoscope or by a suppository. In certain embodiments of the above invention, the microbial composition is administered enterically with one or more prebiotics.","If the composition is administered colonoscopically and, optionally, if the composition is administered by other rectal routes (such as an enema or suppository) or even if the subject has an oral administration, the subject can have a colon-cleansing preparation. The colon-cleansing preparation can facilitate proper use of the colonoscope or other administration devices, but even when it does not serve a mechanical purpose, it can also maximize the proportion of the bacterial cells in the pharmaceutical composition relative to the other organisms previously residing in the gastrointestinal tract of the subject. For example, the colon cleansing preparation may maximize the amount of bacterial entities of the bacterial composition that reach and\/or engraft in the gastrointestinal tract of the subject.","Dosages and Schedule for Administration. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are provided in a dosage form. In certain embodiments, the dosage form is designed for administration of at least one OTU or combinations thereof disclosed herein, wherein the total amount of pharmaceutical composition administered is selected from 0.1 ng to 10 g, 10 ng to 1 g, 100 ng to 0.1 g, 0.1 mg to 500 mg, 1 mg to 100 mg, or from 10-15 mg. In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is consumed at a rate of from 0.1 ng to 10 g a day, 10 ng to 1 g a day, 100 ng to 0.1 g a day, 0.1 mg to 500 mg a day, 1 mg to 100 mg a day, or from 10-15 mg a day, or more.","In certain embodiments, the treatment period is at least 1 day, at least 2 days, at least 3 days, at least 4 days, at least 5 days, at least 6 days, at least 1 week, at least 2 weeks, at least 3 weeks, at least 4 weeks, at least 1 month, at least 2 months, at least 3 months, at least 4 months, at least 5 months, at least 6 months, or at least 1 year. In some embodiments the treatment period is from 1 day to 1 week, from 1 week to 4 weeks, from 1 month, to 3 months, from 3 months to 6 months, from 6 months to 1 year, or for over a year.","In one embodiment, between about 10and about 10CFUs total can be administered to the patient in a given dosage form. In another embodiment, an effective amount can be provided in from 1 to 500 ml or from 1 to 500 grams of the pharmaceutical composition having from 10to 10bacteria per ml or per gram, or, for example, a capsule, tablet or suppository may contain from 1 mg to 1000 mg lyophilized powder having from 10to 10CFUs. Those receiving acute treatment can receive higher doses than those who are receiving chronic administration (such as hospital workers or those admitted into long-term care facilities).","Any of the pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be administered once on a single occasion or on multiple occasions, such as once a day for several days or more than once a day on the day of administration (including twice daily, three times daily, or up to five times daily). In another embodiment, the preparation can be administered intermittently according to a set schedule, e.g., once weekly, once monthly, or when the patient relapses from the primary illness.","Combination Therapy. The pharmaceutical compositions, with or without one or more prebiotics, can be administered with other agents in a combination therapy mode, including anti-microbial agents. Administration can be sequential, over a period of hours or days, or simultaneous.","In one embodiment, the microbial compositions, with or without one or more prebiotics, are included in combination therapy with one or more anti-microbial agents, which include anti-bacterial agents, anti-fungal agents, anti-viral agents and anti-parasitic agents.","Anti-bacterial agents can include cephalosporin antibiotics (cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefadroxil, cefazolin, cephalothin, cefaclor, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefprozil, and ceftobiprole); fluoroquinolone antibiotics (cipro, levaquin, floxin, tequin, avelox, and norflox); tetracycline antibiotics (tetracycline, minocycline, oxytetracycline, and doxycycline); penicillin antibiotics (amoxicillin, ampicillin, penicillin V, dicloxacillin, carbenicillin, vancomycin, and methicillin); and carbapenem antibiotics (ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem\/cilastatin, and meropenem).","Anti-viral agents can include Abacavir, Acyclovir, Adefovir, Amprenavir, Atazanavir, Cidofovir, Darunavir, Delavirdine, Didanosine, Docosanol, Efavirenz, Elvitegravir, Emtricitabine, Enfuvirtide, Etravirine, Famciclovir, Foscarnet, Fomivirsen, Ganciclovir, Indinavir, Idoxuridine, Lamivudine, Lopinavir Maraviroc, MK-2048, Nelfinavir, Nevirapine, Penciclovir, Raltegravir, Rilpivirine, Ritonavir, Saquinavir, Stavudine, Tenofovir Trifluridine, Valaciclovir, Valganciclovir, Vidarabine, Ibacitabine, Amantadine, Oseltamivir, Rimantidine, Tipranavir, Zalcitabine, Zanamivir and Zidovudine.","Anti-fungal agents include, but are not limited, to polyene antifungals such as natamycin, rimocidin, filipin, nystatin, amphotericin B, candicin, and hamycin; imidazole antifungals such as miconazole, ketoconazole, clotrimazole, econazole, omoconazole, bifonazole, butoconazole, fenticonazole, isoconazole, oxiconazole, sertaconazole, sulconazole, and tioconazole; triazole antifungals such as fluconazole, itraconazole, isavuconazole, ravuconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, terconazole, and albaconazole; thiazole antifungals such as abafungin; allylamine antifungals such as terbinafine, naftifine, and butenafine; and echinocandin antifungals such as anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin. Other compounds that have antifungal properties include, but are not limited to polygodial, benzoic acid, ciclopirox, tolnaftate, undecylenic acid, flucytosine or 5-fluorocytosine, griseofulvin, and haloprogin.","In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered in combination with one or more corticosteroids, mesalazine, mesalamine, sulfasalazine, sulfasalazine derivatives, immunosuppressive drugs, cyclosporin A, mercaptopurine, azathiopurine, prednisone, methotrexate, antihistamines, glucocorticoids, epinephrine, theophylline, cromolyn sodium, anti-leukotrienes, anti-cholinergic drugs for rhinitis, anti-cholinergic decongestants, mast-cell stabilizers, monoclonal anti-IgE antibodies, vaccines, and combinations thereof.","The pharmaceutical compositions described herein have beneficial effects for the subject locally, at the site of administration (e.g., in the gastrointestinal tract for compositions administered orally, or in the vagina for compositions administered vaginally), as previously described. Surprisingly, the pharmaceutical compositions described herein may also be used to correct or prevent a dysbiosis at a site distal to the site of administration, intended engraftment, or intended colonization of a composition, e.g., a probiotic composition, of the invention. For example, if a probiotic composition is administered vaginally, a distal effect of the composition would occur outside the vagina. Similarly, if a probiotic composition is administered to the skin, e.g., through a skin patch, transdermal lotion, etc., a distal effect of the composition would occur in a niche other than the skin. If a probiotic composition is administered to the lungs, e.g., in an inhalable formulation, a distal effect of the composition would occur outside the lungs. If a probiotic composition is administered to the ear, eye, nose, etc., a distal effect of the composition would occur at a site other than the site of administration, engraftment, or colonization of the composition (i.e., distal to the ear, distal to the eye, distal to the nose, etc.).","Distal sites include but are not limited to the liver, spleen, fallopian tubes and uterus. Other distal sites include skin, blood and lymph nodes. In other embodiments, the distal site is placenta, spleen, liver, uterus, blood, eyes, ears, lungs, liver, pancreas, brain, embryonic sac, or vagina. In another embodiment, the distal site is vagina, skin, lungs, brain, nose, ear, eyes\/conjunctiva, mouth, circulatory system, e.g., blood, placenta, reproductive tract, cardiovascular system, and\/or nervous system. A probiotic composition may have an effect on the microbiota of more than one distal site in a subject. For example, in some embodiments, a probiotic composition modulates the microbiota of one or more sites distal to the site of administration, engraftment, or colonization, e.g., one or more of placenta, spleen, liver, uterus, blood, eyes, ears, lungs, liver, pancreas, brain, embryonic sac, vagina, skin, brain, nose, mouth, reproductive tract, cardiovascular system, and\/or nervous system. In preferred embodiments, the probiotic composition contains a immunomodulatory bacteria, e.g., a anti-inflammatory bacteria.","Without wishing to be bound by theory, the probiotic compositions of the invention may impact sites distal sites in several ways.","Pharmaceutical compositions described herein can correct or treat a distal dysbiosis by correcting the imbalance in microbial diversity that is present at the distal site. Bacteria contained in the pharmaceutical composition can correct the distal dysbiosis directly, by translocating to the distal site. Bacteria contained in the pharmaceutical composition can also correct the distal dysbiosis indirectly, by promoting translocation of other gut commensals to the distal site, or by modifying the microenvironment of the distal site to create conditions that restore a healthy microbiome, e.g., by reducing inflammation.","A distal dysbiosis includes disruptions in the normal diversity and\/or function of the microbial network in a subject at a site other than the gastrointestinal tract, which is generally the site of administration of probiotics provided orally. In cases where a probiotic composition is administered vaginally to a subject, a distal dysbiosis can include disruptions in the normal diversity and\/or function of the microbial network in a subject at a site other than the vagina.","In order to characterize a distal dysbiosis, provided are methods of detecting, quantifying and characterizing 16S, 18S and ITS signatures in immune organs, such as the lymph nodes, spleen, etc. Moreover, provided are methods of detecting bacterial and fungal components typically associated with one microbiota in a distal site, often associating (in a physiological or pathological manner) with the microbiota of that distal site. For example, bacteria normally detected in the GI tract or vagina are detected in distal sites, for example, the blood.","In one embodiment, a bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition engrafts in the gastrointestinal tract of a subject, and translocates to a distal site, thereby augmenting the bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition at the distal site. In one embodiment, the bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition is not detectably present at the distal site prior to administration of the pharmaceutical composition.","In another embodiment, a bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition is augmented in the gastrointestinal tract of a subject without engraftment, and translocates to a distal site, thereby augmenting the bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition at the distal site. In one embodiment, the bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition is not detectably present at the distal site prior to administration of the pharmaceutical composition.","In another embodiment, a bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition modulates the microenvironment of the gut, augmenting a second bacterial strain present within the gut microbiota. The second bacterial strain augmented in the gut translocates to a distal site, thereby augmenting the second bacterial strain at the distal site. In embodiments, the second bacterial strain is not present in the pharmaceutical composition. In some embodiments, the bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition is an immunomodulatory bacteria, e.g., an anti-inflammatory bacteria. Modulation of the microenvironment of the gut may include, for example, alteration of cytokines secreted by host cells in and around the gut, reducing inflammation in the gut, increasing secretion of short chain fatty acids in the gut, or altering the proportion of immune cell subpopulations in the gut, each of which impacts the gut microbiome. Modulation of the microenvironment of the gut can include increasing or decreasing overall microbial diversity.","In another embodiment, a bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition modulates the microenvironment at a distal site in a subject, thereby augmenting a second bacterial strain at the distal site. In embodiments, the second bacterial strain is not present in the pharmaceutical composition. In some embodiments, the bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition is an immunomodulatory bacteria, e.g., an anti-inflammatory bacteria. Immunomodulatory bacteria can modulate the microenvironment at a distal site in a subject by, for example, reducing systemic inflammation. This can be achieved by altering the profile of cytokine expression by immune cells which circulate throughout the body, or altering the proportion of immune cell subpopulations which circulate throughout the body. Bacterial strains present in the pharmaceutical composition can also modulate intestinal permeability, e.g., by secretion of short chain fatty acids, which impacts the microenvironment of distal sites. In addition or alternatively, bacterial strains present in the pharmaceutical composition can increase or decrease overall microbial diversity.","Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions described herein may additively or synergistically elicit an immunomodulatory response either distally, e.g., in which enteral administration of microbes results in altering the immune response at a site outside the gastrointestinal tract such as the skin or liver, or locally, e.g. the enteral administration of microbes results in altering the immune response in the gastrointestinal tract, e.g., in the intestines.","The immune system of a subject and the microbiome of the subject are closely linked, and interact systemically. Disruptions to the microbiome, both in the gastrointestinal tract and at distal sites, can have profound effects throughout the body of the subject. In particular, disruptions to the microbiome increase systemic inflammation and intestinal barrier dysfunction in a subject. Increased inflammation and intestinal barrier dysfunction negatively impact the health of the subject in many ways, by contributing to a wide range of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions distal to the gastrointestinal tract. Conversely, increased inflammation in a subject leads to disruptions in the subject's microbiome, and disruptions to the microbiome lead in turn to further increases in inflammation. Administration of a pharmaceutical composition containing immunomodulatory bacteria can reduce inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and restore intestinal barrier integrity, resulting in a reduction in inflammation at sites distal to the gastrointestinal tract, and improvement in the symptoms of autoimmune or inflammatory disorders associated with systemic inflammation. Administration of a pharmaceutical composition containing bacterial strains that secrete short chain fatty acids are also capable of reducing inflammation restoring intestinal barrier integrity.","The pharmaceutical compositions and methods described herein can prevent or treat the loss or reduction of barrier function recognized to occur during dysbiosis or in the shift in one or more microbiotal populations that give rise to the dysbiosis. The loss of barrier function results in systemic seeding of bacterial populations resulting in dysbiotic activity, and in some events, the loss of barrier function results in a local reseeding of the bacterial populations. In both situations, the resulting immune activation leads to pathogenic inflammatory and immune responses. In response, provided are compositions that are capable of restoring barrier function, restoring the normal microbiotal components, and reducing (e.g., suppressing) immune\/inflammatory response. In some compositions, provided are antibiotic agents that remove the existing microflora in a target niche, while newly administered or recruited bacteria populate (or re-populate) the target niche. Co-administration or co-formulation with a carbohydrate may synergistically affect this population\/repopulation technique.","Disorders associated with a dysbiosis, i.e., a gastrointestinal dysbiosis or a distal dysbiosis, which increases systemic inflammation and\/or reduces intestinal barrier integrity include, for example, autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, Crohn's Disease, vaginal dysbiosis, and transplant disorders such as graft-versus-host disease. These disorders can be treated by administration (e.g., oral administration) of pharmaceutical compositions containing immunomodulatory (e.g., anti-inflammatory) bacterial strains.","The pharmaceutical compositions described herein may additively or synergistically reduce the number of types of autoimmune disease- or inflammatory disease-associated pathogens or pathobionts either distally\u2014e.g., orally-administered microbes reduce the total microbial burden in an organ not in the gastrointestinal tract, or intravaginally-administered microbes reduce the total microbial burden in an organ that is not the vagina\u2014or locally, e.g., the intestines or vagina, respectively.","Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides a method of reducing inflammation in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a probiotic composition comprising an isolated, anti-inflammatory bacterial population, such that inflammation in the subject is reduced. A systemic reduction in inflammation can modulate the microbiome of niches distal to the site of administration, intended engraftment, or intended colonization of the bacterial population. The probiotic composition can contain an excipient useful for formulation as a pharmaceutical composition. In instances where the bacterial population includes anaerobic bacteria, the excipient can, in one embodiment, reduce exposure of the bacterial population to oxygen.","In a preferred embodiment, administration of the probiotic composition can reduce inflammation at a site distal to the site of administration, engraftment, or colonization, such as, for example, vagina, skin, lungs, brain, nose, ear, eyes\/conjunctiva, mouth, circulatory system, e.g., blood, placenta, embryonic sac, reproductive tract, cardiovascular system, and\/or nervous system. In one embodiment, administration of the probiotic composition can reduce inflammation at a site selected from blood, skin, vagina, liver, spleen, fallopian tubes, uterus, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, administration of the probiotic composition modulates the microbiome at a distal site.","The anti-inflammatory bacterial population can induce a decrease in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and\/or an increase in secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines by host cells. The anti-inflammatory properties of the bacterial population can be determined by methods described herein or known in the art, for example, by measuring alterations in cytokine secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to the bacterial population. Anti-inflammatory bacteria can be selected for inclusion in the probiotic formulation based on modulation of particular cytokines of interest. For example, anti-inflammatory bacteria can be selected based on the ability to decrease secretion of one or more pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., IFN\u03b3, IL-12p70, IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, MCP1, MIP1\u03b1, MIP1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, and combinations thereof, and\/or the ability to increase secretion of one or more anti-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., IL-10, IL-13, IL-4, IL-5, TGF\u03b2, and combinations thereof.","In another aspect, the invention provides methods of treating or preventing a distal dysbiosis in a subject, by administering to the subject a probiotic composition comprising an isolated bacterial population in an amount sufficient to alter the microbiome at a site distal to the site of administration, engraftment, or colonization of the bacterial population, such that the distal dysbiosis is treated. For example, administration of the probiotic composition may modulate a first microbiome at the site of administration, engraftment or colonization of the bacterial population, causing subsequent modulation of a second microbiome at a site that is distinct from the first microbiome, e.g., a distal site.","In one embodiment, the invention provides methods of treating or preventing a distal dysbiosis, by orally administering a probiotic composition which alters the microbiome at a site distal to the gastrointestinal tract.","In another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating or preventing a disorder associated with a distal dysbiosis in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to the subject a probiotic composition comprising an isolated bacterial population in an amount sufficient to alter the microbiome at a site of the distal dysbiosis, such that the disorder associated with the distal dysbiosis is treated. Disorders associated with distal dysbiosis, including disruptions to the systemic microbiome, are described herein and include, for example, autoimmune or inflammatory disorders such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulterative colitis, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type I diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, and Celiac disease; transplant disorders such as graft-versus-host disease; and vaginal dysbiosis. In one embodiment, the disorder associated with distal dysbiosis occurs in the respiratory tract (e.g., lung), including but not limited to Cystic Fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).","In one embodiment, the probiotic composition contains a species of bacteria that is deficient at the site of the distal dysbiosis. Administration of the probiotic composition can increase the quantity of the deficient species in the distal microbiome. In one embodiment, the deficient species is not detectably present at the site of the distal dysbiosis prior to administration of the probiotic composition. In one embodiment, the species of bacteria in the probiotic composition translocates to the site of the distal dysbiosis.","In another embodiment, the probiotic composition results in augmentation of a species of bacteria not present in the probiotic composition at a distal site. This augmentation can result from, for example, translocation of a species of bacteria not present in the probiotic composition to the distal site, and\/or modulation of the microenvironment of the distal site in a manner that alters the microbiome.","In preferred embodiments, the probiotic composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria, e.g., anti-inflammatory bacteria.","In another aspect, the invention provides a method of reducing intestinal permeability in a subject, by administering a probiotic composition comprising an isolated bacterial population, wherein administration of the probiotic composition augments a species of bacteria that produces short chain fatty acids, such that the intestinal permeability of the subject is reduced. In other embodiments, intestinal permeability and disorders associated therewith is improved by administering a probiotic composition containing mucin-containing bacteria, and\/or anti-inflammatory bacteria.","Pharmaceutical compositions useful for correcting or treating a distal dysbiosis, or for treating a disorder distal to the site of administration (e.g., the gastrointestinal tract) associated with a dysbiosis, can include any of the pharmaceutical compositions described herein. In exemplary embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition useful for correcting or treating a distal dysbiosis includes one or more bacterial strains from Table 1.

In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition contains or is administered in conjunction with a prebiotic, as described herein.","Exemplary pharmaceutical compositions useful for treatment of disorders associated with a dysbiosis distal to the site of administration (e.g., the gastrointestinal tract) contain bacterial strains capable of reducing inflammation in a subject. As described herein, such immunomodulatory (anti-inflammatory) bacteria can modulate cytokine expression by host immune cells, resulting in an overall increase in secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines and\/or an overall decrease in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, systemically reducing inflammation in the subject. In exemplary embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions useful for treatment of disorders associated with a distal dysbiosis stimulate secretion of one or more anti-inflammatory cytokines by host immune cells, such as PBMCs. Anti-inflammatory cytokines include, but are not limited to, IL-10, IL-13, IL-9, IL-4, IL-5, TGF\u03b2, and combinations thereof.

Pharmaceutical compositions containing anti-inflammatory bacteria reduce inflammation at the site of administration, e.g., in the gastrointestinal tract, as well as at distal sites throughout the body of the subject.","Other exemplary pharmaceutical compositions useful for treatment of disorders associated with a dysbiosis distal to the site of administration (e.g., the gastrointestinal tract) contain bacterial strains capable of altering the proportion of immune subpopulations, e.g., T cell subpopulations, in the subject.","For example, immunomodulatory bacteria can increase or decrease the proportion of Treg cells, Th17 cells, Th1 cells, or Th2 cells in a subject. The increase or decrease in the proportion of immune cell subpopulations may be systemic, or it may be localized to a site of action of the pharmaceutical, e.g., in the gastrointestinal tract or at the site of a distal dysbiosis. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition comprising immunomodulatory bacteria is used for treatment of disorders associated with a dysbiosis distal to the site of administration (e.g., the gastrointestinal tract) based on the desired effect of the pharmaceutical composition on the differentiation and\/or expansion of subpopulations of immune cells in the subject.","In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that increase the proportion of Treg cells in a subject. In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that decrease the proportion of Treg cells in a subject. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that increase the proportion of Th17 cells in a subject. In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that decrease the proportion of Th17 cells in a subject. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that increase the proportion of Th1 cells in a subject. In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that decrease the proportion of Th1 cells in a subject. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that increase the proportion of Th2 cells in a subject. In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that decrease the proportion of Th2 cells in a subject.","In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria capable of modulating the proportion of one or more of Treg cells, Th17 cells, Th1 cells, and combinations thereof in a subject. Certain immune cell profiles may be particularly desirable to treat or prevent particular disorders associated with a dysbiosis. For example, treatment or prevention of autoimmune or inflammatory disorders can be promoted by increasing numbers of Treg cells and Th2 cells, and decreasing numbers of Th17 cells and Th1 cells. Accordingly, pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment or prevention of autoimmune or inflammatory disorders may contain pharmaceuticals capable of promoting Treg cells and Th2 cells, and reducing Th17 and Th1 cells.","Distal disorders associated with loss of intestinal barrier function can be treated or improved by administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing bacterial strains that produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as, for example, butyrate, acetate, propionate, or valerate, or combinations thereof. Distal disorders associated with loss of intestinal barrier function can be treated or improved by administration of probiotic compositions containing bacterial strains that reduce inflammation, as described herein.","In other embodiments, the distal dysbiosis is caused by a deficiency in microbes that produce lactic acid. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the probiotic composition can contain a species of bacteria that produce lactic acid.","The invention is further illustrated by the following examples.

The mucosa of the GI tract forms a selective barrier between the host and the environment of the gut lumen. The mucosa allows transport of nutrients while restricting passage of larger molecules and bacteria. Impaired barrier integrity is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of many disorders including autoimmune diseases, including transplant disorders such as graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), and neurological disorders. Disruption of the intestinal barrier due to toxins, dysbiosis, inflammation or other factors is believed to result in the passage and presentation of environmental antigens to the immune system leading to aberrant immune responses. Similarly, the leakage of bacterial endotoxin or other toxic metabolites into the circulation can lead to systemic inflammation promoting the development of autoimmunity and neuroinflammation.","Restoration of GI barrier integrity through the administration of selected prebiotics and\/or probiotics represents an approach to correct a basic defect underlying multiple pathological conditions.","In a first set of experiments, intestinal permeability was assessed using serum endotoxin levels as a marker of gut permeability in mice treated with xylose and\/or antibiotics. Basal levels of intestinal permeability can be measured under disease or normal conditions. Intestinal permeability can be induced in mice through administration of inflammatory stimuli such as cholera toxin (3 oral gavages of 10 \u03bcg cholera toxin, 5 days apart), Poly I:C (3 intraperioneal injections of 1 mg\/kg, 3 days apart) or dextran sulfate (3% dextran sulfate sodium salt in drinking water for 7 days). Quantitation of intestinal permeability was carried out by quantitatively measuring plasma levels of endotoxin originating from gut bacteria using a commercially available chromogenic assay (Lonza, Rockland, Me.). The results of these experiments are shown in .","Quantitation of intestinal permeability can also be conducted using a number of alternative methods (reviewed in Bischoff et al, 2014) for example, by quantifying leakage of fluorescently-labeled high molecular weight dextran (FITC-dextran) into the plasma following oral administration (oral gavage with 0.6 g\/kg 4 kDa FITC-dextran, serum samples collected 4 hours later and read for fluorescence intensity at 521 nm; Hsiao et al, 2013). To study the effect of bacterial strains on intestinal permeability, mice are gavaged orally with 10-10bacterial cells for an average of 5 administrations, typically daily or 2 days apart. Bacteria can be administred as single strains or combinations of strains. The bacteria can be administered alone or in combination with a pre-biotic(s). The pre-biotic can be xylose or xylose-containing molecules as a preferred carbon source for anaerobic bacteria. Other prebiotics that can be used include, for example, those described in Table 4. After administration of bacteria+\/\u2212pre-biotic, intestinal permability is assessed using the preferred method at the desired time point(s) starting on day 1 post-treatment.","As shown in , C57BL\/6 mice were either left untreated or were treated with xylose at 10 g\/L in drinking water from day \u22127 to day 14; ciprofloxacin (cipro) at 0.25 g\/L in drinking water from day \u22127 to day \u22122; enrofloxacin (enro) at 0.25 g\/L in drinking water from day \u22127 to day \u22122; xylose+cipro or xylose+enro. Analysis of serum samples collected on days 0 and 14 showed that basal levels of serum endotoxin are present in normal mice that remained unchanged in untreated mice. Xylose treatment reduced these basal levels over time, suggesting an increase in gut barrier integrity even in normal animals. Antibiotic treatment with cipro, a broad spectrum quinolone antibiotic, or enro, an anaerobe-sparing antibiotic, led to an increase in serum endotoxin levels (measured 2 days after a 5 day course), likely due to disruption of the microbiota. Serum endotoxin levels returned to baseline over time. As shown in , xylose appeared to counteract the increase in serum endotoxin level caused by cipro, but not enro. The differential effect of xylose on these 2 antibiotics may relate to its ability to preserve\/promote expansion of anaerobic bacteria, which are killed by cipro but not enro.","The microbiota of mammalian hosts is composed of bacterial species that possess both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties. In healthy individuals, a balance or state of eubiosis is maintained that supports gut barrier integrity, immune containment of commensal bacteria and promotion of a tolerogenic environment. Under disease conditions, dysbiosis characterized by an imbalance in pro- and anti-inflammatory bacteria results in local inflammation and compromised gut barrier integrity, leading to systemic inflammation and aberrant immune responses. Administration of selected probiotic bacterial strains (+\/\u2212prebiotics) that possess anti-inflammatory activity and promote immune tolerance represents an approach to correct a basic defect underlying multiple pathological conditions.","An in vitro system was developed to efficiently test the inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of different human commensal bacteria on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

As shown in , EPV3 has relatively low intrinsic inflammatory activity compared to EPV 8 and is able to reduce the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines by EPV 8, including IL-6, MCP-1, IL-12p70, and IFN\u03b3 which are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of GVHD. By comparison, EPV 5 is similar to EPV 8 in terms of induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and shows little ability to counteract the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines by EPV 8.","Additional bacteria were profiled using this methodology including: (EPV 6), (EPV15), ATCC 29174 (EPV 20), product ATCC 27340 (EPV 21), ATCC 29236 (EPV 22), ATCC BAA-2371 (EPV-23) and ATCC27752 (EPV 24).

As observed with the initial set of bacterial candidates, each isolate displayed a defined signature. Candidates for treatment of autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, such as GVHD, displayed low induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and\/or positive induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and had ability to counteract the inflammatory activity of . Bacterial candidates meeting these criteria include, for example, EPV 35, 51, 78 and 114.","Taken together, these results show that commensals have distinct immunomodulatory properties and display a definable signature in terms of their ability to induce cytokines in human host cells, or counteract the pro-inflammatory activity of another bacterium (). Accordingly, bacterial compositions may be selected in order to achieve a desired modulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. For example, anti-inflammatory bacterial strains may be selected based on their ability to reduce key pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon gamma, IL-12p70, IP-10 and IL-1RA and\/or increase anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-13, IL-10 and IL-4.","In order to determine whether exposure to commensal bacteria may polarize T cells toward a particular phenotype, flow cytometry analysis was performed on human PBMCs cultured with various commensal bacteria as described above. The cells recovered from culture were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and stained with a cocktail of fluorescently labeled antibodies against specific cell surface protein markers to allow for the detection of Th1 cells (CXCR3CCR6), Th2 cells (CXCR3CCR6), Th17 cells (CXCR3CCR6) and Tregs) (CD25CD127. Negative control wells contained PBMCs in culture medium alone and positive control wells contained PBMCs+LPS (100 ng\/ml) as a known immune stimulus. The commensal bacteria examined included: Epv 1; Epv 3; Epv 2; Epv 5; Epv. 8: ; Epv 20, ATCC 29174; Epv 21: B. product, ATCC 27340; Epv 24, ATCC 27752. As shown in , exposure of human PBMCs to bacteria did result in a shift in the relative proportion of T cell populations compared to the PBMCs alone (control) although statistical significance was not achieved in every case. Overall, most bacteria tested caused an increase in the proportion of T cells with a regulatory phenotype (Tregs) with EPV 21 and EPV 24 having the greatest impact and EPV8 () causing little or no increase in Tregs. Most bacteria also caused a decrease in the proportion of Th17 cells, an increase in Th2 cells and had little or no effect on the proportion of Th1 cells. This type of analysis indicates that commensal bacteria can modulate the proportions of effector T cell types and can be used to select the desired phenotype for a given disease application. For example, the optimal T cell profile to address pro-inflammatory disorders such as GVHD would consist of \u21d1Treg, \u21d3Th17, \u21d3 or unchanged Th1, and \u21d1Th2. This phenotype was induced by many of the bacteria tested.","Modulation of the microbiota to correct a dysbiosis associated with pathological conditions can potentially be achieved through administration of bacteria (or bacterial combinations) and prebiotic(s) as a carbon source to promote endogenous expansion of beneficial bacteria. Alternatively, prebiotics can be administered in combination with bacteria to promote their growth or create a favorable environment for their growth. Profiling of carbon source usage by bacterial isolates can be used to customize and optimize selection of prebiotics for particular bacterial strains. Profiling of carbon source usage was conducted on 21 anaerobic commensal bacteria (Table 3) using 96 well plates from Biolog (Hayward, Calif.) where each well contains a different carbon source for a total of 192 different carbon sources (PM01 and PM02A plates). The carbon sources tested are listed in Table 4. The assay was conducted according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, pre-cultured bacteria were suspended in Biolog assay medium at a 750 nm optical density (OD) of 0.3-0.4 and 100 \u03bcl of the suspension was transferred to each well of the 96 well PM01 and PM02 assay plates. The plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in an anaerobic chamber for 24 hr or longer. The amount of growth on each carbon source was evaluated by measuring the optical density (OD) of each well at 750 nm. The results are summarized in , and indicate that each individual strain displays a unique pattern of carbon source usage. Interestingly, different isolates of the same species (e.g. and ) show related (albeit distinct) patterns. Overall, these results indicate that characterization of carbon source usage for profiling of bacterial candidates allows optimal selection of prebiotics. Preferred prebiotics can be selected which increase the growth (indicated by an increase in optical density) of bacterial species contained in probiotic compositions.","D-xylose is a carbon source generally preferred by anaerobic bacteria. Preliminary results in the mouse indicate that it may act to promote gut barrier integrity (). It is also used as a carbon source by several bacterial strains () that were determined to possess a desirable immunological profile for target indications such as GVHD (). A parallel, double-blind, 5 cohort escalation food safety study was conducted to examine D-xylose in normal human volunteers. The study was a double-blind, single-center, parallel group study designed to evaluate the tolerability and potential microbiome changes induced by ingestion of D-xylose at 5 different amounts in healthy, adult volunteers enrolled at 1 study center in the United States (US).","Subjects were screened for eligibility within 21 days prior to the first planned ingestion of study sweetener on Day 1 (Baseline).

Stool was collected pre-ingestion and at pre-specified time points, and post-ingestion samples were evaluated for changes in the gut microbiome compared with Baseline for all subjects. For subjects who consented to further sampling, additional stool specimens were used to potentially isolate living bacteria that could be categorized for research and potential commercialization purposes. Serum and urine were collected for measurement of D-xylose levels and pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments and PK\/pharmacodynamics (PD) correlations. Telephone follow-up was conducted as needed, but minimally once per week. The total duration for each participant was up to 60 days, including the Screening period (Day \u221221 to 0), the ingestion period (Day 1 to 28), and an End-of-Study (EOS) follow-up visit conducted 7 (\u00b13) days after the last ingestion of study sweetener.","Criteria for Evaluation","Safety","Safety was evaluated on a continual basis through AE monitoring, clinical laboratory measurements, vital sign monitoring, physical examinations, ECGs, telephone follow-up, and electronic subject ingestion diaries.","Immunology and Other Assessments","Stool was collected at pre-specified pre- and post-ingestion time points and post-ingestion samples were evaluated for changes in the gut microbiome compared with Baseline.

GI-related events were mild for all but 1 subject in the 15 g TID D-xylose cohort who experienced moderate GI-related AEs of abdominal distension, diarrhea, and GI pain that required reduction of the D-xylose ingestion amount to 12.5 g TID.","Eleven subjects (22.9%) experienced at least 1 AE that was considered by the Investigator to be related to study sweetener, including 9 subjects (25.0%) in the D-xylose cohorts and 2 subjects (16.7%) in the Splenda\u00ae cohort. The incidence of sweetener-related AEs appeared to increase with increasing D-xylose ingestion amounts. Sweetener-related AEs reported for more than 1 subject in the D-xylose cohorts included diarrhea (3 subjects [8.3%]) and flatulence and GI pain (2 subjects [5.6%] each). Sweetener-related AEs reported in the Splenda\u00ae cohort were abdominal distension, flatulence, and infrequent bowel movements.","No fluctuations in clinical laboratory measurements over time were considered to be clinically meaningful. Categorical shifts from Baseline that occurred in >10% of subjects in either the combined D-xylose or Splenda\u00ae cohorts included decreased or increased glucose (27.7% D-xylose and 16.7% Splenda\u00ae) and decreased absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (13.9% and 8.3%); these shifts were not associated with sweetener type or ingestion amount.","Immunology and Other Assessments","To assess the effect of D-xylose on the gut microbiome, this study incorporated an analysis of alpha diversity, beta diversity, and differentially abundant taxa. These factors were assessed both across cohorts and over time. Regardless of sweetener ingestion amount, no apparent significant impact on the intra-sample alpha diversity of the gut microbiome was observed, and no significant changes in community composition were observed over time on study. Numerous taxa were identified as differentially abundant, but these findings may reflect the relatively small sample sizes in each cohort.","Across all D-xylose cohorts, 8.3% of subjects with normal serum CRP at Baseline experienced at least 1 post-ingestion CRP value >2.9 mg\/L. A substantially higher proportion of subjects in the Splenda\u00ae cohort (41.7%) had normal serum CRP at Baseline and experienced at least 1 post-ingestion CRP value >2.9 mg\/L. None of the post-ingestion CRP values for any subject were deemed clinically significant.","Because most individual cytokine data points were below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) and therefore set to zero, cytokine summary statistics were limited and did not indicate any consistent or clinically meaningful changes over time for either sweetener or any D-xylose ingestion amount. There was a trend for reduced levels of serum interferon gamma over time in the 2 g and 15 g D-xylose cohorts (). No consistent or clinically meaningful changes over time in total T-cells or any T-cell subsets were observed for either sweetener or any D-xylose ingestion amount.","Pharmacokinetics","Serum D-xylose concentrations increased linearly with increasing ingestion amounts. Little to no accumulation of serum D-xylose occurred at Day 15 following 1 g to 12.5 g TID ingestion, while an approximately 1.9-fold accumulation ratio was observed in the 15 mg TID cohort (although variability was high). On Day 28, the accumulation ratio ranged from 1.08 to 1.31 following 1 g to 12.5 g TID ingestion and 1.68 following 15 g TID ingestion, although variability was moderate to high in all but the 8 g TID cohort.","In the 1 g TID cohort, approximately 40% of the ingested amount of D-xylose was recovered in urine within 5 hours post-ingestion on Days 1, 15, and 28. In the 2 g through 15 g TID cohorts, between 23% and 32% of the ingested amount of D-xylose was recovered in urine within 5 hours post-ingestion on Days 1, 15, and 28. The fraction excreted in urine was similar among Days 1, 15, and 28.","A review of the time course of serum D-xylose concentrations and the corresponding urinary excretion profiles indicated high ingestion compliance.","Changes in the Gut Microbiome","A total of 344 stool samples were collected in OMNIgene\u25cfGUT collection kits and shipped to the GenoFIND laboratory for DNA extraction and V3-V4 16S amplicon sequencing. There were no major shifts in the microbiome alpha diversity between the different treatment groups (absolute number of OTUs, abundance of OTUs) or over time on study. There was an overall decrease in the Chao diversity index over time (indicator of community richness\u2014# of singleton, doubleton OTUs), as shown in . Numerous taxa were identified as differentially abundant, but this finding may be attributable to the relatively small sample sizes of each cohort. Similar observations were made in the mouse study, e.g., xylose treatment did not cause major shifts in the gut microbiome but showed some differences at the family level. Overall, these results suggest that, under the conditions tested in normal individuals and normal mice, ingestion of xylose exerts subtle changes in the gut microbiome. The impact of xylose on the microbiome under disease conditions remains to be determined.","Taken together, the results of this trial show that D-xylose is safe and well-tolerated, and indicate that prebiotic formulations containing xylose may reduce inflammation in a subject, resulting in reduction of serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.","The trillions of organisms forming the microbiome function as an organ system interconnected throughout the body. The possibility that modification of the microbiome in a given physical location may influence the microbiome at other sites in the body (distal augmentation) was investigated. Seven week old C57Bl\/6 female mice were acclimatized for 7 days prior to the start of the study by daily handling and shuffling between cages. All mice were housed at three mice per cage in individually vented cages (Thoren, Hazleton, Pa.). At day 0, baseline fresh fecal pellets, and vaginal lavages with 100 \u03bcL of sterile double-distilled water were collected and immediately frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. for microbiome analysis. After baseline collection, mice were given to drink either autoclaved water (N=6) or 0.5 mg\/L of the antibiotic vancomycin in autoclaved water (N=6) ad libitum. Water alone is not expected to influence the microbiome and acted as a negative control. Oral vancomycin is poorly absorbed from the gut and its ingestion does not result in significant levels of drug in the body (Rao et al, 2011). The impact of oral vancomycin is therefore expected to be limited to the gastrointestinal tract such that microbiome changes elsewhere in the body (e.g. vagina) would be attributable to distal augmentation. At day 6, fresh fecal pellets and vaginal lavages with 100 \u03bcL of sterile double-distilled water were collected and immediately stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. for microbiome analysis.","Isolation and sequencing of microbial DNA from the stool and vaginal samples was performed by DNA Genotek (Ottawa, ON, Canada). The V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal subunit was amplified with custom PCR primers and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq to a minimum acceptable read depth of 25,000 sequences per sample. The widely accepted read depth requirement for accurate taxonomic profiling is 15,000-100,000 reads (Illumina, 2014). A closed-reference taxonomic classification was performed, where each sequence was aligned to the SILVA reference database, version 123. Sequences were aligned using the UCLUST algorithm included in QIIME version 1.9.1 (Caporaso et al., 2010). A minimum threshold of 97% sequence identity was used to classify sequences according to representative sequences in the database. At 97% sequence identity, each OTU represents a genetically unique group of biological organisms. These OTU's were then assigned a curated taxonomic label based on the seven level SILVA taxonomy.","As expected, oral vancomycin treatment had a strong impact on the microbiome of the gut. As shown by principal component analysis (PCA) at the family level, the day 0 to day 6 pattern in fecal samples was clearly different in the control vs oral vancomycin group (). Interestingly, the day 0 to day 6 pattern in the vaginal samples also showed an overall difference between the PBS and oral vancomycin groups even though the vaginal environment is not exposed to vancomycin following oral administration of the antibiotic (). In addition, some bacterial species were detected at low frequency in vaginal samples of the vancomycin-treated group at day 6 (median abundance of approximately 0.00002%) that were not present at day 0 (Table 5). These results support the concept of distal augmentation whereby modification of the microbiome at one site also has an impact at a distal site(s). This finding opens the possibility of modulating the microbiome, for example at the level of the gut, to effect therapeutic changes in the microbiome at other sites, for example the lung.","The following work is done in the presence and absence (as a control) of one or more selected prebiotic carbohydrates. This assay may be used to test or confirm the ability of a prebiotic-bacterium pair to elicit an immunomodulatory response such that the production or release of proinflammatory cytokines decreases and\/or the production or release of anti-inflammatory cytokines increases, may be used to evaluate the difference in cytokine response in the presence or absence of a prebiotic mixture, and\/or may be used to evaluate an array of prebiotic candidates. Clostridales bacteria are obtained from the ATCC or purified from a human donor and cultured in brain-heart infusion broth at 37\u00b0 C. The bacteria are harvested by centrifugation (3000 g, 15 minutes) after 24 hours of stationary growth. To test the effects of spores on human intestinal cells and\/or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (huPBMC), bacteria are first heat killed (95\u00b0 C., 30 minutes) before the centrifugation step. Bacteria (or spores) are washed three times with lx PBS (pH 7.2, Gibco BRL) and subsequently diluted to obtain final cell densities of 10and 10colony forming units (cfu)\/ml in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco BRL).","Human enterocyte-like CaCO-2 cells (passage 60-65) are seeded at a density of 2.5\u00d710cells\/ml on 25 mm cell culture inserts (0.4 \u03bcm nucleopore size; Becton Dickinson). The inserts are placed into six well tissue culture plates (Nunc) and cultured 18-22 days at 37\u00b0 C.\/10% COin DMEM (glutamine, high glucose; Amimed) supplemented with 20% decomplemented fetal calf serum (56\u00b0 C., 30 minutes; Amimed), 1% MEM non-essential amino acids (Gibco BRL), 10 \u03bcm\/ml gentamycin (Gibco BRL), and 0.1% penicillin\/streptomycin (10 000 IU\/ml\/10 000 UG\/ml; Gibco BRL). The cell culture medium is changed every second day until the cells are fully differentiated. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) is determined continuously in confluent CaCO-2 monolayers using a MultiCell-ERS voltmeter\/ohmmeter or as described in Example 44.","Tissue culture inserts covered with CaCO-2 cell monolayers are washed twice with prewarmed RPMI 1640 medium and transferred to six well tissue culture plates. 2 mL culture medium is added to the apical and basolateral compartments of the transwell cell culture system.","Next, the apical surface of CaCO-2 monolayers is challenged by addition of 10or 10cfu\/ml of Clostridiales bacteria or spores, in the absence of gentamicin. After four hours, gentamicin is added (at 150 \u03bcg\/mL) to stop bacterial growth and metabolite secretion. CaCO-2 cells are stimulated with the bacteria or spores for 6-36 hours in a 37\u00b0 C., 10% COincubator. Then the CaCO-2 cells are collected, washed once with cold 1\u00d7PBS (pH 7.2), and lysed in denaturation solution for RNA extraction (Micro RNA Isolation Kit, Stratagene). Cellular lysates are stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. and cell culture supernatants are collected from the apical compartment and frozen at \u221220\u00b0 C. The immune response of CaCO-2 cells is monitored by analysis of cytokine gene transcription (TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, monocyte chemoattracting protein 1 (MCP-1), TGF-\u03b2, IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-10) using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique and determination of cytokine secretion in cell culture supernatants using an ELISA (Haller D, Bode C, Hammes W P, Pfeifer A M A, Schiffrin E J, Blum S, 2000.
