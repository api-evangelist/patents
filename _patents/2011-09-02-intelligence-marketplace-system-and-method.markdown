Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to enabling a multitude of participants to publish and subscribe to information artifacts that can be used to rapidly share intelligence data, trigger actions and generate income.","The information artifacts, in the following description called triggers, are designed in such a way that they can be easily created, updated, shared, analyzed and consumed by people as well as by computer-implemented systems.","In addition, the information artifacts can be easily combined, for example, in order to create further enriched information artifacts providing higher levels of insight or invoke predetermined actions once a predetermined set of conditions is fulfilled, thus providing additional value to subscribers with respective additional income potential for publishers.","The term participants shall include, but not be limited to, individuals, businesses and their respective delegates including information systems. A participant may publish one or more triggers, subscribe to one or more triggers, or both.","2. Background of the Invention","A steadily increasing, very large amount of mostly unstructured electronic content is being published worldwide. However, for consumers of such content, it is typically not easy to keep track of, combine, refine and apply such content in an effective way according to their respective needs. For providers of such information, it is typically not easy to effectively monetize their published information.","In addition, while it can be very important for a multitude of consumers to receive crucial information with as little delay as possible, for example for online stock traders, it is typically a significant challenge for providers to deliver such requested information with minimal delays, particularly to large audiences.","The invented system addresses the above-mentioned challenges as described in detail below. Additional objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art based on the following drawings and detailed description.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In the following description, the term electronic marketplace shall be referred to as marketplace.","Before being subscribed to, only a subset of a trigger's attributes are made visible to participants in the marketplace as described in more detail below. The invented marketplace and example operation thereof will also be described in detail below.","A trigger represents, for example, a latest status of a fact, a prediction, an insight, a piece of information or the like, such as \u201cThe growth domestic product of the United States of America will go up 1.7% in 2010\u201d. In the following description, this human readable composite of various pieces of information that are part of a trigger shall be described as \u201ctrigger statement\u201d. Of course, each piece of information that is part of a trigger may also be written and read directly or in any combination.","The present invention comprises, but is not limited to, the following three types of triggers: 1) predictive triggers, 2) reporting triggers and 3) celebrity triggers. The common features as well as the differences between the disclosed trigger types are described in detail below.","Now referring to , trigger  optionally contains a title , for example, to brand it and make it easily distinguishable for participants in the marketplace.","In addition, trigger  contains a symbol , for example \u201cGDPUS\u201d. Symbol  is a unique identifier that can be used to unambiguously identify trigger  at least within a trigger system.","Type  indicates the trigger type of trigger , typically either predictive, reporting or celebrity,","A reporting trigger indicates a fact, measurement, status or piece of information, such as \u201cThe current temperature in New York City is 75 degree Fahrenheit\u201d.","A predictive triggers indicates a prediction, such as the above example \u201cThe growth domestic product of the United States of America will go up 1.7% in 2010\u201d.","A celebrity trigger can feature a reporting or predictive trigger statement in order to allow expressing, for example, an opinion, insight, prediction, a fact, a feeling and the like.","Source  indicates who owns or controls trigger  and can relate, for example, to a person, business entity, device, animal, plant or a composition or group thereof. Typically, a trigger source is a participant in a trigger system.","Designation  indicates the key subject that the trigger relates to, such as \u201cThe growth domestic product of the USA\u201d, \u201cThe current temperature in New York City\u201d and the like.","Action  indicates the key action or status that the trigger  expresses, such as \u201cwill go up\u201d, or \u201cis\u201d. A set of default key actions disclosed as part of the present invention is described in more detail below.","Value  indicates a quantitative or qualitative part of the trigger statement of trigger , such as \u201c1.7\u201d or \u201c75\u201d or \u201csignificantly\u201d.","Unit  indicates what unit of measurement value  is related to, for example \u201cDegree Fahrenheit\u201d, \u201c$\u201d or \u201c%\u201d.","Value comment  may contain an optional comment, for example \u201cStrong winds expected starting at 4 pm EST\u201d.","Action , value , unit  and value comment  are typically only accessible to subscribers of trigger .","Price  indicates the fee required to be paid by subscribers in order to be able to access action , value , unit  and value comment  of trigger . As an example, price  may be $0.99 per week.","Published indicator  indicates whether trigger  is published and thus visible on the marketplace for subscribers, or not.","Last updated indicator  indicates when any relevant content of trigger  was last changed, typically expressed in the time zone of the trigger system hosting trigger . This information may be particularly important for subscribers of trigger  to determine how timely trigger 's latest trigger statement is.","Trigger  may also optionally be related to a description  that can, for example, be used to educate prospective subscribers of trigger  in more detail about its benefits and how and by whom trigger  is being updated.","Optionally, trigger  may be related to one or more ratings . Ratings  may be produced and attached by active subscribers and may be used, for example, by prospective subscribers to evaluate prior subscriber satisfaction with trigger  and thus help them determine the perceived quality of trigger  among prior subscribers.","Optionally, trigger  may also be related to one or more comments . Comments  may typically be produced and attached by active subscribers of trigger  and may be used, for example, by prospective subscribers to evaluate prior subscriber satisfaction with trigger  and thus help them determine the perceived quality of trigger  among prior subscribers.","Additionally, trigger  may be related to one or more links . The term link shall be used in the spirit of the well-known Uniform Resource Locator (URL) concept used throughout the Internet. Links  may typically be attached by the source of the trigger , for example to provide subscribers with additional information about trigger  or its latest status.","Additionally, trigger  may be related to one or more icons . An icon may be any visual that can be attached to trigger , such as an image, video, interactive graphic and the like.","Additionally, trigger  may be related to one or more locations . The term location shall be used for describing a position in a physical or imaginary space that a) can be measured and whose co-ordinates can be derived in a particular spatial reference system, for example using latitude and longitude; or b) that can be described in a textual form, e.g. \u2018San Francisco, Calif.\u2019. Using co-ordinates a) is particularly useful in describing a point location of a trigger, for example, to pin-point the present or past location of trigger  on a map or to measure its present or past distance from other triggers or objects. Using a textual location form b) is particularly useful in easily describing areas that may have complex geographical boundaries, for example, to allow textual searching for all triggers that are currently related to locations in San Francisco, Calif. The same approach may be applied to relate triggers to imaginary spaces, such as used in computer games or simulations that use imaginary spaces and respective spatial reference systems.","Now referring to , a trigger request  is depicted. A trigger request is an information artifact that can be created and used by a prospective subscriber to request a new trigger within one or more trigger systems. Once the trigger request is created, it is made visible to other potential subscribers within the one or more trigger systems who can then support the trigger request by attaching a respective pledge. Additionally or alternatively, potential subscribers can attach comments to the trigger request, for example to add thoughts. Trigger requests can drive demand on the trigger marketplace helping potential trigger sources to learn about and determine the demand for a particular type of trigger by prospective subscribers. This can be accomplished for example, by considering the number of supporters a trigger request accumulates, its total pledged amount, how fast the number of its supporters and pledges are increasing, which comments are being attached, or any combination thereof.","Title  ideally contains a short, descriptive heading for the trigger request , for example, as depicted in the implementation example further below.","Description  ideally contains a detailed description of the requested trigger.","Total pledged  indicates the sum of all pledges received for trigger request  to date.","Number of supporters  indicates the total number of supporters of trigger request  to date.","Date created  indicates the date and time when trigger request  was created, for example for potential trigger sources to determine how up-to-date trigger request  is or how quickly it gained support.","Date last pledged  indicates when the latest pledge was received for trigger .","Comment(s)  indicates comments that were attached to the trigger request  to date.","Now referring to , a robot  is depicted. In the spirit of the present invention, a robot is an executable information artifact that can at least be used to watch one or more triggers and perform one or more reactions upon detecting a predefined state of its one or more watched triggers.","Optional title  ideally contains a short, descriptive sentence describing the purpose of the robot .","Optional description  ideally contains a more detailed description of the robot , for example explaining the broader strategy that robot  shall help to accomplish and the like.","One or more watch(es)  indicate which attributes of one or more triggers the robot  shall watch and in which one or more cases it shall perform one or more of its defined reaction(s) .","One or more reaction(s)  may comprise, but not be limited to, one or more of, sending an alert via e-mail, sending an alert via instant messaging, updating a trigger in a predetermined way, and at least one of: consuming data via at least one particular URL, delivering data to at least one particular URL.","Status  indicates the current status of the robot , for example to distinguish between a paused state, an actively watching state or an issue state.","Referring now to , a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown illustrating a trigger system  according to, and in the spirit of, the present invention.","Trigger system  comprises one or more marketplaces , and a multitude of trigger portfolios such as the depicted trigger portfolio . Each marketplace  may be publicly or privately accessible. Privately accessible shall mean only accessible to a specific group of one or more participants of the trigger system . Publically accessible shall mean accessible to anybody or anything that can access trigger system , ideally via the Internet (not shown).","Trigger system  comprises application programming interfaces (APIs)  and  that can be accessed from outside trigger system  ideally via the Internet (not shown). Of course, trigger system  may comprise additional APIs (not shown).","Marketplace  comprises four triggers , ,  and . In addition, marketplace  contains one trigger request . Of course, this is only an example and marketplace  may contain a multitude of triggers and trigger requests.","Trigger portfolio  depicts a personal trigger area of a particular participant x (not shown) of the trigger system . In the presented example, participant x has subscribed to trigger  thus seeing a copy of trigger  in his personal trigger area, here numbered . Trigger copy  is updated whenever any attribute of trigger  is updated and exposes the same attributes as trigger . Trigger  is controlled and updated by its trigger source, that is another participant y (not shown) of trigger system . Trigger copy  can also be understood as a representation or projection of trigger  that is updated whenever trigger  is updated.","It is a key aspect of the present invention to enable participants of the trigger system  to propagate trigger updates to other participants of the trigger system  with as little delay as possible, ideally in real-time or near real-time.","In addition, trigger portfolio  contains two triggers  and  that are both owned by the participant x. In this example, trigger  is periodically updated via the Internet and via API  by a mobile device (not shown) owned by participant x (not shown).","In addition, trigger portfolio  is assigned a robot  that is set by participant x to watch the triggers  and . Watch  defines which one or more attributes of trigger  robot  is to watch, whereas watch  defines which one or more attributes of trigger  robot  is to watch.","Once robot  detects a match according to either watch  or watch , it performs a reaction  that was defined by participant x to update trigger  in a particular way. Trigger  is published as trigger copy  on the marketplace  and thus can be subscribed to by other participants that have access to marketplace . Subscribers of trigger  can access its trigger statement and attribute updates performed by robot  and can in turn run one or more own robots (not shown) in their one or more own trigger portfolios (not shown) performing their one or more own desired reactions (not shown) as they wish.","The depicted ability for participants to have actions performed in a standardized way based on the status of one or more own and\/or subscribed triggers is a key advantage and embodiment of the present invention.","Participant x may also access the status of triggers in his portfolio  via API , for example, to have a software application outside of the trigger system  track his subscribed triggers and perform respective reactions that may include updating trigger  via API .","Resource meter  may measure the rate at which individual participants in the trigger system, their robots, or any of their delegates are using, for example, processing power, communication network bandwidth, messaging services such as e-mail or instant messaging, or any combination thereof within the trigger system. The resulting usage data may be used, for example, for billing participants accordingly.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the depicted trigger system  shall provide means to propagate status changes within the trigger system with as little a delay as possible. This shall mean, for example, that at least each time a trigger is updated, subscribers of that trigger as well as robots watching the updated trigger may be notified of the update in real-time or near real-time.","Furthermore, resulting actions of the subscribers or robots, such as updating respective triggers in respective reactions, may also be performed in real-time or near real-time. This may be accomplished, for example, by applying a real-time publish-and-subscribe event-based technology or any other technology operable to achieve as little delay as possible between the time when a status within the trigger system changes and the time this status change is being communicated to participants in the trigger system.","It is an additional aspect of the present invention to allow deploying more than one robot with the same watch definitions in various execution environments, for example in order to minimize delays between an update of a watched trigger and the detection of the update by the one or more robots.","As an example of this approach, robot  with watches  and  may be run on a backend processing infrastructure of trigger system . In parallel, at least one of the watches  and  may be performed by at least one more robot. This one or more robots may, for example, be run within a web client used by a participant of the trigger system, for example, using the well known scripting language JavaScript, or be run within any other processing environment operable for this purpose.","Upon detecting a fulfillment of either watch  or watch , each such deployed robots may try initiating the reaction  with a mechanism in place that only allows the first robot to successfully perform the reaction .","It is an additional aspect of the present invention to allow one or more dashboards  to comprise one or more triggers or trigger copies, for example, the triggers  and . Furthermore, one or more of the dashboards  may be part of marketplace  and offered for subscription on marketplace . Additionally or alternatively, one or more of the dashboards  may be part of the one or more trigger portfolios . Additionally or alternatively, one or more of the dashboards  may be hosted outside of the trigger system  and comprised trigger copies may be updated via one or more data network connections. Additionally or alternatively, one or more of the dashboards  may not only comprise triggers or trigger copies, but also other content, such as conventional charts, images, textual information and the like.","Now referring to , a typical operation of a trigger is depicted.","In step , a trigger is created within a trigger system by a trigger source. This may, for example, be accomplished via a user interface accessible via the Internet, via an API, or any other means operable to initiate creating a trigger. Since the newly created trigger is not published yet, the trigger is not visible on a trigger marketplace yet.","In step , the trigger source sets a subscription price for the trigger and publishes the trigger in step . At this point, the trigger appears on at least one trigger marketplace within one or more trigger systems. Of course, the subscription price may be set to zero, meaning that subscribers may not need to pay for accessing the trigger.","In step , if the trigger source or a delegate determines that the trigger shall be updated, it is updated in step . Updating the trigger typically includes changing and persisting at least one of, its designation, action, value, unit and value comment. However, it may additionally or alternatively include changing one or more of the trigger's other attributes, for example, its price, title, links or the like. In step , if the trigger shall not be updated, step  is skipped and step  is performed directly.","In step , if the trigger was subscribed by at least one subscriber, in step , all subscribed copies of the trigger are updated, preferably automatically by the trigger system upon detecting the original update of the trigger in step .","Prior to performing the update of subscribed trigger copies, the trigger system may, for example, check the validity of each subscription.","Additionally or alternatively, for example, each subscriber may be debited with a prorated part of the trigger's subscription price and the trigger source may be credited with the resulting proceeds minus any applicable commission fees. Alternatively, at least a subset of subscribers may pay the trigger's subscription price in advance for a particular subscription time period at the start time of the subscription.","In case the trigger subscription price was set to zero in step , no payment by subscribers of the trigger may be necessary.","Of course, a multitude of alternative or additional subscription or other fee payment models can be applied and the invention is not limited to a specific subscription or fee model or process.","In step , if the trigger does not have at least one subscriber, step  is skipped and step  is performed directly.","In step , if the trigger shall be deleted, for example because it is obsolete, it is deleted in step . In this case, the trigger will not be available for subscription on a marketplace anymore and will typically become invisible at least within the trigger system it was created in.","In step , if the trigger shall not be deleted, step  is performed as described above.","Now referring to , a typical operation of a trigger request is depicted.","In step , a participant in a trigger system creates a trigger request within the trigger system and pledges a prospective subscription price, for example, \u201c$3.00 per week\u201d in step . The pledged subscription price can be used, for example, by prospective trigger sources to determine how valuable the requested trigger would be to the creator of the trigger request.","In step , the creator of the trigger request publishes the trigger request, which makes the trigger request visible at least within the trigger system it was created in.","In step , if the trigger request is supported by at least one supporter, the trigger request is updated accordingly in step . In this case, at least the number of supporters, the date last pledged, and the total pledged attributes of the trigger request are computed and updated accordingly. For example, if one supporter pledges \u201c$4.00 per week\u201d, the total pledged attribute of the trigger request would be updated with $3.00 per week by the creator plus $4.00 per week by the one supporter=$7.00 per week. This allows other participants in the trigger system to quickly and easily determine the accumulated demand for the requested trigger.","In step , if the trigger request is not supported by at least one supporter, step  is skipped and step  is performed directly.","In step , if at least one participant in the trigger system indicates having seen a trigger similar to the requested trigger somewhere in a trigger system, a comment is attached to the trigger request in step  reflecting this information.","Additionally, a message may be sent by the trigger system ideally to the requestor as well as to all supporters of the trigger request, notifying them of the attached \u201cseen\u201d comment.","In step , if a trigger similar to the requested trigger has not been seen somewhere in a trigger system yet, step  is skipped and step  is performed directly.","In step , if the trigger request shall be deleted, for example because another already existing sufficiently similar trigger was found, or a trigger source created the requested trigger based on the trigger request, the trigger request is deleted in step .","In step , if the trigger request shall not be deleted, step  is performed as described above.","Now referring to , a typical operation of a robot in the spirit of the present invention is depicted.","In step , a robot is created within a trigger system, typically by a subscriber of at least one trigger published within the trigger system. Of course, a robot may also be created for the subscriber, for example, by a third party service provider.","In step , the creator of the robot defines at least one watch of the robot. A watch typically targets one trigger that is subscribed to by the robot creator. Furthermore, the watch defines which state or value a particular attribute of the target trigger will need to have in order for the watch to be become successful. For example, a watch may be defined to become successful if the current value of a trigger exceeds a particular number, or if the current or predicted location of a trigger is or will be within a particular local area.","In step , the creator of the robot defines at least one reaction of the robot. A reaction typically defines at least one particular action including, but no limited to, sending an e-mail, sending an instant message, updating a trigger, and calling an API or posting data to an API.","In step , if the robot shall start performing its at least one defined watches, step  is performed computing whether at least one of the robot's watches are successful. Step  is typically repeated whenever at least one watched trigger is updated.","In step , if no watch shall be performed, step  is repeated.","In step , if at least one of the robot's watches is successful, all of the robot's respective reactions are performed in step . In step , if the performing of the one or more defined watches of the robot shall be stopped, step  is executed, stopping the watches.","In step , if no watch was successful, step  is skipped and step  is performed.","In step , if the performing of the robot's watches shall not be stopped, step  will be repeated.","Now referring to , a typical operation of the trigger system in the spirit of the present invention is depicted.","In step , a participant in the trigger system searches for ingredient triggers. The term ingredient trigger shall be used based on the presently disclosed approach that more than one trigger may be watched by a subscriber or one or more of his robots in order to detect a particular status within a trigger system, for example, in order to detect an opportunity to perform a particular action such as buying stock, buying or selling a product, a service and the like.","In step , the participant subscribes to one or more desired ingredient triggers in order to gain access to these triggers' status whenever updated.","In step  the participant creates one or more result triggers that shall be updated by his one or more robots when at least one of the robots' watches is successful. In this example, it shall be assumed that the participant has already created one robot.","In step  the participant defines the desired watches of this robot as described above.","In step  the participant defines the desired reaction of this robot as described above.","In step  the participant sets each of the created result triggers to a desired initial state.","In step , the participant publishes the result triggers and has the robot start the defined watches of the ingredient triggers in step .","In step , if at least one of the watches is successful, the respective defined reactions are performed in step .","In step , if the respective reaction(s) contain updating at least one of the created result triggers, the respective result trigger(s) are updated in step .","In step , if the participant wants his robot to end its watches, step  is performed, ending performing the robot's watches.","In step , if no watch was successful, step  is performed.","In step , if no result trigger(s) shall be updated, step  is performed.","In step , if the watches shall be continued, step  is performed.","Now referring to , a screen shot of an example implementation of a trigger marketplace in the spirit of the present invention is depicted.","Marketplace  allows a participant in a trigger system to browse for available published triggers and to subscribe to desired triggers.","Search function  allows for a keyword-based search within the trigger system, for example, to find triggers with particular attributes. Of course, other trigger discovery methods may be available.","Top triggers area  shows the currently top x published triggers within the trigger system, for example ranked based on best ratings, most number of subscriptions or any combination thereof. This area can be used, for example, by prospective subscribers to determine which triggers currently may provide the best value to them.","Top trigger designations area  shows the currently top y trigger designations within the trigger system, for example ranked based on highest number of subscriptions of triggers using the respective designation, fastest subscription growth of triggers using the respective designation, or any combination thereof. This area can be used, for example, by prospective trigger sources to determine which triggers they should best offer on the marketplace in order to gain highest possible subscription income.","Top trigger requests area  shows the currently top z trigger requests within the trigger system, for example ranked based on each trigger request's highest number of supporters, highest total pledges, fastest growing number of either supporters or pledges, or any combination thereof. This area can be used, for example, by prospective trigger sources to determine which triggers they should best offer on the trigger marketplace in order to gain highest possible subscription income.","In this simplified example, marketplace  currently contains three triggers ,  and . Of course, marketplace  may contain a multitude of triggers as well as showing trigger group areas (not shown) for specific types of triggers, such as celebrity triggers, predictive triggers and the like.","In this simplified example,  shows the view of a fictitious participant called \u2018Peter\u2019 being signed into the trigger system looking at the marketplace .","As depicted in account overview area , Peter currently has an account balance of $23.69, an income account balance of $1,524.98, 3,000 vUnits and a subscription to the VTurbo Platinum\u2032 plan.","Peter's account balance reflects the $ credit that Peter currently has within the trigger system, for example, to buy trigger subscriptions, buy additional vUnits, renew his subscription plan, or buy any other provided services.","Peter's income balance reflects the $ credit that Peter currently has within the trigger system stemming from, for example, subscription fees paid by other participants in the trigger system for access to one or more of Peter's triggers.","Peter's vUnits balance relates to the credit that Peter currently has regarding the state of a measured indicator called vUnits. Very much like electricity usage, whenever Peter is using services within the trigger system, vUnits are being measured by a resource meter within the trigger system as described above and deducted from Peter's vUnits account according to a defined rate. This rate may be related, for example, to the amount of processing power used by Peter, his robots or any other of Peter's delegates within the trigger system, for example, to perform trigger updates, use APIs and the like.","As trigger  is subscribed by Peter, the trigger's latest trigger statement  is shown.","As trigger  is not subscribed by Peter, he is presented with an option to subscribe to trigger  and trigger 's trigger statement is not shown.","Trigger  is one of Peter's own triggers, which allows him to update the status of trigger  as described in more detail below.","Last visited area  lists the last x triggers that were clicked on by Peter with the latest clicked trigger or trigger request on top.

While there may be additional or alternative trigger action selections for predictive triggers, it is a key aspect of the present invention to provide the depicted default selections for predictive triggers in order to provide a general standard throughout a trigger system that can be depended upon by participants. This can be particularly beneficial, for example, in order to enable participants across various languages to easily define robots or external software that can analyze and process trigger updates in a clearly defined way.","While action selection area  is specific to predictive triggers, selection area  can also be selected and is universal across trigger types.","Value entry area  allows inputting a value, for example, such as a number or textual expression.","Unit entry area  allows selecting from a set of standard units that apply across trigger types, or, if needed, inputting a unit that is not part of the available universal units, such as \u201cKilometers\u201d and \u201ckg\u201d, for example.

This method is also explicitly claimed as part of the present invention.","Dotted area  indicates a typical approach for a seller  to advertise an offer , for example \u201c20% off product x only today\u201d, to a target audience . In the illustrated typical approach, seller  would distribute the offer content  via various channels, such as e-mail, online or other, for example print media, radio or television to a target audience . Typically, offer content  will point the target audience  to an offer landing page  on the Internet that allows potential buyers among the target audience  to learn more about the offer  and initiate respective orders .","Typically, a main goal for success of this typical approach is to maximize the number of orders created by the target audience. Typical key influence factors for reaching this goal are the size of the target audience as well as the quality of the selection of the target audience based on the offer. Both of these influence factors are typically not easy to optimize, as engagement cost for the seller increases with the size of a target audience as well as with identifying and engaging higher quality target audiences.","In contrast, the present invention allows the seller  with minimal effort and cost to engage additional, high quality target audiences to the depicted existing advertisement approach  using a trigger system  in the following way:","In addition, or alternatively, to the above-described typical channels, Seller  publishes offer  via a Trigger  on marketplace . In this case, as per , Trigger  may be created and published as a reporting trigger with the designation \u201cProduct X\u201d, the seller as the trigger source, the action \u201cis\u201d, the value \u201c20\u201d, the unit \u201c%\u201d and the value comment \u201coff only today\u201d. In addition, a more detailed description of the offer  may be attached to Trigger  as well as a link to the offer landing page .","Once published on marketplace , a multitude of participants of the trigger system  including micro businesses (not shown) may subscribe to Trigger , deploy their respective intelligences, here represented by  within respective trigger portfolios , by, for example, packaging Trigger  with another offer, here represented by Trigger , creating combined or enriched offers, here represented by TriggerX  and publishing their respective resulting triggers, here represented by a multitude of TriggersX  on the marketplace .","As each publishing participant including micro businesses is monetarily or otherwise incentivized to create and distribute the best possible offers in the shortest amount of time to their respective subscribing target audiences , there will be a high propensity to intelligently optimize the quality of each resulting trigger offer to attract interest among respective target audiences.","Also, as the present invention allows distribution of the resulting offer triggers in a highly individualized and accelerated fashion, it provides access to target audiences  that seller  would typically not have reached with typical approach .","Furthermore, buyers among target audiences  will be able use the same offer landing page  as target audience , thus adding to the number of orders for seller  and increasing commercial success with minimal additional cost for the seller .","Additionally or alternatively, buyers among target audiences  can be pointed directly to the web presence of seller  using a direct link  thus eliminating the need and cost for particular offer landing pages altogether.","In the above-described way, publishing participants including micro-businesses can turn their respective intelligence into highly valuable content for their respective subscribers who will in turn provide subscription revenue back to participants including micro businesses. Sellers can seamlessly add new, highly scalable distribution channels to their existing marketing processes with minimal cost and high upside potential in terms of access to new customer segments.","In fact, sellers can even gain subscription revenue by publishing high quality offer triggers via the presently disclosed invention. For example, sellers could first publish time-critical offers via offer triggers to paying subscriber participants including micro-business subscribers on the disclosed market place and then, slightly delayed, publish the same offer via their typical advertisement channels as indicated in area , thus creating an incentive for direct participant subscribers including micro-business resellers to pay subscription fees for receiving valuable offers first.","As a specific example for applying intelligence in the above-described way, a micro business may subscribe to a trigger of a seller who provides time-critical hotel rate opportunities in Las Vegas, Nev. In addition, the micro business also subscribes to triggers that offer deals on rental car and show ticket rates in Las Vegas, Nev. The micro business then publishes an own trigger that advertises package opportunities whenever the micro business spots a particularly interesting combination of a hotel, rental car and show ticket deal in Las Vegas, Nev. based on input from the subscribed triggers. Since the micro business's trigger is attracting a particular target audience based on added value and reputation, the micro business receives growing trigger subscription revenue while the original sellers enjoy respective additional business generated by a subset of the micro business's target audience that the original sellers would typically not have access to.","As yet another example for applying intelligence in the spirit of the present invention, a participant in a trigger system who is a well known celebrity updates one of her triggers with a link to a respective source trigger and a personal comment whenever she spots a great fashion deal published by sellers within the same trigger system. Given her excellent reputation and brand, her trigger's subscribers provide her with significant subscription income for publishing picks of great deals based on her experience and judgment, while the original sellers enjoy additional revenue generated by a subset of her large subscription target audience.","Now referring to , a flow chart is depicted that shows an example operation of the preferred embodiment of .","In step , a seller creates a trigger referring to an offer as described above. In step , if a landing page for the offer is available, step  is performed and a link to the landing page is attached to the trigger. In step , if no landing page for the offer is available, step  is performed attaching a direct link to the seller's web presence to the trigger. This is particularly useful for sellers that do not have the resources or do not want to create landing pages for offers for whatever reason.","In step , the trigger is published on a marketplace of a trigger system in the spirit of the present invention as described above.","In step , a reseller subscribes to the trigger and applies his intelligence, for example, by combining the seller's offer with an offer of another seller, adding a translation or explanation suited for a particular target audience, and the like.","Of course, the reseller may apply his intelligence in a multitude of additional or alternative ways and one of the key advantages of the present invention is to support the reseller in doing so without the need to disclose his intellectual property.","In step , if the reseller chooses to create and publish a new trigger representing the result of applying his intelligence, step  is performed and a new trigger is created and published accordingly on a marketplace of a trigger system.","In step , if the reseller chooses to update one of his existing published triggers with the result of applying his intelligence on the seller's trigger, such update is performed in step .","In step , subscribers of the reseller's chosen published trigger receive the new resulting content and may initiate orders with the original seller accordingly.","Of course, there are many additional or alternative ways to operate the above-described method within the spirit of the present invention.","For example, in addition to publishing his offer trigger within a trigger system, the reseller may send out links pointing to his published trigger, for example via well-known social networks such as Facebook or Twitter, to new target audiences that may not yet be participants of the trigger system. In this case, a subset of the new target audiences may choose to subscribe to the reseller's trigger within the trigger system, thus increasing new trigger subscription revenue potential for the reseller and offer revenue potential for the seller.","As another example, the reseller may choose to publish the offer on more than one market place in more than one trigger system using more than one trigger.","As another example, the present invention can also be used for fundraising and non-profit purposes in novel ways. In this case, for example, the publisher of one or more triggers may ask subscribers to pay as much or as little as they like for sponsoring and in return receiving immediate updates on the programs, people or purposes they would like to sponsor. Thus, instead of giving money in general to one or more organizations, for example, subscribers can very easily and timely route their donations where they feel it is best spent based on timely information. Also, in this way the receiving organizations can build a much more immediate and emotionally including environment to inform and at the same time motivate their donors to keep giving for the most valuable purposes. Using image or video triggers as described below, the present invention can also be used, for example, to provide instant gratification to donors by illustrating progress or success stories stemming from their donations.","As another example, one or more sponsors of a trigger may pay for respective subscription fees for the trigger so that subscribers of the trigger may gain access to the trigger for free. Of course, a publisher may also provide one or more triggers to subscribers for free, for example, to support a brand, drive traffic to an attached URL, feature a particular non-profit cause or service and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0273","num":"0272"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},"One or more videos and images may, for example, be attached by a publisher to a trigger in the form of one or more URLs pointing to respective files or data sources on the Internet, including IFrames, in the same or similar way as depicted in  (). In this case, for example, the publisher may input or copy and paste a particular URL or piece of HTML or other code that contains a particular URL, into one or more respective text fields of a form that allows to relate the input data with the trigger. An IFrame (Inline Frame) is defined as an HTML document embedded inside another HTML document on a website.","Of course, the input data may then be parsed or modified in order to extract and format respective URLs in a desired way. In this case, for example, respective URLs may be extracted from an HTML input, cleansed from potentially unsafe URL parameters and then shortened in order to store them in the most efficient and safe way with, or in relation to, the respective trigger. Of course, URLs may be attached to triggers in any other feasible way known by those skilled in the art.","Additionally or alternatively, one or more icons including images, videos, audio, IFrames, or any other file may be attached directly to a trigger, meaning their respective data is attached to the trigger and not merely a URL pointing to their respective data.","Trigger  has a music video attached that is currently playing with its video controls temporarily hidden to allow an undisturbed view of the video. It is a preferred embodiment of the present invention that both, the attached video as well as other attributes of the trigger  including its title, designation and value may be updated independently from each other. Thus, the video may play while other attributes of the trigger  are updated or vice versa.","In addition, video attributes, such as the current size of the video, trigger 's location on the screen, audio volume level or starts and stops at specific frames, for example, may be controlled by attributes of trigger  that can be updated while the video is playing.","Furthermore, URLs attached to trigger , if any, may be updated as well allowing, for example, an interaction of one or more subscribers of trigger  with the publisher of trigger  even while the attached video is playing. Of course, trigger  may contain particular interaction areas such as buttons, sliders and the like (not shown) facilitating the heretofore mentioned interaction.","Trigger  has an image attached that, for example, can be used to advertise a particular product, service or the like. Again, as described above, trigger  may have one or more links attached that may, for example, allow a subscriber of trigger  to see a higher resolution version of the currently presented image when clicking on the image or a specific area on the trigger, visit a web page served from within or from outside the present trigger system, the web page allowing the subscriber to get more detailed information on the advertised product or service, order the advertised product or service and the like.","Trigger  depicts an example of a trigger that was just updated. In this case, trigger  may automatically show respective video controls that may allow a subscriber of trigger , for example, to start watching the attached video, fast forward to a specific frame in the video, select an alternative video resolution, watch the video in a larger view and the like. Of course, starting and pausing the video may also be as easily accomplished as clicking on the video for starting it and clicking on the video again for stopping it and the like.","In the depicted example view, trigger  is a copy of trigger  attached to another trigger group and therefore updated whenever trigger  is updated.","It is a preferred embodiment of the present invention to allow a subscriber the consumption of, and interaction with, more than one video, image or IFrame triggers at the same time. This aspect of the present invention allows, for example, to watch the videos attached to triggers ,  and  at the same time, allowing, for example, a much more effective consumption of various visual real-time sources in parallel or enjoying a particular composition of various visual and textual content sources at the same time.","As another example, trigger  has an image attached that depicts a data visualization, for example, to allow easy tracking of multi-dimensional data sources. Of course, alternatively, trigger  may have an IFrame attached that depicts the data visualization plus allows interaction with the data visualization, for example.","Trigger  is another example of an attached data visualization image used in a business scenario. In this case, trigger  is not shown in full height to save screen real estate. Using control , for example, trigger  may be expanded and contracted as needed. Of course, other triggers such as trigger  and  may be contracted and expanded in a similar way to allow for a flexible use of the overall available screen real estate.","Trigger  depicts an example for a news video trigger that is currently only partially seen.","Trigger  depicts a trigger that does not currently have a video or image attached.","Using the present invention in the depicted way, one or more subscribers may easily consume, and interact with, a multitude of visual and non-visual data sources represented by respective triggers that may be periodically updated independently from each other. Since at least a subset of the subscribers may also be publishers of one or more of the respective triggers, the present invention allows not only one-way, but rich interaction between various publishers and subscribers.","This may particularly be beneficial, for example, in the fields of business or scientific data tracking and sharing, entertainment, games, real-time advertising, publishing and consuming of electronic art, publishing and consuming of news and the like.","The inventions set forth above are subject to many modifications and changes without departing from the spirit, scope or essential characteristics thereof.
