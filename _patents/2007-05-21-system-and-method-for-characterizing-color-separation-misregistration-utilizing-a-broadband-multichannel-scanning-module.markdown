No. 11\/496,907, all three of which have been assigned to the present assignee, and the entire contents thereof, are hereby incorporated by reference.","1. Technical Field","The present disclosure relates to multi-color printing systems, and, in particular, to a system and method for characterizing color separation misregistration of a multi-color printing system utilizing a multi-channel scanner.","2. Description of Related Art","In multi-color printing systems a limited number of color separations are used for marking a substrate for achieving a wider variety of colors, with each separation marking the substrate using discrete shapes, such as dots having a circular or oval shape, or periodic line patterns. This concept is generally known as color halftoning, and involves combining two or more patterned separations on the substrate. The selection of color separations and halftone pattern designs are carefully chosen for achieving a visual effect of the desired color.","Many prior art printing systems use cyan, magenta, yellow and black (also referred to as CMYK) color separations that mark a substrate using discrete cluster dots. The dots may be marked in a dot-on-dot fashion, by marking the substrate with a first and second color separation, with the dots of the second color separation superimposed over the dots of the first color separation for achieving the desired color. In addition, the dots may be applied in a dot-off-dot fashion, with the dots of the second color separation placed in the voids of the dots of the first color separation for achieving the desired color. However, multi-color printing systems are susceptible to misregistration between color separations due to a variety of mechanical related issues. For both dot-on-dot and dot-off-dot rendering, color separation misregistration may cause a significant color shift in the actual printed color that is noticeable to the human eye.","Broadband multi-channel scanners are widely available. Typically, they include a plurality of channels each of which are responsive to a wide spectrum of optical wavelengths. Since the human eye has three types of daytime optical receptors (i.e., cone cells), broadband multi-channel scanners usually contain 3 channels, each of which are usually referred to as \u201cRed\u201d, \u201cBlue\u201d and \u201cGreen\u201d channels. Therefore, these broadband three-color scanners are called \u201cRGB\u201d scanners.","A widely used marking technology includes using rotated cluster dot sets since anomalies (e.g., color shifts) due to color separation misregistrations are subtle and less detectable by the human eye. However, even in these cases color misregistrations can be objectionable, particularly at edges of objects that contain more than one separation. Therefore, it is important to characterize color separation misregistration in order to perform corrective action in the print engine.","Many other methods for characterizing misregistration of color separations include using physical registration marks. The registration marks include two fine straight lines, each line formed using a different color separation. The two lines are aligned and joined to form one straight line. Alignment of the two lines is analyzed, with misalignment indicating misregistration of one of the color separations relative to the other. The analysis may include studying the printed registration marks with a microscope and visually determining if misregistration has occurred. Such analysis is tedious and not conducive to automation. The analysis may include imaging the marker with a high resolution scanning device and analyzing the high resolution scanned image using complex software for determining the positions of the registration marks relative to one another. These types of analysis sometimes require high-resolution scanning equipment and may involve a significant amount of computational power.","In another method used for higher end printer devices outputting high volume and\/or high quality images, misregistration of color separations is characterized by measuring the transition time between the edges of two primary separation patches (e.g., cyan and magenta) on a moving photoreceptor belt. The patches have angled edges (e.g., chevrons) that allow the determination of misregistration in both the fast scan direction (transverse to the longitudinal axis of the photoreceptor belt) and slow scan direction (parallel to the longitudinal axis of the photoreceptor belt). Simple photo detectors are used to measure the time between the moving edges of the chevrons, and this can in turn be used to compute the misregistration in both slow and fast scan directions. However, there is a continuing need to characterize color separation misregistration effectively and\/or efficiently.","The present disclosure relates to multi-color printing systems, and, in particular, to a system and method for characterizing color separation misregistration of a multi-color printing system utilizing a multi-channel scanner.","One aspect of the present disclosure includes a method for characterizing color separation misregistration of a multi-color printing system that involves generating a spectral reflectance data structure. The spectral reflectance data structure may correspond to a broadband multi-channel scanning module and may include at least one parameter. The broadband multi-channel scanning module may be a RGB scanner. The method may provide for calibrating a spectral-based analysis module by utilizing the spectral reflectance data structure and characterizing color separation misregistration utilizing the calibrated spectral-based analysis module by examining at least one plurality-separation patch. The plurality-separation patch, described in more detail infra.","In another aspect thereof, the step of generating the spectral reflectance data structure may include marking a substrate to form a misregistration gamut target on the substrate. The misregistration gamut target may include at least one training patch and\/or at least one Neugebauer primary patch. The step of marking the substrate to form a misregistration gamut target on the substrate may utilize a printing module. In addition, the step of generating the spectral reflectance data structure may also include scanning the misregistration gamut target utilizing a broadband multi-channel scanning module.","In another aspect thereof, at least one parameter mentioned supra, may be an approximation of at least one of \u015d, \u03b2, and {circumflex over (\u03b3)}, discussed in more detail infra. The approximation of \u015dmay be calculated by an \u015dmodule. The \u015dmodule may utilize Equation 6. The approximation of {circumflex over (\u03b3)}may be calculated by a {circumflex over (\u03b3)}module. The {circumflex over (\u03b3)}module may utilize Equation 13. The approximation of \u03b2may be calculated by a \u03b2module discussed in more detail infra.","In another aspect thereof, the step of calibration of the spectral-based analysis module by utilizing the spectral reflectance data structure may include inverting Equation 15 utilizing at least one parameter of the spectral reflectance data structure. Also, the step of inverting the Equation 15 may result in a solution in accordance with at least one of Equation 18 for at least one of P partitions of an RGB color space.","In another aspect thereof, the step of characterizing color separation misregistration utilizing the calibrated spectral-based analysis module by examining at least one plurality-separation patch may include scanning at least one plurality-separation patch utilizing the broadband multi-channel scanning module. Additionally or alternatively, the step may further include determining r\u2032, g\u2032, and b\u2032 for at least one plurality-separation patch and\/or determining the approximate color separation misregistration within the spatial domain of at least one plurality-separation patch in accordance with at least one Equation 18 for the at least one of P partitions of the RGB color space by utilizing r\u2032, g\u2032, and b\u2032.","In another aspect thereof, the present disclosure includes a system implemented by an operative set of processor executable instructions configured for execution by at least one processor for determining color separation misregistration in a multi-color printing system. The system may include a communication module, a spectral-based analysis module, a generation module, and\/or a calibration module. The communication module may be configured for receiving a patch data structure. The patch data structure may correspond to at least one plurality-separation patch and may have been generated utilizing a broadband multi-channel scanning module, e.g., an RGB scanner. The spectral-based analysis module may be in operative communication with the communication module and may process the patch data structure to characterize color separation misregistration. Also, the spectral-based analysis module may be calibrated.","The generation module may generate a spectral reflectance data structure corresponding to a multi-channel scanner and the spectral reflectance data structure may include at least one parameter. The calibration module may calibrate the spectral-based analysis module by utilizing a spectral reflectance data structure. The calibration module may calibrate the spectral-based analysis module by utilizing the spectral reflectance data structure by inverting Equation 15 utilizing at least one parameter of the spectral reflectance data structure resulting in a solution in accordance with at least one Equation 18 for at least one of P partitions of an RGB color space. As mentioned above, at least one parameter may be an approximation of at least one of \u015d, \u03b2, and {circumflex over (\u03b3)}.","In another aspect thereof, a system implemented by an operative set of processor executable instructions configured for execution by at least one processor for estimating color separation misregistration is provided. The system may include a means for calibrating a spectral-based analysis module, and a means for characterizing a color separation misregistration by examining a plurality-separation patch utilizing an RGB scanner.","Color shifts due to misregistration for dot-on-dot and dot-off-dot patterns have been described in the article by Warren L. Rhodes & Charles H. Hains, entitled \u201cThe Influence of Halftone Orientation on Color Gamut,\u201d published in \u201cRecent Progress in Digital Halftoning\u201d, an Imaging Society & Technology publication, in January of 1995. Therein color shifts that may occur due to misregistration for dot-on-dot and dot-off-dot halftone-patterns are described in addition to the relationship between the value of chroma (C*) with regards to transition from dot-on-dot and dot-off-dot color separation registrations, which increases approximately monotonically as the halftone patterns transition therebetween.","Referring now to the drawings,  depicts a plurality-separation patch . Plurality-separation patch  is a species of color separation misregistration patches (\u201ccolor separation misregistration patches\u201d being the genus). The previously filed U.S. patent application entitled, \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR HIGH RESOLUTION CHARACTERIZATION OF SPATIAL VARIANCE OF COLOR SEPARATION MISREGISTRATION\u201d, discloses a color separation misregistration patch that is configured for characterizing color separation misregistration of multiple separations relative to a reference separation (usually \u201cK\u201d is used as an example for reference) by utilizing overlapping color separation markings, referred to therein as a \u201cmeasurement patch\u201d; however, the aforementioned patch, described in more detail therein, is described herein as a \u201cplurality-separation patch\u201d.","The plurality-separation patch  includes overlapping parallel lines using each of the color separations in a color space (CMYK in the present example) and having a first line pattern orientation, i.e., parallel lines along the first direction. A line pattern may be formed by a plurality of lines. For example, consider lines  that are marked by a \u201cC\u201d separation. Lines  form a line pattern of the \u201cC\u201d separation; lines  and  form a line pattern of the \u201cY and M\u201d separations; lines  form a line pattern of the \u201cK\u201d separation. The CMYK color space in this example may be formed by Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black inks (or toners). The CMYK color space is typically used by multi-color printing system. The CMYK color space may correspond to the individual inks (or toners) of a printing system utilized by a respective color separation, e.g., a printing system may have a \u201cyellow\u201d ink that marks paper with a specific color separation dedicated for marking paper with that ink. However, other combinations of toners and\/or inks may be used.","Although the line patterns are depicted as being parallel to the axis of the first direction (refer to the axes depicted in ), other line pattern orientation may be used, e.g., lines , , , and  may be at a 45\u00b0 angle to a line parallel to the axis of the first direction. As depicted, lines , , , and  are parallel to the axis of the first direction, and consequently, may determine each respective color separation misregistration relative to a K color separation in the second direction. Utilizing multiple color separations patches with multiple orientations may be needed to characterize color separation misregistration in both of the first and second directions. One method of rotation is described in a previously filed U.S. Application entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CHARACTERIZING COLOR SEPARATION MISREGISTRATION\u201d.","Plurality-separation patch  may be a graphic depiction a digital image, e.g.,  depicts plurality-separation patch  as a visualization of a digital image file that may be sent to color separations to mark on paper. Additionally or alternatively, plurality-separation patch  may be a depiction of a patch marked on a substrate with no color separation, e.g., a patched marked on paper with no relative C, M, and\/or Y color separation misregistration relative to the K color separation.","Plurality-separation patch  may be utilized by a method for simultaneously estimating misregistration of C, M, and Y color separations relative to a K color separation from spectral measurements of plurality-separation patch . A unique reflectance spectrum may result from plurality-separation patch  based upon misregistration(s); and as long as the reflectance properties of the individual inks (or toners) of each respective color separation have suitable optical absorptions characteristics, an examination of the reflectance spectrum of plurality-separation patch  may be utilized to characterize color separation misregistration(s).","For an example, consider the following: assume that plurality-separation patch  is a depiction of an image stored in a file. If multiple color separations (CMYK is this example) are instructed to mark paper with plurality-separation patch , the \u201caverage\u201d color appearance of the image as marked on the paper will be a function of the relative color separation misregistration of the C, M, and Y color separations relative to the K color separation. In addition, the reflectance spectrum of plurality-separation patch  may be measured by a spectrophotometer to assist in determining the color separation misregistration mentioned in this example.","Note that several of the color separation halftone-lines are shifted relative to the K halftone pattern lines (also referred to as halftone lines). For example, the C halftone lines are phase shifted \u2212L\/4 relative to K. And the M and Y halftone lines are phase shifted +L\/4 relative to K. Note that the halftone lines are repeating creating a periodic halftone pattern; the repeating pattern is defined as having a period L. For misregistrations of the C, M, and Y color separations relative to the K color separations, a unique reflectance spectrum exists for each possible color misregistration.","Referring now to the drawings,  is a cross-section view of a plurality-separation patch  as marked on a substrate with a color separation misregistration of the Y color separation in the negative second direction relative to the C, M, and K color separations. Note that the orientation of the axes of  relative to that of  for proper orientation; however, the cross-section view of plurality patch  is not to scale and does not possess the same proportions as depicted in . Additionally,  is shown consistent with a plurality-separation patch  with a color separation misregistration while  does not (assuming it is a depiction of a patch marked on a substrate rather than a depiction of an image file).","There may be significant disparity between the actual reflectance spectrum vs. the predicted reflectance spectrum of plurality-separation patch . Substrate scattering can cause significant deviations in actual reflectance spectrum compared to some predicted reflectance spectrum theoretical models of plurality-separation patch . This disparity is partly because photons entering into one region of plurality-separation patch  may emerge from another region of plurality-separation patch . The reflectance spectrum of plurality-separation patch  may be mathematically modeled using a probabilistic framework to account for substrate scattering, e.g., paper scattering. To account for scattering of local substrate, plurality-patch 's reflectance spectrum may be described in terms of a point spread function PSF(x-x\u2032), indicating the probability that a photon will enter the substrate at region at region x and exit at region x\u2032. The average reflectance across a halftone cell (and by extension plurality-patch ) can be computed by:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"R","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03bb"}},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["R","p"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03bb"}},{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"mn"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u03b2","mn"]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["T","m"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03bb"}},{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["T","n"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03bb"}},"mo":"."}],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}],"mo":"\u2062"}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"The coefficients \u03b2of Equation 1 are based purely upon the geometric properties of plurality-patch  and describe the coupling between region m and region n.

Also,  may correspond to the misregistration states of plurality-patch  in a specific direction, e.g., the second direction of plurality-patch  as depicted in .","Utilizing Equation 1, an estimate of the reflectance spectra resulting from each possible misregistration state depicted in  of plurality-patch  may be calculated. The resulting reflectance spectra may be depicted as a corresponding discrete reflectance spectra in terms of a CIE 1976 L*a*b color space as depicted in . For example, a misregistration of a plurality-patch  as marked on the substrate may have a misregistration of: 15 \u03bcm of a \u201cY\u201d color separation in a second direction, 10 \u03bcm of a \u201cC\u201d color separation in second direction and a \u221220 \u03bcm misregistration of a \u201cM\u201d color separation in the second direction. These misregistration states are described in terms of a differential to the \u201cK\u201d color separation. Thus, there is a color separation misregistration state corresponding to the misregistration state described, and utilizing Equation 1, a discrete reflectance spectra in term of a CIE 1976 L*a*b color space may be calculated. That calculation may be depicted as a discrete reflectance spectra in .","Each misregistration state depicted in  may be considered to be mapped (i.e., correspond) to a depicted discrete reflectance spectra within the graphic of  utilizing Equation 1. A lookup table may be generated that maps the misregistration states of  to the corresponding spectra of . The lookup table may be implemented in hardware, software, software in execution, or some combination thereof. Additionally or alternatively, the lookup table may be a data structure such as an array and\/or an associative array. If an estimated reflectance spectra is measured by a spectrophotometer of plurality-patch , and within the lookup table there is not a discrete value described therein, a discrete reflectance spectra that is closest to the measured reflectance in terms of Euclidian distance to may be chosen to determine a discrete color separation misregistration state of . Additionally or alternatively, an interpolation algorithm may be utilized in order to determine a color separation misregistration estimate utilizing a Lookup table.","However, note that a measurement patch, such as plurality-patch  has the property of having a spatial domain for determining and\/or estimate color separation misregistration. For example, plurality-patch  may have a spatial domain corresponding approximately to the length and width dimensions of the patch and may only estimate color separation misregistration in the second direction. Another separation patch may be needed to estimate color separation in a certain spatial domain to character color separation misregistration in the first and second directions. The spatial domain may be the area of a substrate in which a color separation misregistration patch (such as plurality-patch ) may be used to measure and\/or estimate the color separation misregistration of that region of the substrate.","Referring simultaneously to , B, and , and note as mentioned supra, the previously filed U.S. patent entitled, \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR HIGH RESOLUTION CHARACTERIZATION OF SPATIAL VARIANCE OF COLOR SEPARATION MISREGISTRATION\u201d, describes in more detail the spectral effects of a color separation misregistration has on plurality-separation patch  as may be measured from a spectrophotometer; however, , depicts a flow chart diagram of a method  for characterizing color separation misregistration of a multi-color printing system utilizing a broadband multi-channel scanning module .

With the reflectance measurement in R of Equation 5 and with the information of scorresponding to broadband multi-channel scanning module , the corresponding channels may be mapped to y, which is illustrated in Equation 5.","The rows of the matrix R may be formed by stacking r, k=1,2 . . . , N, the reflectance spectra corresponding to the measurements in y.","Estimates of scan be obtained by solving Equation 5. To ensure that the estimates of sare sufficiently accurate for RGB values likely to result due to a color separation misregistration, we need to choose a training set of N patches that well represent the range of RGB values of color separation misregistration states.","Referring now simultaneously to , B, , A, and B, a k-means algorithm was used to cluster the reflectance spectra depicted in  to obtain a reduced number of reflectance spectra that represent a reduced but sufficient number of color separation misregistration states depicted in  with the corresponding reflectance spectra whose CIELAB representations are shown in .

Misregistration gamut target  may be formed from 353 patches having approximately the same reflectance spectra as the discrete spectra represented in . Additionally, Misregistration gamut target  may have patches corresponding to the Neugebauer primaries of printing module , e.g., Neugebauer primary patch .","However, the systems of equations that may be expressed by Equation 5 are ill-posed, i.e., no exact solution is likely to be determined, and can not be reliably solved as a least-squares problem. However, the standard regularization solution may be used and the smoothness of the quantum efficiency functions may be utilized. The sharp peaks may be neglected that may be present in the efficiency functions due to the spectral power distribution of the illuminant associated with broadband multi-channel scanning module .
