The government has certain rights in the invention.","Compounds and methods disclosed herein are useful for treating viral infection in vertebrates, including RNA viral infections.","As a group, RNA viruses represent an enormous public health problem in the U.S. and worldwide. Well-known RNA viruses include influenza virus (including the avian and swine isolates), hepatitis C virus (HCV), West Nile virus, SARS-coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).","More than 170 million people worldwide are infected by HCV, and 130 million of those are chronic carriers at risk of developing chronic liver diseases (cirrhosis, carcinoma, and liver failure). As such, HCV is responsible for two thirds of all liver transplants in the developed world. Recent studies show that the death rate from HCV infection is rising due to the increasing age of chronically infected patients. Likewise seasonal flu infects 5-20% of the population resulting in 200,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths each year.","Compared to influenza and HCV, West Nile virus causes the lowest number of infections, 981 in the United States in 2010. Twenty percent of infected patients develop a severe form of the disease, resulting in a 4.5% mortality rate. Unlike influenza and HCV, there are no approved therapies for the treatment of West Nile virus infection, and it is a high-priority pathogen for drug development due to its potential as a bioterrorist agent.","Among the RNA viruses listed, vaccines exist only for influenza virus. Accordingly, drug therapy is essential to mitigate the significant morbidity and mortality associated with these viruses. Unfortunately, the number of antiviral drugs is limited, many are poorly effective, and nearly all are plagued by the rapid evolution of viral resistance and a limited spectrum of action. Moreover, treatments for acute influenza and HCV infections are only moderately effective. The standard of care for HCV infection, PEGylated interferon and ribavirin, is effective in only 50% of patients, and there are a number of dose-limiting side effects associated with the combined therapy. Both classes of acute influenza antivirals, adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors, are only effective within the first 48 hours after infection, thereby limiting the window of opportunity for treatment. High resistance to adamantanes already restricts their use, and massive stockpiling of neuraminidase inhibitors will eventually lead to overuse and the emergence of resistant strains of influenza.","Most drug development efforts against these viruses target viral proteins. This is a large part of the reason that current drugs are narrow in spectrum and subject to the emergence of viral resistance. Most RNA viruses have small genomes and many encode less than a dozen proteins. Viral targets are therefore limited. Based on the foregoing, there is an immense and unmet need for effective treatments against viral infections.","The compounds and methods disclosed herein shift the focus of viral drug development away from the targeting of viral proteins to the development of drugs that target and enhance the host's innate antiviral response. Such compounds and methods are likely to be more effective, less susceptible to the emergence of viral resistance, cause fewer side effects and be effective against a range of different viruses (1).","The RIG-I pathway is intimately involved in regulating the innate immune response to RNA virus infections. RIG-I agonists are expected to be useful for the treatment of many viruses including, without limitation, HCV, influenza, and West Nile virus. Accordingly, the present disclosure relates to compounds and methods for treating viral infection, including infection by RNA viruses, wherein the compounds can modulate the RIG-I pathway.","One embodiment includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound having a structure",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"27.09mm","wi":"22.69mm","file":"US08927561-20150106-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1 ","2 ","4","4","4","4","4","4","5","4","5","4","5 "],"sub":["3","3","2","2","n"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["Ris H, lower alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkylaryl, arylalkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, arylalkoxy, heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl or cyclic heteroalkyl;","Rand Rare each independently selected from H, lower alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkylaryl, arylalkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, arylalkoxy, alkoxyalkylaryl, alkylamino, dialkylamino, arylamino, heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, cyclic heteroalkyl, cyclicheteroalkylalkyl, alkylcarbonyl, heteroalkylcarbonyl, furan, thiophene, oxazole, thiazole, isothiazole, pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, piperazine, piperadine, dioxane, quinoline, isoquinoline, quinazoline, benzene or naphthalene or two can be taken together forming a cyclic constituent including, but not limited to, piperazine, piperadine, morpholine, thiomorpholine, thiomorpholine, S,S-dioxide, azapine or diazapine;","W is lower alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkylaryl, arylalkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, arylalkoxy, alkoxyalkylaryl, alkylamino, arylamino, heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, cyclic heteroalkyl, C\u2550O, alkylcarbonyl, O, S, NH, NR, (CRR)or (C\u2550O)R;","X is C or N;","Y is H, alkyl, OR, or C\u2550O;","Z is H, alkyl, aryl, heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, OH, OR, NRR, NRCOR, NR(C\u2550O)NRR, COH, COR, CONH, CONRR, 1-amidine, 2-amidine, guanidine, sulfonylamidine, sulfonylguanidine, N-cyanoamidine, N-cyanoguanidine, tetrazole, aminosquaric acid, aminosquaric acid amide, COH, CS(OR), SOR, COR, CONRR, (SO)NRR, NR(SO)NRR, NRor SOR;","n is 0, 1 or 2;","wherein the dashed lines represent the presence or absence of a double bond;

Such compounds and methods are likely to be more effective, less susceptible to the emergence of viral resistance, cause fewer side effects and be effective against a range of different viruses (1).","The RIG-I pathway is intimately involved in regulating the innate immune response to RNA virus infections. RIG-I is a cytosolic pathogen recognition receptor that is essential for triggering immunity to a wide range of RNA viruses (5-8). RIG-I is a double-stranded RNA helicase that binds to motifs within the RNA virus genome characterized by homopolymeric stretches of uridine or polymeric U\/A motifs (9). Binding to RNA induces a conformation change that relieves RIG-I signaling repression by an autologous repressor domain, thus allowing RIG-I to signal downstream through its tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) (4). RIG-I signaling is dependent upon its NTPase activity, but does not require the helicase domain (10, 11). RIG-I signaling is silent in resting cells, and the repressor domain serves as the on-off switch that governs signaling in response to virus infection (8).","RIG-I signaling is transduced through IPS-1 (also known as Cardif, MAVs, and VISA), an essential adaptor protein that resides in the outer mitochondrial membrane (12-15). IPS-1 recruits a macromolecular signaling complex that stimulates the downstream activation of IRF-3, a transcription factor that induces the expression of type I IFNs and virus-responsive genes that control infection (16). Compounds that trigger RIG-I signaling directly or through modulation of RIG-I pathway components, including IRF-3, present attractive therapeutic applications as antivirals or immune modulators.","A high-throughput screening approach was used to identify compounds that modulate the RIG-I pathway, a key regulator of the cellular innate immune response to RNA virus infection.

Polyhydric alcohols can be present in an amount between 0.1% and 25% by weight, typically 1% to 5%, taking into account the relative amounts of the other ingredients.","Stabilizers refer to a broad category of excipients which can range in function from a bulking agent to an additive which solubilizes the therapeutic agent or helps to prevent denaturation or adherence to the container wall. Typical stabilizers can be polyhydric sugar alcohols (enumerated above); amino acids such as arginine, lysine, glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, alanine, ornithine, L-leucine, 2-phenylalanine, glutamic acid, threonine, etc., organic sugars or sugar alcohols, such as lactose, trehalose, stachyose, mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, ribitol, myoinisitol, galactitol, glycerol and the like, including cyclitols such as inositol; polyethylene glycol; amino acid polymers; sulfur-containing reducing agents, such as urea, glutathione, thioctic acid, sodium thioglycolate, thioglycerol, alpha-monothioglycerol and sodium thiosulfate; low molecular weight polypeptides (i.e., <10 residues); proteins such as human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, gelatin or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; monosaccharides such as xylose, mannose, fructose and glucose; disaccharides such as lactose, maltose and sucrose; trisaccharides such as raffinose, and polysaccharides such as dextran.

Such techniques are disclosed in Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21Ed., published by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, A Wolters Kluwer Company, 2005.","Parenteral formulations to be used for in vivo administration generally are sterile. This is readily accomplished, for example, by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.","Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semi-permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the compound or composition, the matrices having a suitable form such as a film or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides, copolymers of L-glutamic acid and ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the PROLEASE\u00ae technology or LUPRON DEPOT\u00ae (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.

The Examples are included to demonstrate particular embodiments of the disclosure. It should be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the Examples represent techniques and compositions discovered by the inventors to function well in the practice of the disclosure, and thus can be considered to constitute preferred modes for its practice. However, those of ordinary skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. For example, the Examples below provide in vitro methods for testing the compounds of the disclosure. Other in vitro virus infection models include but are not limited to flaviviruses such as bovine diarrheal virus, West Nile Virus, and GBV-C virus, other RNA viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, and the HCV replicon systems (32).

Compounds of this class have antiviral activity as measured in a number of assays described below. A summary of antiviral activity of KIN500 is as follows: the HCV focus-forming assay (FFA) (IC) value was 19.1 \u03bcM; the Influenza nucleoprotein (NP) ELISA (IC) value was 4.6 \u03bcM; the cytotoxicity (CC) value was >50 \u03bcM; and the Therapeutic Index (TI) (CC\/IC) was 11. The data are shown below in Table 5.","Further analog development is carried out for the uracil derivative KIN500, which has an 18-fold enhancement of ISG expression, and potency against influenza virus infection. The compound falls within the accepted range for all Lipinski parameters and possesses rotatable bonds and a polar molecular surface area consistent with a high probability of bioavailability. Stage 1 of analog development carries out metabolic modifications and minimal structure changes. Stage 2 expands the structural diversity around the structural seeds identified in stage 1 and tests a limited number of core variants described below.","As shown in , the structure of KIN500 can be parsed into four regions: Region 1, a uracil core (purple); Region 2, an annulated aryl (brown); Region 3, an appended aryl amide (red); and Region 4, an aryl methylene (green). No overtly reactive groups are present; however, the primary metabolic concern arises from the labile methoxy groups of Region 3.","Methyl ethers commonly undergo demethylation in vivo and the resultant phenolic anilines would be poised to metabolize oxidatively to the highly reactive ortho or para-iminoquinones. This issue can be readily addressed by a survey of metabolically stable substituents arrayed at the labile 2 or 4 positions (, stage 1 metabolic modifications) or by sterically encumbering the oxidizable positions on the aryl ring.","With a molecular weight at the upper range of Lipinski's size constraints (Mr 491) and the rotational flexibility of the Region 3 and 4 side chains, analogs of KIN500 are constructed to define a minimal structure that retains biological activity. These analogs maintain the Region 1 uracil core unaltered while severely reducing or eliminating the Region 2, 3, and 4 appendages (Stage 1: Minimal structure analogs).","Once a minimal structure is identified, a diverse array of side chains varying in length, flexibility\/rigidity, heteroatom content, aryl\/aliphatic ratio, and the like are introduced in the available regions (Stage 2: Expansion of structural diversity). Finally, as the regions surrounding the uracil core are fully optimized, the core itself is modified or replaced to further expand structure\/activity space (Stage 2: Core variants). The listed analogs are examples and are expanded upon once increased activity is observed for a particular structure.","Chemical analogs of KIN500 are tested for in vitro antiviral activity against HCV genotype 2A and influenza A virus (A\/WSN\/33). Viral protein and RNA levels are assessed following drug treatment using the assays described above.","Following several iterative rounds of QSAR, the most attractive analogs from the KIN500 structural class are selected for characterization of their in vitro toxicological and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties and for further mechanistic study. The QSAR studies are designed to provide compounds with picomolar to nanomolar potency, which is adequate to support preclinical development.","In vitro pharmacology. In vitro pharmacology studies are performed to measure performance of the most promising KIN500 analogs in one or more assays of intestinal permeability, metabolic stability and toxicity. Key in vitro characterization studies can include plasma protein binding; serum, plasma, and whole-blood stability in human and model organisms; intestinal permeability; intrinsic clearance; human Ether-a-go-go (hERG) channel inhibition; and genotoxicity.","For each KIN500 analog, an HPLC- and\/or HPLC-mass spectrometry-based analytical method is used to evaluate drug and metabolite concentrations in various test systems. Although the specific analytical method is optimized for each molecule, reverse-phase chromatography can be used alone or in combination with quadrupole mass spectrometry to characterize the identity and purity of molecules. Initially, drug stability over time in increasing concentrations of serum, plasma, and whole blood from mammalian species (such as mouse, cynomolgus macaque, and human) is evaluated by HPLC, and a half-life is determined.","In some instances, prominent metabolites are characterized by mass spectrometry. Human plasma protein binding is evaluated by partition analysis using equilibrium dialysis. For intestinal permeability modeling, apical-to-basolateral flux is assessed in the human epithelial cell line TC7. Hepatic clearance is estimated for a subset of the most promising KIN500 analogs by measuring the rate of disappearance of the parent compound during incubation in human liver microsomes. As above, specific metabolites can be isolated and characterized.","In vitro toxicology. This description of toxicological assays is exemplary and not intended to be limiting. In vitro toxicology studies are performed to evaluate the potential cardiac and genetic toxicity of KIN500 analogs. Automated patch-clamp can be used to assess the impact of each compound on hERG channel currents in a recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line transgenically expressing the human Kv11.1 gene. Concentrations up to the lesser of 30 times the maximum serum concentration or the limit of solubility of each compound are evaluated in order to determine an ICfor the molecule on the hERG channel. A subset of compounds is evaluated over a range of concentrations for their ability to induce mutation reversion in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 or to promote micronucleus formation in CHO cells in culture.","Huh7 cells were grown under normal growth conditions and treated with the indicated amount of drug in media containing 0.5% DMSO. The cells were grown in the presence of drug for 5 hours and then infected with 250 pfu Murine Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) for example obtained from ATCC #VR-129B. Infected cells were grown for an additional 18 hours and then cell viability was measured using an MTS assay. Negative control cells were treated with buffer alone containing 0.5% DMSO.

For the WNV infection model, subcutaneous footpad infection of wild-type C57BI\/6 mice with the virulent lineage 1 strain of WNV (WNV-TX) are performed (29). Non-surgical tracheal instillation is performed for influenza virus strains A\/PR\/8\/34, A\/WSN\/33, and A\/Udorn\/72.","The influenza virus strains used for certain experiments are of two different subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) and exhibit varying pathogenic properties and clinical presentations in C57BI\/6 mice (30). Mice are monitored for morbidity and mortality over a range of challenge doses (such as, 10 to 1,000 pfu of virus) either alone or in combination with KIN500 compound treatment beginning 12 h before or 24 h after infection and continuing daily, subject to the determined plasma half-life of the drug. Compound dose-response analysis and infection time course studies are conducted to evaluate compound efficacy to: 1) limit serum viral load, 2) limit virus replication and spread in target organs, and 3) protect against viral pathogenesis.","For WNV, in addition to serum, viral burden is assessed in lymph nodes, spleen, and brain; for influenza virus, viral burden is assessed in heart, lung, kidney, liver, and brain. Incorporated in the design of these experiments is the determination of an effective dose for 50% and 90% suppression of serum viral load (ED50 and ED90) by each compound after a standard challenge of 100 pfu of WNV-TX or 1,000 pfu of influenza virus. Serum viral loads are determined by qPCR of viral RNA at 24 h intervals following compound treatment. The compound actions are tested at the ED50 and ED90 toward limiting WNV pathogenesis in the cerebral nervous system using a WNV neuroinvasion model of infection (31).","Mice are monitored for morbidity and mortality after standard intracranial challenge of 1 pfu of WNV-MAD, either alone or in combination with compound treatment beginning 24 h after infection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0152","num":"0202"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 5"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Summary of KIN500 Anti-Viral Activity"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"HCV Focus-forming assay (FFA) (IC)","19.1 ","\u03bcM"]},{"entry":[{},"Influenza nucleoprotein (NP) ELISA (IC)","4.6 ","\u03bcM"]},{"entry":[{},"Cytotoxicity (CC)",">50 ","\u03bcM"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Therapeutic index (TI) (CC\/IC)","11"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0153","num":"0203"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00032","num":"00032"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00032","he":"251.71mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US08927561-20150106-C00032.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Aminobenzothiophene 1 (4.8 mmol) is dissolved in hot anhydrous toluene (10 ml).
