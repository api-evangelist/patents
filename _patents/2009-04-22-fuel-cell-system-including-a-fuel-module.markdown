{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under contract number W909MY-08-C-0025, awarded by the Department of Defense. The government has certain rights in this invention.","This application is related to fuel modules for solid oxide fuel cell systems","The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.","Solid oxide fuel cells can generate electricity by electrochemically reacting an oxidant and fuel. Solid oxide fuel cells can be adapted to operate utilizing various fuel compositions including fuels that are commercially available. Exemplary fuels include various hydrogen-containing molecules and mixtures of hydrogen-containing molecules.","Hydrocarbon-based fuels such as fuels that contain propane, butane, and blends of propane and butane, with or without other components are commercially available worldwide. Solid oxide fuels cells can utilize these hydrocarbon-based fuels to generate electricity. Using fuel that is locally commercially available can be advantageous over using fuel that is specifically formulated for fuel cells in that separate distribution networks do not need to be established when utilizing fuels that are already commercially available in the marketplace.","The composition of commercially available fuel can differ in fuel grade, composition of hydrocarbons, fuel purity level, poison level, contamination level, particulate level, and level of fuel additives. In particular, fuel compositions can differ between grades or classifications of fuels or can different within a grade or a classification, that is, a grade or classification specification can allow for ranges of fuel component levels.","For example, in the United States there are multiple grades of commercial propane containing varying amounts of propane, butane, and other light hydrocarbons. Further, fuel compositions can differ based on different fuel composition standards in different parts of the world. For example, the composition of liquefied petroleum gas (\u2018LPG\u2019), an exemplary solid oxide fuel cell fuel that typically includes propane and\/or butane, can vary by a broad range based on regional or country-specific standards.","Fuel can be refined prior to utilization for electrochemical reactions within a solid oxide fuel cell. An internal fuel refining member (for example, a fuel filter) can convert a raw fuel introduced to the fuel cell system to a refined fuel. The refined fuel can provide increased fuel cell performance and fuel cell operating life when compared with the unrefined fuel. The fuel filter and refinement method can be optimized based on the raw fuel composition, impurities levels, and fuel additives. Further, system controls can be optimized based on the raw fuel composition and based on the fuel cell system's capability in refining the raw fuel to the refined fuel.","Fuel can be routed through a fuel filter prior to being routed to the fuel cell to remove potential poisons, contaminants, non-fuel molecules, debris, or other undesirable components contained within the raw fuel. However, if the fuel filter does not have sufficient poison removal properties to refine the fuel, poisons, debris, contaminants, or additives can pass through the fuel filter and degrade the operational performance of the fuel cells.","Since commercially available fuels vary widely in composition, filter design and filtering media composition can vary widely for optimization with the specific fuel composition. For example, a fuel filter may not efficiently remove poisons if the fuel filter is incompatible with the specific fuel utilized or if the fuel filter is utilized beyond the fuel filter's operational lifetime. Further, the wide range of fuel compositions can lead to an undesirably high probability that a fuel filter that is not sufficiently compatible with the fuel composition will be utilized within the fuel cell system, due to, for example, misidentification of fuel or user error. Still further, in order to accommodate a wide-range of fuel compositions, fuel filters can be over-engineered with filtering or poison removal materials that are not utilized for the specific fuel composition, thereby increasing the cost of the fuel filter.","Therefore, improved fuel cell systems utilizing commercially available fuels and improved methods for operating fuel cells with commercially available fuels are needed.","It should be understood that the appended drawings are not necessarily to scale, presenting a somewhat simplified representation of various preferred features illustrative of the basic principles of the invention. The specific design features of the fuel cell will be determined in part by the particular intended application and use environment. Certain features of the illustrated embodiments have been enlarged or distorted relative to others for visualization and understanding. In particular, thin features may be thickened for clarity of illustration. All references to direction and position, unless otherwise indicated, refer to the orientation of the solid state electrochemical device illustrated in the drawings.","In accordance with exemplary embodiments, a fuel cell system includes a fuel module and an energy conversion module. The fuel module includes a fuel tank, a fuel module identification member, and a fuel filter member. The fuel tank includes raw fuel stored therein and the fuel filter member is configured to convert raw fuel to a refined fuel. The fuel module identification member includes fuel module data. The energy conversion module includes a control module and a fuel cell. The control module is configured to access the fuel module data from the fuel module identification member. The fuel cell stack is configured to utilize the refined fuel to generate electrical energy. The fuel module is detachable from the energy conversion module.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A","b":["1","1","10","10","12","14","12","14","12","10","22","14"]},"The exemplary fuel cell system  is connected by coupling a fuel module exit port  of the fuel module  to an energy conversion module receiving port  of the energy conversion module .","The energy conversion module  is sealed to the fuel module  for routing fuel between the energy conversion module  and the fuel module . Further, bracket members  and \u2032 are provided for coupling the fuel module  to the energy conversion module , wherein the bracket members  and \u2032 provide orientation and positioning of the fuel module  relative to the energy conversion module .","In alternative embodiments, other orientation members can be utilized to orient the fuel module  relative to the energy conversion module . Exemplary alternative orientation members include protruding members, recessed portions, interlocking members, tracks, and the like.","In the exemplary fuel cell system , the fuel module  is attached to the outer casing  of the energy conversion module . In alternate embodiments, the fuel module can be detachably coupled to locations inside the outer casing. Alternate embodiments include installation of the fuel filter remote from either the fuel tank or the fuel cell system.

The faceplate includes a power port . The energy conversion module  can generate electricity by reacting fuel from the fuel module  and atmospheric oxygen inputted at the air inlet  in a fuel cell stack  (). The electricity is routed from the fuel cell stack  to the power port , wherein the electricity can be provided for use by an external device (not shown).","The fuel module  further includes a fuel module identification member  configured to signally couple with a communications port  of the energy conversion module .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["12","2","12","30","30","32","34","40","42"]},"The fuel tank  each define an inner chamber with raw fuel disposed therein. The fuel tank  can comprise a commercially available fuel tank and can be made from material generally compatible with the raw fuel. The terms \u201craw fuel\u201d as used herein refer to fuel in a state before being processed for use a fuel cell, for example being processed within a fuel filter. The raw fuel can include any of several commercially available fuels that can be utilized in solid oxide fuel cells to generate electricity. The specific commercially available fuel can vary widely and can be a standard fuel composition for a specific region of the world.","Exemplary fuels include a wide range of hydrocarbon fuels. The raw fuel can contain one or more components that can be partially or completely removed prior to routing the fuel to a fuel cell stack  () of the fuel cell system . In various embodiments of the present disclosure the amount of undesirable components removed by the fuel filter member can vary based on the specific type of raw fuel utilized. For example, in one embodiment, the fuel filter member can remove between one part per million and one hundred parts per million undesirable components from the raw fuel.","Exemplary undesirable components contained within the raw fuel can include sulfur containing molecules and particulates. The raw fuel also can include mixtures comprising combinations of various component fuel molecules, examples of which include gasoline blends, a liquefied natural gas, JP-8 fuel and diesel fuel. Further, in various embodiments, the fuel cell system can utilize fuels having various grades, hydrocarbon ratings, refinement levels and purity levels. Thus, the exact fuel composition is to be understood as to be not limiting on the present disclosure. Exemplary fuels comprise one or more other types of fuels, such as alkane fuels, for example, methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane, along with hydrocarbon molecules with greater number of carbon atoms such as cetane, and the like, and can include non-linear alkane isomers. Further, other types of hydrocarbon fuel, such as partially and fully saturated hydrocarbons, and oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as alcohols and glycols, can be utilized as raw fuel. In one embodiment, the raw fuel comprises an ethyl mercaptan additive, for example, the raw fuel can comprise propane fuel with the ethyl mercaptan additive. In one embodiment the raw fuel contains other sulfur containing molecules, for example, thiophenes, hydrogen sulfides or other mercaptans, in addition to or instead of ethyl mercaptan.","Raw fuel can be routed from the fuel tank  through the fuel valve . The fuel valve  is configured to control whether raw fuel from the fuel tank  is routed to the fuel filter member  and to control the rate of raw fuel being supplied from the fuel tank  to the fuel filter member . The fuel valve  is configured to receive a signal (\u2018VALVE_POSITION\u2019) () from the control system  to control valve actuation and thus control a raw fuel flow rate through the fuel valve .","The fuel filter member  is utilized to process raw fuel to a refined fuel. The fuel filter assembly  includes filtering media  disposed within an inner chamber . The term \u201crefined fuel\u201d as used herein refers to fuel in a state after being processed within the fuel filter member . The filtering media  can comprise one or more filtering or absorbent materials. The filtering media  can be in one of many exemplary forms including filter paper, filter paper with reactive material disposed thereon, a packed bed, beads, foams, fibers, and like forms. Sulfur containing molecules such as ethyl mercaptan additive and other undesirable components can be filtered, captured, or absorbed by the filtering media. Exemplary absorbent components can include silica, for example, silica in the form of silica gel, alumina, and activated copper oxide. Further, the absorbent components can include both components that chemically bond with molecules and components that can physically sieve molecules into storage channels. The fuel filter media  can further include sodium oxide, zinc oxide, silver oxide, calcium oxide, iron (III) oxide, copper and copper oxides, and magnesium oxide, and can include mixtures with water or aqueous forms of the foregoing materials. Although exemplary material is described for an exemplary fuel filter member , one benefit of the fuel cell system  is that it can utilize different fuel filters for operation with different types of fuel and therefore, is adaptable to fuel filter members that vary greatly from the exemplary fuel filter member .","Fuel is routed from the fuel filter member  to the fuel module exit port  and out of the fuel module  to the energy conversion module .","In an exemplary embodiment, the fuel module identification member  utilizes single-wire communication to communicate with the control system  by sending information to and receiving information from a communications bus (not shown) of the control system  via the communications port. The fuel module identification member  sends information to the communications bus during a first time period of each loop cycle and receives information from the communications bus during a second time period of each loop cycle. The specific communications type utilized can depend on, for example, a desired performance level, desired control speed, desired amounts of data transferred, and desired reliability levels. In one embodiment, the control system  utilizes a 1-Wire device from Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. The interconnected circuits or devices employ other interface protocols, such as RS-232, RS-422, RS-423, RS-485, J1708, SPI, Microwire, and I2C can be utilized in other exemplary embodiments.","The fuel module identification member includes a memory device that can store information including preconfigured information and information received from the communications bus and stored for later retrieval. The memory device further includes encrypted handshake data that is communicated to the control system . The encrypted handshake data is accessed by the control system  to authenticate the fuel module . When the control system  cannot authenticate the fuel module , the control module  will control the fuel valve  to maintain a shut position and not accept fuel from the fuel module. Thus, the fuel cell system  can prevent the use of unauthorized or counterfeit fuel that can degrade operational performance of the fuel cell system.","In an exemplary embodiment, the useful operating life of the fuel filter member  is matched with the total amount of fuel stored in the fuel tank  such that useful operating life of the fuel filter member  is substantially depleted when a level of fuel equal to the total capacity of the fuel tank  is depleted. Matching the fuel filter life with the fuel capacity of the fuel module, provides a cost advantage in that excess absorbent material is not wasted within the fuel filter member. Further, the fuel filter member  is engineered for the fuel composition of raw fuel within the fuel tank  and provides appropriate refinement of the raw fuel such that the refined fuel will not degrade operation performance of the fuel cells within fuel cell system  while not including absorbent or filtering material that is not needed for the specific raw fuel composition. In one embodiment, the useful life of the fuel filter member  is tracked on the fuel module identification member. The useful life of the fuel filter member can be measured at a fuel distribution center during refueling of the fuel module to determine when fuel filter replacement is needed. Further, in one embodiment, the useful life of the fuel filter member can be monitored by the control system  during and the control system  can provide fuel filter life information to the user and can notify the user when filter replacement is required.","In one embodiment, the fuel module identification member  includes software that is uploaded to the energy conversion module . The uploaded software can include updates, patches, and software optimized for the specific fuel module.","Referring to  the fuel cell system  includes a control system (\u2018CONTROL SYSTEM\u2019) , a fuel cell stack  (\u2018STACK\u2019) disposed within an insulative body (not shown), an anode air pump  (\u2018ANODE AIR PUMP\u2019), a cathode air pump  (\u2018CATHODE AIR PUMP\u2019), a fuel valve  (\u2018VALVE\u2019), and a recuperator  (\u2018RECUPERATOR\u2019).

Signals monitored by the control system  include an ambient pressure (PRESSURE_AMBIENT) from an ambient pressure sensor , an ambient temperature (\u2018TEMPERATURE_AMBIENT\u2019) from an ambient temperature sensor , actual fuel flow rate (\u2018FLOWRATE_FUEL\u2019) from a fuel flow rate sensor , an actual anode air flow rate (\u2018FLOWRATE_ANODEAIR\u2019) from anode air flow rate sensor , a reactor temperature (\u2018TEMPERATURE_REACTOR\u2019) from a temperature sensor  proximate internal reformation reactors disposed within fuel cell tubes of the fuel cell stack , and an interconnect temperature (\u2018TEMPERATURE_INTERCONNECT\u2019) from a temperature sensor  disposed proximate interconnect members at the exhaust ends of fuel cell tubes of the fuel cell stack .","The control system  is configured to provide signals to send commands to component actuators of the fuel cell system . The signals commanded by the control system  include the first valve position (\u2018VALVE_POSITION\u2019), a second valve position (\u2018VALVE_POSITION\u2019), an anode air pump power level (\u2018POWER_ANODEPUMP\u2019), a coil power (\u2018POWER_COIL\u2019), and a cathode air pump power level (\u2018POWER_CATHODEPUMP\u2019).","The cathode air pump  pumps ambient air through the recuperator  and into the fuel cell stack  and an exhaust fan (not shown) pulls exhaust gases (\u2018EXHAUST\u2019) away from the fuel cell stack . The fuel valve  controls fuel flow from the fuel module  to the fuel cell stack  and the anode air pump  pumps ambient air to the fuel cell stack , wherein the ambient air and fuel are combined. The coil  comprises a resistant heating coil that can heat fuel and air that pass through the fuel cell stack  to combust the air and fuel.","The fuel cell stack  comprises a plurality of solid oxide fuel cell tubes, along with various other components, for example, air and fuel delivery manifolds, current collectors, interconnects, and like components, for routing fluid and electrical energy to and from the component cells within the fuel cell stack . The solid oxide fuel cell tubes electrochemically transform the fuel gas into electricity and exhaust gases. The actual number of solid oxide fuel cell tubes depends in part on size and power producing capability of each tube and the desired power output of the SOFC. Each solid oxide fuel cell includes an internal reformer disposed therein. The internal reformer can refine fuel such that the reformed fuel can be reacted at an anode of the fuel cell tube. For exemplary fuel cell tubes, and stack see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/979,017 to Crumm et al, which is hereby incorporated by references in its entirety and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/991,268 to Crumm et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","The control system  comprises a microprocessor configured to execute a set of control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in storage mediums to provide the respective functions. The control system  can monitor input signals from sensors disposed throughout the fuel cell system  and can execute algorithms in response to the monitored input signals to execute commands to control power, reactant flows, and component operations of the fuel cell system . Monitor communications bus created with tank one-wire chips, not just sensor inputs.","A fuel module data signal (\u2018MODULE_DATA\u2019) is communicated between the fuel module identification member  of the fuel module  and the control system . The module identification signal comprises filter assembly information such as component signals shown in  including a fuel module lifespan capacity level (\u2018LIFESPAN CAPACITY\u2019), a chamber volume level (\u2018CHAMBER VOLUME\u2019), a remaining filter life level (\u2018FILTER LIFE\u2019), a raw fuel type (\u2018FUEL TYPE\u2019), a fuel tank capacity (\u2018FUEL TANK CAPACITY\u2019), a remaining fuel level (\u2018FUEL REMAINING\u2019), and shelf life parameter for storage sensitive filter media (\u2018SHELF LIFE DATE\u2019).","The lifespan capacity level represents an overall amount of useable life of the fuel module and can be determined based the remaining fuel level or the remaining filter life. The exemplary lifespan capacity level is a fixed value stored (i.e., factory configured value) in the data storage media of the filter data module . In one embodiment, the lifespan capacity level can include multiple values, wherein each value contains a lifespan capacity level for a type of fuel utilized within the fuel cell system . The lifespan capacity level can be received by the control system . The lifespan capacity level can be utilized by the control system in various algorithms, calculations and\/or look-up tables as will be described in further detail below. In alternate embodiments, the filter data can further include override data for near end of filter life in critical applications, fuel cell system operation history and variable lifespan based on type of fuel tank, fuel manufacturer or batch purity, and location or region-based fuel variations.","The fuel type indicates the raw fuel composition that is supplied from the fuel tank . The control system  can utilize the raw fuel type to determine a control scheme for operating the fuel cell stack . For example, the control system  can determine air to fuel ratios within the fuel cell system based on the raw fuel type. Further, the control system  can operate utilizing a raw fuel even when the fuel filter member is passed its useful life when the raw fuel is not of a type that will significantly degrade operational lifetime of the fuel cell stack . The control system  can also operate utilizing a raw fuel even when the fuel filter member is passed its useful life when the application for critical applications either with or without operator interaction.","The chamber volume level indicates the amount of fluid, for example, ambient air that can occupy the fuel filter chamber  during operation of the fuel filter member . The fuel filter member  can regulate fluid flow by maintaining the pressure level within the pressure band, and therefore a separate regulator component is not required for accurate pressure regulator. During operation of the fuel filter member , air passes into the filter until a pressure (hereafter, pressure A) is registered, and then the valve  is subsequently shut. The fuel cell system converts the fuel within the fuel filter displaced volume until a lower pressure level (hereafter, pressure B) is reached within the chamber  of the fuel filter member . When pressure value B is reached, the valve between the fuel tank and fuel filter opens and the chamber  is pressurized up to pressure A. Therefore, the chamber volume is utilized by the control system  to determine values within feedback control algorithms and values for controlling the fuel valve  to provide selected levels of fuel pressure to the downstream fuel cell stack .","The remaining filter life level indicates a remaining filtering capacity of the fuel filter member . The fuel tank capacity indicates overall fuel storage volume within the fuel tank . The remaining fuel level indicates a level of raw fuel remaining within the fuel tank  available for utilization by the fuel cell stack .","Each of the fuel level remaining, the filter life remaining, and the fuel module life remaining (each of which will be general designated Life Remaining) can be updated at each loop cycle time N (hereafter, Life Remaining (N)) and is continually received by control system  such that the control system  utilizes the Life Remaining (N) to determine a Life Remaining for a next loop cycle time (N+1) according to equation (1), below:\n\nLife Remaining()\u2212Usage()=Life Remaining(1)\u2003\u2003(1)\n","In one embodiment, the usage (N) value is a fixed value such that the control system  counts down remaining filter life in fixed increments during each loop cycle. In one embodiment, the usage (N) value is calculated based on the fuel flow rate (\u2018FLOW RATE FUEL\u2019) detected by the fuel flow sensor . In one embodiment, the usage (N) value can be determined based on the type of raw fuel or based on both the type of raw fuel and the filtering capability of the fuel filter member , wherein the filtering capability of the fuel filter member  is selected based on the type of raw fuel. In alternative embodiments, other control conditions within the fuel cell system  such as temperature levels and other fluid flow rates within the fuel cell system are utilized. In an exemplary embodiment, the control system  is continually comparing the remaining filter life to a first threshold filter life and the control system  is configured to command system shutdown (by discontinuing fueling to the fuel cell stack ) when one of the fuel module life falls below the first fuel module life. In an exemplary embodiment, the control system  is continually comparing the remaining fuel module life to a second threshold fuel module life and the control system  is configured to send a warning signal to a fuel cell user when the remaining fuel module life falls below the second threshold fuel module life. In one embodiment, the fuel cell system  includes a user override function so that the user can continue operating the fuel cell system  when the control system  is actively sending the warning signal.","Referring to , in an alternative embodiment, a fuel module identifier (\u2018FUEL MODULE\u2019)  sends fuel module classification information (\u2018FUEL MODULE CLASS\u2019) to the control system  and the control system  utilizes a lookup table  to determine a fuel module lifespan capacity level (\u2018LIFESPAN CAPACITY\u2019), a chamber volume level (\u2018CHAMBER VOLUME\u2019), and a raw fuel type (\u2018FUEL TYPE\u2019), a fuel tank capacity (\u2018FUEL TANK CAPACITY\u2019).","The control calculator  is utilized to control actuators of the fuel cell system  and can be utilized to update the filter life level at each loop cycle. A remaining filter life level (\u2018FILTER LIFE\u2019), a remaining fuel level (\u2018FUEL REMAINING\u2019), and a fuel module life (\u2018FUEL MODULE LIFE\u2019) is continuously communicated between the fuel module identifier to the control calculator .","In other embodiments, optimal system control parameter of fuel cell systems can vary based on the fuel module. In one embodiment, a preferred air-to-fuel ratio provided to a fuel reformer of the fuel cell system can vary based on the fuel module identification signal. For example, information from the combination of filter type and fuel type could be utilized to determine operating set points, such as fuel cell stoichiometry, fuel reforming conditions, target operating temperatures, and fuel utilization limitations. The information transmitted to the control system  from the fuel module  can be used to notify the operator of additional operational functionality or constraints for the fuel cell system, for example, the ability to invert the fuel filter or fuel tank during operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["110","112","114","112","114","118","114","112"]},"The fuel module  includes a commercial fuel tank  comprising a commercially available raw fuel therein that is retrofitted with filtering module  including a fuel identification member  disposed at an end of the fuel feed tube .
