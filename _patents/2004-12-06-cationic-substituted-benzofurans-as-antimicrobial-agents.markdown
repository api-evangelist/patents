Method B: linear gradient 30-75% solvent B in 10 min, hold for 2 min. The flow rate was maintained at 1.5 mL\/min. Column and flash chromatography was carried out using Fisher Davisil\u00ae 60A (200-425 mesh). Melting points were determined on a Thomas Hoover (Uni-Melt) capillary melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Gemini2000 NMR spectrometer (300 MHz) and are reported in ppm (\u03b4) relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. Unless otherwise stated, DMSO-dwas used as solvent and the following abbreviations are used: singlet (s), dublet (d), dublet dublet (dd), triplet (t), multiplet (m), broad (br). Coupling constants (J values) are given in hertz (Hz). Elemental analyses were obtained from Atlantic Microlab Inc. (Norcross, Ga.) and are within 0.4% of the theoretical values unless otherwise noted. Low-resolution mass spectra were obtained on Aligent 1100 MS using electrospray ionization. The compound was determined to be \u201cconsistent\u201d with the chemical formula if the mass measurement was within 0.5 pm relative M+H of exact monoisotopic mass.","The purity of isolated final compounds (1-79) was greater then 95% on analytical reverse phase HPLC and was achieved by recrystallization from 1.5 M aqueous HCl\/EtOH mixtures. When necessary, preparative reverse phase HPLC was performed on an automated Varian ProStar Chromatography Workstation, equipped with PS-701 fraction collector, solvent pumps PS-215, head size 50 mL, UV-VIS ProStar 320 Detector (\u03bb=254 nm) and Dynamax\u00ae-60A\u00b0 (41\u00d7250 mm) preparative column. The eluents employed were phase A: formic acid (40 mM) and ammonium formate (10 mM) in 100% of water and phase B: formic acid (40 mM), ammonium formate (10 mM) in 75% acetonitrile and 25% of water. The program ran as follows. Method C: linear gradient 0-100% solvent B in 35 min, hold for 5 min. The flow rate was held constant at 40 mL\/min. The purified fractions were evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in water, the solution was frozen at \u221278\u00b0 C. and lyophilized twice on VirTisBenchTop 2K lyophilizer at \u221252\u00b0 C. and 45-70 millitorr. Acquired bis-amidines, as free bases, were dissolved in ethanol and converted into their HCl salts with 3 M aqueous HCl.","All chemicals and solvents were purchased from Aldrich chemical Co., Fisher Scientific, or Acros organics.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0281","num":"0334"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00022","num":"00022"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00022","he":"229.95mm","wi":"75.01mm","file":"US07417158-20080826-C00022.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0282","num":"0335"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00023","num":"00023"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00023","he":"209.30mm","wi":"75.95mm","file":"US07417158-20080826-C00023.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0283","num":"0336"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00024","num":"00024"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00024","he":"134.45mm","wi":"74.59mm","file":"US07417158-20080826-C00024.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0284","num":"0337"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00025","num":"00025"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00025","he":"106.26mm","wi":"75.52mm","file":"US07417158-20080826-C00025.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0285","num":"0338"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00026","num":"00026"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00026","he":"119.97mm","wi":"149.01mm","file":"US07417158-20080826-C00026.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0286","num":"0339"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00027","num":"00027"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00027","he":"211.75mm","wi":"75.52mm","file":"US07417158-20080826-C00027.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0287","num":"0340"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00028","num":"00028"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00028","he":"191.18mm","wi":"75.27mm","file":"US07417158-20080826-C00028.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"2-((4-Amidinobenzofuran-2-yl)methyl)benzofuran-4-carboxamidine dihydrochloride (1). Representative procedure. A mixture of dry 1,4-dioxane (40 mL) and dry EtOH (10 mL) in a 3-neck 250 mL flask equipped with a gas inlet tube, a thermometer, and a drying tube, was saturated with gaseous HCl at 0\u00b0 C. 2-((4-Cyanobenzofuran-2-yl)methyl)benzofuran-4-carbonitrile (86) (1.42 g, 4.8 mmol) was added in one portion, the flask was sealed, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature until the starting material was no longer detectable by HPLC (1 day). The reaction mixture was diluted with dry ether and the diimidate was filtered off under argon, washed with diethyl ether and dried under high vacuum to give 2.11 g (96%), which was reacted immediately with appropriate amines.","The diimidate (0.70 g, 1.5 mmol) was suspended in dry EtOH saturated with gaseous ammonia (19 mL). The sealed reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature. The progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC. After 4 days the reaction mixture was diluted with diethyl ether (50 mL) and placed in a freezer overnight. The resulting precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration, washed with diethyl ether and dried under high vacuum to give 0.45 g (89%) of crude material, which was recrystallized from 1.5 M HCl to afford 1, as a brown solid (0.14 g, 21%): mp 310-311\u00b0 C.

Compounds with an amidine group in the 5-position of the benzofuran system and with the diether linking group in the 4\u2032-position of the A ring and the 4\u2033-position of the B ring appear to be the most active molecules in this series. The toxicity profile of these compounds against J774 macrophages, however, parallels the antiparasitic activity.","Referring now to Table II, several members of the isopropyl amidine series of unsymmetrical benzofurans possess antileishmanial activity similar to pentamidine against amastigote-like organisms, although none in this series are as active as the amidine-containing unsymmetrical benzofurans. As in the amidine series, compounds with the diether linking group in the 4\u2032-position of the A ring and the 4\u2033-position of the B ring appear to be the most active molecules in this series. Again, little selectivity for parasites compared to J774 macrophages is seen.","Referring now to Table III, the imidazoline-containing unsymmetrical benzofuran 70 is as active as any of the amidine-containing compounds and also possesses modest (5-fold) selectively for axenic amastigotes over J774 macrophages. All of the other imidazoline-containing compounds were at least 10-fold less active against , even those that also possess the diether linking group in the 4\u2032-position of the A ring and the 4\u2033-position of the B ring. This observation suggests that alkyl chain length has an important effect on antileishmanial activity in the imidazoline series.","Referring now to Table IV, in the 2-aryl benzofuran series, dications comprising an amidine group in the 4\u2032-position are the most active, with isopropyl amidines and imidazolines again displaying lower activity. Analogs with a methoxy group in the 7-position of the benzofuran system have high antileishmanial activity.","Referring now to Table V, bis-benzofurans 11 and 8 are among the most active benzofuran-containing dications tested thus far against axenic amastigotes. Preliminary structure-activity studies indicate that these 5,5\u2032- and 6,6\u2032-substituted compounds are more active than 4,4\u2032-substituted bis-benzofurans. The amidines again appear more potent than the isopropyl amidines or imidazolines. Most importantly, 11 and 8 appear to be much less toxic to macrophages than , being 41- and 14-fold more active against the parasites compared to the mammalian host cells,
