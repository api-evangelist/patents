{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to a hand apparatus, in particular a tool for working with soil and other loose materials, such as sand or snow, that can be folded on itself.","Hand-operated apparatuses of various kinds for working the soil by hand have always been used by man in farm work. They generally consist of an elongate connecting element, made of wood or metal, to which is connected at one of the two ends the real working tool, generally metallic, having different shapes, depending on the function to perform. The other end of the connecting element serves as a handle to allow the use of the tool.","Although, to maintain economically acceptable quantitative standards, the agricultural field is now largely mechanized, manual tools are still used in the cultivation of small parcels of land, in gardening and small home maintenance operations.","Tools of this type are also supplied in equipment kits to army personnel.","Moreover, recently the market of these tools has also turned to fields other than agriculture, such as sports, in particular mountain climbing and hiking, and in camping equipment.","Consequently, foldable hand apparatuses that can be placed in compact spaces and thus carried where they are to be used, even in remote places, are preferable over traditional ones, whose length could be a hindrance in transportation.","Prior art foldable hand apparatuses, in their most rudimental form, have a simple single joint, generally arranged on the connecting element, and can be folded so that the tool fastened at one end folds back on the other end, the one forming the handle. Unfortunately, the size of the apparatus, even when folded, is not always sufficiently compact to allow it to be easily carried, for example inside a rucksack.","To resolve this problem, the document WO96\/41513 issued to Fiskars Consumer OY AB discloses a foldable hand apparatus provided with two joints: a first pin rotatably connects the tool to the connecting element, while a second pin rotatably connects the connecting element to the handle. In this manner, the size of the folded apparatus is rather compact.","One drawback found in that known solution lies in the fact that both said two joints have axes of rotation that are transversal to the connecting element and parallel to each other: in this manner, when a force is applied on the apparatus during its normal use, there is the risk that one of the two pins, particularly the second one, that is under the greater strain, yields, thus causing the tool to accidentally fold back on itself at an inappropriate moment. This problem is already pointed out in the above-mentioned document which, in fact, to avoid this problem, proposes an apparatus provided with a further element, a slidable sleeve arranged to protect and reinforce the second joint, which must be lifted to perform the actions of opening\/folding the apparatus, thus making them rather complicated and time-consuming.","In addition, since the apparatus must be such as to be used by both right-handed and left-handed users, the handle has been proposed in a triangular shape and rather narrow, to contain its size: for this reason, it may be found to be not very practical for a user that grips it wearing gloves.","The main objective of the subject matter of the present invention is to overcome the drawbacks of the known art by devising a multipurpose hand apparatus that is particularly practical to use and carry.","In the scope of the above objective, one purpose of the present invention is to realize a hand apparatus that can be placed in a very limited space when not in use and that has a particularly compact shape, without projecting portions, so as to make it easier and safer to carry the same even inside a rucksack.","At the same time, however, the apparatus of the present invention must be able to reassure the user against the possibility of undesirable and accidental closing of the same during its use.","Another purpose of the present invention is to provide an easy-to-use apparatus in which the operations of opening or folding it back upon itself are as simple and fast as possible.","Another purpose of the present invention is to achieve a multipurpose apparatus that can be completely and easily disassembled and reassembled for its maintenance.","A further purpose of the invention is to realize a foldable apparatus in which the hand tool can be easily replaced to modify its shape on the basis of necessity and that is also easily adaptable to be used by a left-handed person.","One not least important purpose is to devise a foldable apparatus that can be easily made with the usual well-known systems, machinery and equipment.","The above objective and purposes, and others that will be more evident later herein, are achieved through the construction of an apparatus as defined by claim .","With reference to the above-mentioned figures, in particular , a foldable multifunction apparatus  is shown comprising an elongate connecting element , extending along a first axis X-X, to which are rotatably connected, at one of the two ends, a hand tool , and at the opposite end, a gripping means , or handgrip.","As will be explained later in greater detail, the tool  and the handgrip  can be opened in a first extended, working position, and a second retracted position, in which both are folded on the connecting element ; in addition to said two positions, the tool  can also be set in one or more stable intermediate positions to better adapt to the different working conditions.","The rotatable connection of the tool  to said connecting element  is achieved by the interposition of a first joining element , such as a first sleeve, while the rotatable connection of the grip means  to said connecting element  is achieved thanks to the interposition of a second joining element , such as a second sleeve.","In the enclosed figures, the tool  has the shape of a shovel for tilling the soil, but there is nothing preventing it from having other shapes, such as for example a snow shovel or a pick; in effect, one purpose of the present invention is to make it possible to interchangeably mount different tools on the same support structure.","Said connecting element  consists substantially of an elongate hollow body, preferably cylindrical, that extends along a first longitudinal axis X-X, and includes a first end portion A, provided with a first pair of facing holes , designed to be received inside a corresponding hollow end portion A of said first sleeve , which also has a longitudinal extension along the same axis X-X.","Said first sleeve  also includes a second hollow portion B, that extends perpendicularly to said first portion A, substantially along a second axis Y-Y, so that all in all the first sleeve  is in the shape of a T.","The first sleeve  can be made as an integral part or the two portions perpendicular to each other can be assembled at a separate moment, for example by welding.","Said second hollow portion B is closed at both ends by the closing side walls , each of them provided with a second pair of facing holes A, preferably arranged in the central portion. One of the two closing walls  is also provided with a further through hole B, arranged off-centre with respect to the central portion of the same wall.","Two shoulders A, B, arranged facing each other, rise substantially at right angles on the surface of said tool , preferably at an edge portion, to which they are fastened by conventional fastening means.","Said two shoulders A, B are positioned at a reciprocal distance such as to allow the insertion between them of the second portion B of said first sleeve , so that the external surfaces of the closing walls  are respectively in contact with the facing surfaces of the shoulders A and B.","In addition, on said two shoulders A and B there is a third pair of holes , that makes it possible to rotatably articulate said tool  on said first sleeve , around a first transversal pin  that extends substantially along said second axis Y-Y. Said first pin  may consist, for example, of a male screw and a female screw that are joined to each other by interposing, if necessary, sealing washers, and a Belleville washer to restrain the rotation.","Said first pin  is suitable to also cross the second pair of holes A, in addition to the third pair of holes , so as to rotatably connect the tool  to the first sleeve , and the first pair of holes  provided on the portion of the first end A of the connecting element  to fasten the latter stably to the first sleeve .","On one of the two shoulders (A in the figures), in particular the one that comes into contact with the wall  of the first sleeve  provided with the offset hole B, is provided a plurality of through holes, generally indicated in the figures by reference number : each of said plurality of holes , by interacting with a first control means  as will be explained later, determines a position of the tool  with respect to the connecting element . In addition, on the top edge of the same shoulder A is also provided a recessed portion  which, by interacting with said first control means , defines the fully closed position of the tool  with respect to the connecting element .","In fact, in said offset hole B is to be inserted said first control means , such as a push button, opposed by a first resilient means A, such as a compression spring inserted in the offset hole B substantially coaxially with said first push button .","The functioning of this first rotatable connection between the tool  and the connecting element  is as follows: the head B of said first push button  is adapted to interact with said plurality of holes , by inserting itself selectively into one of them, thus locking the rotation of the tool  around said first pin  and consequently fixing a working position of the tool  with respect to the connecting element .","To vary the position of the tool , it is necessary to apply an axial force on the push button  such as to overcome the opposing force exerted by said spring A: in this manner, the head B of said second push button  becomes detached from the hole in which it was engaged, thus freeing the rotation of the tool  around the pin .","Then, by releasing the push button  and rotating the tool  so that the head B can exit again from a different hole of said plurality of holes , the tool  is locked in a different working position.","Advantageously, and as shown in the enclosed figures, the plurality of holes  includes three holes A, B and C, arranged substantially along an arc, which determine respectively a first position in which the tool  extends along the X-X axis, that is useful for example for a user in the snow, a second position in which the tool  is rotated 45\u00b0 around the Y-Y axis in the direction of rotation shown by the arrow A in , that is advantageous for example when used in working with soil, and a third position in which the tool  is rotated 90\u00b0 around the Y-Y axis, to be used for example as a hoe. Naturally, it will be sufficient to add additional holes on said shoulder A to allow different inclinations of the tool , also based on the use of a type of tool different from the one shown in the figures, such as for example a pick.","Finally, to obtain the position in which the tool  is completely folded back upon the connecting element , as shown in , it is necessary for the head B of the first push button  to be arranged so as to be engaged in the seat , thus preventing the backward rotation of the tool .","Advantageously, the end A of said connecting element  can be cut according to an inclined plane to avoid interfering with the movement of the first push button .","The second end portion B of the connecting element , opposite to said first end portion A, is provided with a fourth pair of facing holes , arranged at a 90\u00b0 angle with respect to said first pair of holes . The second end portion B is adapted to be received inside a second joining element  that rotatably connects said connecting element  to said gripping means , or the handgrip of the tool.","Said second joining element , or second sleeve, consists substantially of a first hollow, elongate portion A joined preferably without discontinuity to a second portion B having at least one wider section and including at least two flattened faces having, at the central portion, a fifth pair of facing holes .","Only one of the two flattened faces, in the figures the one facing upwards, is crossed by a further hole , arranged off-centre and offset axially in the direction of the handgrip , in which are inserted coaxially a second control means , such as a second push button, and an opposing resilient means A, such as for example a compression spring.","The head wall  of the second sleeve  is rounded and provided with an elastically deformable portion , suitable to interfere as a cam with a corresponding wall  provided in the body of the handgrip , as will be explained in greater detail later.","The handgrip  includes a rigid body having a substantially \u201cL\u201d shape, in which a first side A extends substantially along said first axis X-X, and a second portion B, arranged preferably perpendicularly to said first portion A, is adapted to be gripped by the user both when using the apparatus  and also when carrying the same apparatus in its completely folded configuration.","Said first portion A ends with two facing portions A, B jutting toward the connecting element , that is, two shoulders on which is provided a sixth pair of holes ; in addition, one of said two shoulders, indicated in the figures with reference number A, is provided with a further off-centre hole .","The distance between said two shoulders A, B is such as to allow the insertion between them of the second portion A of the second sleeve , so that the fifth pair of holes  overlaps the sixth pair of holes  and the hole  in which the second push button  is inserted overlaps the off-centre hole .","A second pin , for example in the form of a male screw inserted into a female screw, extending along a third axis Z-Z perpendicular to both said first axis X-X and said second axis Y-Y, makes it possible to rotatably join the handgrip  to the second sleeve , as well as to stably join the connecting element  to the second sleeve : said second pin  is in fact suitable to cross, respectively, the sixth pair of holes , the fifth pair of holes , and the fourth pair of holes .","The operation of the rotating connection between said connecting element  and said grip means  is as follows: when the apparatus  is in a fully open configuration, the head B of said second push button  engages in the opening of the offset hole  of the gripping means , locking in this manner the relative rotation of the two elements around the axis Z-Z, defined by the pin .","This position is maintained stable, thanks also to the action of the elastically deformable portion , which, having a cam-like profile with respect to the position of the second pin , comes to interfere with a corresponding projecting wall  provided inside the handle body , as shown in ,  and . In this manner, the friction between the elastically deformable portion  and the wall  is increased by effect of the springback of the elastically deformable portion  on the wall  caused by the mutual interference.","The complete folding back of the handle  is possible through its rotation around the Z-Z axis, as indicated by the arrow B of : the user must apply an axial force on the second push button  to oppose the resilient action of the spring A, so that the head B of the same push button becomes disengaged from the off-centre hole , thus freeing the rotation of the handgrip  around the pin .","The user can then move the handle  by rotating it around the third axis Z-Z until it is folded back against the connecting element , which movement is opposed only initially by the interference between the elastically deformable portion  and the wall .","The configuration of the handle  completely bent backward, shown in , is maintained thanks simply to the frictional action exerted by the second push button , the head of which B is made to adhere against the internal surface of the shoulders A, B by the action of the spring A, as well as by the friction exerted by the second pin  against the wall of the fifth pair of through holes .","When wishing to open the apparatus  from the folded-back configuration it is necessary to rotate the handle  in the opposite direction until the head B of the second push button  becomes engaged again inside the off-centre hole .","Advantageously, the head of said first and second push button B, B can be shaped in the form of a variable radius cusp, so as to favour, after the action of the user on the push button, the fast disengagement of the same push button from a hole of said plurality  provided on the shoulder of the tool  and from the off-centre hole , allowing the rotation of the handle  around the second pin .","As can be immediately sensed by an expert in the field, the apparatus  according to the present invention may be easily modified in order to telescopically extend the connecting element , with widely known means and procedures, so as to make it adjustable in length.","From the above, it is thus evident how a foldable multipurpose apparatus according to the present invention achieves the initially foreseen purposes and advantages. In fact, an apparatus according to the present invention is absolutely practical to use and can be stored in a very small space when not in use.","When folded, the apparatus has a compact shape, without projecting portions, so as to make it easier and safer to carry the apparatus inside a rucksack.","The particular nature of an apparatus  according to the present invention lies in the fact that the tool element  is articulated at one end A of the connecting element  around a second axis Y-Y transversal to the first axis X-X along which said connecting element  extends, while the handle  is articulated at the opposite end B of the connecting element  around a third axis Z-Z transversal to said first axis X-X, so that said second axis Y-Y and said third axis Z-Z are perpendicular to each other. In this manner, there is a considerably reduced possibility of the tool accidentally closing when being used.","In addition, the actions required to switch from a position in which the apparatus is completely open, thus when both the tool  and the handgrip  are extended, to a position in which the apparatus is completely retracted, or the situation in which both the tool  and the handle  are folded over the connecting element , and vice versa, are easy and intuitive, and can be carried out in a few instants.","Moreover, advantageously, the structure of an apparatus according to the present invention gives it the maximum versatility, as it is possible to replace the tool  to make it more suitable for a changed situation, or in case of breakage, simply by operating on a single element, that is, on the first pin .","The same can be said when wishing to adapt the apparatus for use by a left-handed user: this can be easily done by simply acting on the second pin , rotating by 180\u00b0 the whole unit formed by the second sleeve  and the handle , and then closing the second pin  again.","Further, the particular shape of the handle  has been suitably devised for easy handling even by a user wearing gloves.","Moreover, as the tool of the present invention can be completely disassembled, it can also be disposed of once it is no longer usable, according to the material of each component, thus avoiding the undifferentiated disposal and favouring the salvaging\/recycling of materials.","Advantageously, a multipurpose apparatus according to the present invention can be easily made with the usual well-known systems, machinery and equipment.","Naturally, the present invention can lead to numerous applications, modifications or variants, without thereby departing from the scope of protection, as defined by the appended claims.","Moreover, the materials and equipment used to achieve the present invention, as well as the shapes and dimensions of the individual components, can be the most suitable for the specific requirements."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":["Advantages and characteristics of the invention will be evident from the description which follows, by way of non-limiting example, with reference to the enclosed figures, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIGS. 3 and 4","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIGS. 5 and 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
