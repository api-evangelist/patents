title: System and method to enable power related decisions to start additional workload based on hardware power budget in a virtulization environment
abstract: An information handling system includes a first power detector that detects a first power level of the information handling system, a second power detector that detects a second power level of the information handling system, and a virtual machine manager. The virtual machine manager is operable to receive the first power level and the second power level, apportion a first portion of the first power level to a first workload instantiated on the information handling system, apportion a second portion of the first power level to a second workload instantiated on the information handling system, apportion a first portion of the second power level to the first workload, and apportion a second portion of the second power level to the second workload.

No. 12\/695,591, entitled \u201cSystem and Method to Enable Power Related Decisions in a Virtualization Environment,\u201d filed on Jan. 28, 2010, the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This disclosure relates generally to information handling systems, and relates more particularly to enabling power related decisions in an information handling system.","As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option is an information handling system. An information handling system generally processes, compiles, stores, or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements can vary between different applications, information handling systems can also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information can be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data memory, or global communications. In addition, information handling systems can include a variety of hardware and software resources that can be configured to process, store, and communicate information and can include one or more computer systems, data memory systems, and networking systems. An information handling system can include virtual machines that run multiple operating systems and applications on a common host system.","The use of the same reference symbols in different drawings indicates similar or identical items.","The following description in combination with the Figures is provided to assist in understanding the teachings disclosed herein. The following discussion will focus on specific implementations and embodiments of the teachings. This focus is provided to assist in describing the teachings, and should not be interpreted as a limitation on the scope or applicability of the teachings. However, other teachings can be used in this application. The teachings can also be used in other applications, and with several different types of architectures, such as distributed computing architectures, client\/server architectures, or middleware server architectures and associated resources.","For purposes of this disclosure, an information handling system can include any instrumentality or aggregate of instrumentalities operable to compute, classify, process, transmit, receive, retrieve, originate, switch, store, display, manifest, detect, record, reproduce, handle, or use any form of information, intelligence, or data for business, scientific, control, entertainment, or other purposes. For example, an information handling system can be a personal computer, a PDA, a consumer electronic device, a network server or storage device, a switch router, wireless router, or other network communication device, or any other suitable device and can vary in size, shape, performance, functionality, and price. The information handling system can include memory (volatile such as random-access memory), nonvolatile such as read-only memory or flash memory) or any combination thereof), one or more processing resources, such as a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU), hardware or software control logic, or any combination thereof. Additional components of the information handling system can include one or more storage devices, one or more communications ports for communicating with external devices, as well as various input and output (I\/O) devices such as a keyboard, a mouse, a video\/graphic display, or any combination thereof. The information handling system can also include one or more buses operable to transmit communications between the various hardware components. Portions of an information handling system may themselves be considered information handling systems.","Portions of an information handling system, when referred to as a \u201cdevice,\u201d a \u201cmodule,\u201d or the like, can be configured as hardware, software (which can include firmware), or any combination thereof. For example, a portion of an information handling system device may be hardware such as, for example, an integrated circuit (such as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), a structured ASIC, or a device embedded on a larger chip), a card (such as a Peripheral Component Interface (PCI) card, a PCI-express card, a Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) card, or other such expansion card), or a system (such as a motherboard, a system-on-a-chip (SoC), or a stand-alone device). Similarly, the device could be software, including firmware embedded at a device, such as a Pentium class or PowerPC\u2122 brand processor, or other such device, or software capable of operating a relevant environment of the information handling system. The device could also be a combination of any of the foregoing examples of hardware or software. Note that an information handling system can include an integrated circuit or a board-level product having portions thereof that can also be any combination of hardware and software.","Devices or programs that are in communication with one another need not be in continuous communication with each other unless expressly specified otherwise. In addition, devices or programs that are in communication with one another may communicate directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","130","140","150","160","110","120","130","140","115","125","135","145","115","125","135","145","150","150","160","115","125","135","145","150","150"]},"Virtual machine manager  functions to create one or more workloads in virtual environment .

A virtual machine manager similar to virtual machine manager  is connected to each power status module, and is implemented in one or more of the information handling systems to create the workloads across the information handling systems. For example, the virtual machine manager can be implemented on a single information handling system, the functionality of the virtual machine manager can be distributed on two or more information handling systems, or each information handling system can include a virtual machine manager that works in conjunction with the virtual machine managers in the other information handling systems.","In operation, power detector module  provides an indication to power status module  of the power being supplied by power supply .
