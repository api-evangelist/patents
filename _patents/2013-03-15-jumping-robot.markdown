{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/625,881, filed on Apr. 18, 2012, which is incorporated by reference herein.","This invention was made with government support under CNS0721441 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in this invention.","The disclosure relates generally to robots and more particularly to a jumping robot.","Many robots with jumping ability are known. For these traditional designs, jumping is accomplished by an instant release of the energy stored in the robot. As a result, all the robots with jumping ability can be classified by their energy storage methods. The most popular conventional method to store the energy is based on traditional springs such as compression, extension, or torsion springs. One exemplary jumping robot uses a motor-driven ball screw to charge and release a compression spring. In another example, the energy in an extension spring is stored and released through a geared six-bar mechanism. Yet a further example utilizes a slip gear system to store and release the energy in an extension spring via a four-bar mechanism.","Still another conventional robot employs a planetary gear train and a one-way clutch, where a conical spring directly strikes the ground. Prior prototype robots employ a motor driven eccentric cam to charge a torsion or two extension springs that actuates rear legs. A wheel-based, stair-climbing robot with soft landing ability has a jumping mechanism based on four compression springs. Another exemplary version, known as the EPFL jumper, can achieve a jumping height about 1.4 m with torsion springs charged and released by a motor driven cam system; see Kovac, M. et al., \u201cA Miniature 7 g Jumping Robot,\u201d Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Robot. Autom. (2008) at 373-378. This robot was later modified to add self-recovery capability and jumping direction changing ability; see Kovac, M. et al., \u201cSteerable Miniature Jumping Robot,\u201d Auton. Robots, Vol. 28, No. 3 (2010) at 295-306; and Kovac, M. et al., \u201cA Miniature Jumping Robot with Self-Recovery Capabilities,\u201d Proc. IEEE\/RSJ Int. Conf. Intell. Robots Systems (2009) at 583-588. In another construction, a multimodal robot can jump up to 1.7 m based on two symmetrical extension spring-actuated four-bar mechanisms.","A second traditional method for energy storage is based on elastic elements such as customized special springs. A scout robot employs a motor-driven winch to charge a single bending plate spring and release it to directly strike the ground for jumping. A conventional compact jumping robot utilizes an elastic strip to form closed elastica, which is actuated by two revolute joints. With two symmetrical power springs made of carbon fiber strips as legs, another conventional microbot charges its springs with dielectric elastomer actuators. In another example, known as the Jollbot, a spherical structure formed by several metal semi-circular hoops is used to store energy in the hoops by deforming its spherical shape. A similar conventional idea is utilized in a deformable robot, but the material for hoops is replaced by shape memory alloy.","A third conventional method to store energy for jumping is based on compressed air. In this method, a robot usually carries an air tank and a pneumatic cylinder. The sudden release of air in the tank will force the cylinder to extend. A traditional rescue robot and a patrol robot employ cylinder extension to strike the ground for jumping. Instead of striking the ground, the jumping ability of another traditional robot, known as a quadruped Airhopper, is accomplished by several cylinder-actuated four-bar mechanisms. With a biped structure, another exemplary robot, different from other pneumatic-based jumping robots, uses several pneumatic artificial muscles for jumping.","In addition to the preceding, there exist several other known devices. A pendulum jumping robot is based on the principle that momentum will be generated from swinging arms during human jumping. Furthermore, a jumping robot developed by the Sandia National Labs uses the energy from hydrocarbon fuels and can achieve a significant jumping height. Another robot is based on microelectromechanical (\u201cMEMS\u201d) technology and has a small jumping height. Finally, an additional robot uses a voice coil actuator to charge energy into an electrical capacitor instead of a mechanical structure.","It is noteworthy, however, that traditional jumping robots are either too heavy, too expensive or too large. Furthermore, most conventional robots disadvantageously require multiple actuators which quickly use considerable battery power. While such robots may be needed for space exploration, their weight and size prevent them from achieving desired jumping heights and distances.","In accordance with the present invention, a jumping robot is provided. In another aspect, a jumping robot weighs less than 50 grams, jumps at least 20 cm high and has a maximum linear dimension of 10 cm. A further aspect provides a robot that employs a single electromagnetic actuator that actuates at least two of: jumping, steering and\/or self-righting. Still another aspect employs multiple jumping robots that communicate with a remote communications station and\/or each other either airborne or on the ground.","The present jumping robot is advantageous over traditional devices. For example, the present jumping robot is light weight and of small size thereby allowing it to achieve long jumping distances or large jumping heights. Furthermore, the present jumping robot is multifunctional in its movements driven by a single actuator; this assists with realizing the light weight, small size and low cost while requiring minor battery power such that more than 100 jumps can be made on a single battery charge. The present jumping robot is ideally suited for mass production so many of them can be used at a natural disaster site or in a war zone to locate victims or targets, respectively. The low cost nature avoids the need for recovery of the robot after use while allowing for many robots to be employed at a single site. Moreover, the significant jumping height allows for line-of-sight and\/or airborne sensing and communications over rubble and other ground obstacles. The height of the jump provides a greater sensing and communications coverage area as well. Additional advantages and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description and appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","The preferred embodiment of a jumping robot  as shown in , includes a body , a jumping mechanism , a steering and transmission mechanism , a self-righting mechanism  and a single actuator . An accessory assembly  is also mounted to body  and includes solar panels  for generating electricity, sensors , a communications transmitter and receiver , an antenna , a battery  and a microprocessor based controller . The robot employs four mechanisms. The first one is jumping mechanism  that transforms stored energy into the kinetic energy for take-off. The second one is an energy or crank device that charges the energy and releases it instantly. The third one is self-righting mechanism  to have the robot stand up from any landing posture. The last one is steering mechanism  that changes the jumping direction of robot .","A. Jumping Mechanism:","Reference should be made to , -,  and . Torsion springs  are used to store energy since they can be implemented in a small size and light weight, they are off-the-shelf components which can be easily obtained at low cost, and good performance can be achieved. A spring-actuated six-bar mechanism  includes a pair of legs  coupled to body  by pivot pins  at hip joints and to foot  by pivot pins  at ankle joints. Each leg  is divided into two parts: an upper leg or femur  and a lower leg or tibia . The femur and tibia are joined at a knee joint  via a pivot pin  such that knee joints  bend outwardly away from each other. Each pair of adjacent leg parts act as elongated links connected by articulated revolute joints and they can rotate relative to each other. Therefore, jumping can be modelled by a planar parallel mechanism with foot  functioning as a fixed base, body  as the moving platform, and the two legs  as kinematic chains connecting the fixed base and moving platform.","The jumping mechanism, shown in , is symmetric with respect to a vertical line \u2032. Six revolute joints are placed at A, B, C, D, E, and F. A coordinate frame is established with an X axis along {right arrow over (ED)}, and a Y-axis along {right arrow over (00)}\u2032. The link lengths are denoted as\n\n|,and .\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nA vertical distance y is between AB and ED, and the angle \u03b1 is between {right arrow over (AB)} and {right arrow over (BC)}, and an angle \u03b2 is between {right arrow over (DC)} and X. The mechanism has three planar degrees of freedom from the Kutzbach-Gr\u00fcbler mobility formula. Nevertheless, if eight torsion springs with spring constant k are placed at A, B, E, and D, two springs for each place, then the springs can be charged to store energy if a vertical downward force F is applied at point O\u2032, and the energy is released once F is removed.\n","For energy storage, an analysis of how much force F, varying with y, is needed to charge the spring is as follows. Since the mechanism is symmetric with respect to OO\u2032, a static analysis for one side is sufficient. Free body diagrams for links AB, BC, and CD are illustrated in , where all the forces are decomposed along the coordinate frame axes. Note that all of the component forces along the same axis, except F, have the same quantity, although the directions may be opposite. Fand Fdenote the same quantity along the x axis and y axis, respectively. The static equations for the three links are:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"F","mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["F","y"]}}}},{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03c4","mn":"1"},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"\u03c0","mn":"2"},"mo":"-","mi":"\u03b1"}}}},{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":["F","x"]},{"mi":"l","mn":"2"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["sin","\u03b1"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"msub":[{"mi":["F","y"]},{"mi":"l","mn":"2"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["cos","\u03b1"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}],"mo":"+"}],"mo":"="}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03c4","mn":"2"},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"\u03c0","mn":"2"},"mo":"-","mi":"\u03b2"}}}},{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mo":"-","msub":{"mi":["F","x"]}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"msub":{"mi":"l","mn":"3"},"mi":["sin","\u03b2"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"msub":[{"mi":["F","y"]},{"mi":"l","mn":"3"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["cos","\u03b2"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}],"mo":"+"}],"mo":"="}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}]}}},"br":{},"sub":["1 ","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"F","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"kl","mn":"3"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"\u03c0","mo":"-","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"\u03b1"}}}},"mi":["sin","\u03b2"]},{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"kl","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"\u03c0","mo":"-","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"\u03b2"}}}},"mi":["sin","\u03b1"]}],"mo":"+"},{"msub":[{"mi":"l","mn":"2"},{"mi":"l","mn":"3"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mrow":{"mi":"sin","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["\u03b1","\u03b2"],"mo":"+"}}}}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"4"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["c","1","4","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["y","C"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mi":"y","mn":"2"},{"mrow":[{"mi":"y","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msubsup":[{"mi":"l","mn":["2","2"]},{"mi":"l","mn":["3","2"]}],"mo":"-"}}},{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"e"}]}],"mo":["-","+"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["l","d"]},"mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"e"}},"mo":"\u2062","msqrt":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"l","mn":"2"},{"mi":"l","mn":"3"}],"mo":"+"}},"mn":"2"},"mo":"-","mi":"e"}},{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":"e","mo":"-","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"l","mn":"2"},{"mi":"l","mn":"3"}],"mo":"-"}},"mn":"2"}}}],"mo":"\u2061"}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"5"}}]}}}}},"where e=l\/4+yand l=l\u2212l.

Energy Mechanism:","Based on the jumping mechanism, another energy mechanism is needed to store energy in the spring and release it when necessary. Referring to FIGS.  and -, a single direction rotation of actuator , which is an electric motor, is used for energy storage and release, leading to a short cycle time. This can be achieved by a slip-gear system, an eccentric cam or a variable length crank mechanism. Preferably, a one way bearing is employed. The energy mechanism, shown in an intermediate position in , can apply force F in  and remove it instantly. A rotating link or crank arm  is connected to an output shaft  of a speed reduction transmission (having rotating gears  driven by actuator ) via a one way bearing ; therefore, it can only rotate in the counterclockwise direction as illustrated. A cable  or other flexible member connects the end of rotation link to the base or foot  of the robot, and two pulleys  are used for cable guidance. When crank  rotates counterclockwisely (as illustrated) from a bottom vertical initial position, cable  will be pulled up, and body  will be forced to move towards base or foot  into a \u201ccocked\u201d and retracted position, as shown in . Once crank  passes a top vertical position shown in , the energy will be released due to one way bearing , which has internal compression spring biasing.","With such a mechanism, a vertical downward force is applied for energy storage. For optimization this force is related to torque generated by a speed reduction system. This can be achieved by static analysis for crank . As can be observed in , lis the length of crank , lis the vertical length from the end of crank  to a center of pulley , and \u03c6\u2208[0, \u03c0] is the rotation angle. Then the required torque T at angle \u03c6 should be equal to the torque generated by F with respect to pivot point O:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00005","num":"00005"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"T","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["Fl","a"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["l","a"]},{"mi":["l","b"]}],"mo":"+"}}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["sin","\u03d5"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"msqrt":{"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["l","a"],"mn":"2"},"mo":["+","-"],"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["l","a"]},{"mi":["l","b"]}],"mo":"+"}},"mn":"2"},"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["l","a"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["l","a"]},{"mi":["l","b"]}],"mo":"+"}}},"mi":["cos","\u03d5"]}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"8"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["y=y","l","l","+l","l","l","+l","l","l","+l","l","l","+l","l"],"sub":["max","d","a","b","a","a","b","d","a","b","a","a","b","b"],"sup":["2","2","2","2"]},"C. Self-Righting Mechanism:","With the above two mechanisms, the robot can jump if the robot initially stands with its foot on the ground. Nevertheless, after the robot jumps into the air and lands on the ground, this optimal orientation may not occur due to the landing impact. Therefore, as illustrated in , , -, and ; self-righting mechanism  is needed to make robot  recover from possible side landing orientations. The active self-righting mechanism is based on two active self-righting arms . The robot has a generally rectangular external shape, and two side surfaces are significantly larger than the other four end, top and bottom surfaces. As a result, most of the time the robot will contact the ground  with one of these two large surfaces after landing. Without a loss of generality, a landing posture as shown in  can be assumed. Self-righting arms  are coupled to body and nominally retracted initially parallel to the robot's two largest side surfaces . When actuated, arms  rotate simultaneously in opposite directions such that an end of the lower arm pushes against ground . After a certain amount of arm advancing rotation, the robot can stand up and be ready for the next jump. The final position, when both arms  are fully extended, is shown in .","The details of a driving device  are shown in . Each arm  is connected to body  via a revolute joint . One arm has an elongated and straight groove or enclosed slot , and a follower pin  projects adjacent an end of the other mating arm, such that pin  slides along groove  in a slave-like manner. In this way, if an upward force is applied on pin , both arms  will rotate but in opposite directions. A torsion spring  has one end fixed to body  and the other end attached to the adjacent arm . If the upward force is removed, then both arms  will return to their retracted original positions due to the biasing torque from the single torsion spring .","Referring now to , robot  applies an upward force without using another actuator. Note that body  moves towards foot  during the energy storage process. With this motion, a protrusion  upwardly projects from foot  and beneath pin , and the upward force will be generated once protrusion  contacts pin . If the energy is released, the body will move away from the foot; consequently, the upward force is removed when the body is a far enough distance away from the foot. Accordingly, the charge of the spring and the self-righting mechanism can be performed simultaneously because the motion from the charge of the spring is used for self-righting. This coupling motion advantageously reduces the cycle time for jumping. Again, all the motion can be advantageously accomplished with one directional rotation of single electromagnetic actuator .","D. Steering Mechanism:","The final mechanism to realize the jumping motion sequence is steering mechanism , which can change the jumping direction without requiring an additional actuator. The steering mechanism is based on the speed reduction transmission in the energy mechanism. Since all the above-mentioned motions can be achieved using one directional rotation, the steering mechanism can be actuated by the same multi-functional motor actuator , but with rotation in another direction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIGS. 5","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["17","18","171","173","41","133","171","133","41","171","85","41","171","41","91","171"]},"Alternately, a single large gear at the end of the speed reduction transmission acts as the steering gear. Due to its large diameter, the alternate steering gear touches the ground beyond the outer robot surfaces regardless of which largest surface of the robot contacts the ground. This method, although simpler, has a slow steering speed because the angular velocity of the large gear is small. The preferred design, however, solves this disadvantage by using two gears next to the motor output pinion gear so that their angular velocities are larger.","E. Optimal Design of Jumping Mechanism and Energy Mechanism:","With the jumping mechanism and the energy mechanism, if the same energy in the spring can be charged with a small peak value of torque T generated by the speed reduction system, then the weight and size for the speed reduction system can be reduced. Therefore, mechanism optimization is desirable to minimize the peak value of T. The optimal design calculations are set forth as follows. The optimization is achieved following the procedure of identifying the optimization variable, formulating the objective function, obtaining the constraints, and solving the constrained optimization problem. To perform an optimal design, the optimization variables should be first identified.

In other words, k, l, and y are either constants or can be obtained from l, l, l, l, and \u03c6. Furthermore, the torsion springs are chosen to have a constant k=58.98 Nmm\/rad (preferably obtained from McMaster Carr as part no. 9287K77). Moreover, lis represented as a function of l, l, and las will be shown in what follows. Let ybe the final minimum distance for y when the spring is fully charged, then l=(y\u2212y)\/2.

The optimization is performed by dense discretization of \u03c6 and evaluating the value at the resulting points. The constrained nonlinear multivariable function in the Optimization Toolbox is employed to find the optimal value.

Tail Assisted Orientation Control:","Referring to , a tail  includes an elongated rigid link or rod member  with negligible mass, and an enlarged weight or ballast  attached adjacent a distal end thereof. The other end of rod  is rigidly connected to a rotor or tail gear , for movement therewith, which engages and is driven by a smaller diameter motor output gear . A small, fractional horsepower, electric tail motor  drives motor gear  through its central axis. In this way, movement of tail  is controlled by controlling the motor's rotation. If the air resistance is negligible, the angular momentum of robot  in mid-air is a constant. Therefore, if tail  rotates, robot body  will also rotate to conserve the angular momentum. Accordingly, a pitch angle of jumping robot  is automatically controlled by rotating tail .","A schematic diagram of robot  in the air is shown in , where robot  is represented as body  or \u2018B\u2019 and tail  or \u2018A\u2019 is connected at an active revolute joint at point \u2018C\u2019. The mass for body  and tail  are denoted as mand m, respectively. Furthermore, the body angle and tail angle with respect to a horizontal line are labeled as \u03b8and \u03b8, respectively. The center of mass for the tail, body, and whole robot are at points A, B, and O, respectively. Moreover, a length for link AC and link BC are land l, respectively. As shown, a coordinate system OXY is established with the origin at the robot's center of mass, X axis along the horizontal direction, and Y axis along the vertical direction. The moment of inertial is designated as land lfor the tail and body, respectively. During the jumping motion, the system's angular momentum will be reserved. Thus, if tail  rotates in a clockwise direction, then body  rotates in the counterclockwise direction to conserve the angular momentum.

Accordingly, such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the disclosure, and all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIGS. 8-10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIGS. 11 and 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 13"],"b":"14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIGS. 19 and 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIGS. 21 and 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIGS. 23 and 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 28","FIG. 27"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 29","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 30","FIG. 29"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 31","FIG. 29"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 32","FIG. 29"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 33","FIG. 29"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
