No. PCT\/JP2014\/057949 filed on Mar. 14, 2014 which designates the United States, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, and which claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Applications No. 2013-054371, filed on Mar. 15, 2013, No. 2013-054372, filed on Mar. 15, 2013, No. 2013-110330, filed on May 24, 2013, No. 2013-110443, filed on May 24, 2013, No. 2013-146882, filed on Jul. 12, 2013, No. 2013-153815, filed on Jul. 24, 2013, No. 2013-244411, filed on Nov. 26, 2013, and No. 2014-019469, filed on Feb. 4, 2014, incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a powder container for storing toner that is powder used by an image forming apparatus, such as a printer, a facsimile machine, a copier, or a multifunction peripheral with multiple functions of the printer, the facsimile machine, and the copier, and also relates to an image forming apparatus including the powder container.","2. Description of the Related Art","In electrophotographic image forming apparatuses, a powder replenishing device supplies (replenishes) toner that is powder from a toner container serving as a powder container containing the toner to a developing device. A toner container described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2012-133349 includes an opening arranged on one end of the toner container, a nozzle receiver provided at the opening to receive a conveying nozzle that includes a powder receiving hole for receiving toner from the toner container, a rotary conveyor that rotates to convey the toner toward the powder receiving hole, and a gear that meshes with a container driving gear of a main-body of the image forming apparatus to transmit a driving force to the rotary conveyor. When the toner container is attached to the powder replenishing device, the gear meshes with the container driving gear on the opening side relative to the powder receiving hole in the longitudinal direction of the toner container. In this configuration, the influence of the arrangement of the gear can be reduced when the toner is transferred to the powder receiving hole of the conveying nozzle, and the toner can be transferred more smoothly than in a conventional configuration.","However, if the gear of the container is driven, a pressure generated at a position where the gear and the container driving gear of the main-body mesh with each other is applied to the toner container or the conveying nozzle. Therefore, if an attached position of the toner container with respect to the powder replenishing device is not determined, a load on the conveying nozzle or the nozzle receiver increases, so that the conveying nozzle or the nozzle receiver may be broken or a gap may be generated between the conveying nozzle and the nozzle receiver resulting in toner leakage.","The present invention has been made in view of the abovementioned issues, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a powder container and an image forming apparatus that are capable of improving the performance to transfer powder from the powder container to the toner replenishing device and capable of reducing a load due to the drive transmitted by the container driving gear.","According to an embodiment, a powder container contains powder used for forming an image and to be attached to an image forming apparatus. The image forming apparatus includes: a conveying nozzle to convey the powder; a powder receiving hole of the conveying nozzle to receive the powder from the powder container; an apparatus main-body gear to transmit a driving force to the powder container; and a container receiving section that includes the conveying nozzle and receives the powder container. The powder container includes: an opening that is at one end of the powder container in a longitudinal direction; a nozzle receiver at the opening to receive the conveying nozzle; a conveyor to convey the powder; and a container gear to drive the conveyor by meshing with the apparatus main-body gear. The container gear is to mesh with the apparatus main-body gear at a position closer to the opening than the powder receiving hole in the longitudinal direction, and the opening is to mate with the container receiving section.","Various embodiments of the present invention will be explained below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the embodiments, the same components or components with the same functions are denoted by the same reference numerals and symbols, and the same explanation will not be repeated. The descriptions below are mere examples and do not limit the scope of the appended claims. Furthermore, a person skilled in the art may easily conceive other embodiments by making modifications or changes within the scope of the appended claims; however, such modifications and changes obviously fall within the scope of the appended claims. In the drawings, Y, M, C, and K are symbols appended to components corresponding to yellow, magenta, cyan, and black, respectively, and will be omitted appropriately.","First Embodiment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0204","num":"0203"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["500","500","500","100","200","400","100"]},"Four toner containers  (Y, M, C, K) serving as powder containers corresponding to different colors (yellow, magenta, cyan, black) are detachably (replaceably) attached to a toner container holder  serving as a container holding section provided in the upper part of the printer . An intermediate transfer device  is arranged below the toner container holder .","The intermediate transfer device  includes an intermediate transfer belt  serving as an intermediate transfer medium, four primary-transfer bias rollers  (Y, M, C, K), a secondary-transfer backup roller , multiple tension rollers, an intermediate-transfer cleaning device, and the like. The intermediate transfer belt  is stretched and supported by multiple roller members and endlessly moves in the arrow direction in  along with rotation of the secondary-transfer backup roller  that serves as one of the roller members.","In the printer , four image forming sections  (Y, M, C, K) corresponding to the respective colors are arranged in tandem so as to face the intermediate transfer belt . Four toner replenishing devices  (Y, M, C, K) serving as powder supply (replenishing) devices corresponding to the four toner containers  (Y, M, C, K) of the four colors are arranged below the toner containers , respectively. The toner replenishing devices  (Y, M, C, K) respectively supply (replenish) toner that is powder developer contained in the toner containers  (Y, M, C, K) to developing devices of the image forming sections  (Y, M, C, K) for the respective colors. In the embodiment, the four image forming sections  (Y, M, C, K) form an image forming unit.","As illustrated in , the printer  includes an exposing device  serving as a latent-image forming means below the four image forming sections . The exposing device  exposes and scans the surfaces of photoconductors (Y, M, C, K) serving as image bearers (to be described later) with light based on image information of an original image read by the scanner , so that electrostatic latent images are formed on the surfaces of the photoconductors. The image information may be input from an external apparatus, such as a personal computer, connected to the copier , instead of being read by the scanner .","In the embodiment, a laser beam scanning system using a laser diode is employed as the exposing device . However, other configurations, such as a configuration including an LED array, may be employed as the exposing means.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0210","num":"0209"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"46"},"The image forming section Y includes the drum-shaped photoconductor Y. The image forming section Y includes a charging roller Y serving as a charging device, a developing device Y serving as a developing means, a photoconductor cleaning device Y serving as a cleaning device, and a neutralizing device, all of which are arranged around the photoconductor Y. Image forming processes (a charging process, an exposing process, a developing process, a transfer process, and a cleaning process) are performed on the photoconductor Y, so that a yellow toner image is formed on the photoconductor Y.","The other three image forming sections  (M, C, K) have almost the same configurations as the image forming section Y for yellow except that colors of toner to be used are different, and toner images corresponding to the respective toner colors are formed on the photoconductors (M, C, K). Hereinafter, explanation of only the image forming section Y for yellow will be given, and explanation of the other three image forming sections  (M, C, K) will be omitted appropriately.","The photoconductor Y is rotated clockwise in  by a drive motor. The surface of the photoconductor Y is uniformly charged at a position facing the charging roller Y (charging process). Subsequently, the surface of the photoconductor Y reaches a position of irradiation with laser light L emitted by the exposing device , where an electrostatic latent image for yellow is formed through exposure scanning (exposing process). The surface of the photoconductor Y then reaches a position facing the developing device Y, where the electrostatic latent image is developed with yellow toner to form a yellow toner image (developing device).","The four primary-transfer bias rollers  (Y, M, C, K) of the intermediate transfer device  and the photoconductors  (Y, M, C, K) sandwich the intermediate transfer belt , so that primary transfer nips are formed. A transfer bias with polarity opposite to the polarity of toner is applied to the primary-transfer bias rollers  (Y, M, C, K).","The surface of the photoconductor Y, on which the toner image is formed through the developing process, reaches the primary transfer nip facing the primary-transfer bias roller Y across the intermediate transfer belt , and the toner image on the photoconductor Y is transferred to the intermediate transfer belt  at the primary transfer nip (primary transfer process). At this time, a slight amount of non-transferred toner remains on the photoconductor Y. The surface of the photoconductor Y, from which the toner image has been transferred to the intermediate transfer belt  at the primary transfer nip, reaches a position facing the photoconductor cleaning device Y. At this position, the non-transferred toner remaining on the photoconductor Y is mechanically collected by a cleaning blade included in the photoconductor cleaning device Y (cleaning process). The surface of the photoconductor Y finally reaches a position facing the neutralizing device, where the residual potential on the photoconductor Y is removed. In this way, a series of image forming processes performed on the photoconductor Y is completed.","The above image forming processes are also performed on the other image forming sections  (M, C, K) in the same manner as the image forming section Y for yellow. Specifically, the exposing device  arranged below the image forming sections  (M, C, K) emits laser light L based on image information toward the photoconductors  (M, C, K) of the image forming sections  (M, C, K). More specifically, the exposing device  emits the laser light L from a light source and irradiates each of the photoconductors  (M, C, K) with the laser light L via multiple optical elements while performing scanning with the laser light L by a rotating polygon mirror. Subsequently, toner images of the respective colors formed on the photoconductors  (M, C, K) through the developing process are transferred to the intermediate transfer belt .","At this time, the intermediate transfer belt  moves in the arrow direction in  and sequentially passes through the primary transfer nips of the primary-transfer bias rollers  (Y, M, C, K). Therefore, the toner images of the respective colors on the photoconductors  (Y, M, C, K) are superimposed on the intermediate transfer belt  as primary transfer, so that a color toner image is formed on the intermediate transfer belt .","The intermediate transfer belt , on which the color toner image is formed by superimposing the toner images of the respective colors, reaches a position facing a secondary transfer roller . At this position, the secondary-transfer backup roller  and the secondary transfer roller  sandwich the intermediate transfer belt , so that a secondary transfer nip is formed. The color toner image formed on the intermediate transfer belt  is transferred to a recording medium P, such as a sheet of paper, conveyed to the position of the secondary transfer nip, due to, for example, the action of a transfer bias applied to the secondary-transfer backup roller . At this time, non-transferred toner which has not been transferred to the recording medium P remains on the intermediate transfer belt . The intermediate transfer belt  that has passed through the secondary transfer nip reaches the position of the intermediate-transfer cleaning device, where the non-transferred toner remaining on the surface is collected. In this way, a series of transfer processes performed on the intermediate transfer belt  is completed.","Movement of the recording medium P will be explained below.","The recording medium P is conveyed to the secondary transfer nip from a feed tray  provided in the sheet feeder  arranged below the printer  via a feed roller , a registration roller pair , and the like. Specifically, multiple recording media P are stacked in the feed tray . When the feed roller  is rotated counterclockwise in , the topmost recording medium P is fed to a nip between two rollers of the registration roller pair .","The recording medium P conveyed to the registration roller pair  temporarily stops at the position of the nip between the rollers of the registration roller pair , the rotation of which is being stopped. The registration roller pair  is rotated to convey the recording medium P toward the secondary transfer nip in accordance with the timing at which the color toner image on the intermediate transfer belt  reaches the secondary transfer nip. Accordingly, a desired color image is formed on the recording medium P.","The recording medium P on which the color toner image is transferred at the secondary transfer nip is conveyed to the position of a fixing device . In the fixing device , the color toner image transferred on the surface of the recording medium P is fixed to the recording medium P by heat and pressure applied by a fixing belt and a pressing roller. The recording medium P that has passed through the fixing device  is discharged to the outside of the apparatus via a nip between rollers of a discharge roller pair . The recording medium P discharged to the outside of the apparatus by the discharge roller pair  is sequentially stacked, as an output image, on a stack section . In this way, a series of image forming processes in the copier  is completed.","A configuration and operation of the developing device  in the image forming section  will be explained in detail below. In the following, the image forming section Y for yellow will be explained by way of example. However, the image forming section  (M, C, K) for the other colors have the same configurations and perform the same operation.","As illustrated in , the developing device Y includes a developing roller Y serving as a developer bearer, a doctor blade Y serving as a developer regulating plate, two developer conveying screws Y, a toner density sensor Y, and the like. The developing roller Y faces the photoconductor Y. The doctor blade Y faces the developing roller Y. The two developer conveying screws Y are arranged inside two developer accommodating sections, i.e., first and second developer accommodating sections Y and Y. The developing roller Y includes a magnet roller fixed inside thereof and a sleeve that rotates around the magnet roller. Two-component developer G containing carrier and toner is stored in the first developer accommodating section Y and the second developer accommodating section Y. The second developer accommodating section Y communicates with a toner dropping passage Y via an opening provided in the upper side thereof. The toner density sensor Y detects toner density in the developer G stored in the second developer accommodating section Y.","The developer G in the developing device  circulates between the first developer accommodating section Y and the second developer accommodating section Y while being stirred by the two developer conveying screws Y. The developer G in the first developer accommodating section Y is supplied to and borne on the surface of the sleeve of the developing roller Y due to a magnetic field generated by the magnet roller in the developing roller Y while the developer G is being conveyed by one of the developer conveying screws Y. The sleeve of the developing roller Y rotates counterclockwise as indicated by an arrow in , and the developer G borne on the developing roller Y moves on the developing roller Y along with the rotation of the sleeve. At this time, the toner in the developer G electrostatically adheres to the carrier by being charged to the potential opposite to the polarity of the carrier due to triboelectric charging with the carrier in the developer G, and is borne on the developing roller Y together with the carrier that is attracted by the magnetic field generated on the developing roller Y.","The developer G borne on the developing roller Y is conveyed in the arrow direction in  and reaches a doctor section where the doctor blade Y and the developing roller Y face each other. The amount of the developer G on the developing roller Y is regulated and adjusted to an appropriate amount when the developer G passes through the doctor section, and then conveyed to a development area facing the photoconductor Y. In the development area, the toner in the developer G adheres to the latent image formed on the photoconductor Y by a developing electric field generated between the developing roller Y and the photoconductor Y. The developer G remaining on the surface of the developing roller Y that has passed through the development area reaches the upper side of the first developer accommodating section Y along with the rotation of the sleeve. At this position, the developer G is separated from the developing roller Y.","The developer G in the developing device Y is adjusted so that the toner density falls within a predetermined range. Specifically, toner contained in the toner container Y is replenished to the second developer accommodating section Y by the toner replenishing device Y (to be described later) in accordance with the amount of toner consumed from the developer G in the developing device Y through the development. The toner replenished to the second developer accommodating section Y circulates between the first developer accommodating section Y and the second developer accommodating section Y while being mixed and stirred with the developer G by the two developer conveying screws Y.","Next, the toner replenishing device  (Y, M, C, K) will be explained.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0229","num":"0228"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["32","60","32","70"]},"Toner contained in the toner containers  (Y, M, C, K) attached to the toner container holder  of the printer  is appropriately replenished to the developing devices (Y, M, C, K) in accordance with the consumption of toner in the developing devices  (Y, M, C, K) for the respective colors as illustrated in . At this time, the toner in the toner containers  (Y, M, C, K) is replenished by the toner replenishing devices  (Y, M, C, K) provided for the respective colors.","As illustrated in , among the four toner containers  (Y, M, C, K), the size of the toner container K containing black toner is different from the sizes of the toner containers  (Y, M, C) containing yellow toner, magenta toner, and cyan toner. Specifically, the diameter of the toner container K is greater than those of the other toner containers. Therefore, it becomes possible to reduce the frequency of replacement of the toner container K containing black toner that is frequently used.","As for the toner replenishing devices  (Y, M, C, K), the shape of the toner replenishing device K to which the toner container K containing black toner is attached is different from the shapes of the toner replenishing devices (Y, M, C) to which the toner containers  (Y, M, C) containing yellow toner, magenta toner, and cyan toner are attached, in accordance with the shapes of the toner containers .","Incidentally, the toner replenishing devices  and the toner containers  have almost the same configurations except that the colors of toner to be used in the image forming processes and the diameters of the toner containers  are different. Therefore, only the toner replenishing device Y and the toner container Y for yellow will be explained below, and explanation of the toner replenishing devices  (M, C, K) and the toner containers  (M, C, K) for the other three colors will be omitted appropriately. In the following, components configured in different manners for different colors may be denoted by symbols Y, M, C, and K indicating the respective colors, and components configured in the same manner for all of the colors and components common to all of the colors may be denoted by a symbol (Y, M, C, K) or may be denoted without symbols.","The toner replenishing device  (Y, M, C, K) includes, as illustrated in , the toner container holder , a conveying nozzle  (Y, M, C, K) serving as a conveying pipe, a conveying screw  (Y, M, C, K) serving as an apparatus main-body conveyor, the toner dropping passage  (Y, M, C, K), and a container rotating part  (Y, M, C, K) serving as a driving part.","When a user performs attachment operation to push the toner container Y in the attachment direction indicated by an arrow Q in  and  and the toner container Y is moved inside the toner container holder  of the printer , the conveying nozzle Y of the toner replenishing device Y is inserted from a front side of the toner container Y in the attachment direction along with the attachment operation. Therefore, the toner container Y and the conveying nozzle Y communicate with each other. A configuration for the communication along with the attachment operation will be described in detail later.","As an example of the toner container, the toner container Y is a toner bottle in the form of an approximate cylinder. The toner container Y mainly includes a container front end cover Y serving as a container cover or a held portion that is non-rotatably held by the toner container holder , and includes a container body Y serving as a powder storage integrated with a container gear Y serving as a gear of the container. The container body Y and the container gear Y may be integrally provided as a single part or as a couple of separate parts. The container body Y is rotatably held by the container front end cover Y. In other words, the container cover is a member that can rotate relative to the container gear.","As illustrated in , the toner container holder  mainly includes a container cover receiving section , a container receiving section , and an insertion hole part . The container cover receiving section  is a section for holding the container front end cover Y and the container body  of the toner container Y. The container receiving section  is a section for supporting the container body Y of the toner container Y. An insertion hole serving as an insertion opening used in the attachment operation of the toner container Y is defined by the insertion hole part . When a main-body cover arranged on the front side of the copier  (the front side in the direction normal to the sheet of ) is opened, the insertion hole part  of the toner container holder  is exposed. Then, attachment\/detachment operation of each of the toner containers  (Y, M, C, K) (attachment\/detachment operation with the longitudinal direction of the toner containers  taken as an attachment\/detachment direction) is performed from the front side of the copier  while each of the toner containers  (Y, M, C, K) is oriented with its longitudinal direction being parallel to the horizontal direction. Incidentally, a setting cover Y in  is a part of the container cover receiving section  of the toner container holder .","The container receiving section  is provided such that its longitudinal length becomes approximately the same as the longitudinal length of the container body Y. The container cover receiving section  is arranged on a container front side of the container receiving section  in the longitudinal direction (attachment direction), and the insertion hole part  is arranged on a container rear side of the container receiving section  in the longitudinal direction (attachment direction). The four toner containers  are able to move on the container receiving section  in a sliding manner. Therefore, along with the attachment operation of the toner container Y, the container front end cover Y first passes through the insertion hole part , slides on the container receiving section  for a while, and is finally attached to the container cover receiving section .","While the container front end cover Y is attached to the container cover receiving section , the container rotating part (driving part) Y including a driving motor, a driving gear, or the like as illustrated in  and  inputs rotation drive to the container gear Y () that is a gear provided in the container body Y, via a container driving gear Y serving as an apparatus main-body gear. Therefore, the container body Y is rotated in the arrow A direction in . With the rotation of the container body Y, a spiral groove Y serving as a rotary conveyor provided with a spiral shape on the inner surface of the container body Y conveys toner stored in the container body Y from one end on the left side in  to the other end on the right side in  along the longitudinal direction of the container body. Specifically, in the embodiment, the spiral groove Y serves as a rotary conveyor. Consequently, the toner is supplied from the container front end cover Y side to the inside of the conveying nozzle Y via a nozzle hole  serving as a powder receiving hole provided on the conveying nozzle Y. As illustrated in , the powder container  has a container opening (opening portion) on one end in the longitudinal direction thereof. And the nozzle hole  communicates with an opening of shutter supporting portion serving as a shutter side opening, at an inner position relative to the position where the container gear Y is arranged in the longitudinal direction of the container body  in a state in which the toner container  is attached to the main body of the image forming apparatus. Specifically, a position at which the container gear Y meshes with the container driving gear Y is closer to the container opening than the position where the nozzle hole  and the opening of shutter supporting portion communicate with each other in the longitudinal direction of the toner container . And the container gear Y is positioned on one end side (an opening side) relative to the nozzle hole . More specifically, the container gear  meshes with the container driving gear  at the position where a distance between the opening and the container gear  is shorter than a distance between the opening of shutter supporting portion and the nozzle hole . That is, in a state in which toner container  is attached to the image forming apparatus, the container gear Y is positioned between the container opening (a front end of container opening ) and the nozzle hole  in the longitudinal direction of the toner container .","The conveying screw Y is arranged in the conveying nozzle Y. When the container rotating part (driving part) Y inputs the rotation drive to a conveyor screw gear Y, the conveying screw Y rotates to convey the toner supplied in the conveying nozzle Y. A downstream end of the conveying nozzle Y in the conveying direction is connected to the toner dropping passage Y. The toner conveyed by the conveying screw Y falls along the toner dropping passage Y by gravity and is replenished to the developing device Y (the second developer accommodating section Y).","The toner containers  (Y, M, C, K) are replaced with new ones at the end of their lifetimes (when the containers become empty because almost all of the contained toner is consumed). A gripper  is arranged on one end of the toner container  opposite the container front end cover  in the longitudinal direction. When the toner container  is to be replaced, an operator can grip the gripper  to pull out and detach the attached toner container .","The configuration of the container rotating part Y will be further explained below. The container rotating part Y includes the container driving gear Y and the conveyor screw gear Y. As illustrated in  and , when a driving motor  serving as an apparatus main-body gear fixed to a mounting frame  is driven and an output gear is rotated, the container driving gear Y rotates. The conveyor screw gear Y rotates by receiving the rotation of the output gear via a coupled gear .","The toner replenishing device Y controls the amount of toner supplied to the developing device Y in accordance with the rotation frequency of the conveying screw Y. Therefore, toner that passes through the conveying nozzle Y is directly conveyed to the developing device Y via the toner dropping passage Y without the need to control the amount of toner supplied to the developing device Y. Even in the toner replenishing device Y configured to insert the conveying nozzle Y into the toner container Y as described in the embodiment, it may be possible to provide a temporary toner storage, such as a toner hopper.","The toner containers  (Y, M, C, K) and the toner replenishing devices  (Y, M, C, K) according to the embodiment will be explained in detail below. As described above, the toner containers  (Y, M, C, K) and the toner replenishing devices  (Y, M, C, K) have almost the same configurations except that the colors of toner to be used are different. Therefore, in the following explanation, symbols Y, M, C, and K representing the colors of toner will be omitted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0245","num":"0244"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 9","FIG. 6","FIG. 7","FIG. 8","FIG. 20","FIGS. 21A and 21B"],"b":["60","32","32","60","32","32","32","60","32","32","60","32","32","70","60","73"]},"The toner replenishing device  includes the conveying nozzle  inside which the conveying screw  is arranged, and also includes a nozzle shutter  serving as a nozzle opening\/closing member. The nozzle shutter  is slidably mounted on the outer surface of the conveying nozzle  so as to close the nozzle hole  at the time of detachment, which is before the toner container  is attached (in the states in  and ), and to open the nozzle hole  at the time of attachment, which is when the toner container  is attached (in the states in  and ). The nozzle shutter  includes a nozzle shutter flange serving as a flange, on the downstream side in the attachment direction relative to an end surface of a nozzle receiver  serving as a conveyor receiver (to be described later) that comes in contact with the conveying nozzle .","Meanwhile, a receiving opening , which serves as a nozzle insertion opening into which the conveying nozzle  is inserted at the time of attachment, is provided in the center of the front end of the toner container , and a container shutter , which serves as an opening\/closing member that closes the receiving opening  at the time of detachment, is provided.","The toner container holder  includes the container receiving section  that enables the toner container  to slide and move when the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device . As illustrated in  and , the container receiving section  is divided into four sections in a width direction W perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container  (attachment\/detachment direction), and gutters  are provided that serve as container mounting sections extending from the insertion hole part  to the container cover receiving section  along the longitudinal direction of the container body . The toner containers  (Y, M, C, K) for the respective colors are able to move on the gutters  in a sliding manner in the longitudinal direction. As illustrated in , on a ceiling surface  that is an opposite surface of a mounting surface of the gutter , two projections and are provided so as to project from the ceiling surface  toward the gutter  and so as to extend along the longitudinal direction of the gutter , and come in contact with an upward guide  provided in the upper portion of the toner container  when the toner container  (Y, M, C, K) slides and moves on the gutter .","On side surfaces and of the gutter , which are opposite surfaces arranged in the width direction W, guide rails  and  are arranged so as to face each other. The guide rails  protrude in the width direction W from the respective side surfaces and , extend in the longitudinal direction, and are arranged in front of the container cover receiving section . The guide rails  and  have functions to guide the container opening serving as the opening to a container setting section  serving as a container receiving section by being fitted to sliding guides , which serve as guiding portions, vertical restrictors, vertical regulators, vertical positioners, or vertical guides, when the toner container  is attached to the main body of the image forming apparatus.","Incidentally, as illustrated in , each of the guide rails  may be extended to the vicinity of the insertion hole part  in the longitudinal direction. Each of the guide rails  is provided so as to be parallel to the rotation axis of the container body  when the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device . As illustrated in  and , the guide rails  are provided such that the lengths of the guide rails K in the height direction on the gutter K to which the toner container K is attached differ from the lengths of the guide rails  (Y, M, C) in the height direction on the respective gutters  (Y, M, C) to which the toner containers  (Y, M, C) are attached. In particular, the lengths of the guide rails K in the height direction are longer than the lengths of the guide rails  (Y, M, C) in the height direction. Meanwhile, the diameters of the toner containers  (Y, M, C) are smaller than the diameter of the toner container K; therefore, even when any of the toner containers  (Y, M, C) is inserted in the gutter K, a load due to the insertion operation is small and the toner container may be attached to a wrong position. However, because the lengths of the guide rails K in the height direction are longer than the lengths of the guide rails  (Y, M, C) in the height direction, if any of the toner containers  (Y, M, C) is mounted on the gutter K, the sliding guides  (to be described later) of the toner container  (Y, M, C) come in contact with the guide rails K during the attachment operation, and therefore, the movement in the attachment direction is restricted. Therefore, it becomes possible to prevent the toner containers  (Y, M, C) from being erroneously attached. Incidentally, only one of the guide rails  arranged on one of the side surfaces is illustrated in  and .","As illustrated in , setting covers  (Y, M, C, K) for the respective colors are arranged on the container cover receiving section . The setting covers  are provided such that the radial size of the setting cover K for black as illustrated in , , and  differs from the radial sizes of the setting covers  (Y, M, C) for yellow, magenta, and cyan as illustrated in  and . More specifically, the radial size of the setting cover K is greater than the radial sizes of the setting covers  (Y, M, C). The conveying nozzle  is arranged in the center of the setting cover . As illustrated in , the conveying nozzle  is arranged so as to protrude from an end surface of container setting section that is on the inner side in the attachment direction and that serves as a second back surface of the container setting section  located on the downstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container , toward the upstream side in the attachment direction inside the container cover receiving section . The container setting section  serving as the container receiving section is arranged in the protruding direction of the conveying nozzle , that is, toward the upstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container , so as to surround the conveying nozzle . Specifically, the container setting section  is arranged at the base of the conveying nozzle  and serves as a positioner to determine the position of the container opening relative to the toner container holder , where the container opening functions as a rotational shaft when the conveyor inside the toner container  rotates to convey the toner contained in the toner container . Namely, when the container opening is inserted in and mated to the container setting section , the radial position of the container opening is determined.","As illustrated in , , and , on a part of an inner surface of setting cover (first cover inner periphery), in other words, on a part of an inner surface of the container cover receiving section, a groove , which has a depth extending in the attachment direction of the toner container  from an edge of setting cover located on the upstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container , is provided as a cut in the radial direction of the setting cover . At the base of the conveying nozzle  located on the downstream side in the attachment direction relative to the groove of the setting cover when viewed from the attachment direction, the container setting section  is provided to which the container opening (to be described later) is mated when the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device .","The container setting section  is located at the base of the conveying nozzle , includes an inner surface of container setting section in which the container opening is inserted, and includes the end surface of container setting section on the downstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container  relative to the inner surface of container setting section . On the end surface of container setting section , as illustrated in , spring fixing parts protruding from the end surface of container setting section to the upstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container  are provided at eight evenly-spaced positions along the outer periphery of a nozzle shutter spring  serving as a biasing member. In  and , the nozzle shutter spring  is omitted to illustrate the shape of the spring fixing parts . By placing the spring fixing parts so as to cover the outer periphery of the nozzle shutter spring , it becomes possible to restrict the radial movement of the nozzle shutter spring . Therefore, it becomes possible to prevent the toner container  from being set while the nozzle shutter spring  is deviated in the radial direction and prevent the nozzle shutter spring  from being caught between the end surface of container setting section and a front end of the container opening , enabling to prevent a failure to attach the toner container  to the toner replenishing device .","When the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device , an outer surface of container opening , which is a part of the container opening , is slidably mated to the container setting section . On the inner surface of container setting section , as illustrated in , contact surfaces , which are parts of the inner surface of container setting section and which protrude inward in the radial direction from the inner surface of container setting section , are provided at four evenly-spaced positions. The contact surfaces and the outer surface of container opening slide against each other with rotation of the toner container . In the present embodiment, the contact surfaces have the widths of about 4 millimeters (mm) in the circumferential direction and are provided at four evenly-spaced positions. However, for example, the contact surfaces may have the widths of about 6 mm in the circumferential direction at three evenly-spaced positions. If the areas of the contact surfaces that come in contact with the outer surface of container opening are too large, the sliding resistance against the outer surface of container opening increases and a rotational load may be generated. In contrast, if the areas are too small, the contact surfaces are rubbed and worn over time due to the sliding against the outer surface of container opening and it becomes difficult to perform positioning with accuracy. Therefore, it is preferable to determine the widths and the number of the contact surfaces to ensure the contact areas so that the defects as described above can be prevented.","By the mating the inner surface of container setting section to the outer surface of container opening of the toner container , the position of the toner container  relative to the toner replenishing device  in the radial direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container  (the attachment\/detachment direction) is determined. In other words, the container opening serves as a radial restrictor or radial positioner of the toner container  with respect to the toner replenishment device . Furthermore, when the toner container  rotates, the outer surface of container opening functions as a rotational shaft and the inner surface of container setting section functions as a bearing. In other words, the container opening including the outer surface of container opening serves as a rotational shaft of the toner container .","Incidentally, as a method to determine the position of the toner container  relative to the container setting section , the following method may be employed instead of the method to cause the outer surface of container opening to be mated to the inner surface of container setting section . For example, as illustrated in FIG. C, it may be possible to provide a plurality of protrusions \u2032 for positioning on the front end of the toner container  in the longitudinal direction, and cause outer surfaces \u2032 of the protrusions \u2032 for positioning to be mated to the inner surface of container setting section to perform positioning. To determine the top, bottom, left, and right positions of the toner container , it is preferable to provide at least three protrusions \u2032 for positioning. In , the three protrusions \u2032 for positioning are provided on the container front end so as to extend parallel to the longitudinal direction. Furthermore, the three protrusions \u2032 for positioning are provided at positions separated by 120 degrees about the center of the nozzle receiver  of the toner container  (the center of the receiving opening  in which the conveying nozzle  is inserted). Namely, the shape of the container opening is not limited to the continuous cylindrical shape, but may be divided or may be a rod shape as long as the container opening functions as a positioner or a rotational shaft of the toner container .","In , \u03b1 indicates the position at which the outer surface of container opening comes in sliding contact with the contact surfaces as parts of the inner surface of container setting section and at which the radial position of the toner container  relative to the toner replenishing device  is determined at this time.","Incidentally, in the descriptions below, it is repeatedly explained that the container opening of the toner container  and the container setting section  mate with each other in a slidable manner. The mating state is, in a precise sense, a state in which the outer surface of container opening of the toner container  is in contact with the contact surfaces which is a part of the inner surface of container setting section . Hereinafter, for simplicity of explanation, the mating will be referred to as mating the outer surface of container opening with the inner surface of container setting section by omitting the contact surfaces ","The container setting section  includes, as illustrated in , the inner surface of container setting section to be mated to the outer surface of container opening of the toner container  when the toner container  is set. The inner diameter of the inner surface of container setting section is denoted by D. Furthermore, the diameter of the outer surface of container opening of the toner container  is denoted by d. To enable the outer surface of container opening of the toner container  and the inner surface of container setting section to be rotatably mated to each other, the diameter d of the outer surface of container opening of the toner container  and the inner diameter D of the inner surface of container setting section are set such that \u201cd<D\u201d. Moreover, a mating tolerance between d and D is set to about \u201cD\u2212d=0.01 to 0.1 mm\u201d. By ensuring the relationship of \u201cd<D\u201d, it becomes possible to rotate the toner container  while the toner container  is held by the setting cover , in particular, while the container body  is held by the container setting section .","As illustrated in , , , and , holes are provided so as to face each other in the width direction W of the setting cover . On the setting cover , engaging members  and , serving as replenishing device engaging members (to be described later), are arranged so as to be able to move back and forth from the outer surface of the setting cover  to the inner surface of setting cover side via the holes and . The engaging members  and  are biased from the outer side to the inner side of the setting cover  by biasing means, such as torsion coil springs .","Detailed explanations will be given below with reference to . Each of the engaging members  is rotatably supported by the setting cover  such that one end thereof is inserted in a shaft  serving as a fulcrum protruding from a mounting part provided on the setting cover . On another end opposite the one end of each of the engaging members , a spring press part and a rotation stopper are provided. Each of the torsion coil springs , which serve as a pressing unit and are wound around respective pins  provided near the mounting parts of the setting cover , is fitted to each of the spring press parts at one end thereof. A tip part of each of the engaging members  is pressed and biased so as to protrude inwardly to the inner surface of the setting cover  via each of the holes ","By the pressing and biasing, each of the rotation stoppers is pressed against a setting cover notch provided on a supporting part of setting cover of the engaging member located below the mounting part of the setting cover , so that forward and backward movement of each of the engaging members  is restricted.","Incidentally, a direction indicated by R in  is a direction in which each of the engaging members  protrudes inwardly from the inner surface of the setting cover  by being biased by the torsion coil spring , and is referred to as an engaging direction (container holding direction). When the engaging members  move in the engaging direction R, the tip parts of the engaging members  are respectively engaged with engaged openings serving as guiding portions, axial restrictors (longitudinal restrictors), axial regulators, axial positioners, or axial guides of container engaged portions  of the toner container  to be described later, to thereby hold the toner container  in the attached state. Furthermore, a direction indicated by R in  is a direction in which each of the engaging members  is retracted from the inner surface side of the setting cover  against the biasing by the torsion coil springs , and is referred to as a releasing direction. When the engaging members  move in a releasing direction R, the engagement between the tip parts of the engaging members  and the engaged openings of the container engaged portions  is released, so that the toner container  can be pulled out in the detachment direction.","Incidentally, each of the tip parts includes a mountain-shaped top portion P (see  and ) that is provided on the opposite side to the spring press part . The engaging members  are mounted on the setting cover  in a bilaterally symmetrical manner.","The setting covers  will be explained in detail below.","Regarding the setting covers , the shape of the setting cover K to which the toner container K is attached differs from the shapes of the setting covers  (Y, M, C) to which the toner containers  (Y, M, C) are attached. As illustrated in , the setting cover K includes through holes at three evenly-spaced positions on a corner portion (bent portion) between a recess surface serving as a first back surface on the inner side in the attachment direction and the inner surface of setting cover . In contrast, as illustrated in , each of the setting covers  (Y, M, C) includes L-shaped recesses on the corner portion between the recess surface and the inner surface of setting cover , but no hole is provided on the corner portion. Incidentally, it may be possible to provide recesses on the setting cover K or to provide through holes on the setting covers (Y, M, C). However, in the present embodiment, the recesses are provided on the setting covers  (Y, M, C) to ensure the strength of the setting covers  (Y, M, C).","The toner container  will be explained below.","As described above, the toner container  mainly includes the container body  containing toner and includes the container front end cover .  is an explanatory perspective view of the toner container  when the container front end cover  is detached from the state illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0269","num":"0268"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10","FIG. 12","FIG. 13","FIG. 12","FIG. 10","FIG. 29A","FIG. 30A"],"b":["32","330","33","32","330","33","32","330","33","34","32","32","32"]},"As illustrated in  and , the container body  is in the form of an approximate cylinder and rotates about a central axis of the cylinder as a rotation axis. Hereinafter, one side of the toner container  where the receiving opening  is provided (the side where the container front end cover  is arranged) in the longitudinal direction of the toner container  may be referred to as \u201ca container front end\u201d. Furthermore, the other side of the toner container  where the gripper  is arranged (the side opposite the container front end) may be referred to as \u201ca container rear end\u201d. The longitudinal direction of the toner container  is the rotation axis direction, and corresponds to the horizontal direction when the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device . The container rear side of the container body  relative to the container gear  has a greater outer diameter than that of the container front side, and the spiral groove  is provided on the inner surface of the container body. When the container body  rotates in the arrow A direction in the figures, a conveying force for moving toner from one end (the container rear end) to the other end (the container front end) in the rotation axis direction is applied to the toner in the container body  due to the action of the spiral groove .","Scooping portions , which scoop up the toner conveyed to the container front end by the spiral groove  along with the rotation of the container body  in the arrow A direction in the figures, are provided on the inner wall of the front end of the container body . As illustrated in , each of the scooping portions  includes a convex and a scooping wall surface . The convex of the scooping portion rises inside the container body  so as to form a ridge toward the rotation center of the container body  in a spiral shape. The scooping wall surface is a downstream part of the wall surface of a portion continuing from the convex (ridge) of the scooping portion to the inner wall of the container body  in the rotation direction of container. When the scooping wall surface is located in the lower side, the scooping wall surface scoops up toner, which has been entered into an inner space facing the scooping portion  by the conveying force of the spiral groove , along with the rotation of the container body . Therefore, the toner can be scooped up so as to be located above the inserted conveying nozzle .","Furthermore, as illustrated in  and  for example, a spiral rib in a spiral shape is provided on the inner surface of each of the scooping portions  in order to convey the internally-located toner, similarly to the spiral groove .","The container gear  is provided on the container front side relative to the scooping portions  on the container body . A gear exposing opening serving as a gear exposing portion is arranged on the container front end cover  so that a part of the container gear  (the back side of ) can be exposed when the container front end cover  is attached to the container body . In other words, the container front end cover  serves as a cover portion which covers a part of the container gear . When the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device , the container gear  exposed from the gear exposing opening meshes with a container driving gear  of the toner replenishing device .","The container gear  is arranged on the container opening side (near the container opening ) relative to the nozzle hole  in the longitudinal direction of the container body  such that the container gear  can mesh with the container driving gear . The container gear  meshes with the container driving gear  to thereby rotate the conveyor.","The container opening in the form of a cylinder is provided on the container front side relative to the container gear  of the container body  so as to be coaxial with the container gear . A nozzle receiver attachment portion  of the nozzle receiver  is press fitted to the container opening so as to be coaxial with the container opening , so that the nozzle receiver  can be attached to the container body . A method to attach the nozzle receiver  is not limited to press fitting. Other methods including attachment with adhesive agent or attachment with screws may be applied. Furthermore, it may be possible to form a recess on the container body  and insert a protrusion provided on the nozzle receiver attachment portion  into the recess to enable hook fitting.","The toner container  is configured such that toner is replenished from the container opening serving as the opening provided on one end of the container body , and thereafter, the nozzle receiver  is attached to the container opening of the container body .","Cover hook stoppers  serving as cover hook restrictors are provided beside the container gear  on the end of the container opening of the container body . The cover hook stoppers  are provided at three evenly-spaced positions in the circumferential direction on the front end of the container front end cover  in the attachment direction, that is, arranged at intervals of 120 degrees. The container front end cover  is attached to the toner container  (the container body ) in the state illustrated in  from the container front end (from the bottom left side in ). Therefore, the container body  penetrates through the container front end cover  in the longitudinal direction, and the cover hook stoppers  are engaged with respective cover hooks  arranged at three positions in the circumferential direction on the container front end cover . The cover hook stoppers  are provided so as to surround the outer surface of the container opening , and when the cover hook stoppers  are engaged with the cover hooks , the container body  and the container front end cover  are attached so as to rotate relative to each other.","The container front end cover  of the toner container  includes a guiding portion that guides the opening to the container setting section  by restricting the toner container  being attached from moving in directions other than the attachment direction when the toner container  is attached to the main body of the image forming apparatus. Meanwhile, according to the functions described in the present embodiment, the container front end cover  may be a portion mainly used to provide the guiding portion, and may be referred to as a container guide holder. As illustrated in , , , and , a pair of guiding portions for restricting movement of the container front end cover  in the vertical direction are provided on both side surfaces of the lower portion of the container front end cover  of the toner container . Hereinafter, the pair of the guiding portions serving as vertical restrictors are referred to as sliding guides  and . In other words, the container cover serves as a supporter of the vertical restrictors. Each of the sliding guides  and  includes an upper surface A serving as an upper guide and a lower surface B serving as a lower guide, each extending along the longitudinal direction of the container body . Sliding grooves and are provided between the upper surfaces A and the lower surfaces B, respectively. Each of the sliding grooves is provided parallel to the rotation axis of the container body  such that each of the guide rails  and  provided on the gutter  of the container receiving section  as illustrated in , , and  can be sandwiched in the vertical direction. Specifically, the upper surfaces A and the lower surfaces B sandwich the respective guide rails  in the vertical direction, so that the sliding guides  and  function as positioners of the container front end cover  in a vertical direction Z and the width direction W perpendicular to the attachment\/detachment direction when the toner container  is attached to the main body of the image forming apparatus, to thereby restrict the movement of the toner container  in the vertical direction Z and the width direction W.","As illustrated in , each of the sliding grooves is provided such that a gap in the height direction between a lower side of the upper surface A and an upper side of the lower surface B facing each other is gradually changed in the attachment direction. The gap between the upper side and the lower side is gradually increased such that a gap H<a gap H<a gap H, where H is a gap of a front serving as a first guide of the sliding groove on the downstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container , H is a gap of a center serving as a second guide of the sliding groove, and H is a gap of a rear of the sliding groove. Namely, the gap is a distance between the upper surface A and the lower surface B and is set such that the gap on the downstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container  becomes narrower than the gap on the upstream side in the attachment direction. Furthermore, a groove inclined portion is provided so as to be inclined toward a recess surface of the sliding groove and extend along the front and the center of the sliding groove, so that the sliding guides  is prevented from being bent or broken by the gutter . Moreover, as illustrated in , a reinforcing portion  is provided between the sliding guides  in an integrally connected manner, so that it is possible to prevent the sliding guide  from being broken when the toner container  falls down.","The container engaged portions  are provided on an outer surface of container front end cover to determine the position of the toner container  relative to the toner replenishing device  in the axial direction. When the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device , the replenishing device engaging members  arranged on the setting cover  are engaged with the respective container engaged portions .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0281","num":"0280"},"figref":["FIG. 30A","FIG. 30B","FIG. 30A"],"b":"32"},"As illustrated in ,  and , each of the container engaged portions  includes a guiding protrusion , a guiding groove , a bump serving as a force converting portion, and the quadrangular engaged opening . Two sets of the container engaged portions  are arranged on left and right sides of the container cover , respectively, where one set of the container engaged portion  includes the guiding protrusion , the guiding groove , the bump , and the engaged opening as described above. Each of the guiding protrusions is arranged on the container front end of the container cover  so as to be located on a vertical plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container  and on a horizontal plane passing through the rotation axis of the container body . Each of the guiding protrusions serving as guiding members includes a guiding inclined surface  that is an inclined surface adjoined to each of the guiding grooves so as to come in contact with the replenishing device engaging members . And each of the guiding protrusions guides the engaging members  to the guiding grooves when the toner container  is attached. As illustrated in , each of the guiding inclined surfaces  is provided such that a tip  of the container front side is located on the inner side relative to the outer surface of container cover and is extended to each of the guiding grooves arranged on the outer surface of container cover . Each of the guiding grooves is a groove provided on the outer surface of container cover and is a sliding surface on which the top portion P of the tip part of each of the engaging members  slides.","The width of each of the guiding grooves in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the grooves is set to be slightly wider than the width of each of the engaging members  in the same direction such that the engaging members  do not come off from the guiding grooves when the guiding grooves guides the engaging members . Each of the guiding grooves extends in the longitudinal direction and the container rear end side of the guiding groove is adjoined to the bump with the same height as the outer surface of container cover . In other words, the outer surface of the container cover  with a width of about 1 mm is located between each of the guiding grooves and each of the engaged openings ","The tip parts of the engaging members  pass over the bumps and are entered into and engaged with (dropped in) the engaged openings , so that the toner container  is set in (engaged with) the toner replenishing device . This state is the attached state of the toner container .","Incidentally, each of the engaged openings is not limited to the through hole, but may have a closed-end shape with a depth in which each of the engaging members  can move to the initial position in the rotation direction (to be described later with reference to ). In other words, it may be possible to employ a concave such that one side of the engaged opening of the container cover  closer to the circumferential surface of the container body is closed, as long as the movement of the engaging members  to the initial position (to be described later with reference to ) is not interrupted.","In , the container shutter  is located in the center of a segment LL connecting the two container engaged portions  on a virtual plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. If the container shutter  is not located on the segment LL connecting the two container engaged portions , the following situations may occur. Specifically, due to biasing forces of a container shutter spring  serving as a biasing member and the nozzle shutter spring , a moment of force acts to rotate the toner container  about the segment LL serving as the rotation axis, where the moment arm is a distance from the segment LL to the container shutter . Due to the action of the moment of force, the toner container  may be inclined with respect to the toner replenishing device . In this case, an attachment load on the toner container  increases, so that a load is applied to the nozzle receiver  that holds and guides the container shutter . In particular, if the toner container  is new and adequately filled with toner, and when the toner container  is pushed from the rear side so as to insert the conveying nozzle  protruding in the horizontal direction, a moment of force acts to rotate the toner container  with the weight of toner added. Therefore, a load is applied to the nozzle receiver  in which the conveying nozzle  is inserted, and the nozzle receiver  may be deformed or broken in the worst case. In contrast, in the toner container  according to the present embodiment, the container shutter  is located on the segment LL connecting the two container engaged portions . Therefore, it becomes possible to prevent the toner container  from being inclined with respect to the toner replenishing device  due to the biasing forces of the container shutter spring  and the nozzle shutter spring  that act at the position of the container shutter .","The container rotating part  serving as a driving part inputs rotation drive to the container gear  of the toner container  via the container driving gear . When the drive is input to the container gear , the outer surface of container opening of the container body  functions as a rotational shaft and the inner surface of container setting section functions as a bearing, so that the container body  in which the container gear  is provided or integrated is rotated. Incidentally, in the present embodiment, the rotation center of the container gear  is located so as to be concentric with the axis of the container opening ","Furthermore, when the drive is input to the container gear  due to the mesh between the container driving gear  and the container gear , a force is applied in a direction of the pressure angle of the container gear  (an angle between a radial line and a tooth profile at a single point (pitch point) on the tooth surface (based on Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS))), so that the container gear  rotates. The force applied in the direction of the pressure angle of the container gear  is resolved into a component in a direction toward the rotation center of the container gear , so that a force in the direction toward the central axis (rotation axis) of the container body  and perpendicular to the central axis is added to the toner container  including the container body .","If the force is applied in the direction perpendicular to the central axis of the toner container  as described above, the posture of the toner container  in the longitudinal direction becomes unstable and the toner container  may be inclined with respect to the central axis. As a result, the meshing state between the container driving gear  and the container gear  may become unstable, noise may be generated due to the unstable meshing state, or a toner conveying failure may occur.","As described above, because the outer surface of container opening that is the front end of the toner container  serves as the rotational shaft and is supported by the inner surface of container setting section , an unstable meshing state, noise due to the unstable meshing state, or the toner conveying failure is likely to occur when the container gear  is located on the container rear side relative to the container engaged portions . This is because it is expected that a rotational moment as described below is generated. First, an explanation is given of a rotational moment generated on the container opening of the toner container  when the toner container  is set in the replenishing device and a driving force is transmitted to the container gear . On the container opening of the toner container , a rotational moment M is generated due to the force (driving force) applied in the direction perpendicular to the rotation axis of the container gear , so that the engagement between the container opening and the container setting section  becomes unstable. In contrast, the engaged openings of the container engaged portions  of the toner container  are held by the replenishing device engaging members . By the holding by the engaging members, a rotational moment M is generated on the container opening in a direction in which the rotational moment due to the driving force of the container gear  as described above is cancelled out.","If the container gear  is located on the container rear side relative to the container engaged portions , the length of the arm of the rotational moment M (a distance from the container opening to the container gear  in the rotation axis direction) becomes longer than the length of the arm of the rotational moment M (a distance from the container opening to the engaged opening in the rotation axis direction). That is, M>M, so that the holding of the toner container  and the container front end cover  by the toner container holder  may become unstable.","In contrast, according to the present embodiment, as illustrated in  and , the container gear  is arranged between the container engaged portions  and the container opening in the central axis direction (longitudinal direction) of the toner container . Therefore, the length of the arm of the rotational moment M becomes longer than the length of the arm of the rotational moment M, so that M>M. Therefore, the influence of the rotational moment M due to the force (driving force) applied in the direction perpendicular to the central axis of the toner container  can be reduced, the toner container holder  can stably hold the toner container  and the container front end cover , and the posture of the toner container  in the longitudinal direction can be maintained stably.","Detailed explanations will be given below. When the toner container  is held by the toner container holder  (the set state), the toner container  is set such that the outer surface of container opening that is the front end of the toner container  serves as the rotational shaft and is supported by the inner surface of container setting section while the engaged openings of the container engaged portions  are engaged with the replenishing device engaging members . Furthermore, the container gear  is arranged between the container engaged portions  and the container opening ","Therefore, the length of the arm of the rotational moment M due to the force applied to the toner container  in the direction perpendicular to the central axis caused by the mesh between the container driving gear  and the container gear  is the same as the length from the position at which the outer surface of container opening is supported by the inner surface of container setting section to the position at which the container gear  is arranged in the central axis direction (longitudinal direction). Furthermore, the length of the arm of the rotational moment M due to the force (referred to as a holding force) applied to the toner container  in the direction perpendicular to the central axis caused by the engagement between the engaged openings of the container engaged portions  and the replenishing device engaging members  is the same as the length from the position at which the outer surface of container opening is supported by the inner surface of container setting section to the position at which the engaged openings of the container engaged portions  are arranged in the central axis direction (longitudinal direction).","Incidentally, the rotational moment is obtained by multiplying the length of the arm of the rotational moment by the magnitude of the force. Therefore, when the container gear  is arranged on the container rear side relative to the container engaged portions , a greater holding force is needed than in the configuration in which the container gear  is arranged between the container engaged portions  and the container opening ","Therefore, assuming that the holding force as described above is constant, it becomes possible to effectively apply the holding force of the toner container holder  to hold the toner container  and the container front end cover  in the configuration in which the container gear  is arranged between the container engaged portions  and the container opening , as compared to the configuration in which the container gear  is arranged on the container rear side relative to the container engaged portions . As a result, even when the driving force is transmitted to the container gear , it becomes possible to stably maintain the posture of the toner container  in the longitudinal direction.","When the toner container  is held by the toner container holder , as illustrated in  and , a reaction force F (restoring force) to compress the container shutter spring  and a reaction force F caused by compression of the nozzle shutter spring  are applied to the toner container . As illustrated in , , and , each of the cover hooks  arranged at three evenly-spaced positions in the circumferential direction of the container front end cover  receives a component of the reaction force F (i.e., \u2153 of F) from the toner container  via a surface of the cover hook stopper  of the toner container  on the container rear side. Resultant forces of the reaction forces F and F are applied to the container front end cover  evenly and with equal radial distances to the central axis O (rotation axis) of the toner container , so that only a component in the central axis (rotation axis) direction mainly acts. Namely, a component that causes the container front end cover  to be inclined with respect to the central axis O (rotation axis) can hardly act.","Furthermore, as illustrated in , the container engaged portions  are arranged at horizontally symmetrical positions with respect to the central axis O (rotation axis), so that components in the direction perpendicular to the central axis O are cancelled out. Therefore, only a component in the central axis direction acts, but a component that inclines the container front end cover  with respect to the central axis O does not act.","In the container front end cover , an inner surface of a front end of the container front end cover  comes in contact with an outer edge of the cover hook stopper  serving as a cover hook restrictor, on the container front side relative to front ends of the cover hooks . Therefore, the radial position of the toner container  relative to the container front end cover  is determined.","Specifically, the toner container  serving as the powder container of the present embodiment is attachable to an image forming apparatus. The image forming apparatus is configured such that the toner container  containing toner for image formation is attached thereto and includes the conveying nozzle  serving as a conveyor for conveying toner, the nozzle shutter  serving as a nozzle opening\/closing member that opens and closes the nozzle hole  serving as the powder receiving hole arranged on the conveying nozzle, the nozzle shutter spring  serving as a biasing member that biases the nozzle shutter  to close the nozzle hole , the replenishing device engaging members  that apply biasing forces to the sides of the toner container  to hold the toner container  with respect to the main body of the image forming apparatus, the container driving gear  serving as an apparatus main-body gear to transmit a driving force to the conveyor in the toner container , and the container setting section  serving as the container receiving section that is arranged around the conveying nozzle  so as to be coaxial with the conveying nozzle  and that receives the toner container . The toner container  includes the container body  for storing toner for image formation, the opening arranged on one end of the toner container , the conveyor that rotates to convey powder inside the container body to the container opening side, the container gear  serving as a gear to mesh with the container driving gear  to drive the conveyor, the container engaged portions  engaged with the replenishing device engaging members , and the container front end cover  serving as a container cover arranged on the outer surface of the toner container  so as to be coaxial with the toner container . The center of the opening and the rotation center of the container gear  are located on the same axis. The container driving gear  is arranged between the container engaged portions  and the container opening in the longitudinal direction of the toner container . The opening is able to mate with the container setting section .","With the configuration as described above, the toner container  can be held in a stable posture in the radial direction and the axial direction with respect to the toner replenishing device . If the container gear  is arranged between the opening and the container engaged portions  in the longitudinal direction of the toner container , a stable state is maintained because of a balance between the forces in the central axis direction. Therefore, the influence of the force generated at the engaged portion between the container driving gear  and the container gear  is reduced, so that it becomes possible to prevent the toner container  from being inclined in the longitudinal direction (in the central axis direction). Consequently, it becomes possible to prevent the meshing state between the container driving gear Y and the container gear  from becoming unstable, prevent noise due to the unstable meshing state, and prevent a toner conveying failure.","Meanwhile, according to the functions of the present embodiment, the container front end cover  may be a portion mainly used to provide the container engaged portions , and may be referred to as a container engaged portion holder.","As illustrated in  and , the cover hooks  are arranged at three evenly-spaced positions in the circumferential direction on a front end surface of the container front end cover . At bent portions of the cover hooks , protrusions are provided, which serve as guiding portions, radial restrictors, radial regulators, radial positioning portions, radial positioners, or radial guides and which protrude outward from the outer surface of container front end cover . The protrusions are bent along the bent portions of the container front end cover  and arranged at three evenly-spaced positions in the circumferential direction of the container front end cover , that is, at intervals of 120 degrees. The protrusions protrude 0.9 mm from the outer surface of container front end cover and extend 4 mm from the bent portions in each of the radial direction and the longitudinal direction. As illustrated in , the protrusions serving as the guiding portions have functions to guide the movement of the toner container  and determine the position of the toner container  in the radial direction by coming into contact with the inner surface of setting cover when the container front end cover  is entered into the container cover receiving section . Each of the protrusions is provided with a rounded shape so as to come in point contact with the inner surface of setting cover to reduce the sliding resistance. The protrusions are arranged so as to face the respective through holes or recesses (see  and ) provided at three positions on the setting cover . The protrusions are also arranged so as to come in contact with the inner surface of setting cover before the container opening of the container body  comes in contact with the nozzle shutter flange . Therefore, the protrusions function as radial positioners of the toner container  with respect to the toner replenishing device  by coming into contact with the inner surface of setting cover . Namely, the protrusions function as guiding portions, radial restrictors, radial regulators, radial positioners, radial guides or radial positioners.","As illustrated in , a plate-shaped circumferential restricting portion serving as a circumferential restrictor as the guiding portion is arranged on the outer surface of container front end cover . Hereinafter, the circumferential restricting portion is described as a rotation restrictive rib that serves as a rotation restrictive portion, a rotation restrictive protrusion, a guiding portion, a circumferential restrictor, a circumferential regulator, a circumferential positioner, or circumferential guide. The rotation restrictive rib and one of the sliding guides  are provided to be integrated with the container front end cover . The rotation restrictive rib is arranged between the two protrusions located in the lower portion, and protrudes in a radially outward direction from the outer surface of the container front end cover . The rotation restrictive rib is arranged so as to be entered into the groove provided on the setting cover  (see ) when the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device . The rotation restrictive rib protrudes from a downstream end surface of one of the sliding guides  in the attachment direction, and is integrated with the one of the sliding guides . The rotation restrictive rib is arranged so as to protrude from the one of the sliding guides  and be located at approximately the same height as the sliding groove . Therefore, even if the sliding guides  are entered in a slightly deviated manner with respect to the guide rails  when the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device , a deviation in the position of the rotation restrictive rib with respect to the groove of the setting cover can be reduced and the rotation restrictive rib can easily be entered into the groove of the setting cover. Therefore, it becomes possible to reliably determine the position in the circumferential direction.","As illustrated in , , and , the upward guide  is arranged on the container front end cover  so as to protrude upward from the outer surface of container cover in the attached state. On the upward guide , a top portion of upward guide , side portions of upward guide , and inclined surfaces of upward guide are provided. The top portion of upward guide and the side portions of upward guide extend in the longitudinal direction of the toner container . The side portions of upward guide are provided on both sides of the top portion of upward guide so as to be deviated downward from the top portion of the upward guide in the circumferential direction of the container front end cover . The inclined surfaces of upward guide are inclined downward from the top portion of upward guide and the side portions of upward guide of the toner container  to the container rear side.","The container body  is molded by a biaxial stretch blow molding method. The biaxial stretch blow molding method generally includes a two-stage process including a preform molding process and a stretch blow molding process. In the preform molding process, a test-tube shaped preform is molded with resin by injection molding. By the injection molding, the container opening , the cover hook stoppers , and the container gear  are provided at the opening of the test-tube shape preform. In the stretch blow molding process, the preform that is cooled after the preform molding process and detached from a mold is heated and softened, and then subjected to blow molding and stretching.","In the container body , the container rear side relative to the container gear  is molded by the stretch blow molding process. Specifically, a portion in which the spiral groove  is provided and the gripper  are molded by the stretch blow molding process.","In the container body , each of the portions such as the container gear , the container opening , and the cover hook stoppers  provided on the container front side relative to the container gear  remains in the same form as in the preform generated by the injection molding; therefore, they can be molded with high accuracy. In contrast, the portion in which the spiral groove  is provided and the gripper  are molded by stretching through the stretch blow molding process after the injection molding; therefore, the molding accuracy is lower than that of the preform molded portions.","The nozzle receiver  fixed to the container body  will be explained below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0310","num":"0309"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 15","FIG. 16","FIG. 13","FIG. 17","FIG. 13","FIG. 13","FIG. 18"],"b":["330","330","330","330","330"]},"The nozzle receiver  includes a container shutter supporter  serving as a supporter, the container shutter , a container seal  serving as a seal, the container shutter spring  serving as a biasing member, and the nozzle receiver attachment portion . The container shutter supporter  includes a shutter rear end supporting portion  as a shutter rear portion, shutter side supporting portions as shutter side portions, the openings of shutter supporting portion as shutter side openings of the shutter supporting portion, and the nozzle receiver attachment portion . The container shutter spring  includes a coil spring.","The shutter side supporting portions and the openings of shutter supporting portion on the container shutter supporter  are arranged adjacent to each other in the rotation direction of the toner container such that the two shutter side supporting portions facing each other form a part of a cylindrical shape and the cylindrical shape is largely cut out at the openings (two portions) of shutter supporting portion . With this shape, it is possible to cause the container shutter  to move in the longitudinal direction in a cylindrical space S () defined by the cylindrical shape.","The nozzle receiver  provided to the container body  rotates with the container body  when the container body  rotates. At this time, the shutter side supporting portions of the nozzle receiver  rotate around the conveying nozzle  of the toner replenishing device . Therefore, the shutter side supporting portions being rotated alternately pass a space just above the nozzle hole  provided in the upper side of the conveying nozzle . Consequently, even if toner is instantaneously accumulated above the nozzle hole , because the shutter side supporting portions cross the accumulated toner and alleviate the accumulation, it becomes possible to prevent a cohesion of the accumulated toner when the device is not used and prevent a toner conveying failure when the device is resumed. In contrast, when the shutter side supporting portions are located on the sides of the conveying nozzle  and the nozzle hole  and the opening of shutter supporting portion face each other, toner in the container body  is supplied to the conveying nozzle  as indicated by an arrow \u03b2 in .","In the conventional toner container in which the container gear is located on the side opposite the opening relative to the powder receiving hole in the longitudinal direction of the toner container, the diameter of a portion where the container gear is provided needs to be smaller than those of the other portions of the container body in order to attach and detach the toner container and to couple and drive the container gear and the container driving gear of the main body. Therefore, a so-called shoulder portion is provided to pass over the small-diameter portion and toner is moved from the inside of the container body to the opening.","In contrast, according to the present embodiment, the container gear  is coupled and driven with the container driving gear  at a position on the opening side arranged on one end of the container body  relative to the nozzle hole  in the longitudinal direction of the toner container . Therefore, the conveying nozzle  can receive toner on the inner side of the container body  relative to the position (small-diameter position) at which the container gear  is provided. Consequently, it becomes possible to transfer toner more smoothly as compared to the conventional configuration.","The container shutter  includes a front cylindrical portion serving as a closure, a slide area , a guiding rod , and shutter hooks . The front cylindrical portion is a container front end portion to be tightly fitted to a cylindrical opening (the receiving opening ) of the container seal . The slide area is a cylindrical portion, which is provided on the container rear side relative to the front cylindrical portion . The slide area has an outer diameter slightly greater than that of the front cylindrical portion , and slides on the inner surfaces of the pair of the shutter side supporting portions ","The guiding rod is a cylinder that stands from the inner side of the cylinder of the front cylindrical portion toward the container rear end, and serves a rod portion that prevents the container shutter spring  from being buckled when the guiding rod is inserted to the inside of the coil of the container shutter spring .","A guiding rod sliding portion includes a pair of flat surfaces that are provided on both sides across the central axis of the cylindrical guiding rod from the middle of the guiding rod . Furthermore, the container rear end of the guiding rod sliding portion is bifurcated into a pair of cantilevers ","The shutter hooks are a pair of hooks that are provided on ends of the cantilevers opposite the base from which the guiding rod stands, and that prevent the container shutter  from coming off from the container shutter supporter .","As illustrated in , a front end of the container shutter spring  abuts against the inner wall of the front cylindrical portion , and a rear end of the container shutter spring  abuts against the wall of the shutter rear end supporting portion . At this time, the container shutter spring  is in a compressed state, so that the container shutter  receives a biasing force in a direction away from the shutter rear end supporting portion  (to the right or toward the container front end in ). However, the shutter hooks provided on the container rear end of the container shutter  are hooked on an outer wall of the shutter rear end supporting portion . Therefore, the container shutter  is prevented from moving further in the direction away from the shutter rear end supporting portion  in the state illustrated in  and .","Due to the hooked state between the shutter hooks and the shutter rear end supporting portion  and the biasing force of the container shutter spring , the positioning is performed. Specifically, the longitudinal positions of the front cylindrical portion and the container seal , both of which implement a toner leakage preventing function of the container shutter , are determined relative to the container shutter supporter . Therefore, it becomes possible to determine the positions of the front cylindrical portion and the container seal  so that they can be fitted to each other, enabling to prevent toner leakage.","The nozzle receiver attachment portion  is in the form of a cylinder whose outer diameter and inner diameter are reduced in a stepped manner toward the container rear end. The diameters are gradually reduced from the container front end to the container rear end. As illustrated in , two outer diameter portions (outer surfaces AA and BB located in this order from the container front end) are present on the outer surface, and five inner diameter portions (inner surfaces CC, DD, EE, FF, and GG located in this order from the container front end) are present on the inner surface. The outer surfaces AA and BB on the outer surface are connected by a tapered surface at their boundary. Similarly, the fourth inner diameter portion FF and the fifth inner diameter portion GG on the inner surface are connected by a tapered surface at their boundary. The inner diameter portion FF on the inner surface and the connected tapered surface correspond to a seal jam preventing space to be described later, and the ridge lines of these surfaces correspond to sides of a pentagonal cross-section to be described later.","As illustrated in  to , the pair of the shutter side supporting portions , which face each other and which have flake shapes obtained by cutting a cylinder in the axial direction, protrude from the nozzle receiver attachment portion  toward the container rear end. The ends of the two shutter side supporting portions on the container rear side are connected to the shutter rear end supporting portion  that has a cup shape with a circular opening in the center of the bottom. The two shutter side supporting portions face to each other, and thus, the cylindrical space S is defined by inner cylindrical surfaces of the shutter side supporting portions and virtual cylindrical surfaces extending from the shutter side supporting portions . The nozzle receiver attachment portion  includes the inner diameter portion GG, which is the fifth portion from the front end, as a cylindrical inner surface having the same inner diameter as the diameter of the cylindrical space S. The slide area of the container shutter  slides on the cylindrical space S and the cylindrical inner surface GG. The third inner surface EE of the nozzle receiver attachment portion  is a virtual circumferential surface that passes through longitudinal tips of nozzle shutter positioning ribs that serve as abutting portions or convex portions and that are equally spaced at 45\u00b0. The container seal  with a quadrangular cylindrical (cylindrical tube shaped) cross section (the cross section in the cross-sectional view in ) is arranged so as to correspond to the inner surface EE. The container seal  is attached to a vertical surface connecting the third inner surface EE and the fourth inner surface FF with adhesive agent or double-stick tape. The exposed surface of the container seal  opposite the attachment surface (the right side in  and ) serves as an inner bottom of the cylindrical opening of the cylindrical nozzle receiver attachment portion  (the container opening).","Furthermore, as illustrated in  and , the seal jam preventing space (a catch preventing space) is defined so as to correspond to the inner surface FF of the nozzle receiver attachment portion  and the connected tapered surface. The seal jam preventing space is an annular sealed space enclosed by three different parts. Specifically, the seal jam preventing space is an annular space enclosed by the inner surface (the fourth inner surface FF and the connected tapered surface) of the nozzle receiver attachment portion , the vertical surface on the attachment side of the container seal , and the outer surface from the front cylindrical portion to the slide area of the container shutter . A cross section of the annular space (the cross section illustrated in  and ) is in the form of a pentagon. The angle between the inner surface of the nozzle receiver attachment portion  and the end surface of the container seal  and the angle between the outer surface of the container shutter  and the end surface of the container seal  are 90\u00b0.","Functions of the seal jam preventing space will be described below. When the container shutter  moves toward the container rear end from the state in which the receiving opening  is closed by the container shutter , the inner surface of the container seal  slides against the front cylindrical portion of the container shutter . Therefore, the inner surface of the container seal  is pulled by the container shutter  and elastically deformed so as to move toward the container rear end.","At this time, if the seal jam preventing space is not provided but the vertical surface (the attachment surface of the container seal ) continuing from the third inner surface is connected to the fifth inner surface GG so as to be perpendicular to each other, the following situation may occur. Specifically, the elastically-deformed portion of the container seal  may be caught between the inner surface of the nozzle receiver attachment portion  sliding against the container shutter  and the outer surface of the container shutter , resulting in causing a jam. If the container seal  is jammed in the portion where the nozzle receiver attachment portion  and the container shutter  slide against each other, that is, between the front cylindrical portion and the inner surface GG, the container shutter  is firmly attached to the nozzle receiver attachment portion , so that the receiving opening  may not be opened and closed.","In contrast, the nozzle receiver  according to the present embodiment is provided with the seal jam preventing space in the inner area thereof. The inner diameter of the seal jam preventing space (the inner diameter of each of the inner surface EE and the connected tapered surface) is smaller than the outer diameter of the container seal . Therefore, the entire container seal  can hardly be entered into the seal jam preventing space . Furthermore, an area of the container seal  to be elastically deformed by being pulled by the container shutter  is limited, and the container seal  can be restored by its own elasticity before the container seal  is brought to and jammed at the inner surface GG. With this action, it becomes possible to prevent a situation in which the receiving opening  cannot be opened and closed because of the attached state between the container shutter  and the nozzle receiver attachment portion .","As illustrated in  to , the multiple nozzle shutter positioning ribs are provided so as to radially extend on the inner surface of the nozzle receiver attachment portion  that comes in contact with the outer periphery of the container seal . As illustrated in  and , when the container seal  is attached to the nozzle receiver attachment portion , the vertical surface of the container seal  on the container front side slightly protrudes relative to the front ends of the nozzle shutter positioning ribs in the longitudinal direction.","As illustrated in , when the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device , the nozzle shutter flange of the nozzle shutter  of the toner replenishing device  presses and deforms the protruding portion of the container seal  by being biased by the nozzle shutter spring . The nozzle shutter flange further moves inward and abuts against the container front ends of the nozzle shutter positioning ribs , thereby covering and sealing the front end surface of the container seal  from the outside of the container. Therefore, it becomes possible to ensure the sealing performance in the periphery of the conveying nozzle  at the receiving opening  in the attached state, enabling to prevent toner leakage.","The back side of a biased surface of the nozzle shutter flange biased by the nozzle shutter spring  abuts against the nozzle shutter positioning ribs , so that the position of the nozzle shutter  relative to the toner container  in the longitudinal direction is determined. Therefore, a positional relationship of the front end surface of the container seal , the front end surface of a front end opening  (an inner space of the cylindrical nozzle receiver attachment portion  arranged in the container opening as will be described later), and the nozzle shutter  in the longitudinal direction is determined.","The operation of the container shutter  and the conveying nozzle  will be explained below with reference to , , and . Before the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device , as illustrated in , the container shutter  is biased by the container shutter spring  toward a closing position so as to close the receiving opening . The appearance of the container shutter  and the conveying nozzle  at this time is illustrated in . When the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device , as illustrated in , the conveying nozzle  is inserted in the receiving opening . When the toner container  is further pushed into the toner replenishing device , an end surface of the front cylindrical portion , which serves as an end surface of the container shutter  (hereinafter, referred to as \u201cthe end surface of the container shutter\u201d), and a front end that is an end surface of the conveying nozzle  in the insertion direction (hereinafter, referred to as \u201cthe front end of the conveying nozzle\u201d) come in contact with each other. When the toner container  is further pushed from the state as described above, the container shutter  is pushed as illustrated in . Accordingly, the conveying nozzle  is inserted in the shutter rear end supporting portion  from the receiving opening  as illustrated in . Therefore, as illustrated in , the conveying nozzle  is inserted in the container body  and located at a setting position. At this time, as illustrated in , the nozzle hole  is located at a position overlapping the opening of shutter supporting portion ","Subsequently, when the container body  is rotated, toner scooped up above the conveying nozzle  by the scooping portions  falls in and is introduced into the conveying nozzle  via the nozzle hole . The toner introduced into the conveying nozzle  is conveyed inside the conveying nozzle  toward the toner dropping passage  along with the rotation of the conveying screw . Subsequently, the toner falls in and is supplied to the developing device  through the toner dropping passage .","In the relationship between the toner container  and the toner replenishing device  according to the present embodiment, the conveying nozzle  is inserted to a position by penetrating through the inside of the container gear  in the longitudinal direction of the container body . Namely, the container gear  meshes with the container driving gear  at a position closer to the opening than the nozzle hole  in the longitudinal direction of the container body  in a state in which the toner container  is attached to the main body of the image forming apparatus. Therefore, if the rotation drive is input to the container gear  via the container driving gear  in a direction A indicated in , a force generated at the position where the container driving gear  and the container gear  mesh with each other is applied to the container body , the conveying nozzle , or the nozzle receiver  that extend inside the container body . Therefore, the conveying nozzle  or the nozzle receiver  may be damaged or a gap may be generated between the conveying nozzle  and the nozzle receiver , resulting in toner leakage.","Furthermore, by causing the toner container  to slide in the attachment direction Q (pushing direction) on the toner container holder , the conveying nozzle  of the toner replenishing device  pushes open the container shutter  inside the receiving opening  of the toner container  and is entered into the container body . Therefore, if the relative position is deviated during the movement, toner leakage may occur, or the conveying nozzle , the container shutter , or the nozzle receiver  may be damaged. Therefore, it is desirable to perform the movement while the centers of the conveying nozzle , the container shutter , and the receiving opening  are located on the same axis as best as possible.","Furthermore, the rotation center of the container gear  is on the same line as the axis of the container opening (the container body ). Therefore, to mesh the container gear  with the container driving gear  at a correct position without causing gear mesh fault, it is important to determine the radial position of the toner container  relative to the toner replenishing device  by mating the container opening to the container setting section .","For example, while it may be possible to restrict the positional relationship between the toner container  and the toner replenishing device  by uniformly using a long guide extending in the axial direction of the toner container , if the number of directions to be restricted is small, it becomes difficult to achieve adequate regulation. Alternatively, it may be possible to provide multiple restrictors so as to determine the positional relationship between the toner container  and the toner replenishing device  from the beginning of the attachment. However, in this case, positioning (movement restriction) is performed by the multiple restrictors from an early stage of the movement in the attachment direction Q (pushing direction), so that a push resistance increases and the operability may be degraded.","Therefore, in the present embodiment, the container opening is to mate with the container setting section  arranged around the conveying nozzle , and the position of the toner container  relative to the toner replenishing device  is determined by causing the container opening and the container setting section  to mate with each other. Therefore, it becomes possible to stabilize the relative position of the toner container  and the toner replenishing device  and to reduce the influence of the force generated at the meshing portion between the container driving gear  and the container gear .","Furthermore, as illustrated in , a positioning portion  serving as a guiding portion to enable restriction and release with respect to the toner replenishing device  in the attachment direction Q of the toner container  is arranged on the toner container . Therefore, it becomes possible to move the toner container  toward the toner replenishing device  in the attachment direction Q while the centers of the conveying nozzle  and the nozzle receiver  are located on the same axis as best as possible. Consequently, it becomes possible to prevent toner leakage and prevent the conveying nozzle  and the nozzle receiver  from being damaged. Incidentally, the positioning portion  includes multiple positioners (restrictors or regulators) arranged in the attachment direction Q. While  is a perspective view for explaining the positional relationship between the multiple positioners and the toner replenishing device , the configurations of the multiple positioners are mainly illustrated and other configurations are omitted or simplified to avoid complication.","The positioning portion  performs positioning (restricts movement in a predetermined direction) by using the container front end cover  that defines an external shape of the toner container  when the toner container  is being moved in the attachment direction Q on the toner container holder . The positioning portion  performs positioning by using the container opening of the container body  that defines an internal shape of the toner container  when the toner container  is located in the setting position in the toner replenishing device . Incidentally, the positioning portion  serving as the guiding portion restricts movement in any of directions other than the attachment direction Q of the toner container  when the toner container  is being moved in the attachment direction Q on the toner container holder , to thereby guide the toner container  to the toner replenishing device . Specifically, when the toner container  is attached to the main body of the image forming apparatus, the guiding portion restricts the movement of the toner container  in a direction other than the attachment direction while the toner container  is being moved, and guides the opening to the container setting section .","In the positioning portion , the pair of the sliding guides  and , the engaged openings , the multiple (three) protrusions , the rotation restrictive rib , and the container opening serve as positioners. Of these components, the sliding guides  and  and the engaged openings , the multiple (three) protrusions are integrally provided and arranged on the container front end cover  that is made of resin. The container opening is integrated with the container body .","The order of restriction and release of all of the positioners with respect to the toner replenishing device  will be described below. First, as illustrated in , when a user places the toner container  on the gutter  of the container receiving section  of the toner container holder  and pushes the toner container  in the attachment direction Q (performs attachment operation), the toner container  slides on the gutter . At this time, as illustrated in , the toner container  slides while the side portions of upward guide of the toner container  come in contact with the projections provided on the ceiling surface  facing the gutter . Therefore, the toner container  can be pushed in the attachment direction Q while the movement in the vertical direction Z is restricted. Furthermore, the movement in the vertical direction is restricted not by the top portion of upward guide but by the side portions of upward guide provided on the both sides of the top portion of upward guide . Therefore, even when the toner container  is deviated in the horizontal direction during the attaching operation, the toner container  can reliably be brought into contact with the ceiling surface  side.","On the toner replenishing device  side, as illustrated in , the front of the sliding groove serving as the first guides are entered into the most upstream side of the respective guide rail  in the attachment direction Q. Due to the entrance of the front of the sliding groove into the guide rail , the sliding guide  get on the guide rail  and the toner container  that has been in contact with the top surface of the gutter  is lifted upward. The guide rails  and  are provided on the side surfaces and of the gutter  so as to be spaced apart from the mounting surface of the gutter . Therefore, by causing the front of the sliding groove to enter into the guide rail , it becomes possible to roughly determine the positions in the width direction W perpendicular to the attachment direction Q and in the vertical direction Z. This state will be described as a first restricted state. , , , and  are diagrams illustrating the first restricted state.  is a side view illustrating the first restricted state.  is a diagram of a portion on a reference line X in  viewed from the attachment direction.  is a diagram of a portion on a reference line X in  viewed from above. Incidentally, the reference line X illustrated in  indicates the position of the end surface of the container front end cover  and the same applies to the other figures described below.","When the toner container  in the first restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, as illustrated in , the end surface of the container shutter and the front end of the conveying nozzle come in contact with each other. In the first restricted state, the sliding guides  and the guide rails  regulate the width direction W and the vertical direction Z, so that the container shutter  can face the conveying nozzle  as desired and the positional relationship between the receiving opening  and the conveying nozzle  can be ensured. By ensuring the positional relationship between the receiving opening  and the conveying nozzle , it becomes possible to prevent the container seal  from being detached or damaged due to insertion of the container shutter  into the conveying nozzle  in a deviated manner.","When the toner container  in this state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, a second restricted state as illustrated in , , and  is obtained. In the second restricted state, the front end of the container front end cover  is entered into the container cover receiving section . Due to the entrance of the front end of the container front end cover  into the container cover receiving section , the three protrusions provided at evenly-spaced circumferential positions on the outer surface of a front end of container front end cover in the attachment direction come in contact with, from the inner side, the inner surface of setting cover being a part of the container cover receiving section . It is preferable to form at least three protrusions as the protrusions , but the number of the protrusions is not limited to three.","Due to the contact between the protrusions and the inner surface of setting cover , the movement of the toner container  is guided and the radial movement of the toner container  is restricted. The radial direction Ra along which radial movement may occur is illustrated in  . Therefore, in the second restricted state, the radial movement of the container front end cover  relative to the container cover receiving section  is restricted by the contact between the three protrusions and the inner surface of setting cover . Namely, the radial position of the container front end cover  relative to the container cover receiving section  is restricted. Meanwhile, the regulation of the position in a predetermined direction means restriction of the movement of the toner container  in the predetermined direction.","When the toner container  in the second restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, the container seal  and the nozzle shutter flange come in contact with each other as illustrated in . In the second restricted state, the radial direction is restricted by the protrusions and the inner surface of setting cover , in addition to the regulation in the width direction W and the vertical direction Z by the guide rails  and the sliding guides ; therefore, the centers of the container shutter  and the conveying nozzle  coincide with each other. Accordingly, it becomes possible to prevent the attachment operation from being performed when the toner container  is inclined in the width direction W or the vertical direction Z with respect to a contact surface between the end surface of the container shutter and the front end of the conveying nozzle or with respect to the sliding guides . Therefore, it becomes possible to prevent the conveying nozzle  and the container shutter  from being broken or prevent the container seal  from being detached. Furthermore, a force applied to the sliding guides  due to the attachment operation is distributed to the protrusions , so that the force can be reduced. Therefore, it becomes possible to prevent a defect such as breakage or damage of the sliding guides .","When the toner container  is further pushed in the attachment direction Q in the state in which the container seal  and the nozzle shutter flange come in contact with each other as illustrated in , the fronts of the sliding grooves come off from the guide rails , and the restriction in the vertical direction Z is implemented by the centers of the sliding grooves , serving as second guides, of the sliding grooves as illustrated in . When the toner container  in this state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, a third restricted state as illustrated in  to FIG.  is obtained. In the third restricted state, the rotation restrictive rib provided on the outer surface of the front end of the container front end cover  are entered into the groove of the setting cover  as illustrated in . Therefore, the container front end cover  and the setting cover  (the container cover receiving section ) are integrated and the circumferential movement is additionally restricted by the container front end cover . At this time, because the vertical direction Z is restricted by the centers having wider gaps than those of the fronts of the sliding grooves , sliding resistance during the insertion can be reduced, which is preferable in terms of the operability.","When the toner container  in the third restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, a fourth restricted state as illustrated in , ,  is obtained. In the fourth restricted state, the three protrusions on the container front end cover  are located opposite the through holes provided on the setting cover K or the recesses of the setting cover  (Y,M,C). Therefore, the protrusions are entered into the through holes of the setting cover K or be located inside the recess of the setting cover  (Y,M,C), and the radial restriction of the container front end cover  by the protrusions and the inner surface of setting cover is released.","When the toner container  in the fourth restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, a fifth restricted state as illustrated in , , and  is obtained. In the fifth restricted state, as illustrated in , the front end of the container opening is entered into the inner surface of container setting section (the setting cover ) serving as a positioner of the container setting section. Therefore, the container body  is rotatably supported inside the inner surface of container setting section . At this time, the circumferential position of the container front end cover  is restricted by the rotation restrictive rib and the groove of the setting cover, so that the container opening and the container setting section  can be mate with each other such that the respective centers coincide with each other. Therefore, it becomes possible to prevent toner leakage from the container shutter  due to insertion of the container opening into the container setting section  in a deviated manner. Furthermore, when the container opening is entered into the inner surface of container setting section , the radial restriction by the protrusions is already released, so that the circumferential restriction by the rotation restrictive rib is not interfered.","When the toner container  in the fifth restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, a sixth restricted state as illustrated in , , and  is obtained. In the sixth restricted state, the container opening is entered further into the inner surface of container setting section , and the replenishing device engaging members  and  are entered into and engaged with the respective engaged openings of the container engaged portions  and  as illustrated in . Therefore, the toner container  is prevented from moving in the longitudinal direction (the rotation axis direction) and is maintained in the setting position.","Incidentally, a backlash may be provided in the positions in which the replenishing device engaging members  and  are entered into the respective engaged openings of the container engaged portions  and  in the longitudinal direction. With this, it becomes possible to cause the replenishing device engaging members  and  to be reliably entered into the respective engaged openings of the container engaged portions  and  and to prevent a defective setting of the toner container  in the toner replenishing device  even when the accuracies of components or mount positions of components vary, which is a preferable configuration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0352","num":"0351"},"figref":["FIG. 44F","FIG. 44F","FIG. 44F"],"b":["611","330","32","611","330","611","330","332","611","333","612","33","615","361","341","342","32","332","611","361"],"i":["h ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","h ","a "]},"As described above, the positional relationship between the toner container  and the toner replenishing device  can be determined by restricting and releasing the toner container  and the toner replenishing device  in the stepped manner along with the movement of the toner container  in the attachment direction Q relative to the toner replenishing device .

Therefore, the configuration of the container body  will be mainly explained below.","The container body  is a cylindrical member made of resin. The container body  stores therein toner serving as powder developer and includes a conveyor inside thereof. A scooping function is provided in a part of the conveyor. The configuration will be explained below with reference to .  is a perspective view of the nozzle receiver  integrated with scooping ribs corresponding to the scooping wall surfaces (hereinafter, the nozzle receiver is referred to as a \u201cnozzle receiver \u201d).  is a cross-sectional view for explaining a relationship between the nozzle receiver  illustrated in  and the conveying nozzle  when the nozzle receiver  is arranged inside the container body .  is an explanatory lateral cross-sectional view of the entire toner container  on which the nozzle receiver  illustrated in  is mounted.  is a perspective view of a container shutter  as a part of the toner container .","The nozzle receiver  illustrated in  includes the scooping ribs as described above, and is integrated with a conveying blade holder to which conveying blades  made of a flexible material, such as a resin film, are provided.","Furthermore, the nozzle receiver  illustrated in  includes a container seal  serving as a seal, a receiving opening  serving as a nozzle insertion opening, the container shutter , and a container shutter spring  serving as a biasing member. The container seal  is a seal including a front surface that faces and comes in contact with the nozzle shutter flange of the nozzle shutter  held by the conveying nozzle  when the toner container  is attached to the main body of the copier . The receiving opening  is an opening in which the conveying nozzle  is inserted. The container shutter  is a shutter that opens and closes the receiving opening . The container shutter spring  is a biasing member that biases the container shutter  to a closing position so as to close the receiving opening .","Moreover, in the configuration illustrated in , the nozzle receiver  includes an outer surface that slidably mates with the inner surface of container setting section of the main body of the copier  illustrated in . Furthermore, as illustrated in , the container shutter  includes a contact portion that comes in contact with the conveying nozzle , and includes shutter supporting portions . The shutter supporting portions extend from the contact portion in the longitudinal direction of the container body , and include hook portions that prevent the container shutter  from coming off from the nozzle receiver  due to biasing by the container shutter spring . The container gear  provided as a separate body is provided to the nozzle receiver  of the toner container  such that the container gear can transmit drive.","As described above, it is possible to integrate the components, such as a scooping inner wall surface, a bridging portion, and openings of shutter supporting portion serving as shutter side openings, for introducing toner to the nozzle hole .","The toner container  including the scooping ribs will be described in detail below.","As illustrated in , the toner container  includes the container front end cover , the container body , a rear cover  serving as a rear cap, the nozzle receiver , and the like. The container front end cover  is arranged on the front end of the toner container  in the attachment direction Q with respect to the main body of the copier . The container body  has an approximately cylindrical shape. The rear cover  is arranged on the rear end of the toner container  in the attachment direction Q. The nozzle receiver  is rotatably held by the approximately cylindrical container body  as described above.","The gear exposing opening (see ) is arranged on the container front end cover  in order to expose the container gear  attached to the nozzle receiver . The approximately cylindrical container body  holds the nozzle receiver  so that the nozzle receiver  can rotate. The container front end cover  and the rear cover  are attached to the container body  (by a well-known method, such as thermal welding or adhesive agent). The rear cover  includes a rear side bearing that supports one end of the conveying blade holder , and includes a gripper  that a user can grip when he\/she attaches and detaches the toner container  to and from the main body of the copier .","A method to assemble the container front end cover , the rear cover , and the nozzle receiver  on the container body  will be explained below.","The nozzle receiver  is first inserted in the container body  from the container rear side, and positioning is performed such that the nozzle receiver  is rotatably supported by a front side bearing  arranged on the front end of the container body . Subsequently, positioning is performed such that one end of the conveying blade holder of the nozzle receiver  is rotatably supported by the rear side bearing arranged on the rear cover , and the rear cover  is assembled to the container body . Thereafter, the container gear  is assembled to the nozzle receiver  from the container front side. After the container gear  is assembled, the container front end cover  is assembled to the container body  so as to cover the container gear  from the container front side.","Incidentally, the assembling of the container body  and the container front end cover , the assembling of the container body  and the rear cover , and the assembling of the nozzle receiver  and the container gear  are performed by appropriately using a well-known method (for example, thermal welding, adhesive agent, or the like).","A configuration for conveying toner from the toner container  to the nozzle hole  will be explained below.","The scooping ribs protrude so as to come closer to the inner surface of the container body  such that rib surfaces are connected from downstream side parts , which are on the downstream side in the rotation direction, of shutter side supporting portions serving as shutter side portions. The rib surfaces are bent once in their middle portions so as to resemble curved surfaces; however, the configuration is not limited to this example depending on the compatibility with toner. For example, simple flat ribs without bend may be used. With this configuration, it becomes not necessary to form a bulged portion in the container body . Furthermore, the scooping ribs stand from the openings of shutter supporting portion in an integrated manner. Therefore, it becomes possible to obtain the same bridging function and advantageous effects as those obtained in the configuration in which the shutter side supporting portions and the convexes are tightly fitted to each other. Specifically, when the nozzle receiver  rotates while the toner container  is being attached to the main body of the image forming apparatus, the conveying blades are rotated, so that the toner contained in the toner container  is conveyed from the rear side to the front side where the nozzle receiver  is arranged. Subsequently, the scooping ribs receive the toner conveyed by the conveying blades , scoop up the toner from bottom to top along with the rotation, and introduce the toner into the nozzle hole  by using the rib surfaces as slides.","Furthermore, similarly to the first embodiment, when a user places the toner container  according to the second embodiment on the gutter  of the container receiving section  of the toner container holder  and pushes the toner container  in the attachment direction Q, the toner container  moves on the gutter . Along with the movement of the toner container , the state of the container front end cover  is changed from the first restricted state to the fifth restricted state, so that the position of the toner container is restricted in a stepped manner according to each of the states. When the toner container is further pushed in the attachment direction Q to change the state from the fifth restricted state to the sixth restricted state, a container opening is entered further into the inner surface of container setting section and located in the setting position. And the replenishing device engaging members  and  are entered into and engaged with the respective engaged openings of the container engaged portions . Incidentally, in the present embodiment too, the shape of the container opening is not limited to the cylindrical shape, as long as the container opening is entered into the container setting section  so that the radial position is determined, as illustrated in . That is, the shape of the container opening is not limited to the continuous cylindrical shape, but may be divided or may be a rod shape. Therefore, the toner container  is prevented from moving in the longitudinal direction.","As described above, by restricting the positional relationship between the toner container  and the toner replenishing device  in a stepped manner to perform positioning along with the movement of the toner container  in the attachment direction Q with respect to the toner replenishing device , it becomes possible to stabilize the positions of the centers of the conveying nozzle , the container shutter , and the receiving opening . Therefore, it becomes possible to improve the operability in the attachment operation and prevent toner leakage.","Meanwhile, as the scooping portion for improving toner conveying performance to the nozzle hole serving as a powder receiving hole, it is also possible to adopt configurations as disclosed in International Publication No. WO2013\/183782, International Publication No. WO2013\/077474, and U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/991,250, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

Therefore, the connector  is arranged at a position on the main body of the toner replenishing device  so as to face the front end surface of the container front end cover .","As illustrated in , the IC tag  is provided with an IC tag opening  in which a terminal is set, at a position vertically above the gravity center of a substrate  in the tag vertical direction. The IC tag opening  serves as a positioning opening to determine a position of the IC tag  with respect to the image forming apparatus. An earth terminal  for grounding (earth), which is a metal terminal, is mounted on the inner surface of the ID tag opening  and on the periphery of the ID tag opening . The earth terminal  is provided on the front surface of the substrate  such that two earth terminal projections  extend in the tag horizontal direction relative to the annular portion. One rectangular metallic pad  (a first metallic pad ) is arranged above the IC tag opening  in the tag vertical direction. Furthermore, two metallic pads  (a second metallic pad and a third metallic pad ) are arranged below the IC tag opening  in the tag vertical direction. A hemispherical protector , which is made of a resin material such as epoxy and which covers and protects an information storage unit, is provided on the back surface of the substrate .","As illustrated in , the holding mechanism  holds the IC tag  having with the configuration as described above on a vertical surface that is a downstream surface of the container front end cover  in the attachment direction. The holding mechanism  includes a holder , which serves as an IC tag holder and which has a base for holding the IC tag , and a holding portion , which serves as a cover portion, which holds the IC tag , and which is detachably attached to the holder . The IC tag  and the holding mechanism  are arranged in an obliquely upper right space of the container front end cover  when viewed from the container front side along the rotation axis of the toner container . Specifically, the holding mechanism  is arranged on the container front end cover  by using the obliquely upper right space that becomes a dead space when the toner container  is arranged in tandem with the other toner containers  of the other colors. Therefore, it becomes possible to provide a compact-size toner replenishing device that enables the cylindrical toner containers  to be arranged adjacent to one another. Incidentally, in the obliquely upper left space of the container front end cover , the container gear  and the container driving gear  of the main body are arranged.","The substrate  of the IC tag  is sandwiched by the holder  of the holding mechanism  and the holding portion  configured as described above, so that the IC tag  is held such that the metallic pads to and the earth terminal  face the connector .","As illustrated in  and , the connector  includes a positioning pin , three apparatus main-body terminals , and an apparatus main-body earth terminal . The three apparatus main-body terminals  are arranged so as to face the metallic pads to , and come into contact with the respective pads to read information from the IC tag  when the toner container  is moved in the attachment direction Q on the gutter  of the toner container holder . The positioning pin  is arranged so as to face the IC tag opening  used for positioning, and is inserted in the IC tag opening  when the toner container  is being moved and attached to the toner replenishing device  in the attachment direction Q. The positions of the IC tag  and the connector  are determined by insertion of the positioning pin  into the IC tag opening . The apparatus main-body earth terminal  is configured such that the positioning pin  comes in contact with the earth terminal  inserted in the IC tag opening .","In the present embodiment, the positioning pin  is inserted in the IC tag opening  due to the movement of the toner container  in the attachment direction Q between the fifth restricted state and the sixth restricted state as described above.","Specifically, before the positioning pin  is inserted in the IC tag opening , the positions of the toner container  in the vertical direction Z and the width direction W are roughly determined in the first restricted state. In the second restricted state, the movement of the container front end cover  in the radial direction relative to the container cover receiving section  is restricted by the contact between the three protrusions and the inner surface of setting cover . Namely, in the second restricted state, the positions of the toner container  in the width direction W, the vertical direction Z, and the radial direction are determined. Furthermore, in the third restricted state, the rotation restrictive rib is entered into the groove of the setting cover , so that the movement of the container front end cover  in a circumferential direction R is restricted. Subsequently, in the fourth restricted state, the restriction in the radial direction is released. Thereafter, in the fifth restricted state, the container opening is entered into the inner surface of container setting section , so that the position of the container body  relative to the toner replenishing device  is determined.","Therefore, when the positioning pin  is inserted in the IC tag opening , the restriction in the vertical direction, the width direction, the circumferential direction, and the radial direction is performed, so that it is possible to stabilize the relative position of the positioning pin  and the IC tag opening . As a result, in the present embodiment, it becomes possible to improve the operability in the attachment operation, prevent toner leakage, and prevent a contact failure between the IC tag  and the connector .","Fourth Embodiment","In a fourth embodiment, an explanation will be given of identification mechanism (identifier) for identifying the compatibility between each of the toner containers and the toner replenishing device.","In general, to identify the compatibility, identified portions are provided on the respective toner containers and identifying parts are provided on the toner container holder of the toner replenishing device, where the identified portions and identifying parts serve as identification mechanism and differ from type to type. If a different type of a toner container is to be attached to the toner container holder, the identified portion and the identifying part do not match with each other and are opposed to each other to prevent the toner container from being attached to the toner container holder in order to prevent erroneous attachment.","A predetermined clearance is provided between the toner container and the toner container holder to make the attachment easy. If such a clearance is not provided, attachment posture for attaching a correct toner container is severely restricted and attachment of the toner container becomes difficult. In contrast, if the clearance is too large, while the attachment becomes easier, the degree of freedom in the posture of the toner container increases and a certain force may act to allow the toner container to be attached to the toner container holder even when the posture of the toner container is incorrect. Therefore, if more than a predetermined amount of load is applied to the toner container to be attached, the toner container may be erroneously attached to the toner container holder even with a wrong combination of the identified portion and the identifying part that are not supposed to be attached to each other.","The identification mechanism provided on the toner container holder is arranged on the relatively front side of the image forming apparatus so that the compatibility can be identified at an early stage of the attachment. Therefore, the insertion hole part on which the identification mechanism is provided is molded with soft material, such as resin, in order to prevent a user from being hurt when he\/she touches this part during the attachment of the toner container. Therefore, the identification mechanism provided on the insertion hole part is easily bent, so that even when a different type of the toner container is to be attached, the toner container may be moved across the identification mechanism and attached to the toner container holder.","If a different type of the toner container is attached as described above, it becomes impossible to detach the toner container, or the identified portion and the identifying part serving as the identification mechanism may be broken. When, in view of the standardization of components, the same toner containers are used even for different types, and the different types are distinguished by different combinations of the identified portions and the identifying parts. If a wrong toner container is attached to the toner container holder, toner of a different color or a different type is conveyed by the toner replenishing device. Therefore, certain components, such as a developing device or a process cartridge, of the image forming apparatus may be damaged.","Therefore, in the present embodiment, restriction mechanism (restrictor) is provided to restrict the identified portion of the toner container from moving while passing over the identifying part arranged on the toner container holder. By providing the restriction mechanism, even when an incompatible toner container is attached to and forcibly pushed into the toner container holder, the identified portion does not pass over the bent identifying part and the toner container is not attached to the wrong toner replenishing device. Therefore, it becomes possible to reliably prevent a different type of the toner container from being attached and prevent the identifying part arranged on the toner container holder from being broken.","An incompatibility relationship between the toner container and the toner container holder will be explained in detail below with reference to drawings.  is an explanatory perspective view of the front end of the toner container .  is a bottom view of the front end of the toner container . In the present embodiment, an identified portion  is provided on a lower portion of the outer surface of the container front end cover serving as a lower portion of the toner container . The identified portion  is arranged between the pair of the sliding guides  and  serving as a restrictor (vertical restrictor) located in the width direction W. It is sufficient that the identified portion  is located on the lower portion of the outer surface of the container front end cover of the container front end cover , and the position is not limited to between the sliding guides  and . In the present embodiment, the identified portion  is a gap (in other word, an identified gap)  provided between a pair of identified protrusions  and  (in other words, an identified rib) protruding from the outer surface of the container front end cover , where the identified protrusions  and  serve as protrusions between the sliding guides, and the gap  serves as a gap between the protrusions. Alternatively, or in addition, the identified portion  is a gap  that is provided in the lower portions of the sliding guides  and  along the attachment direction so as to be a concave shape, where the gap  serves as a passage, a notch, a recess of the sliding guide, or a recess of the reinforcing portions. In the present embodiment, the gap  is provided in the reinforcing portions  and  serve as parts of the sliding guides  and . A width W of the gap , presence or absence of the gap , and presence or absence of the gap  of the sliding guide are set differently depending on a toner color, a toner type, or an apparatus model. The identified protrusions  are arranged on the upstream side in the attachment direction (on the rear side of the toner container) relative to front ends of the sliding guides and . Furthermore, each of the identified protrusions  is provided such that an upper part of the identified protrusion is connected to and integrated with the container front end cover  and side parts the identified protrusion and of are connected to and integrated with each of the sliding guides  and  integrated with the container front end cover . Therefore, the strength of the components can be increased as compared to a configuration in which only upper portions of the components are integrated with the container front end cover .","In the present embodiment, as illustrated in , the toner container holder  to and from which the toner container  is attached and detached includes the container cover receiving section , the container receiving section , and an insertion hole part A.","The insertion hole part A is provided with the insertion holes (Y, M, C, K), through which the toner containers  for the respective colors passes when the toner containers  are attached and detached. The insertion holes have shapes similar to the external shapes of the container front end covers  for the respective colors, and are provided such that, as illustrated in  and , a certain gap is maintained between the outer surface of container front end cover and the inner surface of each of the insertion holes (Y, M, C, K) when the toner container is attached and detached.","On an insertion hole base that constitutes a lower part of each of the insertion holes , an identifying protrusion  (in other words, a rib, an identifying rib), which serves as an identifying part and which is to be loosely or tightly fitted to or engaged with the identified portion  of the toner container  to identify the type of the toner container, is provided so as to protrude upward from the insertion hole base . On lower side surfaces and of the insertion holes in the width direction W, restriction ribs  and  (Y, M, C, K) serving as restriction parts are arranged. The widths and the protrusion amounts of the restriction ribs  and  (Y, M, C, K) are set such that the restriction ribs  and  can be inserted in the sliding grooves and of the sliding guides  and  (see ) when the toner container  for each of the colors is inserted in each of the insertion holes , so that the sliding guides  and  are allowed to slide. Therefore, the identified portion  provided on the lower portion of each of the container front end covers  is fitted to or engaged with each of the identifying protrusions  while the sliding grooves receive the respective restriction ribs  and the vertical movement of the container front end cover  is restricted. At this time, because the vertical movement is restricted, the toner container  is prevented from being lifted up when the identified portion  and the identifying protrusion  are fitted to or engaged with each other. Therefore, it becomes possible to prevent the toner container  from being continuously inserted across the identifying protrusion  and from being attached in a wrong position.","Incidentally, it is preferable to set the lengths of the sliding grooves of the sliding guides  in the width direction W (the depths of the grooves) (see ) such that about two-thirds or more of the lengths of the restriction ribs  in the width direction W (the height of the ribs) can be inserted. If the lengths of the centers of the sliding grooves in the width direction W (the depths of the grooves) (see ) are shorter than two-thirds of the lengths of the restriction ribs  in the width direction W (the heights of the ribs) such that the lengths of the groove inclined portions become relatively longer, the strength of the sliding guides  can be increased, but only front ends of the restriction ribs  are inserted in the sliding grooves and the restriction in the vertical direction becomes weaker. Therefore, the rear end of the toner container  is lifted up with respect to the restriction ribs . Consequently, even when a wrong toner container is inserted, the toner container may erroneously be attached across the identifying protrusion .","As illustrated in , the restriction ribs  (Y, M, C) on each of the insertion holes (Y, M, C), in which the toner containers  (Y, M, C) are inserted, are provided so as to protrude in opposite directions from the lower side surfaces and at the same height as the guide rails  (Y, M, C) provided on the container cover receiving section .","In contrast, as illustrated in , the restriction ribs K on the insertion hole (K), in which the toner container K is inserted, are provided such that the bottom surfaces are located at the same height as the guide rails  (K) arranged on the container cover receiving section  (see ). Incidentally, the lengths of the restriction ribs  (K) in the height direction differ from the lengths of the guide rails  (K) in the height direction such that the lengths of the guide rails (K) are longer than those of the restriction ribs  (K). Therefore, even when any of the toner containers (Y, M, C) that are smaller in size than the toner container  (K) is erroneously inserted in the insertion hole (K) that is greater in size than the insertion holes (Y, M, C), and if the toner container  is continuously inserted across the identifying protrusion , the guide rails  (K) abut against the sliding guides  (Y, M, C) of each of the toner containers  (Y, M, C), so that further insertion can be restricted and erroneous attachment can be prevented. Furthermore, the guide rails  (Y, M, C, K) and the restriction ribs  (Y, M, C, K) may be integrated with each other.","While the lengths of the restriction ribs K in the height direction are shorter than the lengths of the sliding grooves in the same direction, base ends of the restriction ribs K at the protruding positions on the lower side surfaces and are provided so as to pass by the positions closer to the lower inner surfaces of the sliding grooves than the upper inner surfaces of the sliding grooves when the toner container  is inserted. Therefore, when the restriction ribs  are inserted in the sliding grooves , gaps between the bottom surfaces of the restriction ribs  and the lower inner surfaces of the sliding grooves are reduced. Therefore, even when the toner container  is erroneously inserted, it becomes possible to prevent the toner container  from being lifted up and continuously inserted across the identifying protrusion .","Furthermore, as another restrictor of the present embodiment, the top portion of upward guide arranged on the container front end cover  of the toner container  is used. As illustrated in , the top portion of upward guide comes in contact with a ceiling surface , which is an upper surface of the insertion hole part A and which faces the identifying protrusion  in the vertical direction, so that the vertical movement of the toner container can be restricted. Therefore, it becomes possible to further prevent the toner container  from being lifted up and from being continuously inserted across the identifying protrusion . Incidentally, because the inclined surfaces of upward guide are provided on the upward guide  (see ), when the toner container  is to be detached from the toner container holder , the toner container  is moved in the detachment direction through the insertion hole part A along the slopes of the inclined surfaces of upward guide . Therefore, the operability in the detachment operation can be improved.","A relationship between the identifying protrusion  and the identified portion  will be explained below. In the present embodiment, in the case of the compatible toner container  that is attachable to the insertion hole , as illustrated in  for example, the width W of the gap  is set to be wider than a width W of the identifying protrusion  of the insertion hole . In the case of the incompatible toner container  that is not insertable in the insertion hole , as illustrated in , the width W of the gap  is set to be narrower than the width W of the identifying protrusion  of the insertion hole ","Therefore, when an operator inserts the toner container  in the insertion hole , the restriction ribs  and  illustrated in  to  are first entered into the sliding grooves and of the sliding guides  and  as illustrated in  and . Therefore, the vertical movement of the toner container  (the container front end cover ) is restricted. At this time, the operator cannot move the toner container in the attachment direction Q if the restriction ribs  and  cannot be entered into the sliding grooves and ; therefore, the toner container  can be maintained in a correct posture.","If the toner container  is pushed in the attachment direction Q in the restricted state, the identified portion  approaches the identifying protrusion . At this time, if the toner container  being attached is the attachable toner container , as illustrated in , the width W of the gap  of the identified portion  is wider than the width W of the identifying protrusion . Therefore, the movement of the toner container  in the attachment direction Q is not restricted and the gap  passes by the identifying protrusion , so that the container front end cover  is moved on the container receiving section  and set in the container cover receiving section .","In contrast, if the toner container  being attached is the unattachable toner container , as illustrated in , the width W of the gap  of the identified portion  is narrower than the width W of the identifying protrusion . Therefore, the identified protrusions  of the identified portion  come in contact with the identifying protrusion  of the insertion hole . Therefore, the movement of the toner container  in the attachment direction Q is restricted and the gap  cannot pass over the identifying protrusion , so that it becomes possible to prevent the unattachable and incompatible toner container  from being attached.","Even if the unattachable toner container  is forcibly pushed in the attachment direction Q, the vertical movement of the toner container  (the container front end cover ) is restricted by the sliding grooves and and the restriction ribs  and . Therefore, it becomes possible to prevent the identified portion  from passing over the identifying protrusion , enabling to more reliably prevent the unattachable and incompatible toner container  from being attached.","Furthermore, in the present embodiment, whether the gap  is allowed to pass over the identifying protrusion  is controlled according to the width W of the gap  of the toner container  and the presence or absence of the gap  of the sliding guide. Namely, the compatibility and the incompatibility can be determined by adjusting the width W or determining the presence or absence of the gap  of the sliding guide according to the position or the numbers of the identifying protrusions .

Specifically, each of the protrusions between sliding guides , , and is arranged such that one end thereof is located near the front ends of sliding guides and . Because the end of each of the protrusions between sliding guides , , and is located near the front ends of sliding guides , when a wrong toner container  is attached, a wall surface of each of the protrusions between sliding guides , , and on the downstream side in the attachment direction is fitted to the identifying protrusion  immediately after the toner container  is entered into the insertion hole of the insertion hole part . If, contrary to the present embodiment, the identified protrusion is provided on a container rear side of the sliding guides  so as to be located distant from the front ends between sliding guides , the identified portion  comes in contact with the identifying protrusion  after the front ends between sliding guides are entered into the gutter  across the insertion hole base . As described above, the insertion hole part  is likely to be touched by an operator and is therefore made of a material that is softer and more flexible than those of the container receiving section  and the gutter  arranged on the rear side relative to the insertion hole part  in the attachment direction. Therefore, if the toner container  is pushed in the attachment direction while the rear side of the toner container is being moved in the vertical direction, the contact portion between the front ends of sliding guides and the gutter  that is hard to bend acts as a fulcrum to cause the insertion hole base or the identifying protrusion  protruding from the insertion hole base to bend. If the identifying protrusion  is bent, the identified portion  can easily pass over the identifying protrusion , so that the toner container  may be attached in a wrong position.","In contrast, according to the present embodiment, as illustrated in , each of the protrusions between sliding guides (identified portions) , , and comes in contact with the identifying protrusion  when the front ends of sliding guides are located on the insertion hole base before being entered into the gutter . Therefore, even when the toner container  is pushed in the attachment direction while the rear end of the toner container  is being moved in the vertical direction during the attachment operation of the toner container , because the contact position between the front ends of sliding guides and the insertion hole base acts as a fulcrum, the identifying protrusions  is bent in accordance with the vertical movement of the toner container . Therefore, each of the protrusions between sliding guides , , and can hardly pass over the identifying protrusion , so that it becomes possible to reliably prevent the toner container  from being attached in a wrong position.","Furthermore, according to the present embodiment, in the state illustrated in , each of the protrusions between sliding guides , , and comes in contact with the identifying protrusion  at a position at which the fronts of sliding groove , each having a narrow clearance gap between the upper surface and the lower surface thereof, of the sliding guides  sandwich the respective restriction ribs  as illustrated in .","Therefore, each of the protrusions between the sliding guides , , and and the identifying protrusion  come in contact with each other while the vertical restriction by the sliding guides  and the restriction ribs  is intensified. Therefore, each of the protrusions between the sliding guides , , and and the identifying protrusion  come in contact with each other while the vertical movement of the toner container  is restricted, so that it becomes possible to reliably prevent each of the protrusions between sliding guides , , and from passing over the identifying protrusions  and prevent the toner container  from being attached in a wrong position.","As described above, by setting the locations of the identifying protrusion  and setting the locations, the dimensions, and the presence or absence of each of the protrusion between the sliding guides, the gap between the protrusions, and the gap of the sliding guide according to toner colors, toner components, and apparatus models, as well as by restricting the vertical movement by the sliding guides  and  and the restriction ribs , it becomes possible to increase variations of the incompatibility relationships between the toner container  and the toner container holder  while ensuring good operability, rather than the incompatibility relationships based on simple engagement\/disengagement of protrusions. Therefore, it becomes possible to more reliably prevent an unattachable toner container from being attached.","The configurations of the identifying protrusion , the identified portion , and the restriction ribs  are not applied to only the first embodiment, but applied to the relationship between the container front end cover  of the toner container and the insertion hole in the second and the third embodiments. Even in these cases, the same advantageous effects as those of the present embodiment can be obtained.","Sixth Embodiment","In a sixth embodiment, another example of the radial restrictor of the toner container  with respect to the toner replenishing device  as described in the first to the fifth embodiments will be explained.","As illustrated in , setting cover protrusions protruding inward from the inner surface of setting cover are provided at three evenly-spaced positions in the circumferential direction on the setting cover . When the container front end cover  is entered into the container cover receiving section , the outer surface of the container front end cover  comes in contact with the setting cover protrusions , so that the movement of the toner container  is guided and the radial position is determined. The container front end cover  includes recesses that can face the setting cover protrusions . When the toner container  is pushed to a predetermined position in the attachment direction Q in the toner replenishing device , the recesses are located opposite the setting cover protrusions . Accordingly, the radial restriction of the container front end cover  by the outer surface of the container front end cover  and the setting cover protrusions is released.","While the toner container  is explained as an example in the sixth embodiment, the present embodiment may be applied to the toner container  of the second embodiment as illustrated in , in which a spiral groove is not provided on the outer surface of the container body  and the conveyor having the scooping function is provided inside the container body.","Seventh Embodiment","In a seventh embodiment, another example of the circumferential restrictor of the toner container  with respect to the toner replenishing device  will be explained.","As illustrated in , the container front end cover  is provided with a circumferential restricting groove serving as a circumferential restrictor on the outer surface thereof. The circumferential restricting groove is provided inward from the outer surface of container front end cover . Hereinafter, the circumferential restricting groove is referred to as a rotation restrictive concave serving as a guiding portion or a circumferential positioner. The rotation restrictive concave is arranged so as to be entered into a convex , which serves as a convex of a main-body side and which is provided on the setting cover  illustrated in , when the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device .","In the following, the order of restriction and release of all of the positioners of the sixth and seventh embodiments with respect to the toner replenishing device  will be explained with reference to  and . The order is basically the same as the order as illustrated in  and  to E, except that the configurations of the setting cover protrusions , the rotation restrictive concave , and the convex of the setting cover are different. Therefore, in the following, the explanation will be simplified appropriately.","As illustrated in , when a user places the toner container  on the gutter  of the container receiving section  of the toner container holder  and pushes the toner container  in the attachment direction Q (performs attachment operation), the toner container  slides on the gutter . At this time, as illustrated in , the toner container  slides while the side portions of upward guide of the toner container  come in contact with the projections provided from the ceiling surface  facing the gutter . Therefore, the toner container  can be pushed in the attachment direction Q while the movement of the toner container  in the vertical direction Z is restricted. Furthermore, the movement in the vertical direction is restricted not by the top portion of upward guide on the top of the upward guide  but by the side portions of upward guide provided on the both sides of the top portion of upward guide . Therefore, even when the toner container  is deviated in the horizontal direction during the pushing operation, the toner container  can reliably brought into contact with the ceiling surface  side.","On the toner replenishing device  side, as illustrated in , the fronts of sliding grooves , serving as the first guides, are entered into the most upstream side of the respective guide rails  and  in the attachment direction Q. Therefore, the positions in the width direction W perpendicular to the attachment direction Q and in the vertical direction Z are roughly determined (a first restricted state).","When the toner container  in the first restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, as illustrated in , the end surface of container shutter and the front end of conveying nozzle come in contact with each other. When the toner container  is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, a second restricted state as illustrated in  is obtained, in which the front end of the container front end cover  is entered into the container cover receiving section . Due to the entrance of the front end of the container front end cover  into the container cover receiving section , the outer surface of container cover comes in contact with, from the inner side, the setting cover protrusions provided on the inner surface of setting cover . Due to the contact between the outer surface of container cover and the setting cover protrusions of the inner surface of setting cover , the movement of the toner container  is guided and the radial movement is restricted.","When the toner container  in the second restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, the container seal  and the nozzle shutter flange come in contact with each other as illustrated in . When the toner container  in this state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, a third restricted state as illustrated in  is obtained. In the third restricted state, the fronts of sliding grooves come off from the guide rails , and the vertical direction Z is restricted by the centers of sliding grooves , serving as second guides, as illustrated in . Furthermore, the rotation restrictive concave provided on the outer surface of container cover of the front end of the container front end cover  is entered into the convex provided on the setting cover . Therefore, the container front end cover  and the setting cover  (the container cover receiving section ) are integrated and the movement of the container front end cover  in the circumferential direction R is restricted, so that the container front end cover  does not rotate with the rotation of the container body .","When the toner container  in the third restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, a fourth restricted state as illustrated in  is obtained, in which the recesses provided on the container front end cover  are located opposite the setting cover protrusions . Therefore, the radial restriction of the container front end cover  by the outer surface of the container front end cover  and the setting cover protrusions is released.","When the toner container  in the fourth restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, a fifth restricted state as illustrated in  is obtained, in which the container opening is entered into the inner surface of container setting section (the setting cover ) and the container body  is rotatably supported inside the inner surface of container setting section . At this time, the circumferential position of the container front end cover  is restricted by the rotation restrictive concave and the convex of setting cover , so that the container opening and the container setting section  can mate with each other such that the respective centers coincide with each other. Therefore, it becomes possible to prevent toner leakage from the container shutter  due to insertion of the container opening into the container setting section  in a deviated manner. Furthermore, when the container opening is entered into the inner surface of container setting section , the radial restriction by the outer surface of container cover and the setting cover protrusions is already released, so that the circumferential restriction by the rotation restrictive concave is not interfered.","When the toner container  in the fifth restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, a sixth restricted state as illustrated in  is obtained. In the sixth restricted state, the container opening is entered further into the inner surface of container setting section , and the replenishing device engaging members  and  are entered into and fitted to the respective engaged openings of the container engaged portions  and  (see ). Therefore, the toner container  is prevented from moving in the longitudinal direction (the rotation axis direction) and is maintained in the setting position.","As described above, if the rotation restrictive portion of the container front end cover  has a convex shape with respect to the outer surface of container cover , and if impact or a force is applied to the convex portion because of dropping or the like, stress is concentrated and the rotation restrictive portion may be damaged. However, as in the present embodiment, if the rotation restrictive portion is provided as the rotation restrictive concave that has a concave shape with respect to the outer surface of the container front end cover , the rotation restrictive portion does not come in contact with a floor at the time of dropping for example. Therefore, it becomes possible to prevent the rotation restrictive portion from being damaged.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0446","num":"0445"},"figref":["FIGS. 87A to 87F","FIGS. 87A to 87F","FIG. 87A","FIG. 87B","FIG. 87C","FIG. 87D","FIG. 87E","FIG. 87F"],"b":["700","32","33","34","700"]},"Eighth Embodiment","In an eighth embodiment, the configuration of a cover portion of a toner container serving as a powder container differs from the configuration of the container front end cover  serving as the cover portion as described above, and the configuration of a container holding section to which the toner container is attached differs from the configuration of the toner container holder  serving as the container holding section as described above. Furthermore, the configuration of identification mechanism for identifying the compatibility between the toner container and the toner container holder (the toner replenishing device ) differs from the configuration of the identification mechanism as described above. Therefore, in the eighth embodiment, the configurations of the cover portion, the container holding section, and the identification mechanism will be mainly explained. The container body  or  and the other components having the same configurations as those described above will be denoted by the same reference numerals and the same explanation will be omitted appropriately.","As illustrated in , , , , , and , a toner container  serving as a powder container according to the present embodiment includes the container body  for storing toner as a powder for image formation, and a container front end cover  serving as a container cover attached to the outer surface of the container body . The container body  is rotatably held by the container front end cover .","The container front end cover  is provided in a cylindrical shape such that one end is opened and the container opening of the container body  protrudes from a front end of container cover in the attachment direction. A gear exposing opening is arranged on an outer surface of container front end cover so that a part of the container gear  of the container body  can be exposed when the container front end cover  is attached to the container body .","Cover hooks , which are engaged with the cover hook stoppers  of the container body , are arranged at three positions in the circumferential direction on the front end of container front end cover in the attachment direction. Therefore, the container body  and the container front end cover  can rotate relative to each other.","Container engaged portions  and  are provided on the outer surface of container front end cover to determine the position of the toner container  relative to a toner container holder  (the toner replenishing device ) illustrated in  to  in the axial direction. The replenishing device engaging members  and  are engaged with the respective container engaged portions  and  when the toner container  is attached to the toner container holder  (the toner replenishing device ).","The function and the configuration of each of the container engaged portions  and  are the same as those of the container engaged portions  explained above with reference to  and . Specifically, as illustrated in , each of the container engaged portions  includes a guiding protrusion , a guiding groove , a bump , and an engaged opening serving as a guiding portion, an axial restrictor, an axial regulator, an axial positioner, or an axial guide. Two sets of the container engaged portions  are arranged on left and right sides of the container front end cover , respectively, where one set of the container engaged portion  includes the guiding protrusion , the guiding groove , the bump , and the engaged opening as described above. Incidentally, the container engaged portions  differ from the container engaged portions  in that the container engaged portions  and  are arranged on the container front end cover  so as to face each other and be inclined with respect to the horizontal line passing through the center of the container opening , while the container engaged portions  and  are located in approximately horizontal direction on the container front end cover . Specifically, the engaged openings and are arranged on left and right sides across the center of the container opening such that one of the engaged openings is located above the gear exposing opening and the other one of the engaged openings is located below the gear exposing opening . Each of the guiding protrusions is arranged on the container front end of the container front end cover  so as to be located on a vertical plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container  and on an inclined line passing through the rotation axis of the container body . Each of the guiding protrusions includes an inclined surface connected to each of the guiding grooves so as to come in contact with the replenishing device engaging members  and guide the replenishing device engaging members  to the guiding grooves when the toner container  is attached. Each of the guiding grooves is a groove recessed from the side surface of the container front end cover .","The width of each of the guiding grooves is set to be slightly wider than the width of each of the replenishing device engaging members  such that the replenishing device engaging members  do not come off from the guiding grooves . The container rear ends of the guiding grooves are not directly connected to the respective engaged openings but are terminated, and are located at the same height as the side surfaces of the container front end cover . Namely, the outer surface of container front end cover with a width of about 1 mm is exposed between each of the guiding grooves and each of the quadrangular the engaged openings , and this portion serves as the bump . The replenishing device engaging members  pass over the bumps and fall in the engaged openings , so that the toner container  and the toner container holder  (the toner replenishing device ) are engaged with each other. This state is the setting position (setting state) of the toner container .","As illustrated in , the container shutter  is located in the center of a segment connecting the two container engaged portions  on a virtual plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. If the container shutter  is not located on the segment connecting the two container engaged portions , the following situations may occur. Specifically, due to the biasing forces of the container shutter spring  and the nozzle shutter spring , a moment of force acts to rotate the toner container  about the segment, where the moment arm is a distance from the segment to the container shutter . Due to the action of the moment of force, the toner container  may be inclined with respect to the toner container holder  (the toner replenishing device ). In this case, an attachment load on the toner container  increases, so that a load is applied to the nozzle receiver  that holds and guides the container shutter . In particular, if the toner container  is new and adequately filled with toner, and when the toner container  is pushed from the rear side so as to insert the conveying nozzle  protruding in the horizontal direction, a moment of force acts to rotate the toner container  with the weight of toner added. Therefore, a load is applied to the nozzle receiver  in which the conveying nozzle  is inserted, and the nozzle receiver  may be deformed or broken in the worst case. In contrast, in the toner container  according to the present embodiment, the container shutter  is located on the segment connecting the two container engaged portions . Therefore, it becomes possible to prevent the toner container  from being inclined with respect to the toner container holder  (the toner replenishing device ) due to the biasing forces of the container shutter spring  and the nozzle shutter spring  that act at the position of the container shutter .","As illustrated in , , , , and , an IC tag  and a holder  are provided on the container front end cover , where the IC tag  serves as an IC chip, an information storage medium, or an information storage device of the toner container , and the holder  serves as an IC tag holder for the IC tag . The IC tag  employs a contact-type communication system.","As illustrated in , , and , in the IC tag , multiple rectangular metallic pads (metallic plates) such as a first metallic pad to a fourth metallic pad are arranged side by side on the surface of a rectangular substrate . The fourth metallic pad is an earth terminal for grounding (earth). An information storage unit is provided on the back surface of the substrate .","The IC tag  as described above is held on the container front end cover  by the holder  such that the first metallic pad to the fourth metallic pad are located on the downstream side in the attachment direction. The holder  is arranged on the container front end cover  so as to protrude in the attachment direction Q relative to a vertical surface ","In the present embodiment, the holder  functions as a circumferential restrictor of the toner container , and is therefore integrally molded with the container front end cover  so that the relative position with respect to the container front end cover  can be managed easily. However, as long as the relative position of the holder  and the container front end cover  can be managed, the holder  may be provided separately from the container front end cover  and may be integrally mounted on the container front end cover  by connecting means, such as bonding, welding, or joining. In this case, it becomes possible to simplify the shape of the container front end cover , so that processing costs can be reduced.","The holder  is arranged in an approximately middle position between the container engaged portions  and  facing each other on the container front end cover  so as to be approximately parallel to the inclined segment connecting the container engaged portions  and . Therefore, the gear exposing opening is provided in an approximately horizontal position that is different from the position of the gear exposing opening provided on the container front end cover . Both side surfaces and , which serve as guiding portions, both surfaces of the holder, circumferential restrictor, circumferential regulators, circumferential positioners, or circumferential guides for restricting movement of the container front end cover  in the vertical direction, and which are located in the longitudinal direction of the holder .","The holder  is arranged in an obliquely upper left space of the container front end cover  when viewed from the container front side along the rotation axis of the toner container . Specifically, the holder  is arranged on the container front end cover  by using the obliquely upper left space that becomes a dead space when the toner container  is arranged in tandem with the other toner containers  of the other colors. Therefore, it becomes possible to provide the compact-size toner replenishing device  that enables the cylindrical toner containers  to be arranged adjacent to one another.","As mainly illustrated in , the container front end cover  includes a guiding portion that guides the container opening to the container setting section  as illustrated in  and  by restricting the toner container  being attached from moving in directions other than the attachment direction when the toner container  is attached to the printer  (the main body of the image forming apparatus).","As illustrated in , , and , a pair of sliding guides  and  are provided on both side surfaces of a lower portion of the container front end cover , where the sliding guides  and  serve as a pair of guiding portions, vertical restrictors, vertical regulators, vertical positioners, or vertical guides for restricting movement of the container front end cover  in the vertical direction, and the lower portion serves a lower portion of the outer surface of the container front end cover. Each of the sliding guides  and  includes an upper surface A serving as an upper guide and a lower surface B serving as a lower guide, each extending along the longitudinal direction of the container body . Sliding grooves and are provided between the upper surfaces A and the lower surfaces B, respectively.

In the present embodiment, the toner container holder  to which the single toner container  is attached will be described. Specifically, a monochrome image forming apparatus includes the single toner container holder  in the printer  (the main body of the image forming apparatus), and a multicolor image forming apparatus includes the same number of the toner container holders  as the number of colors in the printer  (the main body of the image forming apparatus). The toner container  set in the toner container holder  supplies, at a replenishing timing, toner to a developing device corresponding to the color of the toner contained in the toner container.","In the present embodiment, the toner replenishing device  includes the toner container holder , the conveying nozzle  serving as a conveyor, the conveying screw  serving as an apparatus main-body conveyor arranged inside the conveying nozzle , a container rotating part  serving as a driving part, and a toner dropping passage. When a user performs attachment operation to push the toner container  in the attachment direction Q and the toner container  is moved inside the toner container holder  of the printer  (the main body of the image forming apparatus, the conveying nozzle  of the toner replenishing device  is inserted from a front side of the toner container  in the attachment direction Q along with the attachment operation.

The container receiving section  is a section for holding the container body  of the toner container . The insertion hole part  is provided with an insertion hole serving as an insertion opening used in the attachment operation of the toner container  as illustrated in . When a main-body cover arranged on the front side of the copier  (the front side in the direction normal to the sheet of ) is opened, the insertion hole part  of the toner container holder  is exposed. Then, attachment\/detachment operation of the toner container  (attachment\/detachment operation with the longitudinal direction of the toner containers  taken as an attachment\/detachment direction) is performed from the front side of the copier  while the toner container  is oriented with its longitudinal direction being parallel to the horizontal direction. Incidentally, a setting cover  is a part of the container cover receiving section  of the toner container holder .","The container receiving section  is provided such that its longitudinal length becomes approximately the same as the longitudinal length of the container body Y. The container cover receiving section  is arranged on a container front side of the container receiving section  in the longitudinal direction (attachment\/detachment direction), and the insertion hole part  is arranged on one end of the container receiving section  in the longitudinal direction. The toner container  is able to move on the container receiving section  in a sliding manner. Therefore, along with the attachment operation of the toner container , the container front end cover  first passes through the insertion hole part , slides on the container receiving section  for a while, and is finally attached to the container cover receiving section .","As illustrated in , while the container front end cover  is attached to the container cover receiving section , the container rotating part  including the driving motor  and multiple gears inputs rotation drive to the container gear  provided in the container body  via the container driving gear  serving as an apparatus main-body gear. Therefore, the container body  is rotated in the arrow A direction in . With the rotation of the container body , the spiral groove  provided with a spiral shape on the inner surface of the container body  conveys toner stored in the container body  along the longitudinal direction of the container body . The conveyed toner is supplied from the container front end cover  side, which is on the other end of the toner container , to the inside of the conveying nozzle  via the nozzle hole  serving as a powder receiving hole provided on the conveying nozzle . Subsequently, the conveying screw  arranged inside the conveying nozzle  rotates when the rotation drive is input to the conveyor screw gear  of the container rotating part  serving as a driving part, so that the toner supplied in the conveying nozzle  is conveyed.

The container driving gear  rotates by receiving the rotation of the output gear from the conveyor screw gear  via the multiple coupled gears .","As illustrated in , , and , the setting cover  is arranged on the container cover receiving section . The conveying nozzle  is arranged in the center of the setting cover . As illustrated in , the conveying nozzle  is arranged so as to protrude from the end surface of container setting section on the downstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container  toward the upstream side in the attachment direction inside the container cover receiving section . The container setting section  serving as the container receiving section stands in the protruding direction of the conveying nozzle , that is, toward the upstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container , so as to surround the conveying nozzle . Specifically, the container setting section  is arranged at the base of the conveying nozzle  and serves as a positioner to determine the position of the container opening . When the container opening is inserted in and mated to the container setting section , the radial position of the container opening is determined.","As illustrated in , at the base of the conveying nozzle  located on the downstream side in the attachment direction when viewed from the attachment direction, the container setting section  is provided, to which the container opening is fitted when the toner container  is attached to the toner container holder . The container setting section  is located at the base of the conveying nozzle , and includes the end surface of container setting section on the downstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container  relative to the inner surface of container setting section in which the container opening is inserted. On the end surface of container setting section , the spring fixing parts protruding from the end surface of container setting section to the upstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container  are provided at eight evenly-spaced positions along the outer periphery of the nozzle shutter spring . By placing the spring fixing parts so as to cover the outer periphery of the nozzle shutter spring , it becomes possible to restrict the radial movement of the nozzle shutter spring . Therefore, it becomes possible to prevent the toner container  from being set while the nozzle shutter spring  is deviated in the radial direction and prevent the nozzle shutter spring  from being caught between the end surface of container setting section and the front end of the container opening , enabling to prevent a failure to attach the toner container  to the toner replenishing device .","When the toner container  is attached to the toner container holder , the outer surface of container opening of the toner container  slidably mates with the inner surface of container setting section ","By the mating the inner surface of the container setting section  and the outer surface of container opening of the toner container  to each other, the position of the toner container  relative to the toner container holder  in the radial direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container  is determined. Furthermore, when the toner container  rotates, the outer surface of container opening functions as a rotational shaft and the inner surface of container setting section functions as a bearing. At this time, the outer surface of container opening comes in sliding contact with the contact surfaces as parts of the inner surface of container setting section and the radial position of the toner container  relative to the toner container holder  is determined.","As illustrated in , the setting cover  is provided with holes and so as to face each other in the width direction W and allow the replenishing device engaging members  and  to move back and forth from the outer surface of the setting cover  to an inner surface of setting cover side. The holes and are inclined with respect to the horizontal direction so as to face the container engaged portions  and  when the toner container  is attached. The replenishing device engaging members  and  are biased from the outer side to the inner side of the setting cover  by biasing means, such as the torsion coil springs .","The setting cover  includes a connector , which serves as a reading means for reading information from the IC tag  by coming into contact with the IC tag  when the toner container  is attached, and includes a guiding part  for housing the connector . The guiding part  is a rectangular space that is arranged so as to protrude in the radial direction from the surface of the setting cover  and that extends in the insertion direction from the side opposite the front surface of the container front end cover . The size of the guiding part  is set so that the guiding part  can house the connector  and the holder  of the IC tag . The guiding part  serves as a circumferential restrictor.","As illustrated in , the connector  includes four apparatus main-body terminals (a first apparatus main-body terminal to a fourth apparatus main-body terminal ) that can come in contact with the first metallic pad to the fourth metallic pad , respectively. Incidentally, the fourth apparatus main-body terminal serves as an earth terminal of the main body that can come in contact with the fourth metallic pad serving as an earth terminal. The connector  is arranged on the inner rear side of the guiding part  on the downstream side in the attachment direction Q. The connector  comes in contact with the pads of the IC tag  and reads information from the IC tag  when the toner container  is moved in the attachment direction Q on a gutter  serving as a container mounting section of the toner container holder .","As illustrated in , on inner surfaces of wall and serving as an inner surface that protrude from the surface of the setting cover  (the container cover receiving section ) and that are located in the radial direction indicated by an arrow R, positioners  and  are provided so as to protrude from the inner surfaces of wall and to the inside of a space. The positioners  and  are provided on the inner surfaces of wall and so as to extend in the attachment direction Q such that one ends of positioners and are located on the upstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container  and other ends of positioners and are located on the downstream side in the attachment direction. The positioners  and  may be integrated with the inner surfaces of wall and , or may be provided as separate bodies and integrally mounted on the inner surfaces of wall and by bonding, welding, or the like. When the IC tag  is entered into the guiding part  at the time of attachment of the toner container , the both side surfaces and of the holder  come in contact with the positioners  and  as described above. In the present embodiment, the positioners  and  are provide such that a space between the positioners  and  is reduced along the attachment direction Q. Therefore, as the toner container  is moved further in the attachment direction Q, the both side surfaces and of the holder  and the positioners  and  are more tightly connected, so that the circumferential movement of the holder  between the positioners  and  is further restricted. Specifically, portions from the one ends of positioners and to centers of positioners and are provided as flat inclined surfaces such that the space between the positioners  and  is reduced, and the other ends of positioners and are provided with semicircular shapes and located parallel to each other. A width W between the one ends of positioners and is wider than a width W between the both side surfaces and of the holder  (see ). A width W between the other ends of positioners and is set to be the same as or slightly narrower than the width W between the both side surfaces and of the holder .","As illustrated in , the container receiving section  is provided with the gutter  serving as a container mounting section extending from the insertion hole part  to the container cover receiving section  along the longitudinal direction of the container body . The toner container  is able to move on the gutter  in a sliding manner in the longitudinal direction (the attachment\/detachment direction).","On side surfaces of gutter and , which are opposite surfaces arranged in the width direction W, guide rails  and  serving as guiding parts are arranged so as to face each other. The guide rails  protrude in the width direction W from the side surfaces of gutter and , extend in the longitudinal direction, and are arranged from one end of container receiving section to the front of the container cover receiving section . The guide rails  and  have functions to guide the container opening to the container setting section  serving as a container receiving section by being fitted to the sliding guides  serving as guiding portions when the toner container  is attached to the printer  (the main body of the image forming apparatus).","Incidentally, each of the guide rails  is divided into four sections in the longitudinal direction in the present embodiment; however, each of the guide rails  may be a single continuous rail in the longitudinal direction. The guide rails  are provided so as to be parallel to the rotation axis of the container body  when the toner container  is attached to the toner container holder .","Identification mechanism will be explained below.","The identification mechanism of the present embodiment enable to identify a combination of the toner container and the toner container holder according to toner colors, toner types, print speed, or apparatus models.","As illustrated in  and , an identified portion  constituting the identification mechanism for identifying the compatibility is provided between the sliding guides  and  on the lower portion of the outer surface of container front end cover . A reinforcing portion  is integrally provided between the sliding guides  and  in an integrally connected manner. The reinforcing portion  is provided along the whole length of the sliding guides  and  in the attachment\/detachment direction to prevent the sliding guides  from being damaged when the toner container  is dropped. The identified portion  is provided on the sliding guide. Specifically, the identified portion  is provided on the reinforcing portion . In the present embodiment, the identified portion  is provided as grooves extending in the attachment\/detachment direction.","As illustrated in , , , in a position located on the downstream side in the attachment direction Q relative to the insertion hole on the gutter , two identifying protrusions  are provided so as to protrude upward from the gutter , where the identifying protrusions  serve as identifying parts constituting the identification mechanism and are to come in contact with the identified portion  of the toner container , and the gutter  serves as the container mounting section of the container receiving section . In the present embodiment, the identifying protrusions  are provided as two protrusions. However, the widths, the heights, the positions, and the number of the identifying protrusions  are changed depending on the widths, the heights, the positions, and the number of the grooves of the identified portion  to distinguish the combinations of the toner container and the toner container holder from one another.","The identifying protrusions  are located on the downstream side in the attachment direction Q relative to front edges of guide rails and on the one end of the container receiving section  such that the identifying protrusions  can come in contact with the identified portion  after the guide rails  and  are inserted in the sliding grooves and . The arrangement of the identifying protrusions  is not limited to the example illustrated in . The identifying protrusions  may be located on the further downstream position than the position in  in the attachment direction Q or may be located on the insertion hole side. However, it is preferable to locate the identifying protrusions  such that they come in contact with the identified portion  after the guide rails  and  are inserted in the sliding grooves and ","With this configuration, when a wrong toner container is attached, the identifying protrusions  come in contact with the identified portion  of the toner container  after the guide rails  and the sliding guides  are adequately fitted to each other. Therefore, the identified portion  and the identifying protrusions  come in contact with each other after the position of the toner container  in the up-down direction (vertical direction) is determined in the attachment operation. As a result, it becomes possible to stably and more accurately bring the identified portion and the identifying protrusions into contact with each other.","The order of restriction and release of all of the positioners of the eighth embodiment with respect to the toner container holder  (the toner replenishing device ) will be explained below with reference to , , and so on.","As illustrated in , when a user places the toner container  on the gutter  of the container receiving section  of the toner container holder  and pushes the toner container  in the attachment direction Q (performs attachment operation), the toner container  slides on the gutter . Subsequently, the guide rails  and  are respectively entered into the sliding grooves of the sliding guides  of the toner container , so that the positions in the width direction W perpendicular to the attachment direction Q and in the vertical direction Z are roughly determined (the first restricted state).","When the toner container  in the first restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, and if the toner container  being attached is a wrong toner container, the identified portion  comes in contact with the identifying protrusions  as illustrated in  and . In this case, if the shapes or positions of the identified portion  and the identifying protrusions  do not match with each other, the movement of the toner container  in the attachment direction Q is prevented, so that it becomes possible to prevent attachment of a different type of the toner container . Furthermore, the first restricted state is maintained at this time; therefore, even if a different type of the toner container  is forcibly pushed, it is possible to prevent the identified portion  from passing over the identifying protrusions  because the position in the vertical direction Z is roughly determined. Therefore, it becomes possible to prevent attachment of a different type of the toner container .","If the shapes of the identified portion  and the identifying protrusions  match with each other and the identifying protrusions  allow the identified portion  to move, the toner container  is further moved in the attachment direction Q. Therefore, as illustrated in , the end surface of the container shutter and the front end of the conveying nozzle  come in contact with each other.","When the toner container  is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, a second restricted state as illustrated in  is obtained, in which the holder  located in the attachment direction Q relative to the vertical surface of the container front end cover  is entered into the guiding part  that includes the connector . At this time, because the position in the vertical direction Z is roughly determined by the sliding grooves of the sliding guides , the holder  is entered into the guiding part  while its position in the vertical direction Z is roughly determined. The entered state is illustrated in detail in  and . Therefore, the movement of the side surfaces and of the holder  in the circumferential direction R is roughly determined by inner surfaces of wall and of the guiding part .","When the toner container  in the second restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, the container seal  and the nozzle shutter flange come in contact with each other as illustrated in , and the holder  is further moved inside the guiding part  as illustrated in . This state is illustrated in . At this time, the side surfaces and of the holder  move on the flat surfaces tapered from the one ends of positioners and arranged on the inner surfaces of guiding part and toward the centers of positioners and , respectively, so that the side surfaces and move in the attachment direction Q while their movement in the radial direction R is gradually restricted.","When the toner container  is further moved in the attachment direction, as illustrated in , , and , the side surfaces and of the holder  are located between the other ends of positioners and , where the width is narrowest (a third restricted state). Specifically, in the third restricted state, the movement in the radial direction R is completely restricted by the holder  and the guiding part  while the restriction in the vertical direction Z by the sliding grooves and the guide rails  is maintained. Therefore, the container front end cover  and the setting cover  (the container cover receiving section ) are integrated, and the container front end cover  is restricted from moving in the circumferential direction R and is prevented from rotating with the rotation of the container body .","When the toner container  in the third restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, a fourth restricted state as illustrated in  is obtained, in which the container opening is entered into the inner surface of container setting section (the setting cover ) and the container body  is rotatably supported inside the inner surface of container setting section . At this time, the position of the container front end cover  in the circumferential direction R is restricted by the holder  and the guiding part , so that the container opening and the container setting section  can mate with each other such that the respective centers coincide with each other. Therefore, it becomes possible to prevent toner leakage from the container shutter  due to insertion of the container opening into the container setting section  in a deviated manner. Furthermore, in this state, each of the pads of the IC tag  comes in contact with a corresponding one of the apparatus main-body terminals of the connector , and information is read from the IC tag . Namely, when the IC tag  and the connector  come in contact with each other, the positions in the vertical direction Z and the radial direction R are determined; therefore, a contact failure is less likely to occur and communication can be performed stably.","When the toner container  in the fourth restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, a fifth restricted state as illustrated in  is obtained. In the fifth restricted state, the container opening is entered further into the inner surface of container setting section , and the replenishing device engaging members  and  are entered into and engaged with the respective engaged openings of the container engaged portions  and  (see ). Therefore, the toner container  is prevented from moving in the longitudinal direction (the rotation axis direction) and is maintained in the setting position. While the engaged openings are illustrated in , the dimensions and the configurations of the engaged openings and the engaged openings are the same with each other; therefore, the states of the engaged openings are the same as those of the engaged openings ","As described above, if the rotation of the container front end cover  is restricted by the fitting between the guiding part  housing the connector  and the holder  holding the IC tag  on the outer surface of container cover , the container opening and the container setting section  can be fitted to each other such that the respective centers coincide with each other. Therefore, it becomes possible to prevent toner leakage from the container shutter  due to insertion of the container opening into the container setting section  in a deviated manner. Furthermore, the positioning of the IC tag  is not needed and rough positioning is satisfactory.","As in the present embodiment, if the IC tag  is arranged in an approximately middle position between the pair of the container engaged portions  and  engaged with the replenishing device engaging members  and  on the outer surface of container front end cover , the following advantageous effects can be obtained. Specifically, as for the movement of the IC tag , the movement in the radial direction is acceptable but the movement in the circumferential direction R is not preferable because the circumferential movement may cause a contact failure. If the IC tag  is arranged in the approximately middle position between the pair of the replenishing device engaging members  and , a force is equally applied from the both sides in the circumferential direction R, so that the movement in the circumferential direction R can be prevented and a contact failure between the IC tag  and the connector  can be prevented, which is a preferable configuration.","Furthermore, in the present embodiment, the replenishing device engaging members  and  and the container engaged portions  and  are inclined with respect to the horizontal direction. Therefore, it becomes possible to reduce the protrusion amount of the container front end cover  in the horizontal direction from the outer surface of container cover as compared to a configuration in which the replenishing device engaging members  and  and the container engaged portions  and  are arranged in the horizontal direction. Consequently, it becomes possible to save a space of the container holding section for each of the colors. As a result, it becomes possible to effectively use the space of the printer  (the main body of the image forming apparatus), enabling to reduce the size of the image forming apparatus. Furthermore, if multiple toner containers are attached as in a color image forming apparatus, it becomes possible to reduce a mounting space in the horizontal direction, enabling to further reduce the size of the image forming apparatus.","Moreover, according to the present embodiment, the identified portion  is provided, which is provide on the lower portion of the container front end cover  in the lower portion of the toner container  and which can pass over the identifying protrusions . Furthermore, the pair of the sliding guides  and  are provided, which serve as vertical restrictors for restricting the movement of the toner container  in the vertical direction Z by receiving the pair of the guide rails  and  when the identified portion  passes through the insertion hole . Therefore, it becomes possible to reliably prevent attachment of a wrong type of the toner container .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0504","num":"0503"},"figref":["FIGS. 103A to 103F","FIGS. 103A to 103F","FIG. 103A","FIG. 103B","FIG. 103C","FIG. 103D","FIG. 103E","FIG. 103F"],"b":["2032","2700","2032","33","2034","2700"]},"In the eighth embodiment, the container body  including the spiral groove is used as the container body.

Any configurations made by combinations of arbitrary embodiments as described above fall within the scope of the present invention.","Tenth Embodiment","In a tenth embodiment, a mechanism that improves the operability for attaching and detaching the toner container  as described above to and from the toner replenishing device  will be explained.","The toner container described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2012-133349 as described above includes a rotatable cylindrical powder storage, a nozzle receiver attached to the powder storage, an opening arranged on the nozzle receiver, and an opening\/closing member that is biased to a closing position at which the opening is closed and that opens the opening along with insertion of a conveying nozzle of a powder replenishing device. When a toner container is set in a container holding section of the powder replenishing device and moved in the attachment direction, the conveying nozzle is inserted in the nozzle receiver of the toner container with the movement of the toner container, and the opening\/closing member is moved to the opening position to open the opening and discharge toner. Furthermore, the conveying nozzle of the powder replenishing device is provided with a nozzle hole, which is opened and closed by a nozzle shutter and which receives toner. The nozzle shutter is biased in a direction in which the nozzle hole is closed, and opens the nozzle hole when the conveying nozzle is inserted in the nozzle receiver of the toner container, so that the toner discharged from the toner container can be supplied into the conveying nozzle.","The powder replenishing device includes a replenishing device engaging member that maintains an attached state when the toner container is attached. By engaging the replenishing device engaging member with the toner container, the attached state of the toner container is maintained.","Japanese Patent No. 4,958,325 discloses a replenishing device engaging member that maintains an opening\/closing member for opening and closing an opening arranged in a bottom portion of the toner container when the toner container is attached to the powder replenishing device.","In the configuration described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2012-133349, when the toner container is set in the powder replenishing device, a force to bias the opening\/closing member of the toner container in the closing direction and a force to bias the nozzle shutter of the conveying nozzle in the closing direction act in a direction in which the toner container is detached from (pushed out of) the powder replenishing device. Therefore, when a user pushes the toner container in the attachment direction to attach the toner container to the powder replenishing device, he\/she attaches the toner container against the force in the detachment direction. In contrast, when the toner container is pulled out to be detached, a force in the detachment direction acts as an assist force. Therefore, a difference between the operating force for attachment and the operating force for detachment is increased, which may give the user a feeling that something is wrong in the attachment\/detachment operation. Furthermore, the force in the detachment direction acts on the toner container in the attached state. Therefore, the replenishing device engaging member that maintains the toner container in the attached state needs to have a holding force to keep holding the toner container against the force in the detachment direction, so that a force to bias and hold the replenishing device engaging member toward the toner container also increases. Therefore, when the user pulls out the toner container in the detachment direction from the attached state, he\/she pulls out the toner container against the holding force of the replenishing device engaging member, but after the toner container is pulled out, the toner container moves in the detachment direction with the aid of the force in the detachment direction. This may also give the user an uncomfortable feeling in the attachment\/detachment operation.","Therefore, in the present embodiment, it is configured such that, when the toner container is to be attached to the container holding section, a first rotational moment to rotate the replenishing device engaging member to attach the toner container is greater than a second rotational moment to rotate the replenishing device engaging member to detach the toner container. Therefore, a difference between the operating force for attachment and the operating force for detachment to attach and detach the toner container to and from the powder replenishing device can be reduced, so that the attachment\/detachment operability can be improved.","A function to maintain the toner container  in the attached state in the toner container holder  will be explained in detail below with reference to , FIG. , and . , , and  illustrate top cross-sectional views of the toner container  and the container cover receiving section  of the toner container holder  taken in the horizontal direction.  is a diagram for explaining a state in which the toner container  is being moved in the attachment direction Q.  is a diagram for explaining a state in which the toner container  has reached the container cover receiving section  and the conveying nozzle  is entered in the container body  by pushing open the container shutter  inside the receiving opening  of the toner container .  illustrates the attached state in which the left and right engaging members  have passed over the bumps and entered into the engaged openings to hold the toner container  in an attached position.","Each of the tip parts of the engaging members  on the left and right sides includes a first inclined surface that comes in contact with the container engaged portion  when the toner container  is moved in the attachment direction Q, and a second inclined surface that comes in contact with the container engaged portion  when the toner container  in the engaged state is moved in a detachment direction Q. The first inclined surface and the second inclined surface define an approximately triangular cross section in the figures, and a tip portion defined by those surfaces is referred to as a top portion P. As illustrated in , each of the engaging members  is mounted on the setting cover  so as to rotate about the shaft  extending in the direction normal to the sheet of . In each of the engaging members , the spring press part receives a biasing force of the torsion coil spring , and the rotation stopper near the spring press part is brought into contact with the setting cover notch of the setting cover . Therefore, the positions of the engaging members  in the engaging direction R are restricted such that the top portions P (see ) serving as the top portions of the approximate triangles protrude from the inner surface of setting cover so as to face each other. In the explanation below, the positions of the engaging members  in the rotation direction illustrated in  are assumed as the initial positions.","In each of the left and right container engaged portions  of the toner container , the guiding protrusion , the guiding groove , the bump , and the engaged opening are arranged, as guiding portions, in this order from the container front side as described above. Each of the bumps includes a first contact surface that is an inclined surface connected from the guiding groove , and a second contact surface that is an inclined surface connected to the engaged opening (adjacent to the engaged opening ). The first contact surfaces and the second contact surfaces define approximately triangular cross sections in the figures. Each of the bumps is provided on the container cover  such that the top portion of the approximate triangle as described above protrudes outward.","As illustrated in , a user pushes the new toner container  in the attachment direction Q to attach the toner container . Accordingly, the container front end of the container shutter  comes in contact with the front end of the conveying nozzle  (the end on the upstream side in the attachment direction Q). When the toner container  is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, the container shutter  moves to the rear side of the toner container  and the conveying nozzle  starts to be entered into the toner container . At this time, the user who is operating the toner container  gradually feels a reaction force (restoring force) against a compression force of the container shutter spring  as the conveying nozzle  is entered further into the toner container .","Incidentally, the shutter hooks of the container shutter  on the container rear end may include a step to be hooked on the outer wall surface of the shutter rear end supporting portion . In this configuration, when releasing the hooked state of the shutter hooks , the user operating the toner container  slightly feels a force (reaction force) to push the toner container  back in the opposite direction (the detachment direction Q) of the attachment direction Q before the container shutter  starts moving to the rear side of the toner container .","When the toner container  is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, the guiding protrusions of the toner container  come in contact with the first inclined surfaces of the left and right engaging members . Each of the guiding protrusions serving as guiding portions includes the guiding inclined surface  that is an inclined surface continuing from the central axis side to the outer periphery side of the container cover  (see ), and causes the left and right engaging members  to rotate about the shafts  (in the releasing direction R) so as to be pushed opened from the initial positions against the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs  when the toner container  is gradually pushed in the attachment direction Q.","At this time, the user operating the toner container  feels a reaction force (a force due to the restoring forces of the torsion coil springs ) of the force that pushes open the left and right engaging members  against the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs  that cause the left and right engaging members  to move back to the initial positions, in addition to the reaction force against the compression force of the container shutter spring . However, because the guiding protrusions include the guiding inclined surfaces  that gradually push open the engaging members , it is possible to reduce an uncomfortable operational feeling as compared to a configuration in which the guiding protrusions having the guiding inclined surfaces  are not provided.","In contrast, if the front end of the container cover  is provided as corner portions without providing the guiding inclined surfaces , the user feels, at a time, a strong reaction force in the direction Q in which the toner container  is pushed back when the engaging members  and the container cover  come in contact with each other, and may erroneously recognize that the attachment is completed because of the reaction force. Therefore, it is preferable to provide the guiding protrusions having the guiding inclined surfaces  as in the present embodiment. Incidentally, if the guiding protrusions protrude to the container front side as in the present embodiment, it becomes easy to catch the tip parts of the engaging members . However, it may be possible to provide only the guiding inclined surfaces  without protrusions toward the container front side.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0573","num":"0572"},"figref":"FIG. 116","b":["32","78","78","339","34","32","608","2","78","78","339","34","339","339","1","339","32","32","78","339","78","2","32","782","78"],"i":["f ","a","c ","b ","b ","a","a","c ","b "]},"In contrast, in the state illustrated in , the nozzle shutter flange of the nozzle shutter  arranged on the outer periphery of the conveying nozzle  comes in contact with the container front ends of the nozzle shutter positioning ribs arranged on the inner periphery of the nozzle receiver . Therefore, when the toner container  is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, the nozzle shutter  starts to be pushed in the attachment direction Q because of the contact with the nozzle shutter positioning ribs . At this time, the user operating the toner container  feels the reaction force (restoring force) against the compression force of the nozzle shutter spring , in addition to the reaction force (restoring force) against the compression force of the container shutter spring .","When the toner container  in the state illustrated in  is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, the first inclined surfaces of the tip parts of the engaging members  and the first contact surface of the bumps come in contact with each other, respectively. When the toner container  is further pushed in the attachment direction Q from the contact positions between the first inclined surfaces and the first contact surfaces , the first inclined surfaces of the left and right engaging members  are pressed by the first contact surfaces and rotated outward about the shaft  (in the releasing direction R) from the contact positions between the top portions of the tip parts and the guiding grooves in the direction perpendicular to the attachment direction Q, against the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs . At this time, the user operating the toner container  feels a reaction force (a force due to the restoring forces of the torsion coil springs ) of the force that pushes open the left and right engaging members  outward from the contact positions between the top portions of the tip parts and the guiding grooves against the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs  that closes the left and right engaging members  toward the initial positions, in addition to the reaction force against the compression force of the container shutter spring  and the reaction force against the compression force of the nozzle shutter spring .","When the toner container  is further pushed in the attachment direction Q, the reaction force against the force that pushes open the left and right engaging members  outward becomes maximum at a position at which the top portions of the approximate triangles of the bumps come in contact with the top portions P of the approximate triangles of the tip parts (the opposed position).","When the toner container  is further pushed in the attachment direction Q and passes through the above-described position, the first inclined surfaces of the tip parts and the first contact surfaces of the bumps are separated from each other, so that the force that pushes open the left and right engaging members  outward stops acting on the engaging members , and the engaging members  rotate about the shafts  (in the engaging direction R) due to the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs  (a restoring force against compression). At this time, because the engaged openings are provided on the outer surface of the container cover  so as to be located on the trajectories of the movement of the top portions P of the approximately triangular tip parts around the shaft , the top portions P of the approximately triangular tip parts of the engaging members  are entered into the engaged openings and the engaging members  are moved back to the initial positions as illustrated in , so that the toner container  is completely attached to the toner container holder .","The user operating the toner container  feels that the reaction force does not act immediately after the reaction force against the force that pushes open the left and right engaging members  outward becomes maximum, so that he\/she can recognize that the attachment of the toner container  to the toner container holder  is completed. Meanwhile, a feeling that the user feels from when the top portions P of the tip parts pass over the bumps of the container engaged portions  and reach the engaged openings is a so-called click feeling.","In the attached state of the toner container  as illustrated in , the reaction force (restoring force) against the compression force of the container shutter spring  and the reaction force (restoring force) against the compression force of the nozzle shutter spring  are applied to the toner container . However, the engaged openings of the container engaged portions  of the container cover  are engaged with the engaging members , and the engaging members  receive a resultant force of the reaction forces as described above (hereinafter, the resultant force is referred to as a \u201crestoring spring force\u201d), so that the toner container  is held in the toner container holder . Specifically, as illustrated in , the second inclined surfaces of the tip part of the engaging members  come in contact with the second contact surfaces of the bumps connected to the front ends of the engaged openings of the container engaged portions , and therefore, the reaction force against the compression force of the container shutter spring  and the reaction force against the compression force of the nozzle shutter spring  are applied. However, the engaging members  can be maintained in the initial positions because of the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs , so that the toner container  can be maintained in the attached state.","Next, a case will be explained below, in which the user detaches the toner container  in the detachment direction Q from the attached state illustrated in  to replace the toner container . When the user pulls the toner container maintained in the attached state as illustrated in  by gripping the gripper  (see ), a force to pull out the toner container  is applied to the toner container  by the user, in addition to the reaction force against the compression force of the container shutter spring  and the reaction force against the compression force of the nozzle shutter spring  as described above. At this time, the second inclined surfaces of the engaging members  receive these forces via the second contact surfaces of the toner container . When the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs  applied to the engaging members  are greater than the above-described forces, the toner container  can be maintained in the attached state. In contrast, when the user increases the pulling force and the above-described forces become greater than the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs , the engaging members  are rotated about the shaft  in the opening direction (the releasing direction R).","When the user further pulls the toner container  in the detachment direction Q, he\/she needs to apply the greatest puling force immediately before the top portions of the approximately triangular bumps reach the positions facing the top portions P of the tip parts . At the positions at which the top portions of the approximately triangular bumps face the top portions P of the tip parts , the reaction force against the force the pushes open the left and right engaging members  outward becomes maximum. When the toner container  passes through this position, the second inclined surfaces of the tip parts and the second contact surfaces of the bumps are separated from each other, so that the force that pushes open the left and right engaging members  does not act on the engaging members , and the engaging members  rotate about the shafts  (in the engaging direction R) due to the biasing forces of the torsion coil spring  (a restoring force against compression). Subsequently, the tip parts of the engaging members  come in contact with the guiding grooves of the container cover . At this time, the reaction force against the compression force of the container shutter spring  and the reaction force against the compression force of the nozzle shutter spring  act in the same direction so as to accelerate the movement of the toner container  in the detachment direction Q. With the assist by these forces, the user can detach the toner container  from the toner container holder  and take the toner container  from the front side of the copier  (the front side in the direction normal to the sheet of ).","As described above, when the toner container  is in the attached state, the reaction force (restoring force) against the compression force of the container shutter spring  and the reaction force (restoring force) against the compression force of the nozzle shutter spring  act on the toner container  in the detachment direction Q opposite to the attachment direction Q. Therefore, the spring pressure (pressure (load) by the spring) of the torsion coil springs  that bias the engaging members  to the initial positions is set to be greater than the reaction forces so as to be able to hold the toner container.","Therefore, when the toner container  is pushed in the attachment direction Q from the state illustrated in  to the attached state illustrated in  to attach the toner container , the restoring forces of the two springs such as the container shutter spring  and the nozzle shutter spring  and the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs  that bias the engaging members  to the initial positions act in the detachment direction Q opposite to the attachment direction Q that is the moving direction of the toner container . Therefore, the user pushes the toner container  in the attachment direction Q against the above forces.","In contrast, when the toner container  is pulled in the detachment direction Q, while the toner container  is pulled against the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs  that bias the engaging members  to the initial positions similarly to the attachment operation, the restoring forces of the two springs such as the container shutter spring  and the nozzle shutter spring  act as an assist force in the detachment direction Q that is the moving direction of the toner container .","Therefore, a difference between the operating force to attach the toner container  to the toner container holder  and the operating force to detach the toner container  from the toner container holder  is increased, and this may give the user an uncomfortable feeling in the attachment\/detachment operation.","Therefore, in the present embodiment, the shapes of the engaging members  and the shapes of the container engaged portions  are conceived so that a difference between the user's operating force for attachment and the user's operating force for detachment can be reduced. Specifically, the engaging members  and the container engaged portions  are configured such that the first rotational moment to rotate the engaging members  in the releasing direction R due to a force in the attachment direction Q applied by the user to attach the toner container  becomes greater than the second rotational moment to rotate the engaging members  in the releasing direction R due to a force in the detachment direction Q applied by the user to detach the toner container .","With this configuration, it becomes possible to more easily rotate the engaging members  when the toner container  is attached as compared when the toner container  is detached. Furthermore, the rotation of the engaging members  becomes heavier when the toner container  is detached as compared when the toner container  is attached.","Therefore, when the user attaches the toner container , he\/she applies a force against the restoring forces of the two springs such as the container shutter spring  and the nozzle shutter spring  in the detachment direction Q to move the toner container  toward the toner container holder , but receives less forces from the engaging members  that act due to the attachment. In contrast, when the user pulls the toner container , the restoring forces of the two springs such as the container shutter spring  and the nozzle shutter spring  in the detachment direction Q act as an assist force, but the forces received from the engaging members  that act due to the detachment are increased relative to the forces received during the attachment of the toner container .","As described above, it becomes possible to reduce a difference in the user's operating force between attachment and detachment of the toner container  to and from the toner container holder  of the toner replenishing device . Therefore, it becomes possible to improve the attachment\/detachment operability.","A relationship between forces applied to the engaging members  will be explained below with reference to  to .  illustrates a state in which the guiding protrusion comes in contact with the engaging member  due to the pushing in the attachment direction Q.  illustrates a state immediately before the attached state is obtained due to the pushing in the attachment direction Q.

The normal force Sacts as the rotational moment in the releasing direction R.","In this case, the normal force Scan be represented as a component of the setting force S in the direction perpendicular to the tangent at the contact point between the top portion P of the tip part and the guiding inclined surface .
