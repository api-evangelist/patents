{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was made with U.S. Government support under Government Contract No.: N66001-04-C-8032, awarded by the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates generally to field programmable circuits as related to three-dimensional integration and, more particularly, to a programmable via structure suitable for use in three-dimensional integration technology.","Traditionally, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) devices have been used in the integrated circuit (IC) industry to reduce cost, enhance performance or meet space constraints. The generic class of ASIC devices falls under a variety of sub classes such as custom ASICs, standard cell ASICs, Gate Array, and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), wherein the degree of user allowed customization varies.","In recent years, there has been a move away from custom, semi-custom and Gate Array ICs toward field programmable components whose function is determined not when the integrated circuit is fabricated, but by an end user \u201cin the field\u201d prior to use. Off the shelf FPGA products greatly simplify the design cycle and are fully customized by the user. These products offer user-friendly software to fit custom logic into the device through programmability, and the capability to tweak and optimize designs to improve silicon performance. While such programmability is expensive in terms of silicon real estate, it reduces design cycle time, time to solution (TTS) and upfront non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs to the designer.","Reconfigurable circuits, such as FPGAs, are also anticipated to play a significant role in the new Three Dimensional Integration (3DI) technology currently under development. In planar circuit technologies (i.e., the individual circuit elements are formed on a single, planar substrate), an FPGA  (as shown in ) is characterized by a set of simple, configurable logic blocks  arranged in an array with interspersed switches  that can rearrange the interconnections between the logic blocks .","In contrast, 3DI structures (such as shown in ) consist of multiple semiconductor layers (DL, DL, etc.) that are interconnected in a vertical direction. In a multilayer logic network, this three-dimensionality may be exploited to increase density without reducing feature size, and reduce the line of flight interconnect path between logic elements. Optimal communication efficiency can thus be achieved in this context by introducing reconfigurable interconnects. Reconfigurable interconnects also offer the possibility for multi-use chips, thereby enabling compatibility with different communication protocols. Moreover, technologically disparate multilayer structures can form unique, single-chip combinations such as (logic+memory), (logic+optical communications) and (logic+sensors), for example. In these types of multicomponent\/multilayer systems, reconfigurable connections are therefore needed to provide the controllable logic functionality, memory element repair and data encryption, etc.","Existing field-programmable logic and memory repair technology utilizes several methods to physically make\/break the connections between logic blocks; unfortunately, none of these existing methods provides a fully adequate solution to the requirements of a 3DI application. For instance, a laser-fusible link is an early approach, but has now replaced by electrical techniques entirely internal to the chip. Electromigration fuses, such as those in IBM's eFUSE technology for rerouting chip logic, are also currently in use. However, an electromigration fuse takes up a large circuit area and requires a high current to blow the fuse. Moreover, the process is \u201cone-shot,\u201d i.e., once the fuse is blown, it cannot thereafter be returned to a conducting state. Further, the distribution of eFuse characteristics is relatively broad, requiring that the state of each fuse be sensed by a discriminating circuit with the digital result stored in a latch.","Another existing approach for FPGA is the use of flash bits to control a pass transistor for each interconnection. A flash bit takes up space in the logic level, is formed by a process that is incompatible with standard CMOS processing, and requires a special high voltage to charge the gate oxide. As compared to a laser-blown fuse or an eFuse, the flash approach is considered limited multi-shot technique (e.g., about 20,000 reversals).","An anti-fuse approach used for some DRAM repair typically involves a very thin dielectric material such as silicon dioxide, or the sandwich combination silicon oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO), between two conductors. The anti-fuse is programmed by applying a relatively high voltage through the conducting terminals, thus causing dielectric breakdown in the dielectric. As a result, the resistance of the anti-fuse permanently changes from high to low. Accordingly, this represents another example of a one-shot technique, one that requires a high voltage.","The controllable link technologies described above do not have optimal properties for programmable logic applications in 3DI (or even for planar applications for that matter). In particular, a dependency on the use of high voltages (whether for gate charging in flash bit applications or for dielectric antifuses) is undesirable. In the case of flash bits, their presence in the logic level real estate may cause process incompatibilities, as described above. Electromigration fuses driven by relatively high current are large-area, require undesirably high power, and require an additional discriminator and latch circuitry. Furthermore, devices incorporating static RAM latches are subject to soft error arising from alpha particles or cosmic rays, which in a 3DI application may also have the effect of randomly altering the logic configuration. With the exception of flash bit technology (which has limited multi-shot capability), conventional fuse-based approaches are one-shot.","Accordingly, it would therefore be desirable to be able to configure a programmable link for a 3DI application that does not require high current or voltage to program, that is compatible with standard CMOS processing at the device level, that avoids the need for an SRAM latch to minimize space and avoid soft errors, and that is reprogrammable for a significant number of multiple instances (i.e., not single-shot).","The foregoing discussed drawbacks and deficiencies of the prior art are overcome or alleviated by a programmable link structure for use in three dimensional integration (3DI) semiconductor devices. In an exemplary embodiment, the structure includes a via filled at least in part with a phase change material (PCM) and a heating device proximate the PCM. The heating device is configured to switch the conductivity of a transformable portion of the PCM between a lower resistance crystalline state and a higher resistance amorphous state. Thereby, the via defines a programmable link between an input connection located at one end thereof and an output connection located at another end thereof.","In another embodiment, a method for programming a programmable link structure of a three dimensional integration (3DI) semiconductor devices includes passing a current through a heating device, the heating device proximate a via filled at least in part with a phase change material (PCM), the via thereby defining a programmable link between an input connection located at one end thereof and an output connection located at another end thereof. The heating device is configured to switch the conductivity of a transformable portion of said PCM between a lower resistance crystalline state and a higher resistance amorphous state.","Disclosed herein is a programmable via structure suitable for use in 3DI technology. Briefly stated, a phase change material (PCM) is incorporated into a programmable via structure wherein the conductivity of the via is altered by a thermal SET or RESET process that changes the crystal properties of the PCM, and therefore the conductivity of the same. Thus configured, the PCM-based programmable vias provide such desirable advantages as, for example: spatial compactness, the elimination of a need for latches, multiple-shot reprogrammability, immunity from soft errors, and the elimination of the need for high voltage\/current\/power switching capability. Such advantages in turn provide improved function and lower costs in 3D applications. As will be further appreciated, the advantages of PCM programmable vias are not necessarily limited to 3DI structures, but rather the PCM programmable links may also be used in planar silicon environments so as to provide an alternative to FPGA.","As described in further detail, a PCM programmable via is formed within the metal layers of a semiconductor device, and may have a standard via cross section for the particular node (e.g., about 0.2 \u03bcm\u00d70.2 \u03bcm). The PCM via material may be switched between resistive and conductive states by using an external heating element operated in a programmed heat cycle. The power requirement for switching of the PCM from a non-conductive, amorphous state to a conductive, crystalline state (and vice versa) is within available line voltage supplies. In addition, because the \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d impedances are suitable for direct interfacing with logic inputs, no latch devices are required. Furthermore, the PCM via structure may be reprogrammed a very large number of times (e.g., PCM memory elements test up to on the order of about 10cycles).","In one embodiment, the phase change material (PCM) is a ternary alloy of germanium (Ge), antimony (Sb) and tellurium (Te) (hereinafter referred to as \u201cGST\u201d), with an exemplary composition of GeSbTe; however, other compositions such as GeSb, (including substitution\/addition of other elements) are also possible for the PCM.

Thus, in the crystalline phase, the state of a PCM link is \u201con,\u201d while in the amorphous phase the state is \u201coff.\u201d The phases are switched from one to another by one of two thermal cycling operations as illustrated in . More specifically, the thermal cycling includes a \u201cRESET\u201d pulse for converting the PCM from crystalline to amorphous form, and a \u201cSET\u201d pulse for converting the PCM from amorphous to crystalline form. During the RESET pulse, the temperature of the PCM is raised above its melting temperature (T), followed by a rapid quench over a short time t. As a result of the rapid quench, the disordered arrangement of atoms of the PCM due to the melt is retained. Thus, the PCM is left in an amorphous, high resistive state after the RESET pulse. During the SET pulse, the PCM is annealed at a lower temperature with respect to the melting temperature, and for a longer time twith respect to t. This process enables the amorphous form to crystallize into a lower resistive state.","As also indicated above, the ternary GST alloy is nitrogen doped in order to raise the crystallization temperature thereof, so that the material remains bistable at an operating temperature of approximately 85-95\u00b0 C. In other words, it is undesirable for the GST alloy to be susceptible to phase change once programmed, where the circuit is operating at temperatures normally designed for.  is a graph illustrating the resistivity of the various states (amorphous, amorphous-rocksalt, hex crystalline) of GeSbTe, as a function of nitrogen doping. As GeSbalso has a more elevated crystallization temperature than undoped GeSbTe, this PCM material need not be doped.","Referring generally now to , several possible embodiments of a programmable via structure (incorporating a PCM) are illustrated. As indicated above, the vias therein may have the standard cross section \u03b1\u00d7\u03b1at a particular node (e.g., \u03b1=0.2 \u03bcm) or lower, and may be comprised wholly or partly of phase change material (PCM). A heater used to implement the SET and RESET operations includes a thin layer (e.g., thickness on the order of about t=20 nm) of a refractory material such as TaSiN, which has a relatively high resistivity (on the order of about \u03c1=400 \u03bc\u03a9cm, depending on composition), and a relatively low thermal conductivity (on the order of about 0.01-0.02 J\/(K\u00b7cm\u00b7sec)). Heating is accomplished by passing a pulse of current through the heater in the horizontal plane. During RESET (quench from melt), a thin region of the PCM adjacent to the heater surface is melted and transformed to the amorphous phase. This thin region corresponds to the transformable part of the via material.","As particularly shown in ) and (), a first embodiment of a programmable via structure  includes a heater  deposited as a film (e.g., TaSiN) on an insulator material (such as SiOfor example). The heater material preferably has a thermal conductivity on the order of about 0.01-0.02 J\/(K\u00b7cm\u00b7sec) or lower, and forms a planar interface with the bottom of a PCM via . In this geometry, the transformable part  of the via  material forms a very thin layer (e.g., having thickness on the order of about t=4 nm, or larger) adjacent to the heater surface. When the via  is in the \u201coff\u201d state, the resistance of the thin layer  constitutes the \u201coff\u201d resistance of the via. When the via  is in the \u201con\u201d state, the whole length of the via  plus a part of the heater  forms the \u201con\u201d resistance. These resistances are key to the via function, and are estimated below.","In the first embodiment of ) and (), the heater power supply current path is through metal contacts  disposed on opposite sides of the heater  with respect to the PCM interface. Such a design permits a TaSiN lead length (external to the PCM material) of one half the via width. As also shown in the embodiment of ) and (), the programmable via structure provides a programmable link between an input connection (IP) located at an upper metal level (M) and an output connection (OP) located at a lower metal level (M), thus enabling a programmable configuration between distinct semiconductor layers in a 3D structure. In this instance, the heater contacts  are disposed at an intermediate metal level (M) between M and M. A conventional via  (e.g., filled with tungsten) is used to connect M to M.","In most cases (except for a later embodiment presented hereinafter; , and a variant of ) the heater circuit is assumed to be isolated and floating when the heater is not operative. Its effect on the via  during logic operation is thus a small parasitic capacitance. As illustrated in a later embodiment, if it becomes desirable to electrically insulate the heater  from the via , a very thin intervening oxide layer may be included therebetween (e.g., having a thickness on the order of about 5 nm).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["600","600","602","604","2","606","604","604","602","608"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 7(","FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 7(","FIG. 7("],"i":["a","b","a"],"b":["700","702","704","706","704","702","704","2","0","1","708","710"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIGS. 6 and 7","FIG. 6","FIG. 7","FIG. 6"],"b":["800","804","1","1","802","804"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIGS. 9(","FIG. 9"],"i":["a","b"],"b":["9","900","906","904","902","908","902","900"],"sub":["x","1-x","4 "],"sup":"\u22124 "},"The insulating layer  on top of the transformable section of PCM  and between the input and output contacts is selected so as to have a low thermal conductivity (e.g., 0.002-0.007 J\/(K\u00b7cm\u00b7sec)) for satisfactory operation.

In this example, the PCM elements  in lines A and B are in the amorphous, high resistance configuration, while the PCM element  in line C is in the crystalline, low resistance state. The inverter  in line C drives the output inverter  at line D through the \u201con\u201d PCM link, which must have a low enough resistance to support a correct logic state and timing. The PCM \u201con\u201d link resistances in Table I are on the order of about 1 K\u03a9, as is required to satisfy this condition in CMOS logic. However, in a performance-related path, where the PCM via \u201con\u201d resistance is such as to degrade performance, a buffer (not shown) may be inserted.","In evaluating the \u201coff\u201d link resistance, it is assumed that inverter outputs A and B are logically low, and that inverter output C is high. In this case, inverter  is (through line D) driving two \u201coff\u201d PCM vias in parallel. This should be a light load in order to maintain CMOS functionality. It is also desirable for this path to draw as small a parasitic current as possible. The relatively high \u201coff\u201d resistances indicated in Table I should ensure these conditions adequately. Thus, the programmable via designs along with the chosen materials should be embeddable in CMOS logic without requiring additional latches. Timing studies may be performed in order to take into account the parasitic capacitance of the heater circuits, except for the embodiment of , where the capacitance of the thin oxide layer is relevant.","Processing Operations","Referring once again to the programmable via structures of , exemplary processing operations for forming the same are now discussed. Generally, each begins with a substrate material, such as silicon. A thermally and electrically insulating layer such as SiO, for example, (about 200 nm in thickness) is then deposited. The thermal conductivity of the insulating layer is preferably in the range of about 0.01-0.02 J\/(K\u00b7cm\u00b7sec) or less, and the material should be temperature-stable in the device operating range.","In the embodiment of , the bottom contact layer M (e.g., W or Cu) is deposited on top of a thermally and electrically insulating layer (e.g., SiO). After patterning the M layer, an oxide is deposited. The SiOis patterned to align via V (e.g., about 0.2\u00d70.2 \u03bcm) with the M level, which again represents the metallization level for the heater. The contact vias at M may be filled with a suitable metal such a tungsten, for example. Following a suitable planarizing step, a refractory metal (H) layer (e.g., about 20 nm in thickness) is deposited. This refractory metal layer (e.g., TaSiN, NiCr, or doped CrO) is then patterned as an external heater. Another planarization (CMP) step may be utilized to insure a \u201cflat\u201d interface between the subsequently formed PCM and the heater layer H. The heater formation is followed by a deposition of SiOwhich is patterned to make a via (e.g., about 0.2\u00d70.2 \u03bcm) to be filled with PCM (including suitable adhesion and capping layers at the opposite ends of the PCM plug, such as Ti\/TiN). The top metallization layer M is then deposited and patterned to make contacts to the filled vias. In this structure, the V contact vias are configured to connect to the bottom logic layer in the 3DI scheme.","In the embodiment of , the metallization level M is deposited directly on top of SiO(without first building the M and V levels). This is followed by formation of the heater H level, where the interface for the next step should be planar. The oxide is then deposited and patterned with vias to be filled with PCM (with capping layers), and thereafter the operations are repeated to create conventional metallic vias, with both types of vias contacting the M level. The embodiments in  are configured to minimize the length of the heater leads so as to optimize power requirements. It will be noted that the specific details of the heater driving circuits are omitted for purposes of simplicity.","In the embodiment of , the process flow is substantially the same as for . However, one difference is that the V via of  is filled with PCM, including the appropriate capping layers. PCM via V, which is built after the planarization step following the deposition of the H heater layer, is connected to the V via underneath the heater. At this point, a CMP step is used to control the \u201cflatness\u201d of the interface between PCM and the next layer H, and thus to control morphology of the melt front. This process will result in a symmetrical PCM via structure, interrupted by a heater in the middle thereof. After filling the V via with PCM and suitable top capping layers, contact is made to the M contact level.","In the embodiment of , the process flow is substantially the same as that for , except that both vias atop the heater level are PCM-filled. The processing for the embodiment shown in  is somewhat similar to that of , although a thin insulating layer (O) may additionally be needed to electrically separate the H heater layer from the PCM (to ensure a desired ON\/OFF ratio). The distinguishing feature of the  embodiment is the thin (e.g., about 5 nm) PCM layer that forms a fully transformable PCM element bridging two crystalline PCM vias. This thin layer is first blanket deposited and patterned over a larger area encompassing the two vias in the programmable structure. A SiOlayer is then deposited and patterned with vias to be filled with PCM as described previously.","In the embodiment of , there are alternating PCM and heater material levels (PCM\/H\/PCM) as is shown in . In this instance, however, following the M level formation, the subsequent level formation is as follows: M, SiO, heater H, and SiO. Then, the vias are formed by pattering and etching the entire SiO\/H\/SiOstack, followed by filling with the PCM. The top metallization (M) level (e.g., using tungsten) will follow, as described above. In this structure, an insulating lining on the vias may be desirable to electrically isolate the heater from the PCM as stated above.","Alternatively, tungsten only may be used in the contact vias, and the metal lines are fabricated by damascene processing, using copper. For example, the process flow for the embodiment of  would involve first oxide deposition, patterning and RIE of the M layer, M plating and CMP, followed by defining the H layer, then another oxide deposition, deep multi-level RIE, PCM fill, and CMP.","Power Requirements","In the embodiments of , the primary heat propagation direction is normal to the film plane along the direction z.

The PCM outer dimensions are 100\u00d7100\u00d7131.25 nm, while the outer dimensions of the oxide shell are 200\u00d7200\u00d7231.25 nm. Smaller samples were also simulated; they show the same behavior but have shorter timescales for all the phase changes.","The temperature structure inside the model is much smoother than the melt structure, which has sharp fronts separating the different phases. To resolve fwithout doing unnecessary calculations for \u03c6, the simulation uses a fine grid for fand a coarse grid for \u03c6. For temperature, the simulations in the ring case use a grid measuring 32\u00d732\u00d737 cells with PCM in the central 16\u00d716\u00d721 cells. The heater measures 32\u00d732\u00d73 cells with the central 16\u00d716\u00d73 cut out and filled with PCM connected to the rest of the PCM. In the slab case, the heater bifurcates the PCM by occupying the horizontal midplane in 32\u00d732\u00d73 cells. In all cases, the PCM has a grid for melt fraction, f, which is 4 times finer than the temperature grid.","The heating function H is taken to be a constant for three intervals of time. During the melting phase, H is large enough to make the peak temperature in the heating zone increase to about \u03c6=1.5. In the quench phase, H=0, so the material returns to room temperature. In the anneal phase, H comes back on for 200 ns but with a value slightly smaller than in the melt phase, now making the peak \u03c6 equilibrate to around 0.98.","The simulations indicate that the PCM in our configurations develop melted holes in the center during the SET phase, thereby changing the electrical conductivity from top to bottom as required by the device. The PCM is quenched when the heating rate is dropped suddenly, and it anneals when the temperature is raised to just below the melting temperature.","The power required to melt the PCM in the ring simulation was 2.8 mW for a heater measuring 0.2\u00d70.2\u00d70.01875 cubic microns; the power for the slab simulation was slightly less, 1.9 mW, for the same dimensions. The slab required less power than the ring because the slab has a greater area in contact with the PCM.","Finally, the considerations for selection of an appropriate PCM are summarized below. As was alluded to previously, suitable PCM materials include not only Ge, Sb, and Te, but also other elements such as Ag, In, Sn, for example, as well as dopants such as N. Generally speaking, desirable PCM properties include archival stability at about 85\u00b0-95\u00b0 C., which tends to improve with Ge content. In addition, crystallization front speed may be on the order of about V<45 m\/s (with maximum recrystallization velocity on the order of about <1.1 m\/s acceptable), which correlates with low Sb content. The nucleation rate of the PCM should be low enough to avoid nucleation during quench (i.e., at high temperature), although the specific mechanism of recrystallization is of no particular concern for application (in contrast to a compact disk read\/write (CDRW) application).","As indicated above, the \u201con\u201d\/\u201coff\u201d ratio is preferably high, while the \u201con\u201d resistance (depending upon the particular structural embodiment) preferably utilizes a high conductance material such as GeSb(e.g., ). For other designs, however, the \u201coff\u201d resistance requirements dictates the use of a lower conductance material.","While the invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment or embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof.
