title: Dynamically generated schema representing multiple hierarchies of inter-object relationships
abstract: Systems and methods for dynamically generating a schema representing multiple hierarchies of inter-object relationships are described. In one aspect, a polyarchical query language data structure includes first, second, and third data fields. The first data field is used to specify a particular schema for presenting or managing a plurality of objects in a data polyarchy based on values of attributes in the objects. The second data field is to indicate an attribute of interest. The third data field indicates how one or more objects that include the attribute of interest are to be presented or managed with respect to one or more participating dimensions of inter-object relationships based on the schema.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation under 37 CFR 1.53(b) of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/995,415, titled \u201cA Dynamically Generated Schema Representing Multiple Hierarchies of Inter-Object Relationships\u201d, filed on Nov. 26, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,944,626 and hereby incorporated by reference.","The following subject matter relates to object-to-object or \u201cinter-object\u201drelationships. More particularly, the subject matter pertains to interfacing with dynamically generated multiple hierarchies of inter-object relationships based on the values of attributes of the objects.","Any object can be linked, correlated, associated, differentiated, or in some manner categorized with respect to a different object to form implicit or explicit inter-object relationships. For instance, in an organization, a person typically has implicit and explicit relationships with other people in the organization, organizational resources (e.g., printers, facilities, etc.), geographical locations, business units, club memberships, and so on. Each implicit and\/or explicit relationship between respective objects (i.e., the person, the other people, a resource, etc.) represents a respective hierarchical data relationship.","For example, one hierarchical data relationship is represented by each person within the company that has access to a specific resource (e.g., a building on the company campus, a room, a printer, etc); the resource being the root node of the hierarchy and the individuals with access to the resource being the leaves. Another hierarchical data relationship is represented by individuals that make up the management structure of the company. Other inter-object data relationships may represent a hierarchy of individuals within a particular business unit, all employees of the company that have specialized training, and so on.","Unfortunately, even though a data store can be configured to some extent by a network administrator to represent inter-object relationships within hierarchies of other data, complex inter-object relationships (e.g., such as those representing a single object within more than one hierarchy) are not simply and adequately represented using conventional data store (e.g., directory, database, etc.) systems and technologies. (Traditional directories include those based on the well-known X.500 standard and the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).","To illustrate this limitation of traditional data store systems and technologies, consider that a directory typically represents inter-object relationships using rigid data naming and inflexible directory schemas. Objects or nodes in the directory are organized within a single hierarchy with a root node at the top of the hierarchy. The root node has a name. Each other node in the directory is named based on its direct naming relationship to the root node and also with respect to each intervening node in the respective node's hierarchy. As a result, if a parent object is renamed in a single operation, any objects that are subordinate or children of the parent object are also renamed in that same single operation. This is because an object's full \u201cdistinguished name\u201d includes the name of each parent object(s) all the way down the line to the root node's name.","It is the full distinguished name of an object that also represents its static location or data relationship with respect to each other object in the data store. Thus, an object's distinguished name inflexibly inter-tangles object naming within a single hierarchy with inter-object relationships in that hierarchy. Because of this, any navigation of the data store must be performed from top-to-bottom to determine and subsequently present any inter-object relationships\u2014that is from the root object, to a parent object to any subordinate child object(s).","Because traditional data stores (e.g., directories, databases, and so on) rely on a carefully specified and inflexible object naming scheme to identify inter-object relationships, an administrator configuring the data store requires a-priori knowledge of the inter-object relationships when configuring the data store. Additionally, any configuration of the data store must consider not only the proper representation of inter-object relationships in the data store, but must also consider the heuristics that a search engine requires to navigate the data store.","To make matters worse, elastic data relationships are not easily described, represented, or navigated using conventional data store systems and techniques. An elastic data relationship is one wherein the relationship is derived from data that defines an object at any point in time. This means that over time elastic data relationships can be dynamic. For instance, consider the following non-obvious and potentially elastic data relationships: a Web site and the Web pages that make up the Web site, a customer and the individuated services that the customer purchases from a merchant, a personal computer (PC) and peripheral devices that are coupled to the PC, a city and the districts within the city, a business and the business' contacts, an employee and the employee's dependents, and the like.","These non-obvious and potentially elastic data relationships are not easily represented because whenever a one-to-one correspondence between a surface object and corresponding sub-objects needs to be represented in the data store, an irreversible design choice must be made. (Conventional practice is to strictly control directory schema updates due to the serious nature of directory schema modification). A network administrator can opt for \u201ctotal incorporation\u201d of the sub-objects into the particular object by representing the sub-objects as attributes of the surface object in the directory schema. Or the network administrator can opt for \u201ctotal distinction\u201d of each object, by creating separate objects in the schema for sub-object components, and positioning the separate objects subordinate to the surface object.","To illustrate this irreversible design choice, consider that a particular network router includes multiple router modules plugged into the router's backplane. Information about the router and the router modules are typically stored in a directory in one or two different fashions\u2014each of which may be equally unsatisfactory depending on how entities and their respective relationships to other entities are represented. One design choice is to characterize a router and its corresponding router modules as a single hierarchical data structure representing the network router as a parent object, and the corresponding router modules as child objects that are subordinate to the parent object. A different design choice is to characterize the router and the router's associated router modules as a single parent object with complex attributes. The parent object represents the router (backplane), and the complex attributes representing the respective router modules that are hosted by the router.","In consideration of the first design choice, depending how the router and the modules are configured, collapsing information about the router modules, or boards onto the backplane may prove unwieldy. This is because the functionality of the router's backplane may be small as compared to the functionality of the network router modules hosted by the router. Whereas considering the second design choice, completely separating the boards from the backplane may be equally unsatisfactory because the router is still a single physical router box that generally includes a number of router modules.","Both of the described solutions to representing data relationships with an inflexible directory schema are time consuming to implement and counter-intuitive. The semantics of shape and naming in the directory must be agreed on in advance to solve the simplest design problem. Thus, whenever a one-to-one correspondence between an entity and corresponding sub-entities needs to be represented in a traditional directory, an irreversible and inflexible design choice must be made within the directory schema.","Whichever design choice is selected, the data store and tools used to navigate, search and present objects within the data store with respect to inter-object relationships have been substantially limited. This is because the data store itself can not represent all of the possible implicit and explicit inter-object relationships of an object. This is considered by many computer programmers to be one of the most intractable problems of directory schema in traditional directories. This is also deemed to be the reason that computer program applications are not typically portable across directory platforms or even directory instances.","To further worsen matters, recent developments in information technology provide network administrators with opportunities to tie disparate data stores (e.g., databases, directories, and so on) of data together into a single logical directory or \u201cmetadirectory\u201d. Such disparate databases and directories include, for example, information corresponding to enterprise users, tangible and intangible resources, financial information, corporate e-mail systems, network operating systems, and so on.","Metadirectories present network administrators with complex and often elastic object data relationships that cannot be simply or adequately described, represented, navigated, or presented using traditional systems and procedures to configure and manage data stores. Considerable efforts are required on the part of the administrator (or a staff of administrators) to configure a data store. Manually determining and implementing such inter-object relationships (whether they be dynamic or not) is fraught with the potential for human error and oversight. Furthermore, database administrators with an appropriate level of such knowledge to perform such a directory configuration are expensive.","The following described subject matter addresses these and other problems of representing inter-object relationships.","Systems and methods for dynamically generating a schema representing multiple hierarchies of inter-object relationships are described. In one aspect, a polyarchical query language data structure includes first, second, and third data fields. The first data field is to specify a particular schema for presenting or managing a plurality of objects in a data polyarchy based on values of attributes in the objects. The second data field is to indicate an attribute of interest. The third data field is to identify how one or more objects that include the attribute of interest are to be presented or managed with respect to one or more participating dimensions of inter-object relationships based on the schema.","Overview","The following subject matter replaces traditional notions of complex real-world object presentation within a single static hierarchy, wherein directory object naming and inter-object relationships are inter-tangled and unwieldy for representing complex data relationships. More specifically, traditional notions of distinguished names for representing inter-object relationships within a single directory of static inter-object relationships are replaced with graphs of elastic (non-static) inter-object connections in multiple dimensions of data relationships (e.g., mono and\/or bi-directional relationships) based on attributes of the objects. In other words, the data relationships establish that one or more data objects participate in one or more respective dimensions, or polyarchies of inter-object relationships. One or more of these hierarchies can intersect creating intersecting hierarchies of inter-object relationships.","Dynamically generated multiple hierarchies of data relationships based on object attributes are represented in a data polyarchy. Specifically, the data polyarchy is generated using each object's respective data attributes or data values and multifarious interrelationships of those values with attributes that correspond to other objects in the polyarchical data set. The inter-object relationships in the data polyarchy can be elastic because inter-object relationships are derived from data defined by an object at any point in time. Patterns of relationships between objects emerge by presenting an object in one or more \u201cdimensions\u201d or polyarchies of data relationships. Such relationships are presented using inter-object connections between virtual entities representing the objects. A virtual entity corresponds to an object of interest and includes and organizes information about an object of interest\u2014including information about how to get more information about the object of interest. Such objects can be presented to people or computer programs that embody that interest.","In contrast to traditional systems and procedures to represent inter-object relationships in a data store, the following described arrangements and procedures are dynamic, in that they are automated and do not require any manual intervention from a network administrator to configure inter-object relationships. By dynamically generating a data polyarchy complex inter-object relationships based on object data are automatically determined without presenting any inflexible design choice to a schema designer.","This means that the network administrator or computer program (e.g., a search engine) is not required to have any a-priori knowledge of complex inter-object relationships to generate, navigate, or search a data store. This also means that each object in a data store can be viewed from as many different dimensional inter-object hierarchies as apply to the respective object. Furthermore, as an object's elastic data relationships change, the data polyarchy automatically detects and reflects those changes.","The following description sets forth arrangements and procedures based on a directory schema for representing polyarchies of inter-object relationships that incorporates elements recited in the appended claims. The subject matter is described with specificity to meet statutory requirements. However, the description itself is not intended to limit the scope of this patent. Rather, the inventors have contemplated that the claimed subject matter might also be embodied in other ways, to include different elements or combinations of elements similar to the ones described in this document, in conjunction with other present or future technologies.","Exemplary System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","108","110","108"]},"The data polyarchy server  includes a processor  operatively coupled to a memory  that includes computer-executable instructions  and data . The processor is configured to fetch and execute the computer-executable instructions and fetch the data during such execution. Such computer-executable instructions include an operating system (not shown), and a data polyarchy management module  to dynamically generate and manage multiple hierarchies of inter-object relationships based on the values of attributes of the objects. These dynamically generated multiple hierarchies of inter-object relationships are stored in the polyarchical data set , which is also referred to as the data polyarchy. To generate the data polyarchy , the data polyarchy management module  uses data (e.g., Extensible Markup Language (XML) data) from any number of different data sources such as from one or more other optional servers  and\/or databases . For instance, a server  provides data (e.g., directories of enterprise users, resources, financial information, corporate e-mail systems, network operating systems, etc.) to the data polyarchy server from any number of various data stores\u2014databases, directories, metadirectories, and so on. A database  is a structured or unstructured data store, including an object-oriented database such as an XML database, a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) database, an SQL server database, and so on.","Responsive to generating and managing the data polyarchy , the management module  respectively generates and updates the elements of interest schema . The elements-of-interest schema indicates how an optional client computer  can manipulate and display the objects in the data polyarchy with respect to their respective polyarchies of inter-object relationships.","For instance, the elements-of-interest schema  identifies each object in the data polyarchy  as an address referencing a virtual entity (e.g., see the virtual object  of ) that represents the respective object. These virtual entities are stored as vectors or arrays of addresses in the schema. Each different type of attribute that an object in the data polyarchy could have is also identified in the schema as well as what kinds of indexes are to be used on the various attribute types. (A data index provides for object access). For each attribute type it is convenient to store with its definition, its corresponding index. In this manner, for example, if somebody requests for an attribute, the index is readily available and all of the values assumed by the attribute can be determined very quickly. (An elements-of-interest schema is described in greater detail below in reference to ).","The data polyarchy server  can generate any number of schemas . Each generated schema can provide access to various subsets of the objects in the data polyarchy  independent of the objects represented by other schemas . For example, a first schema  can be distributed to network administrators to provide access to resources and attributes such as printers and access lists that are otherwise protected or hidden from other employees. In the same manner, a second schema can be distributed to the president of human resources. While the second schema may provide the president with access to certain privileged employee records, the second schema could be completely silent with respect to the resources that are available to the network administrators group via the first schema. In this manner, schemas  can be designed to provide access control to organizational resources.","The data polyarchy server  communicates the elements-of-interest schema  to one or more optional clients . The client computer supports a graphical user interface (not shown) for displaying inter-object relationships in the data polyarchy  as described by the elements of interest schema. Exemplary arrangements and procedures to display objects within polyarchies of data relationships are described in related U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/728,935, titled \u201cHierarchy Polyarchy Visualization\u201d, filed on Nov. 29, 2000, which is assigned to the assignee hereof, and which is incorporated by reference.","The data polyarchy  and the elements of interest schema  can be replicated one or more times in a memory cache  by the data polyarchy server . An exemplary memory cache is described in greater detail below in reference to . Since the polyarchical server can operate either data set from a corresponding memory cache, there can be as many copies of the respective data sets as necessary. Thus no matter how demanding a client , the data polyarchy server can satisfy the demand.","When data polyarchy  and the elements of interest schema  are replicated in a memory cache  by the data polyarchy server , the server can maintain an authoritative store (not shown) in the memory  to represent the most recent, or current representation of the inter-object relationships. Such an authoritative store is beneficial because caches by their very nature are always out of date to some degree\u2014meaning that data in a cache is only as \u201cfresh\u201d, or timely as the most recent cache update. In light of this, a client requesting information from the data polyarchy  can indicate the level of data reliability or timeliness required by the client. If a high timeliness is required, the server  can access the data polyarchy from the authoritative store, rather than from more out of data caches. The speed of access to an authoritative cache depends on its respective implementation (e.g., implemented in internally to the server in random access memory or externally to the server in a data storage device).","Exemplary Data Polyarchy",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["122","122"]},"The data polyarchy  includes multiple virtual object data fields . Each virtual object data field includes and organizes information about a respective object, including, for example, information about how to get more information about the respective object. Specifically, the virtual object includes a globally unique identifier (GUID) data field  and if appropriate for the particular object, one or more attribute data fields .","A GUID  uniquely identifies the virtual object (which in turn represents a respective object) with respect to this or any other object in this or any other data polyarchy . As already noted, these objects can be represented in one or more physically distributed data stores that are in turn logically centralized by one or more directory services as well as by one or more data polyarchies. The attribute data field  defines any data attributes or data values of the virtual object . Each attribute corresponds to the attributes that an actual instance of the virtual object may include. Such attributes include, for example, one or more predicate data fields , multiple domain property data fields , and zero or more sub-object entity references .","Each predicate data field  indicates a respective operation to access or present a particular object with respect to one or more hierarchies of other objects (each object being represented by virtual objects  in the polyarchical data set ). Such operations indicate one or more diverse types of searches (e.g., a linear search and a recursive search), data transformations (e.g., from one hierarchical relationship to another different hierarchical relationship), and so on. (See, block  of ).","If an object is a simple object, meaning that it does not reference to a sub-object entity , a predicate  operation (e.g., a search, modification, data transformation\u2014from one structure such as from a virtual object  to an object within a hierarchy of other objects) will correspond to the respective object of interest. However, if the object is a complex object, meaning that it has a data relationship to one or more sub-objects, then the predicate operation will correspond to a combination of the object and\/or the one or more sub-objects.","The domain property data field  includes a physical domain property and a logical domain property. The physical domain property indicates one or more sets of values used to index a data object. The physical domain property is selected from a group of physical domain properties including a data type, a data precision indication, a scale indication, and a nullability indication). The logical domain property aspect of the domain property  facilitates searching and navigation of the data polyarchy  by allowing object data values to be assigned to particular domains. Specifically, the logical domain indicates a strategy to access and\/or present the corresponding object with respect to the other objects in the data polyarchy. For instance, the logical domain property includes a unique domain property, a locating domain property, and a classifying domain property. The particular one logical domain property that the polyarchical data relationship management module  assigns to an attribute of an object is based on the attribute's relative distribution of its value in the data polyarchy with respect to other values of the same attribute of other objects in the data polyarchy.","We now describe: (a) the relative distribution of the values assumed by an attribute within the data polyarchy ; and (b) how data distribution determines which objects represent respective dimensions (hierarchies), up-nodes, and down-nodes.","Relative Attribute Value Distribution","The set of values that an attribute has is part of that attribute's logical domain. Any information that is collected about the actual distribution of the values (in terms of the number of potential objects that contain each potential value) in a data polyarchy  is also a property of the attribute's logical domain. To determine the relative distribution of attribute values, one or more thresholds (e.g., a low threshold and a high threshold) are defined to determine the attribute's relative distribution in a data polyarchy  with respect to other attributes of other objects in the polyarchy. The thresholds are based on the assumption that the data may have a certain percentage of error within it (e.g., one (1) percent error). (Other statistical analysis techniques can be used in combination with or in place of the thresholds to determine object attribute distributions).","For instance, as objects are loaded into the data polyarchy  (e.g., from one or more directory and\/or database servers ), the data polyarchy management module  examines each object's respective attributes values based on the thresholds to determine: (a) which attributes are substantially unique with respect to their distributions in objects in the data set; (b) which attributes are distributed across a substantially large set of objects; and (c) which attributes are distributed across a substantially small set of objects in the data set. These determinations are made based on assuming that the data has that certain percentage of error.","With this assumption of some data error in mind, consider that a substantially unique attribute is not necessarily the only attribute of its kind in the data polyarchy . Rather, an attribute may be absolutely unique, or the attribute may belong to a relatively sparse distribution of similar attributes in the data set. Attributes that are determined to be substantially unique with respect to their distributions across objects in the data set have a unique logical domain property illustrating that they are distinguishing as compared to other attributes.","Attributes that are distinguishing may identify respective unique dimensions in the polyarchical data set , which are represented as up-nodes of an interconnected graph that in turn represents a hierarchical dimension. Inside this model, the default polyarchy is flat. Attributes that are not distinguishing are distributed either across a substantially large set of objects in the data set, or alternatively distributed across a substantially small set of objects. Non-distinguishing attributes are not good candidates for attributes that define dimensions. Instead, such distributions indicate that non-distinguishing attributes belong to one or more of the identified dimensions. Accordingly, a non-distinguishing attribute is represented as a down-node in at least one dimension that is identified by the attributes distribution. Up-node polyarchies are also discovered when all the values of a down-node object are located in a substantially unique up-node object.","Attributes that are distributed across a substantially large set of objects have a locating domain property (e.g., a surname may be a locating domain property). Attributes with locating domain properties are used to narrow a search for particular ones of the data objects in the data polyarchy . Attributes that are distributed across a substantially small set of objects have a classifying domain property. Attributes with the classifying domain property are used to filter out unwanted objects from a search or navigation procedure.","Jump Gates","A sub-object entity reference  such as a GUID not only indicates whether a virtual object  (i.e., a respective object) has a relationship to a different object in the data polyarchy , but it also references the different object (i.e., via the different object's corresponding virtual object). Specifically, a sub-object reference uniquely identifies the different object of interest as a sub-object of the virtual object data field. The sub-object reference uniquely identifies the different object of interest across one or more data stores.","A virtual object  that references a sub-object (via a corresponding sub-object entity reference ) is a \u201cjump gate\u201d. A jump gate represents an elastic data relationship between a complex object and related sub-objects within the polyarchical data set . Inter-object data relationships in the data polyarchy are modeled with one or more simple objects  and\/or complex objects . If an object has one or more sub-data relationships, such relationships are either represented as referenced sub-objects  in the object (or \u201csurface entity\u201d), or as separate objects  linked to another object  in some dimension.","To illustrate this, consider that an employee and the employee's dependents are people represented as objects in a directory store.

The locating index type - or selecting index type is a good candidate for locating objects within the data polyarchy and is represented, for example, by the following attributes: a surname, a building name, a title, a room number, and\/or the like. An attribute having a classifying index type such as an indication of gender (e.g., male or female) is a good candidate to filter objects in a search of objects in the data set because classifying objects are relatively small in number in the data polyarchy as compared to the relative distribution of objects with attributes that correspond to other index types.","The elements-of-interest schema  is highly customizable. For instance, a network administrator can assign natural language names such as names in English, French, Chinese, etc., to the elements, or objects in the elements-of-interest data set .

The request corresponds to a data object of the data objects in the polyarchical data set  of .","The received PQL message  may correspond to one or more operations including any combination of: (a) an operation to find a default search object of the data objects; (b) an operation to locate an object of the data objects that corresponds to a particular name; (c) an operation to obtain a default hierarchy of data relationships that correspond to a particular object of the data objects; (d) an operation to obtain a particular hierarchy of data relationships that correspond to a particular object of the data objects; (e) an operation to identify at least one subset of a plurality of hierarchies of data relationships that correspond to a particular object of the data objects; (f) an operation to obtain multiple hierarchies of data relationships that correspond to a particular object of the data objects; and so on.","At block , the data polyarchy management module  determines a physical access strategy (e.g., a simple scan, a recursive scan, and so on) to identify data corresponding to the request from the data polyarchy . This determination is based on the request (block ), which in turn is based on the schema  that was communicated to the client  (block ). As already noted, the schema provides the client not only with information that corresponds to the possible contents of the data polyarchy, but also with includes information describing the possible polyarchies of data relationships that may pertain to any one object of interest (e.g., see the \u201c<Dimension>\u201d indicators shown in Table 7).","For instance, consider that if a client request (i.e., a PQL message ) is designed to filter out all elements-of-interest that pertain to an object with the exception of an absolutely unique distinguishing attribute (e.g., a GUID and a common name that corresponds to the GUID), a simple scan of the data polyarchy  is an efficient technique to search for information regarding the distinguishing object of interest.","The request , however, may also indicate that a number of sub-objects should be presented with respect to a complex object (i.e., a jump gate) and then the results are to be subsequently modified by a union of a dimension of information that corresponds to the complex object that is orthogonal to one or more of the sub-objects. In this case, a recursive scan of the data polyarchy  is an efficient technique to search for information regarding the objects and inter-object relationships of interest.","In this manner, a PQL request message  identifying attributes and data relationships of interest also provides an optimized physical access strategy to search the data polyarchy  for such attributes and data relationships.","At block , the data polyarchy management module  accesses the data from the polyarchy based on the determined physical access strategy (block ). The accessed data may take a number of different forms. For instance, the accessed data may be independent of any inter-object relationship between the data object and any other object in the polyarchy. Additionally, the accessed object(s) may participate in one or more hierarchies of inter-object relationships with one or more different data objects in the polyarchy. In this case, the accessed object(s) and the one or more different objects comprise a similar attribute. As discussed above, these inter-object relationships may be orthogonal with respect to one another in one or more dimensions.","At block , the polyarchical data management module  transforms the accessed data for issuing to the client . Specifically, accessed data is transformed based on the requirements of the specific PQL message  that was used to request the data (block ). For instance, if the message indicates an object with respect to a particular dimension, the implicit and explicit inter-object relationships of the accessed data are assembled into a hierarchy based on the particular dimension.","For example, an accessed data object represents a jump gate when the accessed data includes a complex object of the data objects that is related to one or more sub-objects of the data objects. In this case the complex object is transformed or represented as an independent surface entity. Each of the one or more sub-objects is described as a respective separate entity in a manner that is independent of the surface entity. The one or more sub-objects are then transformed or referenced in the surface entity to indicate a relationship between the complex object and the one or more sub-objects. The referencing is independent of any object naming or hierarchical data relationship between the complex object and the one or more sub-objects.","In another example, accessed data includes a first object of the data objects in the polyarchy that is related to one or more sub-objects. The first object is transformed or represented as an independent surface entity. Each of the one or more sub-objects is described as respective separate entities in a manner that is independent of the surface entity. Then, a respective link is included in each of the one or more sub-objects to reference the first object. In this manner, as in the previous example, the data is transformed to express the relationship of interest as indicated in the corresponding PQL message .","At block , data polyarchy management module  issues, or communicates the transformed data (block ) to the client.","Exemplary Computing Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0121"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 1"],"b":["1400","102","102","106","110","1400","1400"]},"The computer  is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.

In this manner, complex real-world objects are represented with respect to the particular objects themselves, with respect to any set of decomposed sub-entities, or sub-objects that are related to the particular objects. These inter-object relationships are managed and navigated using a data polyarchy schema  that has been generated to access elements of interest in the data polyarchy .","Although the described subject matter to generate and manage polyarchies of data relationships has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological operations, it is to be understood that the subject defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or operations described.
