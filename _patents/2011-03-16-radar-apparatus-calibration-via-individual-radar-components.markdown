title: Radar apparatus calibration via individual radar components
abstract: A method, system and computer program product for calibrating and operating a radar apparatus provides for obtaining calibration response data from, for example, a radar cylinder and a plurality of radar columns, prior to assembling the radar cylinder and plurality of radar columns into an assembled radar apparatus. The calibration response data for the exemplary radar cylinder and the plurality of radar columns is evaluated to provide a simulated response of the assembled radar apparatus. Actual measured responses from the assembled radar apparatus may then be correlated with the simulated response through use of a look-up table. The particular method, system and program product for calibrating and operating the radar apparatus provides for avoidance of field calibration of the assembled radar apparatus, which is generally neither desirable nor feasible under hostile conditions.

No. 13\/025,652, filed Feb. 11, 2011, and titled Bench-Top Measurement Method, Apparatus and System for Phased Array Radar Apparatus Calibration, the contents of which is incorporated herein fully by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates generally to radar apparatus. More particularly, the invention relates to methods for calibrating and operating radar apparatus.","2. Description of the Related Art","Radar apparatus are well known and well utilized in both commercial applications and military applications, where it is desirable to map (i.e., locate) and track a particular target within a particular field. Radar apparatus effect such a mapping and tracking of the particular target within the particular field by a detection of reflected radio waves in comparison with emitted radio waves.","While radar apparatus are thus particularly common and quite desirable within commercial applications and military applications, radar apparatus are nonetheless not entirely without problems.","In that regard, radar apparatus, like many other electronic components and apparatus, often require an external and routine calibration in order to assure that the radar scans that are obtained when using a radar apparatus are accurately representative of the location and trajectory of a particular target within a particular field. Unfortunately, radar apparatus when deployed within the context of certain military applications may not be amenable or readily accessible to such external and routine calibration.","Thus, desirable are additional systems and methods for calibrating radar apparatus to assure that radar apparatus accuracy is efficiently optimized with respect to detecting and tracking targets and trajectories within particular fields, and under various radar apparatus installation conditions.","The embodiments include a method for calibrating and operating a radar apparatus and a system for calibrating and operating the radar apparatus. The embodiments also include a computer program product that relates to the foregoing method and system. The particular method, system and computer program product in accordance with the embodiments is predicated upon testing and calibration of individual radar apparatus components prior to assembly and operation of a radar apparatus that comprises the individual radar apparatus components. Thus, the pretested and precalibrated radar apparatus components may be directly assembled to provide a fully calibrated radar apparatus absent a need for testing and calibrating the radar apparatus after assembly in a field environment, such as in particular a hostile field environment.","A particular method for operating a radar apparatus in accordance with the invention includes determining for a plurality of radar components a plurality of laboratory test electrical responses. This particular method also includes determining from the plurality of laboratory test electrical responses a simulated radar response for an assembled radar apparatus assembled from the plurality of radar components. This particular method also includes assembling the plurality of radar components to provide the assembled radar apparatus.

This other particular method also includes determining a plurality of radar column electrical responses for each of a plurality of individual radar columns in a test fixture. This other particular method also includes determining from the radar cylinder electrical response and the plurality of radar column electrical responses a simulated radar response for an assembled radar apparatus assembled from the radar cylinder and the plurality of radar columns.","This other particular method also includes assembling the individual radar column and the plurality of radar columns to provide the assembled radar apparatus. This other particular method also includes determining the location of a target by correlating a measured response of the assembled radar apparatus with the simulated radar response.","A particular radar system in accordance with the invention includes: (1) a radar apparatus comprising a plurality of components; and (2) a computer programmed to: (a) receive for the plurality of components a plurality of laboratory test electrical responses; (b) determine from the plurality of laboratory test electrical responses a simulated radar response for an assembled radar apparatus assembled from the plurality of radar components; and (c) determine the location of a target by correlating a measured response of the assembled radar apparatus with the simulated radar response.","A particular computer program product in accordance with the invention includes a tangible medium encoded to: (1) receive for a plurality of radar components a plurality of laboratory test electrical responses; (2) determine from the plurality of laboratory test electrical responses a simulated radar response for an assembled radar apparatus assembled from the plurality of radar components; and (3) determine the location of a target by correlating a measured response of the assembled radar apparatus with the simulated radar response.","The embodiments, which provide a method for calibrating and operating a radar apparatus and a system for calibrating and operating the radar apparatus, as well as a related computer program product, are understood within the context of the description set forth below. The description set forth below is understood within the context of the drawings described above. Since the drawings are intended for illustrative purposes, the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale.","The particular method, system and program product in accordance with the embodiments provide that individual radar apparatus components are independently tested prior to assembly to provide radar component test performance data files (i.e., typically but not necessarily limited to cylinder test performance data files and column test performance data files) that are inputted to a calibration utility (i.e., a software program) that provides calibration files that are used for calibrating the radar apparatus that is subsequently assembled from the individual radar apparatus components. Such precalibration of radar apparatus components is desirable under circumstances where a radar apparatus is deployed in a hostile environment, and radar apparatus post assembly calibration may be neither desirable nor feasible.","The following description will first describe a particular exemplary non-limiting radar apparatus that may be calibrated and operated in accordance with the embodiments. The following description will next describe a particular calibration and operation methodology of that particular non-limiting radar apparatus in accordance with the embodiments.","Exemplary Non-limiting Radar Apparatus","Referring now to the drawings, wherein like numerals refer to like parts throughout, there is seen in  radar apparatus  within the context of which may be practiced the embodiments and the invention. Radar apparatus  that is generally illustrated in  may optionally be designated as Man-portable Counter-Mortar Radar (MCMR) or Lightweight Counter-Mortar Radar (LCMR). Radar apparatus  generally comprises an antenna  that further comprises a plurality of additional component parts. As is illustrated in , antenna  is positioned upon tripod . Radar apparatus  also includes laptop computer  (to provide at least in-part a radar system in accordance with the embodiments) and power supply  or ","Referring to , antenna  illustratively comprises twenty-four panel columns  that are attached to a central cylinder , although the embodiments are not necessarily limited to panel columns (i.e., other types and geometries of antenna columns are contemplated). Antenna  scans electronically in azimuth using an electronic matrix switch and has a pair of fixed elevation beams. Both azimuth and elevation monopulse angle measurement are used to provide accurate three-dimensional target coordinates (range, azimuth, and elevation).","Antenna  is constructed of twenty-four radially extending antenna panel columns , spaced at fifteen degrees and mounted by support rings  to central antenna cylinder  that houses a transmit matrix switch assembly  and receive matrix switch assembly  of which there are two as illustrated in , as well as receiver , digital signal processor , waveform generator , and CPU , as illustrated in . Antenna panel columns  can be removed and stacked for transport, and can be quickly reassembled when the radar apparatus  is deployed.","Referring to , and , each panel column  is an etched substrate containing six vertically polarized dipole elements , each with a pre-selector filter, limiter, and low noise amplifier. The six elements are combined on panel column  to form two stacked elevation beams that are offset in elevation angle by 17 degrees. A single elevation beam is generated on transmit, centered on the lower receive elevation beam. The elevation beams are independently tapered in amplitude and phase at each frequency to reduce the below the horizon elevation angle sidelobes to suppress the effects of ground-bounce multipath. Each panel column  also contains a pair of solid-state power amplifiers that generate RF power pulses for transmission. Each power amplifier drives three elements through an unequal split, three-way power divider. Panel column  further comprises cable connectors for electrical interconnection to radar electronics housed in central antenna cylinder  and longitudinal slots (i.e., shown in ) formed parallel and adjacent to their respective inner edges. In addition, each panel column  includes a plurality of placement pins (as illustrated in and ) that engages an opening  (i.e., shown in ) formed through support rings  in axial alignment with the slots to further ensure accurate alignment of the panel columns  relative to cylinder .","Each of the elevation receive beam RF signals and the transmitter RF signal from each panel column  are fed into a 24 to 8 electronic matrix that instantaneously selects an 8 column sector and reorders the columns appropriately for the azimuth beamformers. For each azimuth dwell period only 8 of the 24 columns are active. On reception, the azimuth beamformers form an azimuth sum beam and an azimuth difference beam with independent amplitude tapering for optimal sidelobe suppression. The transmit beam is untapered in azimuth.","Referring to , transmit matrix switch assembly  includes an azimuth beamformer that creates the eight equally weighted transmit signals that form the transmit beam. A matrix switch provides beam steering by routing the eight transmit signals to the appropriate eight antenna columns  through a 3:1 selector switch ","Referring to , receive matrix switch assembly  works in reverse of transmit matrix  and routs received signals from each of the eight active antenna columns  through 3:1 selector switch and an 8 by 8 matrix switch to an azimuth beamformer . Azimuth beamformer forms sum and difference beams on receipt of signals.","Radar apparatus  has twenty-four azimuth beam positions 15 degrees apart. The azimuth 3-db beamwidth is slightly wider at 18.7 degrees. A diagram of the twenty-four azimuth beams is seen in  and  depicts the transmit, receive sum, and difference beam patterns in azimuth.  illustrates the three elevation beam patterns of antenna , i.e., the transmit beam, lower receive beam, and upper receive beam.","Referring to , antenna  is constructed on top of tripod . Tripod  includes a tri-bracketed connector  having thumbwheels for leveling antenna  and a boresight scope  for aligning antenna  in azimuth.","Antenna cylinder  is positioned on tripod . Two (top and bottom, as illustrated in ) or three (top and bottom (as illustrated in ), and intermediate (as not illustrated in )) levels of support rings  consisting of multiple interlocking panels are mounted around the base, middle, and for added stability if needed, top of antenna cylinder . As seen in , support rings  have a series of twenty-four circumferentially spaced slots for accepting a longitudinal peripheral edge of panel columns . Panel columns  are then mounted to support rings  using slots . Once panel columns are in position, a series of ground planes  is positioned between adjacent columns  by slidingly engaging the peripheral edges into longitudinal slots . Cable connectors of panel columns  are then engaged with corresponding connectors on antenna cylinder  to electrically interconnect antenna electronics of panel columns  with transmit matrix switch assembly  and receive matrix switch assembly  housed within antenna cylinder .","A small monopole  may be placed over antenna  (on top of cylinder ) as illustrated in  to provide an omnidirectional beam used for sidelobe blanking. Monopole  generates a hemispherical pattern with a null at zenith.","With reference to , an antenna connector ring  may be used to interconnect antenna cylinder  to tri-bracket connector . Connector ring  includes brackets  that securely receive the thumbwheels of connector , and further includes a circumferential sidewall  that envelops the lower portion of cylinder , and a plurality of electrical interconnects  and vent openings  for connecting cylinder  to interface with antenna panels . A base plate includes openings  for power cables, data cables, ethernet cables, and the like. A bubble level  provides visual indication of the level of radar system  relative to the ground.","As shown in , radar electronics comprise a four channel digital receiver , a digital signal processor (DSP) , a coherent waveform generator  including local oscillators, and a data processor or CPU . Waveform generator  digitally generates a coherent linear FM pulse at 6 MHz IF. The IF waveform is up-converted to L-band using a three-stage up-converter. The output of waveform generator  is sent to a transmit matrix module for distribution to appropriate antenna columns . A block diagram for waveform generator  is seen in .","Digital receiver  uses a double-conversion superheterodyne design with an output IF of 30 MHz. Receiver  has four channels: low beam sum, low beam azimuth difference, upper beam sum, and upper beam azimuth difference. Receiver  outputs are fed into a four channel A\/D converter card that directly samples the four 30 MHz IF signals with an A\/D converter as a sample rate of 24 MHz. The four channels are then converted into a baseband complex signal using a digital downconverter, implemented in a field programmable gate array with an internal clock rate of 144 MHz. The complex data is sent to DSP  using high-speed data links. A block diagram for receiver  is seen in .","Referring to , DSP  comprises three high-speed field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), such as a Xilink Virtex-EM having more than 9 billion usable operations per second. Each FPGA node has 4 Mbytes of 100 MHz static RAM. There are 50 MBPS bi-directional communication links and 50 MBPS data channel loops between each node. A constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector extracts target detections from the upper or lower sum beam while rejecting clutter and other extraneous returns. Once a detection is declared in either the upper or lower sum beam, the data in the opposite sum beam and the corresponding azimuth difference beam is used for elevation and azimuth monopulse processing and for the rejection of side-lobe targets. All detection data are sent to the embedded CPU  for further processing.","Embedded CPU  is a single board computer that is PC\/104 compatible and has four serial channels, 48 digital I\/O lines and 10\/100 Ethernet networking capability. For example, a WinSystems EBC-TXPLUS configured with an Intel Pentium 166 MHz processor is acceptable. CPU  operates the radar. For each multiple-pulse radar dwell, CPU  selects that azimuth beam position, chooses the waveform to be transmitted, and receives resulting detections. CPU  also processes detection data to provide range and angle sidelobe blanking, monopulse angle measurement, fine range measurement, and single scan correlation. The processed detection data is then sent to laptop computer  for additional processing and display.","Laptop computer  is used for radar control and display, as well as data processing, calibration and operation in accordance with the embodiments and the invention as described in greater detail below. Embedded CPU  sends processed detections to laptop  for processing by target tracking software. Target track files are maintained on all detected targets. Once sufficient track points are collected on a target, the data is processed by a discriminator that makes an initial determination as to whether the target is a projectile. All targets that discriminate as projectiles are then processed by a trajectory estimator that performs a more detailed target discrimination function to help eliminate false launch point locations from being generated. The trajectory estimator uses a Kalman filter technique to estimate the launch and impact points from the target track data. The target detections, track, launch points, and impact points are all displayed on a PPI display on laptop .","Power for radar system  may be provided by a conventional AC-DC power supply singularly or in conjunction with portable generator .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 20","b":["10","22","16","18","14","26","44","16"]},"Referring to , digital signal processor  comprises a series of firmware operations including a discrete Hilbert transform (DHT) , a time domain correlator (TDC) , a Doppler filter (DOP) , and target detection (DET) .","Discrete Hilbert transform performs digital down conversion and filtering. An integrated FPGA converts the digital IF data to complex in-phase and quadrature data using a digital complex demodulator and pass band filter. The filter may be changed by loading a different set of filter coefficients in a configuration file.","Time domain correlator  takes the received data and correlates it against a stored replica or the transmitted pulse, the equivalent of using a matched filter. Because all radar apparatus  waveforms use linear FM coding with a 1 MHz excursion, this operation results in a compressed pulse width of approximately 1 microsecond.","Doppler filter (DOP)  is carried out using a 128 or 256 point FFT operation. The number of points in the FFT is equal to the number of pulses in a radar dwell. In normal operation, radar apparatus  uses 128 or 256 pulses per dwell. However, other dwell modes, such as 512 or 1024 pulses, are available for use. The two-dimensional array of range-Doppler cell data generated by Doppler filter  is stored in memory and accessed by target detection module .","Target detector  is accomplished by using a sliding window constant false alarm (CFAR) detector. Target detector  also carries out bump detection in both range and Doppler to reduce the number of detections caused by large targets.","Referring to , software installed on laptop  provides radar control, data processing, information display, data recording, and playback capabilities. It should be understood that a variety of software implementations are possible for managing and displaying the reading obtained by radar apparatus . Similarly, a variety of graphical user interfaces is possible for enhancing user operation of radar apparatus . For example, custom windows may be designed for the entry of radar parameters and controls as well as turning the radar on and off. Similarly, software may provide a plan position indicator (PPI) display for tracking relative motion of targets, an oscilloscope display for visualizing the contents of DSP  memory, or a waterfall display of historical parameters and targets detected by radar apparatus .","The Calibration and Operation Method, System and Computer Program Product The method of the inventive monopulse calibration utility for radar apparatus, such as but not limited to the foregoing radar apparatus , is a novel radar calibration method that uses a piecewise calibration of several key components to effect radar apparatus  operation. This particular calibration method is generally executed by custom engineering software that generates monopulse calibration lookup tables based on predicted receive beam patterns.","As is noted above, within the context of the embodiments, a particular non-limiting radar apparatus  includes two major subsystems: (1) an electronics cylinder  that includes the waveform generator, radar receiver, and the analog and digital signal processor; and (2) twenty-four antenna panel columns  that each contain six vertically polarized dipoles mounted on a composite substrate. Each antenna panel column  contains an elevation beamformer which forms two simultaneous stacked elevation beams. Each antenna panel column also contains an RF power amplifier, LNAs (i.e., low noise amplifiers) and filters for the receive signal.","During operation, the radar apparatus  will use the electronics in the cylinder  and a group of eight contiguous antenna panel columns  to form four receive beams (upper sum, lower sum, upper delta (i.e., azimuth difference), lower delta (i.e., azimuth difference). When a target is detected, the signal received through each of these four beams is used in a calculation to determine the precise azimuth and elevation angles between the radar apparatus  and the target. The accuracy of radar apparatus  calibration will ultimately determine the accuracy of the angular measurements of a target position.","The foregoing radar apparatus  was designed to be lightweight, set up quickly without tools, and operated in a hostile environment. Radar apparatus  antenna panel columns  must also be able to be replaced in the field in the event of a panel column  failure. As a result of these requirements, commonly used calibration methods for radar apparatus  are generally not feasible. In more typical and conventional radar apparatus and radar systems, monitor feeds may be used to measure and automatically adjust radar beams during operation. These monitor feeds would not be feasible in a radar apparatus that is assembled on site. Rapid deployment, setup in a hostile environment, and the requirement for assembly without tools, eliminate the possibility of a radar apparatus  calibration that relies on beam measurement before startup. Replacing a failed antenna panel column  will introduce a new set of radiating elements, power amplifiers, receive circuitry, and elevation beamformer. This will cause the receive beams to be slightly different and would require a system-wide calibration (which is common with other radars) to be repeated each time a radar apparatus  panel column  is replaced. For each of these reasons, a mathematical approach to synthesize and simulate radar apparatus  patterns based on a priori (i.e., laboratory or manufacturing) measurement of the panel columns  and electronics cylinder  would be at least desirable, if not necessary. This approach is in accordance with the embodiments described herein.","The radar apparatus  uses a standard monopulse processing technique in azimuth and elevation to determine the angular location of a target. Monopulse processing calculates the beam ratio of two different antenna beams and determines precise angle to a detected target. With this technique, each beam ratio corresponds to a unique target angle. The more accurately these beam ratios are known, the more accurately the target angle can be determined. A considerable issue with using monopulse processing is determining beam responses as a function of angle. Beam responses will be affected by electronic component behavior, signal losses and mechanical construction, as well as other design considerations, so such beam responses are normally difficult to predict. For that reason, beam responses are usually measured after a radar apparatus is fully constructed and installed. As is noted above, such post construction and installation beam response measurement is generally not practical for radar apparatus .","In order to predict the foregoing beam responses (and the related beam response ratios) at all azimuth and elevation angles, the beam responses need to be simulated based on measurements of each individual antenna panel column  and electronics cylinder . These measurements will determine the electrical behavior of these components across frequency, angle and beam number. These measurements will also predict a response of an assembled radar apparatus  according to which order a plurality of antenna panel columns  is installed in the radar apparatus . The following method that combines these measurements attempts to eliminate calculation errors as much as possible by reducing many of the simplifying assumptions that are common with alternative methodologies.","Although all of the antenna panel columns  and the electronic cylinders  produced for radar apparatus  are designed and built to behave exactly the same, each will be slightly different due to manufacturing tolerances and electrical differences in the internal components. These differences will alter the behavior of the generated beams within an assembled radar apparatus . Since each of these components will have a slightly different effect on the radar apparatus  beam patterns, it is not possible to predict how these slight variances affect the overall radar apparatus  beam response without simulating these radar apparatus  beam patterns.","Thus, the embodiments provide a calibration and operation method and system for a radar apparatus, such as but not limited to radar apparatus , in accordance with  (which is directed towards determining radar calibration files) and  (which is directed towards manipulation and application of those radar calibration files to provide for determination of location and trajectory of a target).","In accordance with , such a calibration and operation method and system provides that an individual radar antenna cylinder  and a plurality of antenna panel columns  are subject to laboratory measurements (also intended to include manufacturing measurements or other pre-assembly measurements, such as but not limited to quality assurance measurements) to determine corresponding column data files  and cylinder data files . Further the column data files  and the cylinder data files  are inputted into a calibration utility  (i.e., including but not limited to a software program that may reside in the laptop computer ) that in turn determines a series of radar calibration files .","With respect to column data files , individual antenna panel columns  are inserted into a test fixture which measures the electrical behavior of the individual antenna panel columns . The electrical behavior measurements that are made are specifically the scattering parameters (more commonly known as \u201cS-Parameters\u201d). The test fixture apparatus used to perform these measurements (which is intended as separate from but related to the instant invention) uses a mathematical algorithm (which is also intended as separate from but related to the instant invention) to convert the S-Parameters into a set of complex (magnitude and phase) far-field azimuth and elevation beam patterns that describe each antenna panel column  at each frequency of interest. The complex (magnitude and phase) beam patterns are used as an input to an inventive algorithm in accordance with the embodiments.","The complex (magnitude and phase) beam patterns are determined for each of  antenna panel columns  at all frequencies of interest. These beam patterns are determined from a single measurement for each of 24 antenna panel columns  using the foregoing test fixture apparatus that is specifically designed to measure the antenna beam patterns of the antenna panel columns . The single measurement for each of the 24 antenna panel columns  is combined with a simulated element pattern for an assembled radar antenna  to synthesize the entire complex (magnitude and phase) beam pattern of the assembled radar antenna . There are two outputs of the antenna panel columns , upper and lower. While the upper and the lower outputs are measured in the same manner, the electronics that are being measured are different, and therefore, the electrical test results are typically different:","The \u201cupper\u201d beams are designed to have a maximum magnitude response at a higher elevation angle than the \u201clower\u201d beams. Mathematically, these complex beam patterns are referred to as \u201cBU\u201d (upper) and \u201cBL\u201d (lower) where \u201cf\u201d is the frequency of interest, and \u201cn\u201d is the serial number of a particular column panel . The complex beam patterns are measured at all azimuth angles from \u221290 degrees to 90 degrees (where zero degrees represents the line radial from the center of the cylinder along each antenna column) and at all elevation angles from \u221290 degrees to 90 degrees. Since all elevations angles are not processed by this algorithm, elevation angles less than \u221210 degrees or greater than 40 degrees are excluded. A trivial phase correction is typically performed on each antenna beam pattern to move the far field pattern phase center to a center of an electronics cylinder  once the cylinder  is assembled into a radar apparatus . These phase corrected antenna panel column  pattern measurements are stored electronically in a manner that can be accessed easily by a calibration tool (i.e., a software tool). A typical upper antenna panel column pattern is shown in .  shows a beam pattern of an entire antenna array (i.e., whole radar).","In accordance with the foregoing description, each of the twenty-four antenna panel columns  will be connected to the radar apparatus central electronics cylinder . The signal received by each antenna panel column  passes into the electronics cylinder  and is combined to form a final receive beam.","Similar to the antenna panel columns , each radar apparatus  electronics cylinder  is designed to be exactly the same for each radar apparatus  system, but due to the complexity of the components inside, each electronics cylinder  behaves slightly different. To more accurately characterize the received signals in the radar cylinder , an additional set of measurements is undertaken. The cylinder data file  data measured by this test is also used by the calibration utility  along with the column data file  data from each of the twenty-four antenna panel columns , to generate the final simulated radar beam patterns in accordance with reference numeral  of .","To characterize the electrical changes that occur to each signal passing into the central enclosure radar cylinder , a measurement routine is also performed on this radar apparatus  component. As part of this test, a calibrated test signal is passed into an antenna connector on the outside of the central enclosure radar cylinder  (see, e.g. reference numeral at  or reference numeral  at ) and the change in phase and magnitude is measured at the analog to digital converter (see. e.g.,  and ). This test is repeated for all frequencies of interest, for each of the 24 antenna connectors as defined above, and for each of the 8 beam positions. This data will be referred to as \u201cT\u201d where \u201cf\u201d is the frequency being measured, \u201cC\u201d is the number of the connector (1 through 24), and \u201cB\u201d is the beam number \u201c1 through 8\u201d. The data collected during these measurements is stored to a file that corresponds to the serial number of the central enclosure radar cylinder .","Before the panel column  and central enclosure radar cylinder  measurements can be processed, a beam synthesis must first simulate a geometry of a radar apparatus  assembled from the panel columns  and the radar cylinder . The desired result of the geometry simulation is to map the needed azimuth and elevation indexes for each panel column  position in a beam to the overall beam azimuth and elevation of a plurality of simulated target locations.  shows a coordinate system used to model the radar apparatus  (x,y,z), and a coordinate system used to model the individual panel columns  (a,b,c). \u201cTarget 1\u201d represents a target at zero degrees elevation relative to the (a,b,c) coordinate system, and \u201cTarget 2\u201d is a target at phi deg elevation relative to the same coordinates. To assist in visualization, a rotation matrix is applied to a target azimuth and elevation relative to this panel column  centric coordinate system, and the height of the array from the ground is removed later to bring the resulting azimuth and elevation back to a radar apparatus  centric (x,y,z) coordinate system.","For an azimuth simulation, the observation that each antenna panel column  is offset from an adjacent panel column  by fifteen degrees along with the definition of the center of each beam as a mid-point between its fourth and fifth panel column , allows for a bulk azimuth offset of 15\u00d7(beamposition\u22124.5).

These tables are stored in the radar apparatus  and contain a list of elevation and azimuth angle offsets for all of the possible azimuth and elevation magnitude ratios.

To generate this table, the simulation will loop over all of the possible elevation ratio magnitudes. For each possible elevation ratio, it will loop over the list of possible azimuth ratio magnitudes that can be generated at that elevation ratio magnitude. At each intersection of elevation and azimuth monopulse ratio, the simulation will write four values; left azimuth, left elevation, right azimuth, and right elevation. If a valid elevation\/azimuth ratio pair was not computed during the simulation, a set of placeholders will be entered into the table in the appropriate location.

It is possible for the azimuth and elevation ratios to separately point to several locations on the monopulse ratio plots above. Selection of a particular monopulse ratio location as a \u201ctrue\u201d location of a target is resolved with a novel contouring operation that looks for intersections of a series of possible azimuth and elevation locations.  shows such a series of possible azimuth locations for a given azimuth monopulse ratio and a series of possible elevation locations for a given elevation monopulse ratio.
