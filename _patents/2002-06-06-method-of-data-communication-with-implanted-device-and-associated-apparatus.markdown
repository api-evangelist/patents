{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The United States Government has rights under this invention pursuant to Grant 1-R01-NS43791 from the National Institutes of Health.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a method and associated apparatus employed in wireless two-way communication of data by means of current pulses traveling through living biological tissues and, more specifically, it contemplates the use of an implantable device which may be implanted, for example, in a patient's brain, torso or abdomen in cooperation with an external computerized device for diagnostic, monitoring or therapeutic purposes.","2. Description o the Prior Art","The value of using invasive procedures and devices in diagnosing, monitoring or treating patients has long been known in the medical environment. It has been known, for example, to employ a pacemaker for regulating heart functions. Also, deep brain electrical stimulation for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease has been known.","It has also been known to suggest the use of implantable devices which are in communication with an external computerized device, such as by radio frequency (RF) signals or light or wired connection, for example.","It has also been known for various purposes to suggest two-way communication with wireless base and remote stations wherein data may be communicated. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,289,237.","Among the problems with the prior art utilizing wired systems are the risk of infection and reduced mobility of the patient.","Among the problems with prior art RF systems have been the requirement for substantial size, difficulty in recharging batteries and signal-to-noise ratio. Also the energy required to convert between the signal and the RF waves can be substantial.","There remains, therefore, a substantial need for an implantable device which will efficiently and accurately receive signals from an external device and deliver signals to the external device for medical diagnosis, monitoring and therapeutic purposes.","The present invention has met the above-described need. In the method of the present invention, an implanted device has a first antenna having a pair of electrodes and associated first circuit components. An external device has a second antenna having a pair of electrodes and an associated microprocessor. The invention involves transmitting current pulses containing data through living biological tissue, thereby taking advantage of the electrical conductivity of the ionic fluid of such biological tissue. The data transmission may be effected in both directions, i.e., from the external device to the internal device and from the internal device to the external device. The transmissions are preferably synchronously effected. Corresponding apparatus is provided.","A unique construction of first or volume conduction antenna facilitates directional delivery of the information with high efficiency in the far field.","The efficiency of data communication is such as to enhance battery life. The system also facilitates miniaturization, including the use of microchip technology.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and associated apparatus for providing efficient communication between an implanted device and an external device for purposes of data transmission employing volume conduction.","It is another object of the present invention to provide such a system which can be miniaturized and make efficient use of energy employed to power the system.","It is a further object of such an invention which facilitates implantation of the implantable device in a human patient in regions such as the brain, torso or abdomen.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide such a system which does not require the use of wires for purposes of power delivery or data transmission or the use of light, magnetic field, ultrasound or RF energy.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide such a system which takes advantage of the electrical current carrying capabilities of the body's ionic fluid in order to employ the same as an information carrier.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide such a system which facilitates efficient synchronous communication of current pulses through living biological tissues.","These and other objects of the invention will be more fully understood from the following detailed description of the invention on reference to the illustrations appended hereto.","As used herein, the term \u201cvolume conduction\u201d means data communication by wireless passage of data by current pulses passing through living biological tissues between an implanted device and an external device.","As used herein, the term \u201cpatient\u201d means a member of the animal kingdom, including human beings.","As employed herein, the term \u201ccurrent pulse(s)\u201d means electrical current waveforms which have been modified to carry information such as by, for example, phase shift keying, amplitude modulation or frequency modulation.","The present invention makes advantageous use of an implanted device having a first antenna having a pair of electrodes for receiving and transmitting current pulses from and to an external device having a second antenna having a pair of electrodes and employing the external second antenna to deliver and receive current pulses to and from the implanted first antenna. Each antenna is associated with a microprocessor and related circuit components.","The use of suitably processed current to deliver pulsed current information eliminates a number of the aforementioned problems. In the present context, passage of the current pulses which may be made to contain the desired information as by modulation through living biological tissues takes advantage of the fact that ionic fluid in biological tissues conducts electric current efficiently. This, therefore, prolongs the life of and reduces the size of any battery that would be employed in the implantable device. It also eliminates the need for conversion of light, sound, or RF signals to digital signals for purposes of data communication.","This further permits miniaturization which facilitates the use of microelectronic chips, as in implantable brain devices of the present invention.","Referring to , there is shown a segment of living biological tissue  such as provided in a patient and skin  disposed exteriorly thereof. An internal volume conduction first antenna  is in intimate contact with the living biological tissue  and is operatively associated with circuit components  which may be energized by battery  or another device that produces electrical current. The implanted antenna , circuit components  and battery  may all be provided within a single housing (not shown) which may be suitable protectively encapsulated within a biocompatible resinous material such as epoxy or other synthetic material having the desired durability, sealing properties and inertness. The external second antenna  is in operative association with a microprocessor  which is energized by a suitable power source, which may be a suitable battery .","In general, the system, in a manner to be described hereinafter in detail, contemplates two-way communication employing current pulses traveling between the external second antenna  and the implanted first antenna  in either direction in synchronized fashion. The circuit components  may include sensors to obtain information for delivery to the external device and, where appropriate, actuators and other elements desired for the particular use. The present invention eliminates the need to rely on hard wired systems, transmitted energy as by light, sound, or RF and employs the biological tissue electric conductivity characteristics to carry current pulses which contain the desired information.","As shown in , a centerline of a standing human being has been identified as  with the dimension D between the outermost portion of the internal first antenna  and the innermost portion of the external second antenna  which will generally be in contact with skin  being designated by the letter \u201cD.\u201d In humans, it is presently preferred that the distance \u201cD\u201d be less than about 15 cm. In general, this dimensional preference will be adequate to employ an implanted device within the human brain, torso, or abdomen, as well as other portions of the body, and will be able to communicate with an external device with adequate signal strength for effective communication.","Referring to , there is illustrated a linear two-port network NR with two different connections. It will be seen that, in accordance with the reciprocity theorem these portions which are representative of the antennas ,  have port  providing a current source i at terminals -\u2032 which produces an open circuit voltage at -\u2032 of v. Similarly, port  has a current source i which is identical to that for port , but at terminals -\u2032 and produces an open circuit voltage at terminals -\u2032 of v\u2032. Under the reciprocity theorem, v=v\u2032 regardless of the topology within N. This means that the input and output of the system can be interchanged without altering the response of the system to a given waveform. In the present environment this means that reversing the transmission\/reception modes of the internal first volume conduction antenna  and the external second antenna  the received voltage will not vary. As a result, under the same excitation current, the volume conduction based data communication system produces the same output regardless of whether the information is flowing from the external device to the internal device or in the reverse direction.","Referring to , a preferred form of first volume conduction antenna of the present invention will be considered.","As shown in , the preferred first antenna  has a suitable electrical connection through wires ,  to other circuit components  (not shown in this view) and has a pair of concave shells ,  facing outwardly in generally opposed directions. Shells ,  have inner generally convex surfaces , , respectively, which in the form shown, are joined at . The shells are preferably made of a corrosion resistant metallic or nonmetallic electrically conductive material, such as a suitable metal such as stainless steel or brass, carbon or a conductive polymer, for example, and have on their convex surfaces ,  a coating of an electrically insulating material.","Referring to the prior art dipole construction shown in , a pair of electrical conductors ,  are positioned in relative spaced relationship and illustrate the current field exhibited by such construction. This shows that the majority of the current flux goes directly from the positive pole  to the negative pole , thereby providing a strong shorting current which not only wastes power, but also promotes tissue damages at the source site and other adverse effects which might interfere with a vital organ's activity, such as cardio-pulmonary, nervous or muscular functions. It is also noted that the use of far-field components of the antenna field, which contributes the transfer of information, is relatively weak.","While the individual shells ,  may be symmetrical, in the preferred form of the invention, the shells ,  are asymmetrical and have the upper portion which may be considered to be above the horizontal bisector between the lowermost portion and uppermost of the shell elongated with respect to the lower. This serves to provide the desired directional transmission.","Also shown in  is the fact that the generally x-shaped configuration of the antenna electrodes, combined with the insulators blocking short circuiting, force the current to flow around longer paths thereby increasing the far-field as the amount of current flowing through the conductor volume is the same in both . The flux lines of the upper portion, as represented by reference number  are longer than the flux lines of the lower portions .","The preferred antenna, as shown in , will preferably be employed solely in the implanted first volume conductive antenna  and not in the external second antenna . A comparison between the x-shaped electrode pair, as shown in , was made with the known dipole antenna as shown in , wherein both antennas had a width of 7 mm. In each instance, the transmitted sinesoidal current signal was 1 KHz and the received voltage signal by the external electrodes  cms from the internal electrodes was measured. The results are shown in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e1245","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"119pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Received","X-Shaped Volume Conductive",{}]},{"entry":["Signal","Antenna","Dipole Antenna"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Strength","Current","Voltage","Power","Current","Voltage","Power"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["0.05 mV","130 \u03bcA","20 mV","\u20031.3 \u03bcW","\u2002428 \u03bcA","\u2002600 mV","128.4 \u03bcW"]},{"entry":["\u20020.1 mV","242 \u03bcA","40 mV","\u20024.84 \u03bcW","\u2002762 \u03bcA","\u2002800 mV","304.8 \u03bcW"]},{"entry":["0.15 mV","393 \u03bcA","60 mV","11.79 \u03bcW","1133 \u03bcA","1000 mV","565.5 \u03bcW"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The first column shows the received signal strength in mV (peak value) for each three levels. The first column under each antenna heading indicates the required transmission current in \u03bcA (peak value), followed by the transmission voltage in mV (peak value) and power consumption in \u03bcW. It will be seen that for the same output, the new antenna required only about 30-35% of the transmission current, 3-6% of the transmission voltage and 1-2% of the power, as compared with the known prior design as shown in FIG. . These results confirm the fact that the present invention facilitates miniaturization, lower power consumption and longer battery life or the use of a smaller battery or other power source while preserving the desired communication efficiency.","Among the enhanced difficulties between the use of an internal device within a living patient and an external device effecting bi-directional communication therebetween are the fact that in a live biological body, there is a noisy environment due to the ongoing activity of heartbeat, arterial pulses and muscle activity, for example. Also, the internal and external devices must coordinate their data communication paths so as to provide for synchronized bidimensional communication while taking advantage of volume conduction characteristics of current pulse flow through live biological tissue. All of this must be accomplished employing an internal device which preferably is of small size, light weight and watertight.","A preferred way of accomplishing the foregoing in the present invention is to employ the electrocardiographic (ECG) signal as a clock for synchronization.","Referring to , a time frame reference moving horizontally from left to right is provided graphically. As will be appreciated in the description which follows, use of the cardiac ECG as a reference, combined with exchange between the internal device and the external device facilitate: (1) providing efficient communication; (2) eliminating the need for an external clock mechanism which synchronizes the activities of the implanted device and external device; and (3) maximizing signal-to-noise ratio and, in particular, minimizing the noisy effect created by the heart pumping and deformation of major arteries.","Referring to , there is shown in the uppermost portion, the sharp peaks designated R-waves and shown as \u201cR,\u201d with the delta symbol and two-spaced lines indicating that communication between the external device and internal device will not occur during that period. As a result of not communicating during the R-wave, this source of noise which has the potential to interfere with efficient communication between the external device and the internal device is avoided. Underlying the plot of the ECG are the plots of the external device and the implanted device. The initial Idle Phase has an R-wave followed by a positive pulse designated \u201cA\u201d which is transmitted by the external device to the implanted device during the idle phase. This current pulse is a request for the implanted device to transmit data. In response, a signal labeled \u201cB\u201d is sent by the implanted first antenna  to the external second antenna  () during the Active Phase. This transmission\/reception halts automatically after a certain predetermined period of time. If the data transmission has not been completed, a positive going pulse A is sent again upon the arrival of the next R-wave by the external device and the process repeats (not shown). If the external device would like to send commands or instructions to the internal device, a negative pulse, such as pulse \u201cC\u201d is sent by the external device during the Idle Phase after an R-wave. The implanted device then switches to the receiving mode and a signal wave labeled \u201cD\u201d is put on the channel by the external device during the quiescent period of the ECG in an Active Phase. It will be appreciated that the illustration in  is for conceptual purposes and in actual functioning the waveforms \u201cA,\u201d \u201cB,\u201d \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d would be modulated and well defined waveforms suitable for transmission through the communication channel to take advantage of the volume conduction.","The flow diagrams of FIGS. () and () illustrate schematically flow diagrams of ways in which the concepts of  may be implemented in achieving the objectives of the present invention. More specifically, in monitoring the heart involvement, the second antenna has a pair of body surface electrodes  which receive the ECG signals which are amplified at  and converted into a digital equivalent at analog-to-digital converter (A\/D) , followed by peak detection  delayed by the increment delta  and generation of signals \u201cA\u201d or \u201cC\u201d . The control signal is then introduced into the transmission\/reception antenna electrodes  which, depending upon whether it is signal \u201cB,\u201d meaning that it is the implanted device emitting the signal, or signal \u201cD,\u201d meaning that it is the external device emitting the signal, an appropriate position of control switch  will be employed. If it is signal \u201cB,\u201d there is amplification , analog-to-digital conversion , signal processing  in the microprocessor  (FIG. ), demodulation  and the emitted biological data  which has been communicated. With the signal \u201cD\u201d emitted by the external device with a command signal  passing through the digital logic shaping station , followed by modulation  and digital-to-analog conversion , amplification  and current drive which provides an appropriate amount of power to be emitted by the skin-surface external electrodes .","Referring now to FIG. () and the implanted device, the implanted antenna shown as  in  represented by  in FIG. () has a system control switch , which, depending upon which of the four signals in the example shown in  is being employed will be in an appropriate position. If the signal is \u201cA\u201d or \u201cC,\u201d it is amplified , is detected for a \u201cA\u201d or \u201cC\u201d , which is subjected to digital logic , which, after a desired delay , activates the switch . If the signal is \u201cA,\u201d biological data , after amplification , filtering  and modulation , all in analog form, are sent to the electrodes by current driver  for transmission through drive signal \u201cB.\u201d If the status is \u201cC,\u201d signal \u201cD\u201d is received from the electrodes , is amplified , demodulated  and is converted to appropriate digital form and processed by digital logic , after which the suitable commands\/instructions  are provided.","If desired, the system may be operated ignoring the peaks of the ECG for a specified number of R-waves. A further alternative would be to build a buffer and transmit each packet of data at a faster or slower rate than real-time, as desired for specific applications.","It will be appreciated that a central benefit of the present invention is the ability to transmit current pulses efficiently and synchronously through live biological tissues between implanted and external devices. The reduced size of the unit permits an encapsulated implantable device employing the benefits of microelectronic chips, for example, in the brain, torso, or abdomen or other portions of the body.","Referring to , examples of a preferred use in respect of the brain will be considered.","In this embodiment, the implanted device or electronic capsule  includes an electrically insulative material  interposed between the electrodes ,  of the first antenna. The implanted device is positioned on a flexible sheet , which may be plastic with an underlying plurality of subdural electrode contacts shown generally at , , , for example.","In this form of the implanted first antenna, a pair of outwardly concave electrodes ,  are separated by the large electrically insulating element  which may contain or have secured thereto first circuit components. Unlike the embodiment shown in  and , each electrode , , as viewed from an end such as perpendicular to electrode , for example, will appear to be generally rectangular.","The first antenna assembly may advantageously form part of an electronic chip which is encapsulated and implanted in the brain region between the skull and the brain. The flexible, transparent, thin plastic sheet  may be provided in a variety of sizes and shapes. Similar sheets are commercially available for subdural EEG recording during diagnosis of epilepsy. The connection lead and connector are removed so as to convert this system from wire transmission to wireless transmission. The first antenna electrode , , in the form illustrated, are altered in shape and size, but retain the beneficial properties of the type disclosed herein in  and . It will be appreciated that the structure of  may be used for diagnostic and monitoring functions as by recording subdural EEG and may also be used therapeutically in stimulating the brain. The implanted device  may contain amplifiers, modulators and internal data communication subsystem, and a power source. The first antenna electrodes , , in the form shown, are integrated with the implanted device  at the ends thereof. These electrodes are externally concave and may be covered with a gold foil to establish the two x-electrode surfaces.","The implantable device  with the integrated first antenna electrodes ,  preferably has a width of less than about 12 mm, a length of less than about 12 mm and a thickness of less than about 4 mm.","As shown in , the volume conduction first antenna , which has electrodes , , is a directional antenna with the emitted current pulses, as exemplified by lines , , being delivered generally in the direction of external second antenna electrodes , , which are in contact with the scalp. The plastic sheet  is flexible, thereby permitting it to be deformed freely to conform to the exterior shape of the cortex. In the case where the recording\/stimulation task will be performed within a sulcus, a smaller flexible sheet with thinner contacts would be utilized to facilitate insertion into the sulcus. A further alternative would be to use nanotube material to construct stimulation\/recording electrodes.","Among the advantages of the embodiment of  are the use of a relatively large surface area at each x-antenna electrode piece, thereby reducing the current density in brain tissue surrounding the antenna electrodes and improving electrical contact with the electrically conductive fluid within the brain. It also increases the efficiency of the transmitter because of the larger separation, which may be on the order of 12 mm between the two electrode surfaces. It further eliminates the need for a stand alone antenna electrodes, thereby reducing the size of the implantable device and facilitating placement during neurosurgery. Further, the flexible sheet  functions as a reflector which strengthens the current field in direction of reception and weakens the current flowing from and into the brain. This latter feature is important, as it reduces the undesired brain stimulation as the brain current shown in the dashed curve designated  is smaller than the current in the direction of transmission.","While, for purposes of illustration herein, focus has been placed upon use of the present invention in respect of brain, torso, and abdominal introduction of the implanted device, it will be appreciated that a wide number of applications wherein an implantable device can communicate information and receive information through the advantageous use of volume conduction may be employed.","It will be appreciated that the present invention may be used for diagnostic and monitoring functions, as well as for therapeutic activity. For example, obtaining information regarding brain functioning, such as EEG and therapeutic use through energizing the electrodes in deep-brain stimulation such as described in respect of , may be beneficially provided. Further, examples of utility are in epileptic seizure monitoring and intervention and bypassing brain signals to control limb movement for people with spinal cord injuries.","It will be appreciated, therefore, that the present invention provides a unique method and associated apparatus for efficiently having synchronized, two-way communication between an internal device and an external device through current pulse conduction through living biological tissues has been provided. The ionic fluid of biological tissue, such as cerebrospinal fluid, for example, is highly electrically conductive. Certain preferred features such as a highly efficient antenna which facilitates enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and directional delivery and receipt of signals are provided. In addition, certain noise reducing embodiments such as avoidance of the heart noise disturbances have also been provided.","Whereas particular embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, it will be evident to those skilled in the art that numerous variations may be made without departing from the invention as set forth in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00022","num":"00022"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00023","num":"00023"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00024","num":"00024"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00025","num":"00025"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00026","num":"00026"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00027","num":"00027"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00028","num":"00028"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00029","num":"00029"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00030","num":"00030"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},"FIGS.
