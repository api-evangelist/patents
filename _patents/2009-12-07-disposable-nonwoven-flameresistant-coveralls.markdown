No. 11\/638,040 filed Dec. 12, 2006 now abandoned. This Divisional Application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 120 to the filing date of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/638,040, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention is generally related to a non-woven, flame resistant fabric and coveralls made from such fabric.","2. Description of the Prior Art","Prior art combat uniform fabrics are woven from yarns made from a staple blend of cotton and nylon fiber. This fiber selection primarily supports dyeing and printing using a combination of acid and vat dyes to impart a camouflage pattern providing both visual and near infrared camouflage protection. This cotton and nylon fiber blend yarn, in combination with a lightweight, thin fabric construction, has consistently provided protection, comfort, durability, and UV resistance for U.S. military service personnel for more than twenty years. Many attempts were made to integrate flame and thermal protection into the aforementioned cotton and nylon fiber blend with little success. Such attempts to integrate flame and thermal protection into the this cotton and nylon fiber blend include fibers, fiber blends and functional finishes such as BASOFIL\u00ae flame resistant fiber, Flame Retardant Treated (FRT) cotton, FRT cotton\/nylon, FRT TENCEL\u00ae fibers, FRT cotton\/KEVLAR\u00ae para-aramid synthetic fiber\/nylon, carbonized rayon\/NOMEX\u00ae meta-aramid synthetic fiber, KEVLAR\u00ae para-aramid synthetic fiber\/FR rayon, NOMEX\u00ae meta-aramid synthetic fiber\/FR rayon, PBI\u00ae polybenzimidazole fiber and PBI\u00ae polybenzimidazole fiber\/FRT cotton. However, many of the inherently flame resistant fibers were eliminated for use in a homogeneous fabric due to their high cost and the requirement for visual and near infrared camouflage. The high polymer orientation of the aramids and PBI, for example, contributes to their flame resistance, but also reduces or eliminates their ability to be dyed with traditional dyestuffs due to the lack of chemical dye sites. Some of these materials may achieve coloration by pigment injection in solution form, but their versatility is limited. Aramid blends are dyed and camouflage-printed using proprietary technology that significantly increases the final cost of the finished fabric. Still prized for their inherent flame resistance, some of these fibers were blended with low cost fibers to enhance the overall flame resistance of the fabric. Flame retardant rayon, which is inherently flame resistant rather than flame retardant treated, was blended with the aramids in 60\/40 and 35\/65 percent blend ratios, but these materials fell short of the desired fabric strength and the camouflage print demonstrated poor colorfastness.","Another prior art fiber is flame-retardant cotton. Flame-retardant treated cotton has long been the industry standard for use in low cost flame resistant industrial work wear. However, the most commonly used flame-retardant treated cotton, INDURA\u00ae flame retardant treated cotton fabrics, adds 20 percent to the weight of the fabric. Flame-retardant treated cotton was blended with nylon in 88\/12 percent blend ratios, wherein the nylon was added to improve strength. While the addition of the nylon did not negatively impact the flame resistance, a heavier weight fabric of 11 ounces\/yard was required to achieve relatively acceptable breaking and tearing strengths. Flame-retardant treated cotton was also blended with KEVLAR\u00ae para-aramid synthetic fiber consisting of poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide and nylon to enhance flame resistance and improve abrasion resistance in a 58\/27\/15 percent blend ratio. While the KEVLAR\u00ae synthetic fiber was the strongest of the three fibers, it occupied less than 50 percent of the total material composition to reduce costs and therefore, the strength of the fabric was determined by the lower strength cotton. In addition, the high end and pick count required to anchor the KEVLAR\u00ae synthetic fiber detrimentally reduced the fabric tearing strength to three pounds in the warp and filling directions. PBI\u00ae polybenzimidazole fiber was blended with flame-retardant treated cotton in 20\/80 percent blend ratio in 5.0 and 6.6 ounce\/yardweights, however, the performance characteristics were reflective of the predominate fiber, which was, cotton.","BASOFIL\u00ae non-woven fabric fiber demonstrated low fiber tenacity and corresponding developmental efforts were directed toward insulation, knitted headwear and hand wear applications wherein high strength was not a critical factor. Blends of carbonized rayon and NOMEX\u00ae synthetic fiber consisting of aromatic polyamide polymer were also investigated and, while they demonstrated good strength performance, they could not be dyed and camouflage printed. Flame-retardant treated TENCEL\u00ae fibers demonstrated good strength but the camouflage print design demonstrated poor colorfastness performance.","Core spun yarns were also investigated and developed with the primary intent of manufacturing a yarn that has a high strength, inherently flame resistant core, and low cost readily camouflage printable sheath fiber. The best performing material combination was a cotton sheath, KEVLAR\u00ae synthetic fiber core yarn. However, these materials did not achieve the required strength because only the KEVLAR\u00ae synthetic fiber core and not the sheath contributed to the fabric strength.","While all of the developmental materials investigated met the fabric flame resistance goals (ASTM D 6413; 2.0 seconds, maximum after flame; 25.0 seconds, maximum after glow; 4.0 inches maximum char length), these materials did not achieve the required strength and other performance requirements such as colorfastness of the camouflage print design.","What is needed is a new and improved non-woven, flame resistant garment.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a non-woven, flame resistant garment.","It is another object of the present invention that the aforesaid non-woven, flame resistant garment be disposable.","It is a further object of the present invention that the aforesaid non-woven, flame resistant garment be configured as coveralls that can be worn over regular clothing.","It is yet another object of the present invention that the aforesaid non-woven, flame resistant garment can be manufactured at reasonable cost.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the ensuing description and the accompanying drawings.","Thus, the present invention is directed to a non-woven, flame resistant fabric and disposable coveralls made from this fabric.","In a preferred embodiment, the non-woven, flame resistant fabric of the present invention is made from a plurality of NOMEX\u00ae synthetic fibers, a plurality of KEVLAR\u00ae synthetic fibers, and a plurality of electrostatic dissipative fibers.","The non-woven, flame-resistant coveralls of the present invention provide flame and thermal protection and can be manufactured at relatively low per-unit cost. The coveralls can be quickly deployed and significantly improve the survivability of the individual soldier. In a preferred embodiment, the coveralls have an upper section for covering the shoulder, chest, back and abdominal regions of a wearer. The upper section has long sleeves to cover the arms of the wearer and a collar to cover the neck region of wearer. Each long sleeve has a corresponding elbow section. The coverall also has a waist section for covering the waist region of a wearer, and a pair of leg sections for covering the legs of the wearer. Each leg section has an upper portion contiguous with the waist section. Each leg section also has a corresponding knee portion. The coveralls also have a seat section contiguous with the waist section and the upper portions of the leg sections. The coveralls have a two-way zipper extending from the collar section to the waist section. The coveralls include a flap that covers the zipper. In a preferred embodiment, the fabric forming the waist and seat sections has a degree of elasticity. In a preferred embodiment, the coveralls include at least one pocket that is formed with the fabric and is attached to the waist section. The coveralls include pass-through openings or slits under the pocket to provide access to undergarments. In a preferred embodiment, the coveralls include seat patches, knee patches and elbow patches all made from the fabric of the present invention. The seat patch is attached to and covers the seat section. Each knee patch covers a corresponding knee portion. Each elbow patch covers a corresponding elbow portion. In a preferred embodiment, each leg section has an ankle portion that has a degree of elasticity and each long sleeve has a wrist portion that has a degree of elasticity.","Although the fabric and coveralls of the present invention are discussed in terms of military applications, it is to be understood that the aforesaid fabric and coveralls may be used in non-military applications such as firefighting, law enforcement, auto-racing, aviation, search and rescue, and hazardous materials clean-up.","Referring to , there is shown fabric  in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Fabric  generally comprises a blend of aramid and electrostatic dissipative fibers. Specifically, fabric  comprises a blend of KEVLAR\u00ae synthetic fibers  NOMEX\u00ae synthetic fibers  and electrostatic dissipative fibers .

The aforesaid X-STATIC\u00ae synthetic fiber is a fiber having a layer of silver that is coated over the surface thereof. Sauquoit Industries, of Scranton, Pa., manufactures X-STATIC\u00ae synthetic fibers and markets such fibers under the X-STATIC I\u00ae and X-STATIC II\u00ae synthetic fibers trademarks. Additional electrostatic fiber is INVISTA\u00ae fabric P-140, which has a carbon core and nylon sheath.","In a preferred embodiment, fabric  is made through a non-woven process called spun-lacing. It has been found that spun-lacing provides fabric  that is low cost, lightweight, and air permeable. However, it is to be understood that other non-woven techniques may be used to manufacture fabric  such as needle punching, thermal bonding, spun-bonding, etc. In one embodiment, fabric  is camouflage printed with a pigment printing technique. Alternatively, fabric  may be colored through the use of producer-colored fiber. Other suitable printing techniques may be used as well. In one embodiment, fabric  may be subsequently treated with a water repellant treatment, an oil repellant treatment and\/or an insect resistant treatment. In another embodiment an electrostatic dissipative surface treatment or humectant may be used in addition to an electrostatic dissipative fiber or in place of one. Such treatments are known in the art. Thus, fabric  is relatively light in weight and is manufactured by a relatively low-cost, non-woven process.","Referring to , there is shown coveralls  that are made from fabric  in accordance with the invention. Thus, coverall  has multi-functional characteristics including flame protection, camouflage, and electrostatic dissipation. Coverall  has upper section  for covering the shoulder, chest, back and abdominal regions of a wearer. Upper section  has long sleeve , which has elbow portion , and long sleeve , which has elbow portion , to cover the arms of the wearer. Coverall  includes collar  to cover the neck region of wearer. Coverall  has waist section  that is contiguous with upper section  for covering the waist region of a wearer, and a pair of leg sections  and  for covering the legs of the wearer. Each leg section  and  has upper portions  and , respectively, which are contiguous with waist section . Leg sections  and  have knee portions  and , respectively. Coverall  also has seat section  contiguous with waist section  and upper portions  and  of leg sections  and , respectively. Coverall  has two-way zipper  (shown in phantom) extending from collar section  to waist section . In a preferred embodiment, two-way zipper  is a two-way black-oxidized brass zipper. In an alternate embodiment, two-way zipper  is a plastic zipper. Coveralls  include flap  that covers two-way zipper . Flap  is made from fabric . In a preferred embodiment, waist section  and seat section  have a degree of elasticity. In a preferred embodiment, coveralls  includes pockets  and  that are attached to waist section . Pockets  and  are formed with fabric . Coveralls  include slits, or openings, A and B (shown in phantom) that are underneath pockets  and , respectively. Slits A and B allow the user access to the undergarments that are worn under coveralls . In one embodiment, coverall  includes seat patch  that is attached to and covers seat section  (see ). Seat patch  is made from fabric . Coverall  includes knee patches  and  that are attached to and cover knee portions  and , respectively. Knee portions  and  are made from fabric . Coverall  includes elbow patches  and  that are attached to and cover elbow portions  and , respectively. Elbow patches  and  are made from fabric . Leg sections  and  have ankle portions  and , respectively, which preferably have a degree of elasticity. Long sleeves  and  have wrist portions  and , respectively, which preferably have a degree of elasticity.","The design and construction of coverall  is relatively less complex than many prior art flame-resistant garments. Coveralls  can be configured to have any one of plurality of sizes to accommodate wearers of different sizes. Coveralls  can be configured to have more than two pockets or just one pocket.","The present invention provides many advantages. Since fabric  is light in weight, has a relatively simple construction, made with a low-cost non-woven method, and printed with a low-cost camouflage printing technique, coverall  is intended to be disposable. Testing has shown that coverall  can be worn and laundered approximately 10 times. Due to the coverall's light weight and air-permeable construction, coverall  can be worn over the other clothing such as an ACU (Army Combat Uniform). Thus, coverall  may be carried with the soldier and donned over existing clothing to provide quick, low cost, flame and thermal protection. The flame resistant NOMEX\u00ae synthetic fiber and KEVLAR\u00ae synthetic fiber blend of fabric  provides ignition resistance. Furthermore, the thickness of coverall  and the wearer's underclothes provides thermal protection through insulation. Instrumented manikin testing has demonstrated that coverall  reduces overall body burn from about 88.0% to 8.0% when coverall  is worn over the Hot Weather BDU (Battledress Uniform). Additional testing of coverall  established safe exposure limits up to 5 seconds.","Thus, the use of non-woven, flame-resistant coveralls  over inner, flammable clothing provides a clothing system having flame and thermal protection. Coveralls  can be colored in any desirable color and can be configured with a military camouflage pattern using any one of known suitable techniques. The elasticized seat and waist sections and elasticized wrist and ankle portions provides a close fit and maximum flame protection. The reinforcement elbow, seat and knee patches provide additional protection for the corresponding elbow, buttocks and knees, respectively, of a wearer.","Coveralls  of the present invention provide a significant advantage in the military scenario. Specifically, coverall  can be donned over any combat uniform when a flame and thermal threat or hazard is anticipated. In hot environments, coveralls  can be worn over long underwear rather than a combat uniform. Once the threat is diminished or removed, coverall  can be removed. Depending on the inner clothing over which coveralls  are worn, coveralls  provide a cost savings of anywhere from 48%-88% when compared to the cost of the currently available Aircrew Battledress Uniform. Coveralls  may be treated with water, oil and insect repellant treatments. Specifically, water, oil and insect repellants can be applied as functional finishes to the fabric. Other suitable treatments include fluro-chemical based water\/oil finishes, and permethrin insect repellants.","The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description only. It is neither intended to be exhaustive nor to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed; and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. Such modifications and variations that may be apparent to a person skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined by the accompanying claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The foregoing features of the present invention will become more readily apparent and may be understood by referring to the following detailed description of an illustrative embodiment of the present invention, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
