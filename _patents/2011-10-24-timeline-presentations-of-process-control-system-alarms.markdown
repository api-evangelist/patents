{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates generally to process control systems and, more particularly, to timeline presentations of process control system alarms.","Process control systems, like those used in chemical, petroleum or other processes, typically include one or more process controllers communicatively coupled to one or more field devices via analog, digital or combined analog\/digital buses. The field devices, which may be, for example, valves, valve positioners, switches and transmitters (e.g., temperature, pressure and flow rate sensors), perform process control functions within the process such as opening or closing valves and measuring process control parameters. The process controllers receive signals indicative of process measurements made by the field devices and then process this information to generate control signals to implement control routines, to make other process control decisions, and to initiate process control system alarms.","Information from the field devices and\/or the controller is usually made available over a data highway or communication network to one or more other hardware devices, such as operator workstations, personal computers, data historians, report generators, centralized databases, etc. Such devices are typically located in control rooms and\/or other locations remotely situated relative to the harsher plant environment. These hardware devices, for example, run applications that enable an operator to perform any of a variety of functions with respect to the process of a process control system, such as viewing the current state of the process, changing an operating state, changing settings of a process control routine, modifying the operation of the process controllers and\/or the field devices, viewing alarms generated by field devices and\/or process controllers, simulating the operation of the process for the purpose of training personnel and\/or evaluating the process, etc.","These hardware devices typically include one or more operator interface displays to display pertinent information regarding the operating state(s) of the control system(s) and\/or the devices within the control system. Example displays take the form of alarming displays that receive and\/or display alarms generated by controllers or devices within the process control system, control displays that indicate the operating state(s) of the controller(s) and other device(s) within the process control system, etc.","In a process control system it is common for thousands of alarms to be defined within the process control system to notify operators of the process control system of potential problems. Alarms are defined, for example, to protect people and\/or equipment, to avoid environmental incidents, and\/or to ensure product quality during production. Each alarm is typically defined by one or more settings (e.g., an alarm limit) that define when a problem has occurred and\/or trigger the alarm, and a priority (e.g., critical or warning) to define the importance of the alarm relative to other alarms.","Typically, alarms are presented (e.g., displayed) to operators in list or tabular format. In such formats, each alarm is presented as a single line in the list with specific data that may be relevant to inform an operator of the state of the control system. Data provided in an alarm list may include, for example, a description of the alarm, the time the alarm was triggered, the source of the alarm, the importance or priority of the alarm, the state of the alarm (e.g., acknowledged or not, active or not), the parameter that triggered the alarm, the value of the parameter, etc. As information is received from process controllers and\/or field devices, the alarm list data may be updated in real time to allow the operators access to current information regarding all active alarms.","Methods and apparatus to present a timeline presentation of process control system alarms are disclosed. In one example, an operator interface apparatus for a process control system includes an operator display module to present an operator application on a display. The operator interface also includes an alarm presentation interface to be presented on the display via the operator application. The alarm presentation interface includes a timeline to graphically indicate a temporal relationship of a plurality of active alarms of the process control system.","In another example, a method involves receiving new and\/or updated alarm data; modifying the timeline based on the alarm data; and displaying the modified timeline via an operator interface.","It is not uncommon for process control system operators to be faced with multiple alarms at any given moment. While an operator may be able to adequately manage up to five alarms in a ten minute period comfortably, exceeding that rate of alarms can become overwhelming. When many alarms are triggered in a small timeframe, commonly referred to as an alarm flood, the resulting amount of information may exceed an operator's capacity to analyze and respond effectively to the alarms.","Additionally, because alarms typically are presented in list format, the operator is unlikely to grasp the entire situation quickly. For example, the number of alarms may exceed the vertical space provided for the alarm list, thereby requiring the operator to scroll through the list or otherwise sort and\/or filter the alarm list to review all the alarms. This task is often complicated by the fact that alarm data is typically updated in real time. Thus, if an alarm clears or changes state, or additional alarms are triggered, the operator may miss one or more of these changes. The only way to avoid this is for the operator to repeatedly and frequently reread the list of alarm information, thereby sacrificing precious time to address the alarm flood and avoid a potentially significant process control system failure.","Furthermore, it is common for a particular circumstance and\/or state of a process control system to result in a cascade of predictable alarms, often being tripped in a predictable order. The initial circumstance and\/or state of the process control system that causes such a series of alarms is referred to as a root cause. The faster operators are able to identify a root cause of an alarm flood, the faster they are able to take necessary actions to correct any errors, thereby minimizing the effects of a process control system failure. As such, special operator training may be required for predetermined high-consequence abnormal process conditions, where operators are expected to recognize expected alarm activation patterns (e.g., order of occurrence and spacing). However, operators, equipped only with an alarm list that is sorted and\/or filtered while the data itself is changing, are unlikely to recognize the relationships of the alarms to identify the common pattern and root cause.","Accordingly, the examples described herein may be used to display a timeline, in conjunction with but independent of an alarm list, to graphically indicate an overall state of a process control system by populating the timeline with icons representing each of the alarms currently active in the process control system. The priority of each alarm is represented by the shape and color of the corresponding icon. Also, each alarm may be shifted incrementally along a defined scale of the timeline to preserve the temporal relationship of the active alarms to enable the operator to recognize patterns and determine the causal relations of alarms during an alarm flood and\/or at other times. To avoid scrolling back and forth along the timeline to alarms that may be from the distant past, the examples described herein enable the timeline to be divided into separate time spans where the scale of each span is different and can be spatially adjusted relative to each other across the display of the operator interface, thereby enabling the operator to quickly perceive all active alarms regardless of how many alarms are active.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","102","104","106","102","104","106","108"]},"The example operator station  of  allows an operator to review and\/or operate one or more operator display screens and\/or applications that enable the operator to view process control system variables, view process control system states, view process control system conditions, view process control system alarms, and\/or change process control system settings (e.g., set points, operating states, clear alarms, silence alarms, etc.). An example manner of implementing the example operator station  of  is described below in connection with . Example operator display applications that may be used to implement the example operator station  are described below in connection with .","The example operator station  includes and\/or implements an alarm presentation interface (e.g., the example alarm presentation interface of ) to graphically display all active alarms in a timeline to allow process control system operators to visually perceive the temporal relationships of the alarms, as well as state changes and\/or manual control actions. The alarm presentation interface also provides summary graphics based on aggregated data for all active alarms to provide operators a quick and intuitive means of acquiring an overall understanding of the state of the processing control system and assess relationships between different alarms. Furthermore, the alarm presentation interface enables the creation of traditional alarm lists populated by alarms selected from the alarm presentation interface. An additional aspect of the example operator station  of  includes capturing the timeline in memory to be replayed for training (e.g., to learn to recognize noteworthy alarm patterns) and\/or to conduct post-mortem investigations.","The example workstation  of  may be configured as an application station to perform one or more information technology applications, user-interactive applications and\/or communication applications. For example, the application station  may be configured to perform primarily process control-related applications, while another application station (not shown) may be configured to perform primarily communication applications that enable the process control system  to communicate with other devices or systems using any desired communication media (e.g., wireless, hardwired, etc.) and protocols (e.g., HTTP, SOAP, etc.). The example operator station  and the example workstation  of  may be implemented using one or more workstations and\/or any other suitable computer systems and\/or processing systems. For example, the operator station  and\/or workstation  could be implemented using single processor personal computers, single or multi-processor workstations, etc.","The example LAN  of  may be implemented using any desired communication medium and protocol. For example, the example LAN  may be based on a hardwired and\/or wireless Ethernet communication scheme. However, as will be readily appreciated by those having ordinary skill in the art, any other suitable communication medium(s) and\/or protocol(s) could be used. Further, although a single LAN  is illustrated in , more than one LAN and\/or other alternative pieces of communication hardware may be used to provide redundant communication paths between the example systems of .","The example controller  of  is coupled to a plurality of smart field devices ,  and  via a digital data bus  and an input\/output (I\/O) gateway . The smart field devices , , and  may be Fieldbus compliant valves, actuators, sensors, etc., in which case the smart field devices , , and  communicate via the digital data bus  using the well-known Foundation Fieldbus protocol. Of course, other types of smart field devices and communication protocols could be used instead. For example, the smart field devices , , and  could instead be Profibus and\/or HART compliant devices that communicate via the data bus  using the well-known Profibus and HART communication protocols. Additional I\/O devices (similar and\/or identical to the I\/O gateway  may be coupled to the controller  to enable additional groups of smart field devices, which may be Foundation Fieldbus devices, HART devices, etc., to communicate with the controller .","In addition to the example smart field devices , , and , one or more non-smart field devices  and  may be communicatively coupled to the example controller . The example non-smart field devices  and  of  may be, for example, conventional 4-20 milliamp (mA) or 0-10 volts direct current (VDC) devices that communicate with the controller  via respective hardwired links.","The example controller  of  may be, for example, a DeltaV\u2122 controller sold by Fisher-Rosemount Systems, Inc., an Emerson Process Management company. However, any other controller could be used instead. Further, while only one controller  is shown in , additional controllers and\/or process control platforms of any desired type and\/or combination of types could be coupled to the LAN . In any case, the example controller  performs one or more process control routines associated with the process control system  that have been generated by a system engineer and\/or other system operator using the operator station  and which have been downloaded to and\/or instantiated in the controller .","While  illustrates an example process control system  within which the methods and apparatus to control information presented to process control system operators described in greater detail below may be advantageously employed, persons of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that the methods and apparatus to control information presented to operators described herein may, if desired, be advantageously employed in other process plants and\/or process control systems of greater or less complexity (e.g., having more than one controller, across more than one geographic location, etc.) than the illustrated example of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["104","104","200","200","202","200","200","200","204","206","208","210","204","202","200","200"]},"To allow an operator to interact with the example processor , the example operator station  of  includes any type of display . Example displays  include, but are not limited to, a computer monitor, a computer screen, a television, a mobile device (e.g., a smart phone, a Blackberry\u2122 and\/or an iPhone\u2122), etc. capable to display user interfaces and\/or applications implemented by the processor  and\/or, more generally, the example operator station .","The example operating system  of  displays and\/or facilitates the display of application user interfaces (e.g., the alarm presentation user interface ) by and\/or at the example display . To facilitate operator interactions with applications implemented by the example operator station , the example operating system  implements an application programming interface (API) by which the example operator display module  can define and\/or select the alarm presentation interface  via the operator application , and cause and\/or instruct the operating system  to display the defined and\/or selected alarm presentation interface . An example alarm presentation interface  is described below in connection with .","To present process control system operator displays and\/or applications, the example operator station  of  includes the example operator display module . The example operator display module  of  collects alarm data and\/or information from one or more process controllers (e.g., the example controller  of ) and\/or other elements of a process control system, and uses the collected alarm data and\/or information to create and\/or define a particular alarm presentation interface  (e.g., the example alarm presentation interface of ) via the operator application . The created and\/or defined display is displayed at the example display  by and\/or via the example operating system . The example operator display module  also receives operator inputs via the alarm presentation interface  (e.g., in response to the operator selecting, adjusting and\/or operating elements of the alarm presentation interface ) to update the alarm presentation interface  via the operator application .","While an example manner of implementing the example operator station  of  has been illustrated in , the data structures, elements, processes and devices illustrated in  may be combined, divided, re-arranged, omitted, eliminated and\/or implemented in any other way. Further, the example operating system , the example operator display module , the example alarm presentation interface , and\/or, more generally, the example operator station  of  may be implemented by hardware, software, firmware and\/or any combination of hardware, software and\/or firmware. Further still, the example operator station  may include additional elements, processes and\/or devices instead of, or in addition to, those illustrated in , and\/or may include more than one of any or all of the illustrated data structures, elements, processes and devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3C","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","104","300","302","304","302","304","306","302","302","308","304","308","302","304","308"]},"Some alarms may remain unresolved for extended periods of time (i.e., a stale alarm). Thus, in order to display all alarms on the alarm presentation interface  without requiring horizontal scrolling, the timeline  is separated into multiple time spans , , , and . Each of the time spans , , and  has a corresponding timescale. In this example, the first time span  has a timescale  spanning from 0 to 60 seconds in 5 second increments, the second time span  has a timescale  spanning from 0 to 60 minutes in 1 minute increments, and the third time span  has a timescale  spanning from 0 to 24 hours in 1 hour increments. As such, when multiple alarms are triggered within a single minute, the corresponding alarm icons  are temporally spaced apart as they shift across the timeline  in 5 second increments in the columns  of the first time span  based on the time at which each alarm was triggered. After a minute passes, the alarm icons  shift left into the second time span  and are stacked within the right most column  of the second time span . The alarm icons  are all within one column of the second time span  because the corresponding alarms all occurred within a single minute and each column in the second time span  corresponds to one minute. The alarm icons  continue shifting left as a cluster (i.e., stacked in a single column) until reaching the right most column  of the third time span , where they are grouped with all alarms triggered within the same one hour increment.","The fourth time span  does not have a timescale. Rather, the fourth time span  is labeled \u201cold,\u201d and provides a location for all alarms more than 24 hours old (e.g., stale alarms) to be displayed in the example alarm presentation interface . As such, all alarms that remain active for over 24 hours are restacked in the left most columns  of the timeline  to allow all active alarms to remain on the timeline  without the need for horizontal scrolling.","Between each of the example time spans , , , and  an adjustable boundary  is provided to enable an operator to adjust the widths of each of the time spans , , , and  by clicking on and moving (e.g., using a mouse or any other device) the adjustable boundary  horizontally to space alarms in a particular time span as needed. However, while an operator may adjust the boundaries  for each time span , , , and , a minimum width may be set for each time span , , , and  so that visibility remains for all alarms, even when packed tightly together.","In addition to the alarm icons  on the timeline  indicating the temporal relationship of all alarms, the alarm icons  also vary by shape and color to indicate alarm priority (e.g., red squares for critical alarms and yellow triangles for warnings). Further, the alarm icons  may blink or otherwise vary in appearance (e.g., intensity, size, shape, etc.) to indicate when a particular alarm has not yet been acknowledged. If unacknowledged alarms become inactive, the corresponding alarm icons  have a modified appearance. If alarms are acknowledged and become inactive, the corresponding alarm icons  are removed from the timeline . Any remaining alarm icons  retain their vertical positions within each of the columns  and their relative temporal positions along the timeline .","The example alarm presentation interface  of  also includes a system changes bar  located above the timeline . The example system changes bar  may contain flags  representative of manual control actions, such as, SP\u2014a setpoint change, MD\u2014a mode change, OU\u2014an output change, PR\u2014a parameter change, and MD\u2014a manual change (e.g., an outside operator action as reported by Syncade\u2122 software, sold by Emerson Process Management). The flags  are also presented for UN\u2014a unit state transition such as a transition from \u201cidle\u201d to \u201crunning.\u201d The flags  are placed in the system changes bar  and graphically linked to the timeline , thereby enabling an operator to visually perceive the temporal relationships of manual control actions and\/or unit state changes to the alarms represented by alarm icons  on the timeline . In this manner, operators can graphically determine whether some of the most common alarm contributors (i.e., manual control actions and process state changes) are a root cause of one or more alarms without having to spend time checking an event log.","There may be circumstances where operators desire to see additional information regarding specific alarms represented in the timeline . As such, the example alarm presentation interface  enables operators to mouse hover over an alarm icon  or a flag  to cause additional information to pop up in, for example, a magnifying glass view. Operators may also access additional alarm information by transferring alarms displayed on timeline  into an optional alarm list  to display additional information in tabular form located below the timeline . The alarms included in the alarm list  may be selected individually by clicking on the corresponding alarm icons  in the timeline , or may be selected in mass through marquee mouse controls (e.g., clicking and dragging the mouse to form a rectangular box around the desired alarm icons ). The example alarm presentation interface  also enables operators to populate the alarm list  with all active alarms with a single mouse click. Similarly, when operators are finished reviewing a particular alarm list, the list can be cleared with a single mouse click and the example alarm presentation interface  set to build a new list.","Once the alarm list  is populated with the desired alarms, operators can sort and filter the alarm list . However, any sorting or working with the data in the alarm list  does not affect the temporal relationships and patterns of the alarms preserved in the timeline . However, the alarm list  does interact with the timeline . For example, when one or more alarms are selected in the alarm list  (e.g., by highlighting the alarm(s)), the corresponding icons  within the timeline  are visually distinguished (e.g., by highlighting, enlarging, etc.) to allow rapid identification of the selected alarms in the timeline .","In addition to selecting multiple alarms to populate the alarm list  described above, the example alarm presentation interface  allows for other in-context actions to be taken by an operator for one or multiple alarms such as acknowledging or shelving the selected alarms. Moreover, the in-context action capability of the alarm presentation interface  is able to recognize which actions are allowed for the selected alarms and preventing improper actions from being taken.","Also illustrated in  is an alarm distribution sidebar  that provides summary graphics  based on aggregated data that groups all active alarms into distribution charts based on certain characteristics. For example, the summary graphics  may include distributions of alarms by priority, area, batch number, physical location, etc. In this way, an operator can assess the overall state of the process control system with a single glance at the alarm presentation interface . All alarms sharing a common characteristic within one of the summary graphics  can be mass transferred to the alarm list  by clicking on that portion of the summary graphic . For example, clicking on a critical priority segment  of an alarm priority distribution bar chart  puts all critical alarms into the alarm list  with additional information corresponding to those alarms.","In addition to the foregoing, the example alarm presentation interface  also allows abnormal indications to be temporarily overlaid (i.e., ghosted) on top of the timeline . The abnormal indications include: suppressed alarm activation, interlock activation, bypass activation, permission deactivation, device alert activation, and system hardware alert activation to check for further indications of a root cause.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["104","2","502"]},"Alternatively, some or all of the example operations of  may be implemented using any combination(s) of application specific integrated circuit(s) (ASIC(s)), programmable logic device(s) (PLD(s)), field programmable logic device(s) (FPLD(s)), discrete logic, hardware, firmware, etc. Also, one or more of the operations depicted in  may be implemented manually or as any combination of any of the foregoing techniques, for example, any combination of firmware, software, discrete logic and\/or hardware. Further, although the example process of  is described with reference to the flowchart of , persons of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that many other methods of implementing the example process of  may be employed. For example, the order of execution of the blocks may be changed, and\/or some of the blocks described may be changed, eliminated, sub-divided, or combined. Additionally, persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that any or all of the example operations of  may be carried out sequentially and\/or carried out in parallel by, for example, separate processing threads, processors, devices, discrete logic, circuits, etc.","The process of  begins at block  with an operator station (e.g., the example operator station  of ) running an operator display module (e.g., the example operator display module ) to display an alarm presentation interface (e.g., the example alarm presentation interface ) at block .
