{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under government contract No. N00019-04-C0093 awarded by the Department of Defense. The government has certain rights to this invention.","1. Technical Field","This invention relates to aircraft gas turbine engines and, particularly, to borescope inspection ports on gas turbine engines.","2. Background Information","Borescope inspection ports are commonly used on aircraft gas turbine engines. Borescope ports allow visual inspection of internal aircraft engine flowpath hardware with a fiber optic borescope. These borescope ports make possible frequent engine inspections that otherwise could not be performed without disassembly of the aircraft engine. This allows increased engine usage between overhaul and, thus, lowers aircraft engine operating costs. During engine operation, borescope plugs are used to close the inspection ports on the engine and prevent the escape of high pressure engine gases. Conventional borescope plugs typically close an outer port through an engine casing and seals a flowpath structure such as a turbine blade shroud at an inner port. A spring loaded plunger seals against the inner port. A bolt head is provided for assembling and disassembling the plug from a threaded mount on the engine casing.","Borescope plugs are used to plug the inspection ports used during borescope inspections of hot sections of the engine such as the high pressure turbine (HPT). An exemplary borescope plug and inspection ports are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,815,276 and incorporated herein by reference. The plugs have to endure the harsh environment near the hot turbine flowpath, while being made out of less capable materials than other parts near the flowpath in the HPT. Since the plug does not extend all the way to the flowpath, a cavity is formed in the port below or radially inward of the plug. This cavity entraps hot flowpath air resulting in high metal temperatures on the port walls and a tip of the plug. Overheating of the port and the tip due to stagnating hot air entrapped by the cavity can cause premature deterioration of the port and the tip requiring expensive repairs. Thus, it is highly desirable to have to provide low cost and effective cooling of both the plug tip and the port.","A coolable element having opposite first and second sides and a coolable borescope boss extending away from the second side. A boss hole extends through the boss and terminates at a hole exit flush with a first outer surface of the first side. Cooling passages extending through the boss are oriented for spraying cooling air into the boss hole. An exemplary embodiment of the cooling passages are oriented for the spraying cooling air towards a boss hole axis of the boss hole. Centerlines of the cooling passages may intersect the boss hole axis. An exemplary embodiment of the coolable element includes a conical boss chamfer in the boss around an entrance to the boss hole.","Another exemplary embodiment of the coolable element includes a cylindrical cavity surface between the hole exit and a chamfer inner end of a boss chamfer in the coolable borescope boss around an entrance to the boss hole. The cooling passages have a first portion of the cooling passages having a first portion of cooling inlets in a boss outer surface of the coolable borescope boss radially outward of or above the coolable surface, a second portion of the cooling passages having a second portion cooling inlets in the coolable surface, and the cooling passages having cooling outlets at least partially disposed in the cylindrical cavity surface. Two exemplary embodiments of the cooling passages are cylindrical and open slots disposed through the boss. The open slots may extend through and into the boss from a continuous outer surface of the coolable borescope boss. The continuous outer surface includes a top surface of the boss surrounding the entrance to the boss hole, the boss outer surface of the boss, an outer surface of the boss chamfer, and the cylindrical cavity surface. The boss chamfer and the outer surface of the boss chamfer may be conical.","The coolable element may be a coolable gas turbine engine arcuate shroud segment circumscribed about an axial centerline axis and having opposite first and second sides. The coolable borescope boss extends away from the second side and has a boss hole extending through the coolable borescope boss and terminating at a hole exit flush with a first outer surface of the first side. The cooling passages extend through the boss and are oriented for spraying cooling air into the boss hole. One exemplary embodiment of the segment has cylindrical segment first and second sections and a conical segment midsection therebetween and the hole exit is flush with the conical segment midsection.","An annular segmented turbine shroud assembly having an annular segmented turbine shroud circumscribed about an axial centerline axis includes a plurality of shroud segments. At least one of the shroud segments having opposite first and second sides also includes the coolable borescope boss extending away from the second side. The boss hole extends through the coolable borescope boss and terminates at a hole exit flush with a first outer surface of the first side. The cooling passages extend through the coolable borescope boss and are oriented for spraying cooling air into the boss hole. A borescope plug includes a plug body and a plunger having a tip. The tip has a spherical tip chamfer sealing against the boss chamfer.","The coolable boss may be incorporated in a turbine assembly having high and low pressure turbines including the annular segmented turbine shroud circumscribed about the axial centerline axis and having a plurality of shroud segments. The shroud includes cylindrical shroud first and second sections and a conical shroud midsection therebetween. The cylindrical shroud first section surrounds a high pressure turbine and the cylindrical shroud second section surrounds a low pressure turbine first stage.","Illustrated in  is an exemplary turbofan gas turbine engine  for powering an aircraft (not shown) in flight. The engine  is axisymmetrical about a longitudinal or axial centerline axis  and has a fan section  upstream of a core engine . The core engine  includes, in serial downstream flow communication, a multistage axial high pressure compressor , an annular combustor , and a single stage high pressure turbine  suitably joined to the high pressure compressor  by a high pressure drive shaft . The combustor  includes radially spaced apart annular outer and inner combustor liners , , respectively, disposed coaxially about the centerline axis  and including an annular combustion zone  therebetween.","Downstream of the core engine  is a two stage low pressure turbine  including low pressure turbine first and second stages ,  suitably joined to the fan section  by a low pressure drive shaft . The core engine  is contained within a core engine casing  and an annular bypass duct  containing a bypass flowpath  circumscribed about the core engine . A fan casing  circumscribes the fan section . The bypass duct  extends from the fan section  downstream past the low pressure turbine . The high and low pressure turbines ,  are counter-rotatable with respect to each other and have a vaneless interface  therebetween as more particularly illustrated in .","Engine air  enters the engine through an engine inlet  and is initially pressurized as it flows downstream through the fan section  with an inner portion thereof referred to as core engine air  flowing through the high pressure compressor  for further compression. An outer portion of the engine air is referred to as bypass air  and is directed to bypass the core engine  and flow through the bypass duct . The core engine air  is discharged from the high pressure compressor  at what is referred to as core discharge pressure (CDP) and a first portion  of core discharge pressure air  is suitably mixed with fuel by fuel injectors  and carburetors in the combustor  and ignited in the combustion zone  for generating hot combustion gases  which flow through the high and low pressure turbines , .","Referring to , a second portion  of the core discharge pressure air  is flowed around the combustor between the outer combustor liner  and an outer combustor casing  and used to supply cooling air  to cool an annular segmented turbine shroud  circumscribed about the axial centerline axis  and surrounding both the single stage high pressure turbine  and the low pressure turbine first stage . Referring more particularly to , the segmented turbine shroud  includes a plurality of arcuate shroud segments . Each arcuate shroud segment  is circumscribed about the axial centerline axis .","A hot outer surface  is on a first side  of the segment  forming in part a hot flowpath fluid surface  of the shroud . An outer coolable surface  is on a second side  of the segment . Turbulators  for cooling the second side  are disposed on the second side  and extend upward from the coolable surface . The second side  is opposite the first side  on the segment . A thermal barrier coating  is disposed on the first side  of each segment . Each shroud segment  includes a forward mounting hook  at a circumferential leading edge  of shroud segment , a midsection mounting hook , and an aft mounting hook  adjacent to a circumferential trailing edge  of shroud segment .","A plurality of circumferentially disposed shroud supports  surround and support the shroud segments . Each shroud support  circumferentially spans and supports radially adjacent shroud segments . Each shroud support  includes a forward section , a midsection  and an aft section  that include respective forwardly projecting forward, midsection, and aft hangers ,  and  respectively. Forward, midsection, and aft mounting hooks ,  and  are received by forward, midsection, and aft hangers ,  and , respectively, in tongue-in-groove, or hook-in-hanger, interconnections such that shroud support  supports respective shroud segments .","Referring to , an annular turbine casing  and an inner annular sleeve  are bolted to a flange  at an aft end  of the outer combustor casing . An annular ring structure  which serves as an extension of the turbine casing  maintains the shroud supports  in a desired position and in the exemplary embodiment illustrated herein. Referring to , the annular ring structure  is a one-piece continuous annular ring structure or casing. A radial position of each shroud support , as well as of each shroud segment , is closely controlled by radially outwardly extending forward and aft thermal control rings ,  (also referred to as pseudo-flanges) formed on the annular ring structure . Forward projecting forward and aft casing hangers ,  depend radially inwardly from the forward and aft thermal control rings ,  respectively. The forward and aft casing hangers ,  receive and\/or cooperate with axially rearwardly projecting forward and aft mounting hooks ,  of forward and aft sections ,  of the shroud supports  respectively in a circumferential tongue-in-groove or hook-in-hanger interconnection.","A borescope inspection port assembly , having a cooled inspection port  in at least one of the shroud segments , is used to insert a borescope (not illustrated herein) between the single stage high pressure turbine  and the low pressure turbine first stage  as illustrated in . The cooled inspection port  disclosed herein includes a radially inner coolable borescope boss  in at least one of the shroud segments  of the segmented turbine shroud  as illustrated in . The borescope inspection port assembly  illustrated in  includes an outer port  in the turbine casing . An intermediate port  of the borescope inspection port assembly  is formed in the annular ring structure . A shroud port  of the borescope inspection port assembly  includes the coolable borescope boss  formed in one of the shroud segments  of the segmented turbine shroud .","A borescope plug  installed in the borescope inspection port assembly  is accessed through an access port  in the bypass duct  as illustrated in . Referring to , the borescope plug  includes a plug body  and a plunger  having a tip . The plunger  is positioned for sliding coaxial movement relative to the plug body . The plug body  extends radially inwardly through and sealingly engaging the outer port  in the turbine casing  and the intermediate port  in the annular ring structure  so that the tip  fills and seals off the shroud port  in the shroud segment  of the shroud . A seating shoulder  of the borescope plug body  seats against the intermediate port .","A lower portion  of the borescope plug body  has threads  that engage threads  on the intermediate port . The shoulder  sits on and seals the intermediate port  when the borescope plug  is screwed down. The plug body  has an axial cavity  with a circular spring seat . A cylindrical spring  extends radially inwardly from the spring seat  to a spring seat  of the plunger . The spring  tends to force the plunger  as far down in the axial cavity  as possible. The plunger  is equipped with a flange  that engages a retainer  to prevent exit of the plunger  from the axial cavity  of the plug body . The plunger  bottoms against a retainer  when disassembled from the borescope inspection port.","Referring to , a boss hole  having a boss hole axis  extends through the coolable borescope boss  terminating at a hole exit  flush with the outer surface  of the shroud segment . The coolable borescope boss  extends radially outwardly, with respect to the axial centerline axis , away from the coolable surface  of the shroud segment . A coolable borescope boss may also be used on non annular elements and, thus, may be described more broadly as extending away from the second side. Because the turbine shroud  surrounds both the single stage high pressure turbine  and the low pressure turbine first stage , which circumscribe the axial centerline axis , the turbine shroud  has a cylindrical shroud first section  surrounding the single stage high pressure turbine , a cylindrical shroud second section  surrounding the low pressure turbine first stage , and a conical shroud midsection  therebetween. Thus, each of the shroud segments  has a cylindrical segment first section , a cylindrical segment second section , and a conical segment midsection  therebetween corresponding to the first, second, and midsections of the shroud . Thus, the hole exit  is flush with the outer surface  along the conical shroud midsection  of the shroud segment .","Referring to , the tip  of the borescope plug  has a spherical tip chamfer  which seals against a conical boss chamfer  in the coolable borescope boss  around an entrance  to the boss hole  in order to seal the tip  against hot combustion gases  flowing along a hot flowpath fluid surface  of the shroud . A radially inwardly most tip surface  of the tip  is thus recessed from the flowpath fluid surface  when the spherical tip chamfer  is seated within the conical boss chamfer  thus forming a borescope tip cavity  within the boss hole  extending axially, with respect to the boss hole axis , between the outer surface  and the tip surface  as further illustrated in . Though the tip chamfer  is illustrated as being spherical and the boss chamfer  is illustrated as being conical they both may be otherwise shaped.","Referring to , cooling passages  extend through the coolable borescope boss  into the borescope tip cavity  within the boss hole . The borescope tip cavity  is generally below or radially inward of the boss chamfer  and has a cylindrical cavity surface . The cooling passages  are oriented to spray cooling air  towards the boss hole axis . Some of the cooling passages  have cooling inlets  in a boss outer surface  of the coolable borescope boss  radially outward of or above the coolable surface  of the shroud segment . Others of the cooling passages  have cooling inlets  in the coolable surface  of the shroud segment . All of the cooling passages  have cooling outlets  at least partially disposed in the cylindrical cavity surface . The cooling passages  are aimed at the boss hole axis  and, more specifically, within the borescope tip cavity . Centerlines  of the cooling passages  may intersect the boss hole axis .","One quarter of a full shroud segment  and only one half of the coolable borescope boss  is illustrated in  and, thus, only one half of a number of the cooling passages  are illustrated for the embodiment of the cooling passages  and the boss hole axis  illustrated therein. Three of the cooling passages  are illustrated, the other three would be a mirror image about a centerplane  as illustrated in . Four aft cooling passages  are in an aft end  of the coolable borescope boss  and two side cooling passages  are in first and second sides ,  of the coolable borescope boss  and generally perpendicular to the centerline axis  (not shown in ). The aft cooling passages  have cooling inlets  in the coolable surface  of the shroud segment . The side cooling passages  have cooling inlets  in the boss outer surface  of the coolable borescope boss .","Referring to , the cooling outlets  are at least partially disposed in the cylindrical cavity surface  between the hole exit  of the boss hole  and a chamfer inner end  of the boss chamfer  in the coolable borescope boss  around the entrance  to the boss hole . The cooling passages  are illustrated in  as being cylindrical. An alternative embodiment of the cooling passages , illustrated in , has top open slots  disposed through the coolable borescope boss . The top open slots  extend through and into the coolable borescope boss  from a continuous outer surface  of the coolable borescope boss . The continuous outer surface  include a top surface  of the coolable borescope boss  surrounding the entrance  to the boss hole , the boss outer surface  of the coolable borescope boss , a conical outer surface  of the boss chamfer , and the cylindrical cavity surface .","The cooling passages  provide cooling of the borescope tip cavity  between the outer surface  of the shroud segment  and the tip surface  of the tip  of the borescope plug . The cooling passages  also provide cooling of the coolable borescope boss  and in turn the conical outer surface  of the boss chamfer . Both modes of cooling help maintain a good fit and seal between the tip  of the borescope plug  and the coolable borescope boss . The coolable borescope boss  also helps reduce thermal degradation of the tip  of the borescope plug  and the area of the outer surface  of the shroud segment  surrounding the hole exit  of the boss hole .","While there have been described herein what are considered to be preferred and exemplary embodiments of the present invention, other modifications of the invention shall be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teachings herein and, it is therefore, desired to be secured in the appended claims all such modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, what is desired to be secured by Letters Patent of the United States is the invention as defined and differentiated in the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
