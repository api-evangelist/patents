title: System and method for measuring and quantizing document quality
abstract: Text, images, and/or graphics of electronic documents should be organized and laid out in a two-dimensional format for presentation to the viewer. The best such layout depends upon the content present, the creator's intent, the output device, and the viewer's interests. To analyze the qualitative nature of the layout in quantifiable terms, the electronic document is measure using various quantifiable factors; such as, balance, uniformity, white space management, alignment, consistency, legibility, etc.; that impact a qualitative nature of a document. Such quantifiable factors are then used to quantize the aesthetics, ease of use, eye-catching ability, interest, communicability, comfort, and convenience of the document.

No. 60\/491,043, filed on Jul. 30, 2003, and from U.S. Provisional Patent Application, Ser. No. 60\/491,042, filed on Jul. 30, 2003. The entire contents of U.S. Provisional Patent Application, Ser. No. 60\/491,043, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application, Ser. No. 60\/491,042, are hereby incorporated by reference.","The present invention generally relates to the field of document layout, design, and analysis and, more particularly, to methods which quantitatively measure a document's quality based on characteristics inherent in the document itself.","When documents are created, many decisions must be made as to style, content, layout, and the like. The text, images, and graphics must be organized and laid out in a two-dimensional format with the intention of providing a presentation to the viewer which will capture and preferably maintain their attention for the time sufficient to get the intended message across. Different style options are available for the various content elements and choices must be made. The best choices for style and layout depend upon content, intent, viewer interests, etc. In order to tell if a set of choices made as to the look and feel of the final version of the document were good or bad, one might request feedback from a set of viewers after viewing the document and compile the feedback into something meaningful from which the document's creators or developers can make alterations, changes, or other improvements. This cycle repeats until the document's owners are satisfied that the final version achieves the intended result.","Factors that contribute to the quality and effectiveness of layout and style decisions for a document are the handling of groups of content elements as style and layout choices affect groups of content. A group is a collection of content elements. Group membership is a property of the logical structure of the document. The neighborhood of groups can be considered a layout property. While layout structure often matches the logical structure, there is no requirement that it do so.","Preferably, one would like to have a quantitative measure of various value properties of the document (measures of the document \u201cgoodness\u201d) based on properties inherent in the document itself. In this manner the document itself provides a level of quantitative feedback. For instance, one property that developer's would like to be able to measure would be how easy it is to use a document. A measure for the ease of use of a document can be used in evaluating or making document design decisions.","One aspect of the ease of use of a document is one's ability to tell which elements belong to a group and which do not. The style and layout decisions that are made in the presentation of a document can affect the degree of group identity that it conveys. In evaluating a document's design for its ease of use, it is useful to have a measure of the degree of group identity. Considerations for ease-of-use with respect to groups include spatial coherence, spatial separation, alignment separation, heading separation, background separation, and\/or style separation. Measures for various characteristics of content, feature, and the like could be weighted by intent, relevance, and other parameters and these could then be combined to obtain one or more overall measures for the document itself. If one had a method for evaluating properties inherent in the document itself then such a measure could be used during the document development process to help determine optimal presentation.","An aspect of the ease of use of a document is its searchability. Searchability can be defined as the degree to which the document structurally supports the finding of a desired content element. A document with high searchability provides aids that help in finding desired content. In general, a document with high searchability measure is easier to use because it is easy to locate the portion of the document containing the information of interest.","Another aspect of a document's ease of use is the document's degree of distinguishability. The distinguishability of content can be defined as the ability to identify one particular content element from another content element within the document. Distinguishability is important in establishing the context for the information disclosed by the element. It can reduce confusion about what that element is and to what group or setting it belongs. It can also aid in locating a desired element. The distinguishability of the document elements is therefore a contributing factor to the ease of use of the document.","Another property that would be desirable to be able to quantitatively measure is the ability of the document to hold the viewer's attention and interest. While much of the document's ease of use depends upon the actual content and its relevance to the viewer, there can also be a contribution from the style with which that content is presented. If a measure of the effect of style decisions on ease of use could be defined it could be used in determining a measure of optimal presentation.","Documents can present content in ways that make it easier to locate individual items. This can be referred to as \u2018locateability\u2019. A way to distinguish one content object from another object is to evaluate the target object's locatability, i.e., how easy it is to find an object within the document. This is a little different from distinguishability, which tells how well an item can be differentiated from its neighbors. Structural aids such as layout of tables or bullet lists help the document viewer to locate objects. Presenting content in a table allows its location to be identified by row or column. The presence of headings for the rows and columns can further increase the ease of locating items. Presenting content items in a list introduces an ordering that aids in locating them, and the use of list bullets or item numbers aids further. Separability and distinguishability contribute to the locatability of an object.","Measures for various aspects of content, features, and the like could be weighted by intent, relevance, and other parameters and these could then be combined to obtain one or more overall measures for the document itself. If one had a method for evaluating such properties inherent in the document itself then such a measure could be used during the document development process to help determine optimal presentation.","Therefore, it is desirable to provide a methodology to measure the quality of a document in a quantifiable way. Moreover, it is desirable to provide a quantifiable measurement of quality which is useable in evaluating the document and improving its quality so as to add value to the information being conveyed through the document.","A first aspect of the present invention is a method for quantifying a measure of quality of a document.

On the contrary, the intent is to cover all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the present invention, as defined by the appended claims.","For a general understanding of the present invention, reference is made to the drawings. In the drawings, like reference have been used throughout to designate identical or equivalent elements. It is also noted that the various drawings illustrating the present invention are not drawn to scale and that certain regions may have been purposely drawn disproportionately so that the features and concepts of the present invention could be properly illustrated.","The present invention is directed to various methods for quantifying various document properties to assist document developers in determining document quality. Quality can have several competing aspects and the overall quality can depend not only on the absolute properties of the document, but also on the relative importance of these properties to the beholder. One aspect or class of document quality is its aesthetics, which is its beauty, the degree to which pleasure can be derived from its appearance. Often this property is manifested in the degree of displeasure generated by an ugly layout.","Another aspect or class contributing to the quality of a document is the effectiveness with which it communicates information to the user. Documents are vessels of information, and the ease at which the viewer can gather and understand the information can be an important factor in how well the document does its job.","A third aspect or class that contributes to the quality of a document is its ease of use. A factor that contributes to the ease of use is how convenient the document is, that is, can it be used with a minimum of effort. A second factor contributing overall ease of use is content grouping. Information often has some logical organization and documents can reflect this organization by grouping the content. The effectiveness with which the document coveys this grouping and enables the viewer to capitalize on it contributes to the ease of use.","A fourth aspect or class that enters into document quality is the degree to which the user is comfortable with it. Documents that create anxiety are generally not as desirable as those that the viewer finds soothing and familiar.","A fifth aspect or class that is an important contributor to the quality of some documents is the degree to which they can catch the eye of the viewer. Advertisements for example, strive to capture the attention and not to be easily overlooked","A sixth aspect or class that is similar is the ability for the document to maintain interest. It is one thing to capture the attention, but another to hold it and to avoid boredom as the document is used.","A seventh aspect or class of quality can be the economy of the document, both to the creator and to the viewer. If the other contributors to quality are the same, then a lower cost version of a document is generally considered better than a more expensive one. While other factors may also contribute to document quality, the measuring of these seven aspects or classes provides a good basis for evaluating document quality.","The aspects or classes listed as contributing to document quality (with the exception of economy) are usually considered soft and ill-defined concepts; however, these properties can be quantified. The method for measuring and quantifying these attributes is to first identify document features that contribute to the property. Quantifiable measures of the individual features are then devised. And finally, the individual feature values are combined to form an overall score for the more abstract property.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0110"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["91","92","90","94","93","91"]},"The display  may display the document or portion thereof that is being quantized with respect to quality. The display  may also display the various options that a user can choose though the user interface  with respect to the classes that the user wishes to quantize or the various parameters that a user can choose though the user interface , which are to be measured within the chosen quantization class.","The quantization architecture of  further includes various circuits for measuring\/quantizing various aspects or classes of document quality. These circuits include aesthetics quantizer , ease of use quantizer , eye catching ability quantizer , interest quantizer , communicability quantizer , comfort quantizer , convenience quantizer , and economy quantizer .

If alternate or additional measures of quality are considered, they would also be combined at combiner .","Each value thereof is based on properties inherent in the document itself. The values are individually combined into an overall value or score for the document. Other methods for measuring, assigning, or otherwise associating a quantifiable value for document quality should be considered within the scope of the present invention; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular methods put forth, but also in the much broader concept of determining a value for document quality.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, each rule is defined to produce a value ranging between 0 and 1 such that 0 means low value and 1 means high value. This enables quantized quality values to be calculated and combined to form the overall document quality measure.","If Vis the value calculated for the irule, the document quality measure Vis formed as a function E of these contributions such that: V=E(V, V, . . . V). The combining function E can be as simple as a weighted average of the contributions. However, because any bad contributor can ruin the document quality no matter how good the others are, a linear combination is not preferred.","An alternative is: V=(\u03a3w(V)). In a preferred embodiment, the wfactors are weights that specify the relative importance of each rule and should sum to one. The exponent \u2018p\u2019 introduces a non-linearity that can make one bad value overwhelm many good ones.

The quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and\/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.","As illustrated in , one of the parameters or factors used in determining aesthetics is the measurement and quantization of the document's balance or balance in page layout.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there are at least two primary ways of defining balance. There is an overall balance where the center of visual weight is at the visual center of a page of a document; as illustrated by  with objects  on document  having substantially a center of visual weight equal to a visual center of a page of a document; and a left-right balance; as illustrated by  with objects  on document  where the weight of object  on the left side of the page is matched by the weight of object  at the same vertical position on the right side of the page.

Objects , as used herein, may refer to paragraphs, pictures, graphics, etc.","If the visual center of the page  is at (x, y) and the maximum x and y distances ( shows the x distance) an object can be from the visual center  are dand d, a balance value can be calculated as: V=1\u2212[(((x\u2212x)\/d)+((y\u2212y)\/d))\/2].","Note that one can, in a similar way, compute the balance of subclasses of objects by considering only objects belonging to the subclasses. For example, one could compute the visual balance of all pictorial images on the page, or the visual balance of all text blocks.","For left-right balance, the center of visual weight ( of ) for the x component is calculated as given above. However, for the y component, what is desired is that the left and right halves have the same position, rather than the total being centered. This is achieved by calculating the center of weight for the left side () as: y=(\u03a3yM)\/(\u03a3M) where the sums are over the portions of objects  with x<x. Similarly, y=(\u03a3yM)\/(\u03a3M) where the sums are over the portions of objects with x>x.","If a content object spans both the left and right sides of the page, for the purposes of this calculation, the object is divided along the vertical centerline of the page. The left and right divisions of the object are then entered into the left and right sums, respectively. If the page height is d, a left-right balance value is: V=1\u2212[(((x\u2212x)\/d)+((y\u2212y)\/d))\/2]. It is noted that other definitions are possible.","One might, for example, raise these balance values to powers in order to express the idea that balance is non-linear. Ideally, one would perform the psychophysical experiments to measure human response to balance and define a function that matches that response.","The above expressions make use of the visual weight of an object. To first order, this can be defined as the objects area times its optical density. However, other psychological effects can also be included. Examples include color carrying more weight than gray; round shapes carrying more weight than rectangular, and positioning at the top of the page giving more weight than at the bottom.","As illustrated in , balance is defined with respect to the visual center of the page . The visual center  lies halfway between the left and right edges of the page, but it is not halfway between the top and bottom. Typically, the visual center  is taken to be offset a twentieth of the page height towards the top from the geometric center .","The balance, as illustrated in , is considered a combination of two approaches described above. In , the quantized overall balance value is derived by a combining of the overall balance and the left-right balance using a balance quantizer or combiner circuit .","One approach is: V=1\u2212[w(1\u2212V)+w(1\u2212V)]. The weights Wand Wgive the relative importance of the two balance approaches and should sum to 1. If either of the balance measures is near 1 (good), the overall result is also near 1. The exponent \u2018q\u2019 determines how strong this behavior is.","It is noted that the illustration shows a circuit for the balance quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and\/or firmware. The quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and\/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.","As illustrated in , another parameter or factor used in determining aesthetics is the measurement and quantization of the document's uniformity.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is preferred to have content objects  distributed uniformly over a page , as illustrated in , and not clumped together, as illustrated in . However, for other values, such as attention grabbing, it may be beneficial to have clustered and even unbalanced positioning. Uniformity is preferred.","Non-uniformity is defined herein as the variance of the visual density. For a portion of a page, a visual density is determined by it's the visual weight of the objects contained within the portion, divided by it's the portion's area such that: D=\u03a3M\/Awhere the sum is over objects j contained in page portion i. Densities are preferably scaled to range between 0 and 1. A rescale may be needed if visual weight includes factors in addition to the optical density that alter the range of values. An average page density can also be defined as the sum of the visual weights for all objects on the page divided by the imageable area of the page.","The imageable area Apis typically the area of the page excluding margins. D=\u03a3M\/Ap. A non-uniformity value is calculated by dividing the imageable area into a small number of portions and comparing the visual density for portions to the average page density.","A non-uniformity value can be calculated as the difference between the visual density for the portion of the page and the average page density, which is squared and weighted by the portion's area. Subtracting 1 this gives a uniformity value. In other words, a non-uniformity value van be defined as V=1\u2212(\u03a3(D\u2212D)A)\/\u03a3A.","The average page density can also be calculated for each page individually, or an overall average page density can be determined from the visual weight of all objects on portions of all pages and the area of all pages.","An alternative to calculating a single non-uniformity value for the document directly is to calculate non-uniformity values for individual pages and then combines the page values by some means such as an average, or by a non-linear scheme that might, for example, yield a low result if any page has a low value. Other uniformity measures are possible, for example, the true variance in the densities can be calculated and used to give non-uniformity. Alternatively, a function is constructed from measured human responses to differing uniformities.","As illustrated in , another parameter or factor used in determining aesthetics is the measurement and quantization of the document's white space function.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a good page design is one with white space (including margins) totaling about half of the total page area. The non-white space area can be estimated by totaling the areas of the content objects.","In , the white space function, the amount of area not associated with an object  on page , totals more than half of the imageable area and thus it is undesirable. In , the white space function, the amount of area not associated with an object  on page , totals less than half of the imageable area and thus it is also undesirable. Lastly, in , the white space function, the amount of area not associated with an object  on page , totals about half of the imageable area and thus it is optimal.","The total object area  can be scaled by the total page area Aand the difference between this value and the desired 50% can be found. Squaring the difference to give a positive number produces a measure of how much the layout differs from the 50% rule. Scaling by 4 to get a number ranging between 0 and 1 and then subtracting this from 1 gives the white space function quantization value. Thus: V=1\u22124((\u03a3A\/A)\u22120.5).","Other measures of the effect of the white space function on document aesthetics and on document quality are envisioned herein and should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing white space functions.","As illustrated in , another parameter or factor used in determining aesthetics is the measurement and quantization of the document's trapped white space.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is desired that there should not be any large blocks of white space trapped, in the middle of the page, by content. The white space should always be connected to the margins.","To quantize this class of trapped white space, an efficient method of detecting trapped white space is illustrated in  and discussed in more detail below.","The class of trapped white space is primarily concerned with relatively large blocks of white space. One way that efficiency, as used herein, can be improved is by performing a trapped white space analysis at a coarse resolution. The approach taken is to determine the area of all white space that can be accessed directly from the margins. This area then gets added to the area of the content objects ( of ) and compared to the area of the page. Any difference becomes the amount of trapped white space ( of ).","To achieve this, four profiles () of white space are accessible from the four margins of the document constructed. These profiles are preferably stored in arrays at the coarse resolution. Call the arrays, for example: TopProf, BottomProf, LeftProf and RightProf. Elements of the TopProf and BottomProf arrays are initialized to the page height, while the LeftProf and RightProf arrays are initialized to the page width.","Next all content objects  are stepped through and for each, their left (), right (), top (), and bottom () boundary positions , , , and , respectively, are found. This information is used to update the profile arrays.","For points from the left to right boundary, the value stored in the TopProf array is compared to the top boundary and the array value is replaced with the top value if top is smaller. The difference between the bottom boundary and the page height is compared to the BottomProf array value and updated with the smaller result.

The alignment might be for all left edges to have the same x value. Alternatively, it night be for all objects to share the same centerline. If right edges are aligned as well as left ones, this is better still.

The method also applies to tops, bottoms, and vertical centers. Each application yields a different alignment measure. These are then all combined for an overall alignment measure.","The alignment measure can be applied to all content objects, or alternatively, can be applied to a restricted set of objects such as all objects belonging to a logical group in the document structure. Alignment can also be restricted to objects of a given type, such as all paragraphs, or all pictorial images.","Each alignment metric may be built on a page basis and provides a quantifiable indication of how well different components on the page are aligned. With this approach the individual page alignments can be combined to form an alignment measure for the entire document. Alternatively, alignment values can be calculated using document objects across multiple pages. When components are aligned well, then the number given by the metric is one. When components are not aligned well, the metric gives a number smaller than one. Advantageously, changing the position of the components on the page changes this number in a smooth and continuous way.","To achieve this, first, a histogram of edge (or center) position () is created reflecting the distance objects  on page  are from an edge, in the illustration of , the edge is the left edge. The histogram is preferably created at lower resolutions than the actual positioning. This reduces alignment sensitivity as well as saving on memory and computation requirements.","If the histogram array is called EdgeCount, and if the edge position for an object is x, and the resolution reduction factor is b, for each content object EdgeCount[b*x]+=1. Strong alignment will result in most positions contributing to the same histogram element. If one is interested in the alignment of the left edges of objects, the histogram is filled using left-edge positions. Alignments for right, top, or bottom edges and center positions are intended to be calculated similarly.","The alignment measure depends on the distances between neighboring entries in the histogram. The closer together the entries are, the higher the score. This dependence must be non-linear. Otherwise, any moving of an object closer to its neighbor is canceled by the moving of the object away from its neighbor on the other side. The non-linear function used for entries separated by a distance z is: A\/(A+z) where A is a constant that controls how fast values fall away from 1 as the distance between entries increases.","If two edges were aligned and the distance separating them was z=0, this yields 1. This provides a contribution for the strength of the entries at that position.","In other words, if a position has n edges contributing, n\u22121 separations exist between edges of distance zero. As such, there should be a contribution of n\u22121 from an entry count of n as well as the contribution from the separations between neighboring entry positions. If the total number of components were NumberOfObjects, the maximum contribution, if they were all perfectly aligned, would be NumberOfObjects\u22121.

An overall page security value is defined as the minimum of all the object values for the page PS=min(ps). Most objects will appear fine when there is some threshold distance T beyond which one should get a value of 1 for the property. To adjust the measure for this behavior, calculate: V=min(1, PS*T).","Other measures of the effect of object position on document aesthetics and on document quality are envisioned herein and should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured responses to differing positions e.g., insecurity of objects positioned near page edges.","As illustrated in , another parameter or factor used in determining aesthetics is the measurement and quantization of the document's optimal proportionality.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, certain proportions are more pleasing than others. An aspect ratio between width and height of R=2\/(1+\u221a5)=0.618 . . . is often ideal. The ratio of width and height of the content on a page is determined and compared to this ratio.","For width and height, the bounding box of the content (, , , , and ) is preferred. The bounding box is calculated as follows: Step through the content objects and find the minimum left edge, the maximum right edge, and (measuring top down) the minimum top edge and maximum bottom edge. The width is the difference between the maximum right edge and minimum left edge. The height is the difference between the minimum top edge and maximum bottom edge.","Next, determine whether the width or height is the smaller and divide the smaller by the larger to get the aspect ratio A.

The particular embodiments describe here are meant to illustrate how a quantifiable aesthetic measure can be constructed and how either directly, or through the aesthetics, they contribute to document quality. Their identification should not rule out the use of other features as appropriate.","For the case of document ease of use, the methods herein are used to generate quantifiable values for the contributing features of: separability, distinguishability, locatablility, searchability, and\/or group identity. As illustrated in , a combining circuit  (the ease of use quantizer  of ) receives measured and\/or calculated quantized values representing separability, distinguishability, locatablility, searchability, and\/or group identity and processes these values based upon a predetermined algorithm so as to generate an ease of use quantization value for the document or portion of the document being analyzed.","Each value thereof is based on properties inherent in the document itself. The values are individually combined into an overall value or score for the document. Other methods for measuring, assigning, or otherwise associating a quantifiable value for document quality should be considered within the scope of the present invention; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular methods put forth, but also in the much broader concept of determining a value for document quality.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, each rule is defined to produce a value ranging between 0 and 1 such that 0 means low value and 1 means high value. This enables quantized quality values to be calculated and combined to form the overall document quality measure.","If Vis the value calculated for the irule, the document quality measure Vis formed as a function E of these contributions such that: V=E(V, V, . . . V). The combining function E can be as simple as a weighted average of the contributions. However, because any bad contributor can ruin the document quality no matter how good the others are, a linear combination is not preferred.","An alternative is: V=(\u03a3w(V)). In a preferred embodiment, the wfactors are weights that specify the relative importance of each rule and should sum to one. The exponent \u2018p\u2019 introduces a non-linearity that can make one bad value overwhelm many good ones. The larger the value of the exponent \u2018p\u2019 is, the greater this effect","A further alternative is: V=(\u03a3w(d+V))\u2212d. The wfactors are weights that specify the relative importance of each rule and should sum to one. The exponent \u2018p\u2019 introduces a non-linearity that can make one bad value overwhelm many good ones. The parameter d is a number slightly larger than 0. The larger the value of the exponent \u2018p\u2019 is, the greater this effect.","Other combining functions are, for example, the product of the contributions. If weighting of the contribution is desired, this can be achieved by: V=\u03a0V.","It is noted that the illustrations show circuits or circuit for the ease-of-use quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and\/or firmware. The quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and\/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.","As with the measurement of aesthetics, the measurement of ease of use requires the identification of quantifiable features that contribute to the ease of use. Examples of methods to measure and combine such features are provided.","The features first considered are those that relate to the logical structure of the document, that is, to the organization of the document content into group. In evaluating document quality, content objects of interest need to be identified as to what kind of content these objects are, (e.g., images, paragraphs, headings, titles, blocks, borders, lists, tables, etc.). This of course will be highly dependent upon the kind of document the document's creator or developer either envisions, or is creating, or has already created.","Once the document content of interest has been identified, content needs to be characterized, as illustrated in , as to how content is intended to be grouped such that content can be distinguished from other content, from other content groups, from other content group members (, , ) or elements, and from neighboring content (, , ). This can be effectuated by parsing content objects of interest into a tree structure of content, as illustrated in , wherein nodes  of the content tree are content groups (i.e., lists, tables, etc.) and leaves of the branches  of the content tree are content elements (i.e., paragraphs, images, and the like). It should be understood that one skilled in this art would readily understand the creating of content trees, branches, nodes, etc., along with how to traverse the tree preferably in a computer science context.","Once a content tree has been created, content which is neighboring the content object(s) of interest need to be identified. One procedure takes the content tree and traverses up the tree and identifies neighboring branches thereof. Another then moves down the content tree examining elements on the identified neighboring branches. In such a manner, content neighboring the content of interest can be identified.","First a neighbor list associated with content group G is initialized to an empty list. The content tree is traversed upward to identify branches neighboring content group G. The content tree is then traversed downward such that elements of the identified content branches can be examined. Branches are pruned that are considered to exceed a predetermined distance from the node of the group G. Only branches considered as \u2018nearby\u2019 are recursively analyzed. Although the process described herein involves identifying neighbors N of group G, it should be understood that nothing requires group G to actually comprise a group of content as group G can be a single element (paragraphs, images, etc.) of content.","The procedure IsNeighbor(G,N) is used herein to ascertain whether or not a node N is within a threshold distance of content group G, such that node N is to be considered a neighbor N of group G. This can be readily effectuated by calculating a distance between group G and neighbor N and comparing that distance to a threshold variable CloseEnough so as to determine whether Distance(G,N)<CloseEnough.","Distance can be the distance between content borders or alternatively the distance between content centers. With respect to the former, if the content centers of group G are (x, y) and neighbor N are (x, y) and the widths and heights of group G and neighbor N are (w, h) and (w, h) respectively, then distance can be readily computed by the relationship of: max(abs(x\u2212x)\u2212(w+w)\/2, 0)+max(abs(y\u2212y)\u2212(h+h)\/2, 0). More complex distance calculations such as minimum Euclidean distance between corners can also be used.","The threshold CloseEnough can either be a constant or be adjustable with respect to content size. One can use the square root of the area of object G to determine a threshold value such that: CloseEnough=(Area(G)). This also can be scaled by factor S where S is typically close to 1 such that: CloseEnough=S*(Area(G)).","The methods provided for evaluating distance or determining threshold are not to be considered as limiting in scope.

Using the dimensions of the bounding boxes, (i.e., center position, width, and height) of the content under evaluation, spatial separation can be distances between horizontal and vertical components with a floor of zero. This can be further normalized to yield a value between 0 and 1 by scaling with a maximum separation factor, (e.g., scaling by width (W) and height (H) of the page) such that: (max(abs(x\u2212x)\u2212(w+w)\/2,0)\/W+max(abs(y\u2212y)\u2212(h+h)\/2,0)\/H)\/2.","The particular method provided for evaluating spatial distances between content objects are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.

Alignment separation is how well content avoids having corresponding positional matches within a page. Using the left, right, top, bottom (x, x, y, y) page position of group G () and the (x, x, y, y) page position of neighbor N (), alignment separation is the minimum of the absolute differences of their corresponding positions, given by: min(abs(x\u2212x), abs(x\u2212x), abs(y\u2212y), abs(y\u2212y)).","Alignment separation can be further normalized to a value between 0 and 1 by dividing by a maximum possible difference in positions (page width Wand page height H) of the document page upon which the content resides as expressed by: min(abs(x\u2212x)\/W, abs(x\u2212x)\/W, abs(y\u2212y)\/H, abs(y\u2212y)\/H).","Alternatively, alignment separation can be measured by the sum of the alignment separations between multiple edges as given by: min((abs(x\u2212x)+abs(x\u2212x))\/Wp, (abs(y\u2212y)+abs(y\u2212y))\/H). Alternatively, min(max(abs(x\u2212x)\/W, abs(x\u2212x)\/W), max(abs(y\u2212y)\/H, abs(y\u2212y)\/H)).","The methods for evaluating alignment and alignment separation herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing alignment separation amounts; such that the present invention is directed to the much broader concept of using a measure of alignment separation of content objects in a determination of total separability in the context of evaluating document ease of use and document quality.","As illustrated in , another parameter or factor used in determining ease of use is the measurement and quantization of the document's style separation.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, style separation (StyleSep) is used herein to provide a means by which objects can be further distinguished. To obtain the degree of style separation, content types need to be compared against every other style type and a value assigned for the amount of style separation therebetween. The assignment of such a value would be made as ajudgment call by the document developer. For example, one document developer may consider it easier to distinguish TEXT from an IMAGE than it is to distinguish a LIST from a TABLE. Thus, that developer would assign a much smaller style separation value for types LIST vs. TABLE because it is much more difficult to distinguish between these two types of content.","In other words, the degree of style separation is small. Whereas, with regard to the TEXT vs. IMAGE as previously mentioned, the developer may consider it much easier to distinguish between these two types of content. Thus, separations in style is high so type TEXT vs. type IMAGE would be assigned a high value in the table of style separations, e.g., TypeSepTable, which is preferably multi-dimensional and indexed by type.","The table of style separation values (TypeSepTable) contains a value for all types vs. all other types. For instance, content type IMAGE would be assigned a style separation value against all other types of content (e.g., TEXT, IMAGE, GRAPHIC, LIST, TABLE, etc.). As mentioned, the IMAGE vs. TEXT types would have one value for their degree of style separation. The IMAGE vs. GRAPHIC types would have a value for their respective degree of style separation. All types would be stored in a manner, which renders the value for the degree of style separation between two content types readily retrievable.","Once the style separation table has been generated, the value for the separation of style between content group object G and identified neighbor N is readily retrieved from the table of separation values by a function, referred to herein as type ( ), which returns a number for content type. The pre-determined value for the separation between two content types would be retrieved from the table of style separation values by the function's returning a value for type(G) and type(N). In this instance, StyleSep=TypeSepTable[type(G)][type(N)].","When the two objects are both the same type, then one can compare the style values of one object to the corresponding style value of the other. For each style value pair one can calculate a style difference. For numeric parameters such as font size, line spacing, the style difference can be calculated as just the absolute difference of the size values. For multidimensional values such as color, the style difference can be the distance between the values. For enumerated values such as quadding, font family or font style one can use a two-dimensional look-up table indexed by the enumerated values for the two objects to retrieve difference. An overall style separation difference becomes the weighted sum of the various style differences available for the object type. For example: StyleSep=\u03a3wd(G, N); where the sum is over available style parameters i, and wis the weight of the istyle parameter, and dis the difference measure for the istyle parameter.","The particular methods for evaluating style separation herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining style separation should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing styles; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining style separation, but also in the much broader concept of using a measure of style separation in a determination of content separability in the context of evaluating document ease of use and document quality.","As illustrated in , another parameter or factor used in determining ease of use is the measurement and quantization of the document's background separation.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, objects on different color backgrounds can be considered separate and distinct. Thus, background separation can be thought of as the difference in backgrounds  of two objects ( and ).

Further, some separators only serve to distinguish on a single boundary, i.e., indicating separation at the top but not at the sides.","As such, to calculate inherent separation, each of the four sides of the object under scrutiny needs to be considered separately. For instance, suppose wis a weight that describes the relative importance of the ifeature to the top boundary fTop(G). These weights should sum to 1. And, suppose a parameter P determines how strongly a successful separation feature overwhelms other features, and there is a constant c that should be close to 1 but may be slightly larger to avoid division by 0.

For different types of content (, , and ), their value differences can be retrieved from a two-dimensional table indexed by content type. The table preferably contains values that express just how different those content types are. If type(G) does not match type(N), ContentDistinguish=TypeDistinguishTable[type(G)][type(N)].","If the types do match, content properties can be compared. For groups, lists and tables, the total number of words or characters for all of their contained elements can be compared.","For example, for paragraphs, the number of words or characters thereof can be counted. For lists, the number of list elements can be compared. For tables, the number of rows and columns can be compared. For graphic objects, size and shape can be compared. Since some object types may have several properties by which differences are measured, an overall difference is preferably calculated as a weighted sum of the various content differences for an object type. For example, ContentDistinguish=\u03a3wcd(G,N), where the sum is over available style parameters i, wis the weight for the icontent difference measure, and cdis the actual idifference measure.","Furthermore, objects can be distinguished by their position on their respective pages, as illustrated in . Given object G and neighbor N, the center position for these objects  on page  (x, y) and (x, y), the distance between them can be calculated preferably normalized by the dimensions of the page Wby H.","For example: PositionDistinguish=(((x\u2212x)+(y\u2212y))\/(W+H)). This can be further limited by only considering nearby neighbors on the same page. The same list of neighbors generated for separability can then be utilized. The cost in limiting comparisons to objects on a page, however, is the failure to recognize cases where objects on different pages are indistinguishable.","If any of AlignmentSep, StyleSep, BackgroundSep and ContentDistinguish measures, (described above), provides a strong difference, then the overall effective distinguishability should be high. The closer the neighbor is to the object, the easier it should be to observe their differences. The end result should receive a boost from the SpatialSep. The value of PositionDistinguish can be a further differentiator. If boost b is defined by: b=d\/(d+SpatialSep); where the d parameter controls the strength of the boost effect of spatial nearness, then: EffectiveDistinguish=c\u2212[w*(c\u2212b*AlignmentSep)+w*(c\u2212b*StyleSep)+w*(c\u2212b*BackgroundSep)+w*(c\u2212b*ContentDistinguish)+w*(c\u2212PositionDistinguish)]); where w, w, w, wand ware weighting values that give the relative importance of the alignment, style, background, content and position differences respectively and should sum to 1. The constant c is slightly larger than 1 to prevent division by zero. Note that this is the effective distingishability between an object and one of its neighbors.","To quantify the total distinguishability of a content object, it must be distinguished from all neighbors. In addition, any inherent features such as headers must also be considered. Total distinguishability can be determined by taking the minimum of all EffectiveDistinguish values for all neighbors.","Alternatively, one can raise each term to a power and then apply the inverse power to the sum. TotalDistinguish=w*HeadingDistinguish+(1\u2212w)*([(1\/n)*\u03a3(c+EffectiveDistinguish)]\u2212c); where wis the weight of the HeadingDistinguish property relative to the neighbor differencing properties, n is the number of neighbors, constant c is a small constant to guard against division by zero, and power p determines how strongly close similarities dominate.","A combination of distinguishability measures, as illustrated in , is useful in evaluating the document's total distinguishability.","More specifically, the total distinguishability, as illustrated in , is considered a combination of the effective distinguishability and the heading distinguishability. In , the quantized distinguishability value is derived by a combining of the effective distinguishability and the heading distinguishability using a total distinguishability quantizer or combiner circuit .","It is noted that the illustration shows a circuit for the total distinguishability quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and\/or firmware. The quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and\/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.","A document's overall distinguishability can be defined as the combining of all total distinguishability for all content objects and groups. These values can be combined using a straight average. Alternatives, however, are possible.","If any neighbors are present, from which it is difficult to distinguish the object, then the overall distinguishability for the document should be low. One might argue that any object or group with a low distinguishability value adversely impacts the entire document and therefore should be given higher weight by combining as the root of the sum of powers.","Another issue is whether or not the importance of distinguishability varies with the level in content hierarchy. For example, should being able to distinguish chapters be more or less important than being able to distinguish paragraphs. An algorithm for computing document distinguishability by recursively traversing the content tree was previously discussed which calculates a weighted average.

A measure of locatability is constructed by examination of the document factors that aid or inhibit the locating of content objects.","As illustrated in , another parameter or factor used in determining ease of use is the measurement and quantization of the document's visibility.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, one factor in determining an object's locatability is to determine the visibility of the object, i.e., how well it can be seen against its background. As used herein, visibility means how easy it is to see the object, or how difficult it is to overlook it. Herein two characteristics are used in measuring the value of the object's visibility. One is the size of the object  (the larger the object the easier it should be to detect and identify it) and the other  is its difference from the background.","As a measure of the difference from the background (), the luminance contrast is used, although other and more complex measures are envisioned. If the background is textured, the luminance contrast and color difference may not be well defined. Texture may also act to hide an object.","If colors are specified in red, green and blue (R, G, B) coordinates normalized to range between 0 and 1 then luminance can be given by: Y=yr R+yg G+yb B; where yr, yg and yb are the luminance values for the red, green and blue primary colors respectively. The yr, yg and yb values depend upon the details of the color space actually used but typical values are 0.25, 0.68 and 0.07 respectively.","Contrast is calculated from the luminance of the foreground Yand that of the background Ysuch that: Contrast=2|Y\u2212Y|\/(Y+Y). It should be pointed out that since both contrast and size affect visibility, these values are combined by multiplying them together. While contrast ranges between 0 and 1, size can be unbounded. For a size to be bounded by 0 and 1, the object size is normalized by dividing it by the maximum size it can be. For example: visibility=contrast*(object area)\/(maximum area). In general, this is the area of the document. But, if objects are restricted to a page, the page size can be used.","The particular methods for evaluating an object's degree of visibility are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.

For example, one might locate the long paragraph in a group and ignore the short ones, or locate the middle paragraph of a list. The methods of measuring effective distinguishability can also be used for locatability. However, instead of comparing the object to its neighbors, the object is compared to its sibling members in the group.","Having calculated the EffectiveDistinguish value for the group element under consideration, with each of the other sibling members, the results can be combined as follows: DistinguishLocate=[(1\/n)\u03a3(c+EffectiveDistinguish)]\u2212c; where the sum is overall n sibling group members.

For example, pink and green go together much more harmoniously than pink and orange. Colors that clash will catch the eye. A contributor to the eye-catching property is therefore the color dissonance.","In the following discussion, the calculation of color dissonance is described for the objects that can be seen together (i.e. the objects on a page). If the document has multiple pages, then an average color dissonance value for all pages can be determined.","The color dissonance (or harmony) between two colors is largely determined by their hue difference (although the colors should have sufficient saturation and area to be noteworthy).","There are several methods known in the art for calculating an approximate hue value as an angle for the chrominance components. For example, using the E and S values described above one can define the hue as: h=arctan(S\/E)","As is well known in the art, special handling of the case E=0 is needed and checking signs to determine the quadrant should be done in order to avoid the confusion between E\/S and (\u2212E)\/(\u2212S).

first determine which hues, as illustrated in , are present with sufficient strength to matter. For each object on the page, calculate its color saturation and area as described above. Lightly saturated objects should not contribute strongly. One way to carry this out is to compare the saturation to a threshold and ignore objects with insufficient saturation (i.e. cmust be greater than Tc where Tc is the threshold).","Another approach is to weight the object area by saturation as in A\u2032=A*c. Other variations such as raising the saturation to a power before using it to weight the area are possible.","The identified colored areas can be summed across all the objects in order to determine how much area in each hue can be seen on the page. The areas can be collected in a table H of n possible hue buckets by means of a pseudocode expression such as: H[n*h]=H[n*h]+A\u2032 where his the hue of the iobject and A\u2032 is its weighted area.","To determine the color dissonance, compare every color hue found with every other color hue found. That is, compare all of the colors represented by the H table to one another. The H table tells the amount of area seen in each color hue and can be used to ignore cases where the total area of a color is too small to worry about. An alternative to collecting the colors for the objects on a page is to compare the color of each object with the color of its neighbors. Regardless of which method is used, the results from all comparisons must somehow be combined. A simple way of doing this is to just keep the maximum dissonance value encountered.

The dissonance table captures the model of color harmony and dissonance. A simple model is that the harmony of colors only depends on their hue difference and not the absolute hues themselves. Using this model, the dissonance table need only be indexed with the hue difference. An example of such a model is colors with hue angles that are similar (near 0 degrees apart) or opposite (180 degrees apart) or a third of the way round the hue circle (120 degrees apart) are considered harmonious while other hue angle differences are dissonant. The values stored in the dissonance table would look similar to those depicted graphically in .","Alternative calculations are possible. For example, one might weight each dissonance look-up by the product of the areas of the two color hues being considered and sum this weighted dissonance result over all comparisons. This sum should be normalized by dividing by the sum of all area products (without the dissonance result factored in). This calculation gives more of and overall average dissonance measure instead of a maximum dissonance. The particular methods for evaluating content color dissonance provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining color dissonance should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing amounts and types of color; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining color dissonance but also in the concept of using a color dissonance measure in the context of evaluating document eye-catching ability and document quality.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, another mechanism for catching the eye is to use large fonts. This makes the text readable from a distance and gives it a feeling of importance. This mechanism can be used when the document is presented in black and white. It is the maximum font size that is important here (not the average). It can be found by stepping through all the fonts used (or stepping through all the text and finding the fonts) and keeping track of the largest. The maximum font size found should be converted to a number between 0 and 1 for combination with the other measures.","A way to do this is as follows: V=f\/(fn+f) where f is the maximum font size found and fn is close to the typical font size found in documents (e.g. 8 or 10 point).","One can also consider weighting the largest font by a function the number of characters. However, while increasing the number of characters may make the document more eye-catching when only a few characters are present, the effect may diminish for large numbers of characters.","The impact of font size can be calculated by considering all of the fonts within a document simultaneously, however, an alternative would be to determine the impact of each page separately and then to combine the results of the pages. Combining page results could be done by a simple average, and this may be appropriate for documents such as presentations. However, for many documents it is sufficient for only one page to be eye-catching (e.g. the cover page) and it may be better to employ a non-linear combining method that gives a high score if any of the individual page contributions are high. Or alternatively, one might use a weighted average where the first page is weighted higher than the other.","The particular methods for evaluating font size impact provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining font size should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing sizes and types of fonts; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining a font size measure but also in the concept of using font and font size measures in the context of evaluating document eye-catching ability and document quality.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, page that is densely packed with information will typically require that information to be small and uniform and unlikely to catch the eye. This is not as hard-and-fast an indicator as color or font size because the information might, for example, be presented as a mixture of easy to ignore small black text and eye-catching large colored text. Never the less, one can use the information lightness (the inverse of information density) as another clue as to the documents eye-catching behavior.","For text, a rough measure of the information present is just the number of characters Nc used to encode the information. One might also consider alternative measures such as a count of the number of words.","For graphic figures, one can count the number of primitive graphical constructs (lines, rectangles, circles, arcs, strokes, triangles, polygons, etc.) used to build the figures. The count of graphic constructs Ng may be multiplied by a scaling value to normalize it with respect to the text measure.","Estimating the information content of pictorial images Np is more problematical. One simple approach is to just include a constant information estimation value for each image.","An alternative approach is to sum the variance of the pixel values from their neighborhood values and divide by the image area. Other schemes can also be used to estimate the information found in pictures. This estimate may also require a scaling factor to match its measure to that for text. The total information would then be: Nt=Nc+sg Ng+sp Np","The information density is the total information divided by the area of the document: Id=Nt\/Ad","To convert this to a number ranging between 0 and 1 one can again employ the following method: V=Id\/(a+Id) where a is a constant on the order of the typical information density value.","One can define the information lightness as the inverse of the information density as calculated by: V=1\u2212V","The particular methods for evaluating information density and lightness provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining information lightness should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing amounts and areas of information; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining information density or lightness, but also in the concept of using information lightness measures in the context of evaluating document eye-catching ability and document quality.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, pictures are more eye-catching than pure text. That is why there are pictures on paperback-book covers that are intended to attract viewers to purchase them, but only simple text inside to convey the story. Of course, not all pictures are equally interesting, and for a true measure of a picture eye-catching ability, some analysis of the picture content would be necessary. Still, the mere presence of any pictures in a document is generally an indicator of greater eye-catching ability. A simple measure of this is the fraction of the document area devoted to pictorial images Ap. A normalized measure is: Vp=Ap\/Ad","The particular method for evaluating picture fraction provided herein is exemplary and is not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining picture fraction should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing amounts of pictorial information; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining picture fraction but also in the concept of using a picture fraction measure in the context of evaluating document eye-catching ability and document quality.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, another indicator of how eye-catching a document is its novelty, that is, the presence of the unexpected or unconventional. Of course, to tell if something is unexpected or unconventional, one must first have some model of what is expected or conventional. Such models can be quite sophisticated and can include such factors as the type of document and its anticipated use. However, the use of novelty is illustrated with a simple model. That model is a single typical value expected for each style parameter.","Style parameters are the available choices that govern the appearance and presentation of the document. They can include the presence of backgrounds and borders, the thickness of borders and rules, paragraph indentation and separation, list indentation, list bulleting, font style, font weight and so on. Style parameters also include font size and color selections, which were considered separately above.","It is believed that it is proper to include color and font size in the estimation of novelty for completeness, but that they should also be singled out in the calculation of eye-catching ability since their contribution in this respect is much greater than would be explained by unconventionality alone.","In the simple model each style parameter Phas an anticipated value P. For any style parameter, but particularly for parameters with binary (or enumerated) choices, one can simply add in a constant novelty contribution nif the actual style Pdoes not match the expected value P. More sophisticated calculations are possible; for example, when the style parameter can vary continuously from the expected value (as perhaps in the case of rule width or font size). A function of the style difference can be calculated as the novelty contribution: n=F(P\u2212P)","For enumerated style values one can employ a table look-up to yield more flexibility and control over the novelty contribution. n=T[P]","The overall document novelty can be found by taking the average of the novel contributions for all style settings. Thus if the document had m style choices, the average novelty would be: Vn=\u03a3n\/m","The expected values Pcan be set a priori, or preferably can be found by examining the style settings of typical documents. If they are determined by analyzing documents, the analysis can be conducted on an on-going basis and they can be allowed to adapt to the current typical document style.","In more sophisticated models, the expected style value may depend upon the location of the content item within the document's logical structure. Thus, the expected font style for a heading might be weighted differently from the expected setting for the body text. But however it is calculated, novelty can provide a clue as to the documents ability to catch the eye.","The particular methods for evaluating novelty provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining novelty should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing styles. The present invention lies not only in the particular method of determining picture fraction but also in the concept of using a novelty measure in the context of evaluating document eye-catching ability and document quality.","A property of a document contributing to its quality that is similar to its eye-catching ability is the ability of the document to hold attention and interest. While a major contributor to the interest of a document is its subject matter, the presentation of that subject matter (the style and format) can affect the interest level as well. This invention provides a method of calculating an interest measure for the style and format decisions, calculated as a combination of simpler factors that contribute to interest. If any of the simpler interest factors is strongly present, then the overall effect is an interesting document.","Factors can include variety, change rate, emphasis, graphic fraction colorfulness, color dissonance, picture fraction, and\/or novelty. Calculation methods are defined for each of these factors and each are designed to produce a value ranging between 0 and 1, such that 0 means low or bad interest value, and 1 means high or good interest value. These (and possibly other such factors) can be calculated and combined to form an overall interest measure Vi. The separate factors can be combined by a method similar to that described above for the eye-catching ability property.","The particular methods for evaluating ability of the document to maintain interest provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining how well the document maintains interest should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing document characteristics with respect to the ability to maintain interest; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining the ability to maintain interest, but also in the much broader concept of using a combination of individual measures in the context of evaluating document interest and document quality.","As illustrated in , another parameter or factor used in determining interest is the measurement and quantization of the document's variety.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, one way to make a document interesting to look at is to include a variety of styles in its presentation. Style parameters are the available choices that govern the appearance and presentation of the document. They can include the presence of backgrounds and borders, the thickness of borders and rules, paragraph indentation and separation, list indentation, list bulleting, font style, font weight, font size, color selections and so on.","Style parameters can be grouped and associated with the logical structure of the content. For example, style parameters associated with a text string include the font family, font size, font style, font weight, and color.","Style parameters associated with a paragraph include the indentation, line length, line spacing, before and after spacing and quadding.","Style parameters associated with lists include left and right list indentation, bullet or numbering style, and bullet positioning.","In determining variety of style one is counting the number of styles present in the document, but this raises the question of just what constitutes a different style. Should style parameters be considered individually or as a group?","For example, if a document contains a 12-point bold weight font and a 10-point normal weight font, is that four styles (two sizes plus two weights) or just two styles (two fonts)? The answer for the preferred embodiment is two and the styles should be considered in combination.","But this still leaves the question of what combinations should be considered. If the 12-point bold is used in a list without bullets, and the 10-point normal is used in a list with bullets, is this still only two styles, or should the list styles and font styles be considered independently? This answer is less clear.","But, if one considers the correct grouping to be the entire set of style parameters so that whenever any style parameter changes a new overall style is generated, there is the potential of a combinational explosion of style instances. While this approach is not ruled out, the preferred method is to group the style parameters according to their associated content type (i.e. text styles, paragraph styles, graphic styles, list styles, table styles, content element background styles etc.).","Thus, in the above example, one would have two text styles and two list styles for four style choices in the document. This approach also avoids the problems arising from the growth of style parameters from the hierarchical structure of a document. If the document contains lists of lists of lists, the preferred approach gives three instances of the simple list style group instead of some new large group containing all the style choices of the structure.","To estimate the style variety, first decide what style parameters and parameter groups to include in the analysis. For example, one might decide to consider just the text, paragraph, and graphic styles. For text, consider font family, size, weight, style and color. For graphics, consider fill color, edge color and edge thickness. For paragraphs, consider line length, line spacing, quadding, and first-line indentation.","Three lists are constructed, one for each type of style group. The list elements contain the values of the style parameters for that group. One then steps through the document's logical structure, examining each logical element being analyzed for the style setting (in this example each text segment, graphic element and paragraph.) One considers the style parameter settings of each logical content element and checks the corresponding list to see if an entry has been made with a matching set of values.","If a matching list entry is found, nothing more need be done for this content element. If, however, the list does not contain a match, a new list element containing the new set of style values should be constructed and added to the list.","At the end of the document analysis, the lists should contain all of the style parameter combinations that were discovered. One can then simply count the number of list elements to determine the number of styles used. The sizes of all the lists should be combined into an overall style count. One can weight the list sizes when adding them together if one wishes to make the variety of one form of content count more than that of another (for example, one might make variety in paragraph style count more than variety in graphics). The result would be an overall weighted count of style changes s: s=\u03a3wswhere sis the size of the xstyle list and wis the weight.","In order to combine the style variety measure with the other contributions to interest, this weighted count should be converted to a number ranging between 0 and 1. This can be done as follows: V=s\/(a+s) where Vis the variety measure and ais a constant value about the size of the expected number of styles in a typical document.  is an example of high variety.","The particular methods for evaluating the variety of the document content and style provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining variety should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing document characteristics with respect to variety; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining variety, but also in the much broader concept of using variety measures in the context of evaluating document interest and document quality.","As illustrated in , another parameter or factor used in determining interest is the measurement and quantization of the document's change rate.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is not only the variety of styles in a document that holds interest, but also the rate at which the style changes. There may only be two style combinations represented, but if the document is frequently switching back and forth between them, it is more interesting than if it changes only once.","Calculating the style change rate is similar to calculating the style variety as described above, and uses the same style parameters and groupings. However, one need only to maintain for a single description of the most recently encountered style parameter set for each group (instead of a list of all previously encountered sets). For example, there would be a single set of most recently encountered text style parameters, a single set of the graphic style parameters and a set of the most recently encountered paragraph parameters. Step through the document's logical description and examine the style settings. Whenever a content element has style parameters that differ from those seen most recently, a count of the changes for that style group is incremented, and the new set of style values for use with the next content element is remembered. In a manner similar to the variety calculation, the change counts can be weighted and combined to form a total weighted change count c. c=\u03a3wcwhere cis the size of the xstyle group change count and wis the weight.","In order to combine the style change rate measure with the other contributions to interest, this weighted count should be converted to a number ranging between 0 and 1. This can be done as follows: V=c\/(a+c) where Vis the variety measure and ais a constant value about the size of the expected number of style changes in a typical document.  is an example of high change rate.","The particular methods for evaluating the change rate of the document style provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining change rate should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing document style characteristics with respect to perceived change rate; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining change rate, but also in the much broader concept of using change rate measures in the context of evaluating document interest and document quality.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, some font styles are chosen to emphasize the text. Large text, bold text, and underscored text all have an implied importance over the normal text presentation. This implied importance tells the reader to wakeup and pay attention. As such, it has a special contribution to the maintenance of viewer interest. One can calculate an average emphasis measure for the text in a document by summing an emphasis value for each character and then dividing by the total number of characters. V=\u03a3e(t)\/nc where Vis the emphasis measure, e is the emphasis function for character t, the sum is over all characters and nc is the total number of characters.","The function e(t) should include factors for the size of the text, its weight, its variant and its contrast (other factors such as font style might also be included). The larger the font size, the greater the emphasis, but one would like to have a factor that ranges between 0 and 1. An expression such as size(t)\/(a+size(t)), where ais a constant about the size of a typical font, will do this. The font weight (e.g. light, normal, bold, heavy) is typically an enumerated value and a table of suitable emphasis factors for each weight ew[weight(t)] can be used in the emphasis function. Similarly, the font variant (e.g. normal, underlined, strikethrough, outlined) can be handled as a table look-up such as ev[variant(t)].","Contrast also plays a role in the strength of text emphasis. Text with low contrast to the background will not have the same degree of impact as high contrast text. The luminance contrast can be calculated as described above as 2|Yb\u2212Yf|\/(Yb+Yf) where Yb is the luminance of the background and Yf=Lum(t) is the luminance of the text.","An example of an emphasis function is then:\n\n()=(size()\/(+size()))[weight()][variant()](2\u2212Lum()|\/(+Lum()))\n","Note that one might also include other characteristics such as the font style (e.g. italic). The particular methods for evaluating emphasis provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining emphasis should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing document style characteristics with respect to emphasis; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining emphasis, but also in the much broader concept of using emphasis measures in the context of evaluating document interest and document quality.","As illustrated in , another parameter or factor used in determining interest is the measurement and quantization of the document's graphical fraction.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, graphical constructs are often used to explain or illustrate concepts and ideas. They also add variety to the content. As such, graphics can make a document more interesting, and so, a measure of the graphical content should contribute to the estimation of how interesting the document is.","One simple measure of the graphical contribution is just a count of the graphical content objects encountered in the document.","An alternative approach is to sum the areas of the bounding boxes that enclose each of the graphical content objects encountered. This sum can then be divided by the total area of the document to yield a number ranging between 0 and 1.","A third approach is to examine the graphical content objects in greater detail and to count the primitive drawing objects such as lines, curves, rectangles, polygons and ellipses from which they are constructed. This approach gives a better measure of the complexity of the graphic and possibly a better measure of how interesting that graphic is. The counts for the various drawing primitives can be weighted to indicate how interesting that drawing primitive is (for example, an ellipse might be considered more interesting than a rectangle) and summed to give an overall weighted graphic count: g=\u03a3wgwhere gis the count of the xtype of graphic construct and wis the weight.","In order to combine the graphic fraction measure with the other contributions to interest, this weighted count should be converted to a number ranging between 0 and 1. This can be done as follows: V=g\/(a+g) where Vis the variety measure and ais a constant value about the size of the expected number of graphic drawing primitives in a typical document.","An alternative is to divide the count of graphic drawing primitives, by a count of the total drawing primitives Nin the document (including characters and images). This approach removes the dependence on the document size. V=g\/N.  illustrates an example of a high graphical fraction.","The particular methods for evaluating graphic fraction provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining graphic fraction should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing document style characteristics with respect to emphasis; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining graphic fraction, but also in the much broader concept of using graphic fraction measures in the context of evaluating document interest and document quality.","Several of the factors that attract attention and catch the viewer's eye, will also serve to hold the attention and interest. One can list the properties of colorfulness, color dissonance, picture fraction, and novelty as examples of this joint use. The difference in behavior between attention and interest is one of relative importance or weight. Colorfulness, for example, can be very important in catching the eye, but less important in maintaining interest. Novelty, on the other hand, can be more important to maintaining interest than it is to capturing attention. Methods for estimating the strength of these four measures were described above.","The particular methods for evaluating colorfulness, color dissonance, picture fraction, and novelty provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.

In , the quantized interest value is derived by a combining of the variety, change rate, emphasis, graphic fraction, colorfulness, color dissonance, picture fraction, and\/or novelty using an interest quantizer or combiner circuit .","It is noted that the illustration shows a circuit for the eye-catching ability quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and\/or firmware. The quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and\/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.","Another factor contributing to the quality of a document design is how well that design aids in communicating the information contained within the document to the user. The present invention provides a method of calculating such a communicability measure.","As with aesthetics and ease-of-use, the approach to quantifying communicability is to evaluate factors identified as contributing to the effectiveness of the communication. These factors are then combined to form a composite measure. The factors contribute to the quality of the document design. If any of the simpler communicability factors is absent, then the overall ability of the document to communicate is reduced.","Component factors can include legibility, information lightness, technical level, text and image balance, red-green friendliness, ease of progression, and\/or ease of navigation. Each factor can be defined such as to produce a value ranging between 0 and 1, where 0 means low or bad communicability value and 1 means high or good communicability value. These, (and possibly other such factors), can be calculated and combined to form an overall communicability measure in a manner similar to that described above for aesthetics. If Vis the value calculated for the irule, then the communicability measure Vis formed as a function E of these contributions: V=E(V, V, V, V, V, V. . . V)","The combining function E can be as simple as a weighted average of the contributions, but because any bad contributor can lead to a poor communicating document, no matter how good the others are, a linear combination is not preferred. An alternative is to use: V=(\u03a3w(d+V))\u2212d Here d is a number slightly larger than 0. The closer the value of d to 0, the more strongly a bad value will cancel all other values. The wfactors are the weights that specify the relative importance of each rule; they should sum to 1. The exponent p introduces a nonlinearity that can also increase the strength by which one bad value can overwhelm many good ones. The larger p is, the greater this effect.","Other combining functions are possible as mentioned above. The particular methods for evaluating ability of the document to communicate provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining how well the document communicates should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing document characteristics with respect to the ability to communicate; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining the ability to communicate, but also in the much broader concept of using a combination of individual measures in the context of evaluating document communicability and document quality.","A combination of measures, as illustrated in , is useful in evaluating the document's communicability.","More specifically, the communicability, as illustrated in , is considered a combination of legibility, information lightness, technical level, text and image balance, red-green friendliness, ease of progression, and\/or ease of navigation.

In , the quantized legibility value is derived by a combining of the decipherability, line retrace, relative line separation, and\/or quadding using a legibility quantizer or combiner circuit .","It is noted that the illustration shows a circuit for the legibility quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and\/or firmware. The quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and\/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, one of the first and foremost factors in estimating a document's communication effectiveness is the legibility of its text. Legibility measures the ease of following and recognizing the words of the document when reading. Legibility is itself a property that can be broken down into contributing components. As noted above, chief among these components is decipherability, line retrace, relative line separation, and\/or quadding. Other factors that might also be considered include the word and character spacing and the use of hyphenation.","A combination of measures, as illustrated in , is useful in evaluating the document's decipherability.","More specifically, the decipherability, as illustrated in , is considered a combination of display device properties, font, character familiarity, and\/or luminance contrast. In , the quantized legibility value is derived by a combining of the display device properties, font, character familiarity, and\/or luminance contrast using a decipherability quantizer or combiner circuit .","It is noted that the illustration shows a circuit for the decipherability quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and\/or firmware. The quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and\/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, decipherability, the most complex of the legibility factors, measures the ability to recognize the letter shapes. It can itself be further broken down into simpler pieces. As noted above, factors that contribute to the decipherability include the display device, the font, the character familiarity, and\/or the luminance contrast.","The properties of the display device and the font may often be considered together; that is, one determines how decipherable a particular font is on a particular device. For example, fonts with serifs are, as a rule, easier to decipher than san serif fonts; but on a device that cannot effectively produce serifs, this may not be true. The font family, font size, font weight, font style, and font variant all can contribute to the decipherability.","An approach to dealing with the effect of font specification and device choice is to measure by experiment the decipherability (the ability to correctly determine the character presented) for a fully specified font on a particular device. This measurement can then be handled as a font property. Given the font specification one can then look up the font's decipherability contribution in a font table (df=DF[font specification]).","If the font is to be displayed on the same type of device as was used for the measurement, the font contribution will not require further adjustment for the device. However, if a different display device type is used, then some sort of adjustment is needed. For example, fonts are, in general, much more decipherable when printed on paper than when presented on a CRT display. An example of an adjustment to the font decipherability is to multiply it by an adjustment factor ad for the display device.","One way to determine the adjustment factor is as a function of the smallest font size that the device is capable of effectively presenting. The function could, for example, be the ratio of the smallest effective text size for the device used in measuring the font decipherability to the smallest effective text size for the display to actually be used. For example, if the font properties were measured on a CRT that could effectively display only 8-point or larger fonts, but was to be printed on paper that could support 4-point fonts or larger, then the device adjustment factor should be 2. One may wish to adjust this factor according to the font size actually used because the effect of the display may be less important for large text.","The ease in correctly deciphering a character depends upon the familiarity with it. Reading all caps is harder than reading normal text. Numbers and punctuation characters each have their own degree of difficulty. Thus, another adjustment factor ac for the familiarity of a character should be multiplied in. This adjustment factor can be found from a table indexed by the character code.","The contrast of the character with the background also contributes to the decipherability. It is harder to decipher light yellow characters on a white background than to decipher black ones. A third adjustment factor is the luminance contrast that can be calculated as was described above for locatability: al=2|Yb\u2212Yt|\/(Yb+Yt) where Yb is the luminance of the background and Yt is the luminance of the text.","The overall decipherability for a character is therefore given by: dc=df ad ac al","An average overall decipherability d, for a string of text, can be found by finding the sum of the decipherability measures for each character in the string and then dividing by the total count of characters in the string.","The particular methods for evaluating decipherability provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining decipherability should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing document text characteristics with respect to decipherability; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining decipherability, but also in the much broader concept of using decipherability measures in the context of evaluating document legibility, communicability and document quality.","As illustrated in , another parameter or factor used in determining legibility is the measurement and quantization of the document's line retrace.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the second factor contributing to text legibility is the length of the text lines. There is some cost in moving the eye from the end of one line to the start of the next, but the cost increases with the length of the line. This cost is included by multiplying the decipherability by a line retrace factor r. An example of a function that can be used for this factor is: r=B\/(n+B) where B is a constant (with value on the order of 3600) and n is the average number of characters per line.","In , the retracing of the group of lines  makes it more difficult for the reader to find the next line due to the long length of the text line. On the other hand, in , the retracing of the group of lines  makes it easier for the reader to find the next line due to the short length of the text line.","The particular methods for evaluating line retrace characteristics with respect to legibility provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining line retrace effects on legibility should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing document text line characteristics with respect to line retrace and legibility; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining line retrace characteristics, but also in the much broader concept of using line retrace measures in the context of evaluating document legibility, communicability and document quality.","As illustrated in , another parameter or factor used in determining legibility is the measurement and quantization of the document's relative line separation.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the third contribution to legibility is the relative line separation. Increasing the separation between line acts to improve legibility. It makes it easier for the eye to track correctly from the end of a line to the start of the next line. The effect of lines separation is included by means of a line separation factor s. An example of a function that can be used is as follows: s=y\/(y+g) where g is a constant (e.g. 0.1) that controls how legibility improves with line separation, and y is a biased relative separation defined by: y=(hL\u2212hf)\/hf+bs where hL is the height of the line (baseline to baseline) hf is the height of the font and bs is a small biasing term (e.g. 0.1) to indicate just how far lines must overlap before they become unreadable.","In , the relative line separation of the group of lines  makes it more difficult for the reader to find the next line due to the closely packed text lines. On the other hand, in , the relative line separation of the group of lines  makes it easier for the reader to find the next line due to the widely spaced text lines.","The particular methods for evaluating relative line separation effect on legibility provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.

Left-aligned unjustified text is easiest to read, and justified text is almost as easy. Center-aligned text is more difficult and right aligned is the hardest of all. A factor for the effect of the quadding can be stored in the table and looked up for the legibility calculation of text t. q=Q[quadding(t)]","The particular methods for evaluating contribution from quadding to legibility provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.

Combining can be done by a simple average, but it may be preferred to use a non-linear method such that a low legibility score on any paragraph can result in a lower overall score that would be obtained by a simple average. Methods such as the root of the average of powers that have been described can be used to achieve this effect.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0534","num":"0533"},"figref":["FIG. 70","FIG. 71","FIG. 72","FIG. 73"]},"The particular methods for evaluating document legibility provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.

In general, a short road sign communicates more effectively than a long one. The information lightness, (the inverse of information density), of a document is included as another factor in how well it communicates. This factor is not nearly as important as legibility and is weighted accordingly.","A method for calculating information lightness was described in the discussion of eye-catching ability.","The particular methods for evaluating information density and lightness provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.

The use of pictures reduces the technical level measure. Picture fraction was defined above as: Fp=Ap\/Ad where Ap is the area of the pictures and Ad is the total area of the document.","One actually needs the inverse behavior of the picture fraction, so that as Fp increases, the technical level decreases. Using Fnp=1\u2212Fp is possible, but a few images can make a big difference in the technical level, while as more images are added, the benefits may fall off.

Thus, some method other that weighting by area may be preferred for combining friendliness values. An alternative is to look for the minimum value as in: V=MIN(Frg)","A third approach combines features of the above two methods. The values are weighted by area, but values are raised to a power in a way that emphasizes low values.

Ease of progression measures the difficulty in progressing from one document component to the next component in logical order; for example, in moving from the bottom of one column to the top of the next. An estimation of the ease of progression is calculated as a composite of several properties, each of which aids in the progression process.

This count should be divided by some measure of the size of the document (such as the number of content objects NO) in order to get a link density.\n\n\n","A better measure may be obtained by dividing the count of the references by a count of all the points at which the progression does not follow the typical scan order NSO. The conventional western scan order is that the next logical content element should be aligned with and to the right or below the current object. One can examine the positions of the content elements in their logical order and count the instances when this rule is not followed. These are the cases where a reference to redirect the reader would be most helpful and one can calculate the ratio of references to breaks in scan order. This will typically be a number between 0 and 1, but is not guaranteed to be confined to values 1 or less. To restrict the range, function such as those used above for confining the range can be used, but in this case a simple clamping the value to 1 should be sufficient.

This is the convention followed by text, but it can also be applied to other objects (such as the panes in a comic book). For this convention, one expects the items to have about the same height and to be aligned in rows. The left edge of the rows should be vertically aligned.

For each element find a bounding box that contains the object and indicates the position of its top yt, bottom yb, left side xl and right side xr. As one steps through the objects, the vertical position of the new object (ytn, ybn) is compared with that of the old object (yto, ybo). Objects should be placed to the right and below, but not above, so a deviation amount should be added to a deviation accumulation dcs for the degree to which the new object is above the old.

While progression measures the ease or difficulty of moving through the document in the order intended by the creator, ease of navigation measures the ability to locate an arbitrary element of the document. In estimating the ease of navigation one looks mainly for those features that can aid in finding an element or section. In the example method provided here includes headings, list bullets and numbers, running heads and page numbers, internal links, and\/or group identity. These properties each contribute to the ease of navigation and an overall measure can be created from a weighted average. V=wV+wV+wV+wV+wVwhere the w's are the weights and the V's are the value properties. Note that alternative methods of combination, as well as additional contributing factors, are possible.

For running heads, a measure of their value is the number of different heads divided by the number of pages. One can find this by examining the document for the heads and making a list of the distinct ones. Then one can count the number of heads in the list. For page numbers, one just asks whether or not they are present and if they are, one can add a contribution to the measure. V=wh Nh\/Np+(1\u2212wh)Bpn where wh is the weight given to running heads, Nh is the number of distinct heads, Np is the number of pages in the document, and Bpn is 1 if there are page numbers and 0 otherwise.","The particular methods for evaluating contribution from the page numbers to ease of navigation and communicability provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.

The measures of headings, list bullets and numbers and internal links can be captured as described.","In the discussion on ease of progression one measured the fraction of progressive links. For ease of navigation one wants to count the total number of internal links or references (not just the progressive ones). This will include the entries in a table of contents and in an index as well as references or links within the main body of the document. As suggested above, one can normalize the count by dividing by the number of content objects: V=MINIMUM(1, NLT\/NO) where NLT is the total number of internal links and NO is the number of content objects.","In trying to find one's way around in a document it is helpful to know when one group of content ends and another begins. Thus, there should be a contribution to the ease of navigation from the group identity measure. This is another measure that is also used in the ease of progression estimation.

A method for quantifying the document comfort level will be described next.","Comfort is calculated as a combination of simpler properties or rules. Violating any of the component rules can result in discomfort and ruin the overall comfort of the document layout. Component rules can include limitation of font forms, limitation of colors, grouping number, neatness, decipherability, non-intimidating, conventionality, color harmony, color appropriateness, consistency of luminance, and\/or consistency of size. Each rule is defined to produce a value ranging between 0 and 1 such that 0 means low or bad comfort value and 1 means high or good comfort value. These (and possibly other such rules) can be calculated and combined to form an overall comfort measure. If Vi is the value calculated for the irule, then the comfort measure Vis formed as a function E of these contributions: V=E(V, V, V, V, V, V, V, V, V, V, . . . V)","The combining function E can be as simple as a weighted average of the contributions, but because any bad contributor can ruin the comfort no matter how good the others are, a linear combination is not preferred. An alternative is to use: V=[\u03a3w(d+V)]\u2212d. The wfactors are the weights that specify the relative importance of each rule; they should sum to 1. The exponent p introduces the nonlinearity that can make one bad value overwhelm many good ones. The larger p is, the greater this effect. The constant d is a positive number near 0 and guards against division by 0.","Other combining functions are possible; for example, one could take the product of the contributions. If weighting of the contribution is desired, this can be done by exponentiation (using a different set of weight values).\n\nV=\u03a0V\n","Note that the set of rules chosen is illustrative of how a comfort measure can be constructed. Other factors contributing to comfort exist and could certainly be included in a more sophisticated quantification of comfort.

Other methods for determining the document comfort should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing document characteristics with respect to the feeling of comfort; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining the comfort level, but also in the much broader concept of using a combination of individual measures in the context of evaluating document comfort level and document quality.","A combination of measures, as illustrated in , is useful in evaluating the document's comfort.","More specifically, the comfort, as illustrated in , is considered a combination of limitation of font forms, limitation of colors, grouping number, neatness, decipherability, non-intimidating, conventionality, color harmony, color appropriateness, consistency of luminance, and\/or consistency of size.

The quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and\/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, fonts have many properties that can be selected to achieve different effects. Font families can be chosen to give the document different feelings, from formal to playful, light to serious, modem to classical. Font size can affect the cost and legibility. Font weights such as bold, can convey importance; font styles, such as italic, can indicate that it is special. Font variants such as strikethrough or outlined can add further meaning.","If, however, a single document contains too many different font forms, the result is disquieting. Such \u201cransom note\u201d documents are considered bad style because they lead to discomfort in the reader. The first factor that shall be considered as contributing to viewer comfort is the limitation of the number of font forms. Any change in the font specification (family, size, weight, style or variant) yields a new form. The document can be examined, and the number of distinct font forms Nf can be counted. This can be converted to a number ranging from near 0 (for the case of many font forms) to 1 (for when there is no more than a single font form) by the expression: V=1\/MAXIMUM(1,Nf)","However, more sophisticated measures are possible. One can, for example, include as part of the measure just how different the fonts are from one another. This can be done by first constructing a list, F, of all the font forms that appear in the document. One can then compare every font form in the list to every other font form and accumulate a measure of their differences. For fonts of different sizes, one can make the measure a function of the size difference (such as its absolute value). For font weights, one can add to the measure a function of the weight difference. Since weights are usually limited to a small set of choices, tables FW[weight(f), weight(f)] can be used to describe the weight difference function. Contributions due to differences in family style and variant can also be captured in tables, or a single constant amount af can be added whenever any difference in any of these properties occurs. Comparing every font form to every other font form results in differences accumulating on the order of the square of the number of fonts. To be more in line with the first simpler measure, one can divide by the number of fonts.

A document with lots of colors is considered garish. The viewer tries to make sense of the colors and a large number makes this a difficult and uncomfortable task. A large number of colors will tire the eye. A simple measure of the effect is just a count of the number of different colors found within the document. This can be determined by stepping through the document, identifying the colors and saving them in a list (or other data structure such as a tree or hash table). As each color is encountered it can be compared to the colors already in the list to determine whether or not it has been seen before. If it is a new color then it is added to the list. After the document has been processed, the number of entries in the list can be counted to give the total number of colors Nc. This can be converted to a number ranging from near 0 (for many colors) to 1 (for no more than a single color) by the expression: V=1\/MAXIMUM(1, Nc)","The above scheme works for constant, uniform colors such as typically used in graphics, but does not address how to handle color sweeps or the huge number of colors seen in pictorial images. For color sweeps one can restrict the list entry to only the first and last colors of the sweep. For pictorial images, one can ignore them altogether, or extract a few colors from the image by subsampling, or extract a few colors by a cluster analysis of the image values in color space.","The test for whether a color is already in the list does not have to be a strict match. One can compare colors by computing the distance between them in color space and comparing the distance to a threshold. If the distance is below the threshold, the colors can be considered close enough to match, and a new color list entry is not needed.","The comfort can depend on the choice of colors as well as the number of them. One might therefore compare the colors of the document pair-wise and accumulate a measure of their compatibility. A simple value to accumulate would be the distance between the colors in a color space, but a better measure of the affect on comfort would be the color dissonance of the pair. Since comparing colors pair-wise accumulates values as the square of the number of colors, one can divide the total by the number of colors in the document to get a measure that varies linearly with the number of colors.","Not every color is equally tiring on the eye and more sophisticated measures can take this into account. Strongly saturated colors have more of an effect than neutral ones. There are several possible ways to calculate an approximate saturation value that can be used in augmenting its discomfort contribution. These were described in the above discussion on colorfulness under the eye-catching ability property.","For each color in the list, one can add a contribution to a total color discomfort measure. The contribution can be a function of the saturation. For example, for the icolor with saturation c, the contribution might be ac+cwhere ac is a constant value representing the effect of just having another color, and cis the additional discomfort due to that color's saturation. dc=ac Nc+\u03a3cwhere dc is the color discomfort measure.","It is also possible to keep track of the total document area rendered in each color and include a function of both the saturation and the area in the augmentation of the discomfort calculation. The idea here is that the effect of a large colored area is stronger than the effect of a small one.","An expression such as: V=1\/(bc+dc) where bc is a small positive constant, can be used to convert the discomfort measure into a limitation of color measure that varies between 0 and 1.","The particular methods for evaluating contribution from the limitation of colors to document comfort level provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.

A group should not have too many or too few elements, and odd numbers are preferred over even. The best size for a group is 3 elements. A simple expression for the comfort of a group number is: Gc=1\/(eg+ag(1\u2212MOD(eg))) where eg is the number of elements in the group, ag is a constant that gives the added discomfort of a even number of elements, and MOD is a function that give 0 if its argument is even and 1 if it is odd.","For an entire document, one needs some method of averaging the grouping number comfort values over all groups. For example, if there are Ng groups in the document and the comfort value of the igroup is Gc, then the simple average over all groups yields: V=\u03a3Gc\/Ng","More complex averaging schemes are possible.

One can quantify neatness as a combination of contributing factors. In many cases it is easier to identify a factor that makes a document messy and uses the inverse of such factors. An example of a neatness measure is offered based on the text neatness, border and background presence, alignment, and\/or regularity. Neatness estimates that employ additional factors are possible. In combining the component neatness measures, assume that any source of messiness will destroy the overall neatness (just as was argued for overall comfort).","A similar combining formula can be used.

One can step through the document examining the text, considering every word, space, and punctuation. For words (and punctuation) determine a neatness value based on the font used (f). Consider the font family, style and variant when estimating the font (un)neatness or messiness.

The layout placement of content objects should follow one of these two rules to achieve a consistent model between logical order and layout position. However, the layout need not follow both models simultaneously. One should therefore combine the consistency of scan Vand the consistency of order Vinto an overall consistency of position V. A simple way to do this is: V=MAXIMUM(V, V)","A more sophisticated alternative is the following: V=dcp\u2212(((dcp\u2212V)+(dcp\u2212V))\/2)where dcp is a constant slightly larger than 1 and p is also a number 1 or greater.","A combination of measures, as illustrated in , is useful in evaluating the document's consistency of position.","More specifically, the consistency of position, as illustrated in , is considered a combination of consistency of scan and\/or consistency of order.

A measure of legibility Vwas defined above as a contributor to a document's communicability. It can contribute to convenience as well as communicability but with a different weight. In fact, one could argue that communicability, as a whole, should be used as a contributor to convenience. While this is not ruled out, the example here will just include a few of the components of communicability that have particular bearing on convenience. Considering them separately allows one to give them different weights when contributing to convenience than those used for the contribution to communicability.","The particular methods for evaluating contribution from legibility to document convenience level provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.

For example, a document of only text can be read to someone who is blind, but a document with images would be much harder to convey. Another example of a contributor to a disability proof measure is the red-green friendliness property that was defined in the above discussion on how well a document communicates. The idea behind the measure is that there should be either luminance contrast or blue-yellow contrast between foreground and background colors in order to be red-green friendly. Without this contrast it would be difficult for a colorblind person to distinguish foreground object from background. This measure will be used as an example of a simple disability proof function, V. Additional functions for other handicaps are certainly possible and could be combined into a more sophisticated measure.","The particular methods for evaluating contribution from disability compensation characteristics to document convenience level provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.

They contribute to convenience as well as communicability, and, in fact, are more important (and have larger weights) as convenience measures than as communicability measures. The idea behind the calculation of these properties is to estimate and combine contributing features such as distinguishability, group identity, spatial coherence, list bullets, headings, internal links, alignment and others.","The particular methods for evaluating contribution from ease of navigation or ease of progression to document convenience level provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.

Locatability is a measure of how easy it is to find a document object (whereas ease of navigation is how easy it is to find a document location). Searchability is a rougher measure that looks for the presence of document features that aid in locating document objects. These measures have been described above in the discussion of measures for the ease of use of content groups.","The particular methods for evaluating contribution from searchability or locatability to document convenience level provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.

If the document is displayed on a workstation, some entire content groups may not fit completely into the display window. This inability to view the logical group as a unit can be a hindrance and should reduce the document's convenience measure.","To estimate the viewable fraction for a group displayed on a workstation, first find the bounding size (width and height of the group (wg, hg). Next find the size of the typical display window (wp, hp). The viewable width and height is the minimum of the group and window dimensions.\n\n=MINIMUM()\n\n=MINIMUM()\n\nThe measure of unity of display for the group is then given by ratio of the visible area to group area: U=(wv hv)\/(wg hg)\n","For the case where the group has been split over pages, one can construct a measure by first finding the area of the group elements on each page (e.g. Agfor page p). Next find the maximum area among the pieces and divide it by the total group area.

Recognize that the level of the group within the documents logical tree structure should make a difference. One would be much less likely to expect or need high-level groups to be seen as a unit than the low level groups near the bottom of the tree. First sort the groups by their tree level and find a simple average value for each level (i.e. Uav L). Then combine the average values for the levels weighted by a function of the level: V=\u03a3w(L)Uav L\/\u03a3w(L)","The weighting function w(L) should increase with increasing level such as w(L)=a L for a constant a.","The particular methods for evaluating contribution from viewable fraction to document convenience level provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.

The transmission time is a product of the size of the document file and the bandwidth of the communications channel. While processing time can also depend upon the types of objects that the document contains and on the type of processing being done, a rough estimate can be formed as the product of the file size and a processing speed factor. One can therefore use the file size as a rough indicator of these time costs. To convert file size S into a value between 0 and 1 one can use the expression: V=at\/(at+S) where at is a constant that is about the typical document file size.","The particular methods for evaluating contribution from transmission time or processing time to document convenience level provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.

Costs arise in several ways. For printed documents, there is the cost of the materials required (the paper and the ink). There is also a cost in the effort required to print the document (labor and press time). Material cost may not apply to documents viewed on electronic displays, but there is the cost to transmit and store the document. There is also the cost in the time the viewer spends waiting while the document is transmitted, or while it is being processed for display. Many of these costs depend upon the size of the document (such as described above for transmission and processing time). However, other properties can also have an effect. For example, the size of the fonts can affect the amount of paper needed for printing, and the presence of color can affect the cost of the ink.","The above described quality quantization process can be utilized in many systems.

The first printer prints documents received from the document processing system. The first printer has a particular set of characteristics when printing a document which affects the resulting printed image of the document, such as margins or a particular paper size on which the document is printed.

The portion of the document selected is the portion that needs re-layout or adjustment. The original document can be obtained in a variety of different manners, such as retrieved from the web, from an e-mail attachment, from another computer system, or from a document created by the operator.","Next, the document processing system compares one or more elements of the selected portion of the original document against the same types of elements in portions of a plurality of other stored documents obtained from memory storage device, although other types of comparisons of other numbers and types of elements and other portions could be used.

The document processing system identifies the device based on instructions received from an operator using user input device requesting a particular device to display the original document, although other ways of identifying the display device can be used, such as a programmed selection in the memory storage device of document processing system to use a particular printer for a print job.","As part of the identification process, the document processing system obtains information from memory storage device about the characteristics of the device, although other ways of obtaining information about the characteristics of the device can be used, such as an inquiry by the document processing system to the device, such as printer, for the information.","The document processing system determines which of the one or more mutators obtained from the identified, stored document to use on the selected portion of the original document. The document processing system determines which of the mutators to use based on the characteristics of the device on which the original document is going to be displayed and based on one or more elements of the original document, although other manners for determining which of the mutators to select can be used.","For example, if the first printer selected for the printing job is a black-and-white printer, a mutator for altering color obtained from the identified, stored document is irrelevant and would not used by the document processing system.","In another example, the document processing system could have lists of mutators stored in memory which are associated with particular types of documents, such as for text documents, documents with text and images, and documents with images, and then the document processing system would determine to use the obtained mutators that were on appropriate stored list for the type of document that matches the portion of the original document or the original document.","The document processing system also determines using one or more algorithms for document layout stored in memory storage device and one or more other style sheets stored in memory storage device one or more other mutators to apply to the selected portion of the original document, although other manners for determining which, if any, other the mutators to use can be implemented.","The following is a description of a preferred embodiment of the algorithms and methods used for determining mutators and other parameters for document layout, which are stored as programmed instructions for execution by document processing system.","In determining mutators and other parameters for document layout, the document is modeled as a constraint optimization problem which combines both required constraints with non-required design constraints that act as optimization criteria. One of a set of many existing constraint optimization algorithms is then used to solve the problem, resulting in an automatically generated document that is well designed because it has optimized some specified design criteria.","In particular, a document template is represented as a constraint optimization problem, and therefore contains a set of variables, a value domain for each variable, a set of required constraints, and a set of desired constraints (i.e. optimization functions).","The areas of the document to be filled with content are modeled as problem variables, as are any parameters of the document that can be changed.","As an example, a template specifies that there are two areas that should be filled with content: areaA and areaB. The template also specifies that the positions and sizes of areaA and areaB can be changed. Thus, the problem variables for this example are: areaA, areaB, areaA-topLeftX, areaA-topLeftY, areaB-topLeftX, areaB-topLeftY, areaA-width, areaA-height, areaB-width, and areaB-height.","The constraint optimization formulation further specifies that each problem variable has a value domain consisting of the possible values to assign to that variable. For variables that are document areas to be filled with content (e.g., areaA and areaB), the value domains are the content pieces that are applicable to each area. For variables that are document parameters, the value domains are discretized ranges for those parameters, so that each potential value for the parameter appears in the value domain e.g., 1 . . . MAXINT]. For variables whose value domains are content pieces, the default domain is set up to be all possible content pieces in the associated content database, which is specified in the document template.","The required constraints specify relationships between variables and\/or values that must hold in order for the resulting document to be valid. The desired constraints specify relationships between variables and\/or values that we would like to satisfy, but aren't required in order for the resulting document to be valid. Constraints may be unary (apply to one value\/variable), binary (apply to two values\/variables), or n-ary (apply to n values\/variables), and in our invention are entered by the user as part of the document template.","An example of a required unary constraint in the document domain is: areaA must contain an image of a castle. An example of a required binary constraint is: areaA-topLeftY+areaA-height<areaB-topLeftY. If we had another variable (areaC), an example of a required 3-ary constraint is: areaA-width+areaB-width>areaC-width. In a variable data application of this invention (one of many possible applications), the constraints would also refer to customer attributes (e.g., areaA must contain an image that is appropriate for customer.age).","Desired constraints are represented as objective functions to maximize or minimize. For example, a desired binary constraint might be the objective function: f=areaA-width*areaA-height, to be maximized. If more than one objective function is defined for the problem, the problem becomes a multi-criteria optimization problem. If it is a multi-criteria optimization problem, we sum the individual objective function scores to produce the overall optimization score for a particular solution. We can furthermore weight each of the desired constraints with a priority, so that the overall optimization score then becomes a weighted sum of the individual objective function scores.","Any one of the known existing constraint optimization algorithms is then applied to create the final output document. This invention further describes a means to use a genetic algorithm (one of the many possible constraint optimization algorithms) for doing the constraint optimization and thereby automatically creating a final output document that adheres not only to the required constraints, but also to a set of desired constraints.","In the genetic algorithm formulation of constraint optimization for document creation, the genome is built such that each gene in the genome is a variable of the constraint problem. The unary constraints are used to set up the allowable value domains for each gene. These can be some default range, or input by the user.","The fitness function is defined such that it returns a fitness of 0 for any population members that do not meet the required constraints, and for the members that do meet the required constraints, it returns a fitness score that is a sum of the scores of the individual desired constraints. For instance, if we have the required constraints:","C: areaA-width<300","C: areaB-width<300","And the desired constraints:","C: areaA-width=areaB-width, to be maximized (ranges from 0 to 1)","C: areaA-height=areaB-height, to be maximized (ranges from 0 to 1)","Examples of fitness function for these desired constraints are","f=1\u2212|areaA-width\u2212areaB-width|\/(areaA-width+areaB-width)","f=1\u2212|areaA-height\u2212areaB-height|\/(areaA-width+areaB-height)","If we have a population member with areaA-width=350, areaA-height=350, areaB-width=400, areaB-height=200, the fitness function returns a score of 0. If, however, we have a population member with areaA-width=300, areaA-height=200, areaB-width=300, areaB-height=200, the fitness function returns a score of 2. If we have a population member with areaA-width=225, areaA-height=200, areaB-width=300, areaB-height=200, the fitness function returns a score of 1.875.","Our formulation also extends to allow weighting of the various desired constraints. Thus, the document creator can specify that certain desired constraints are more important than others. For instance, we could have constraint C weighted with an importance of 1.5, and C weighted with an importance of 0.5, meaning that the two objects having the same width is more important than the two objects having the same height. The fitness function's overall score is then computed as a weighted sum of the individual desired constraints.","For instance, if we have a population member with areaA-width=225, areaA-height=200, areaB-width=300, areaB-height=200, desired constraint C returns 0.875, which is multiplied by C's weight of 1.5, to get 1.286. Desired constraint C returns 1, which is multiplied by C's weight of 0.5, to get 0.5. The overall fitness score is then 1.125+0.5=1.786.","If, on the other hand, we have a population member with areaA-width=300, areaA-height=200, areaB-width=300, areaB-height=150, desired constraint C returns 1, which is multiplied by C's weight of 1.5 to get 1.5. Desired constraint C returns 0.875, which is multiplied by C's weight of 0.5, to get 0.438. The overall fitness score is then 1.5+0.438=1.938, thereby preferring the solution that violates C the least.","In the genetic algorithm implementation, an initial population of chromosomes is created by selecting values for each gene, and doing this for the desired number of population members. We evaluate each member of this population according to the fitness function, resulting in a score for each population member. We then select the most fit individuals (i.e., best fitness score) as parents for the new population, and create a new population from the parents using crossover\/mutation operations. We iterate through populations until we reach a specified stopping condition (e.g., a certain number of iterations are complete, or until we have crossed a minimum threshold for the fitness function).","Thus, each genome is evaluated according to how well it satisfies or achieves the design qualities along with the other required constraints. This evaluation results in a generated document that not only satisfies the required constraints, but that is also optimized for the specified design qualities.","The document processing system determines an order or sequence for applying the one or more obtained mutators and the one or more determined mutators to the selected portion of the original document. In these particular embodiments, the document processing system determines the order based on the order the obtained mutators were used in the identified, stored document, although other manners for determining the order for applying the mutators could be used.","For example, the ordering may be a learned function based on noting the effectiveness of orderings on the document quality measure. In another example, the selected order for applying mutators could be based on a predetermined priority order for applying mutators which is stored in memory. The document processing system would determine where each of the obtained mutators occurred in the stored priority order and then would base the order of applying the mutators based on this determination.","The document processing system applies the selected one or more obtained mutators and the one or more determined mutators in the determined ordered order to the selected portion of the original document.","The document processing system stores the selected portion of the original document with the applied mutators as one of the stored documents in memory storage device. The newly stored portion of the original document can now be used to assist with determining the layout of other portions of the original document or of other documents to be displayed.","The document processing system determines if another portion of the original document should be selected for determining a dynamic document layout. If one or more additional portions in the original document are desired to be selected, for example if other portions of the original document have not already been selected, the process for determining a dynamic document layout begins again for the newly selected portion of the original document in the same manner as described above. If no more portions in the original document are desired to be selected, for example if the entire original document was selected for processing or all of the portions of the original document have already been selected, the process for determining a dynamic document layout ends.","In this preferred embodiment, although a case-based approach is provided to apply mutators to a document to obtain a desirable document layout, the concepts of the present invention can also continuously store the determined layouts for use in determining the layout of future documents. By combining case-based mutators with genetic algorithms for dynamic document layout, a more efficient and reliable automated scheme for dynamic document layout is realized.","Accordingly, while the present invention has been described with reference to various embodiments as described above, it is not confined to the details set forth above, but is intended to cover such modifications or changes as may come within the scope of the attached claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention may take form in various components and arrangements of components, and in various steps and arrangements of steps.
