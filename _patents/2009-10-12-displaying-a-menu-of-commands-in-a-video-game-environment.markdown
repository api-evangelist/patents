title: Displaying a menu of commands in a video game environment
abstract: In a gaming system, a user controls actions of characters in the game environment using speech commands. In a learning mode, available speech commands are displayed in a command menu on a display device. In a non-learning mode, the available speech commands are not displayed. A speaker-independent context-sensitive speech recognition module contains a vocabulary of available speech commands. Use of speech commands is combined with input from a controller device to control actions of a character or characters in the game environment.

Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to electronic entertainment devices and relates more particularly to a system and method for menu-driven voice control of characters in a game environment.","2. Description of the Related Art","In electronic entertainment systems such as gaming systems, a user typically interacts with a game program using some type of manually activated controller device. Common controller devices are buttons, joysticks, switches, keyboards, and combinations of these. Some gaming systems use specifically designed control devices, such as a steering wheel and pedals for driving simulations and a stick and pedals for flight simulations.","Each gaming system typically uses manually activated controller devices of a single design for most games playable on the system, and buttons or keystrokes are assigned different meanings for each game. In one game, a particular button may correspond to a punch, while in another game the same button corresponds to firing a torpedo. Thus use of a controller device is not very intuitive for the user in the context of a particular game environment.","Use of manually activated controller devices requires a user to memorize which buttons or keys are assigned to particular actions. For complicated games, the number of buttons or combinations of keystrokes can be very large. In many games, a user only controls the actions of a single character. In games where the user controls a group of characters, the characters act as a group, so in effect the group of characters acts as a single character. Allowing the user to control multiple characters independently using manually activated controller devices may be possible, but would be very complex and difficult to learn and use.","In accordance with the present invention, a system and method are disclosed to implement menu-driven voice control of characters in a game environment. The system of the invention includes game software and a speech recognition module. The speech recognition module is a speaker-independent and context sensitive with a vocabulary of available command words or phrases to control actions of a character or characters in the game environment. A user speaks commands from the vocabulary into a microphone to control the actions of a character or characters in the game environment.","In a learning mode, menus of available commands are displayed to the user. A level  command menu shows available characters to control. A level  command menu shows available actions for character or characters selected from the level  menu. The available actions in the level  menu depend upon a current state of the game. A level  command menu shows available options for the character actions selected from the level  menu. The available options in the level  menu may also depend upon a current state of the game.","In a non-learning mode, menus of available commands are not displayed to the user. The user speaks memorized commands in the vocabulary of the speech recognition module. The speech recognition module is context-sensitive; it will not react to a level  command unless a level  command was previously input, and will not react to a level  command unless a level  command was previously input. Thus, the user inputs verbal sentence-type commands (actor plus action) to control the character or characters in the game environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","112","0","111","1","113","114","116","118","120","122","124","126","100","128","132","134","136","146","116","100","100"]},"CPU , VU , VU , GPU , and IOP  communicate via a system bus . CPU  communicates with main memory  via a dedicated bus . VU  and GPU  may also communicate via a dedicated bus . CPU  executes programs stored in OS ROM  and main memory . Main memory  may contain pre-stored programs and may also contain programs transferred via IOP  from a computer readable storage medium such as a CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, or other optical disc (not shown) using optical disc control unit . IOP  control data exchanges between CPU , VU , VU , GPU  and other devices of system , such a controller interface .","CPU  executes drawings instructions from CPU  and VU  to produce images for display on a display device (not shown). VU  transforms objects from three-dimensional coordinates to two-dimensional coordinates, and sends the two-dimensional coordinates to GPU . SPU  executes instructions to produce sound signals that are output on an audio device (not shown).","A user of system  provides instructions via controller interface  to CPU . For example, the user may instruct CPU  to store certain game information on memory card  or may instruct a character in a game to perform some specified action. Other devices may be connected to system  via USB interface  and IEEE 1394 interface . In the preferred embodiment, a USB microphone (not shown) is connected to USB interface  to enable the user to provide voice commands to system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["110","110","212","214","100","134","212","112","0","111","1","113","132","100","212","212"]},"Speech recognition module  is a speaker-independent, context sensitive speech recognizer executed by CPU . In an alternate embodiment, IOP  executes speech recognition module . Speech recognition module  includes a vocabulary of commands that correspond to instructions in game software . The commands include single-word commands and multiple-word commands. When an input speech signal (utterance) matches a command in the vocabulary, speech recognition module  notifies game software , which then provides appropriate instruction to CPU .","The user of system  and game software  inputs one or more of the commands via the microphone and USB interface  to control the actions of characters in game software . The spoken commands are preferably used in conjunction with controller commands; however, other embodiments of game software  may implement spoken commands only.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["1","322","310","100","1","330","1","332","334","336","1","212","1","1","322","1","322","1","330","1","330","310","1"]},"In the  embodiment of game software , the user controls the actions of a team leader character using controller actions such as actuating buttons or manipulating a joystick. The user inputs spoken commands to control the actions of a two-character team. Team item  represents the availability of a team command that selects both members of the two-character team to perform an action. Alpha item  represents the availability of a command that selects one member, alpha, to perform an action. Bravo item  represents the availability of a command that selects one member, bravo, to perform an action.","The user says the word \u201cteam\u201d into the microphone to select team item , says the word \u201calpha\u201d to select alpha item , and says the word \u201cbravo\u201d to select bravo item . When speech recognition module  recognizes one of the level  commands, it notifies game software , which then displays a level  menu command screen.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B"],"b":["2","324","310","332","2","324","2","340","2","340","1","322","2","342","344","346","2","212","2"]},"Level  menu  illustrates available commands for the two-character team. The available commands depend upon a current state of the game. For example, if the user verbally selects hold position item , then the two-character team will appear to hold their position in the game environment. The next time the user verbally selects team item , hold position item  will not appear but a follow item (not shown) will appear instead.","The combination of team item  and hold position item  is a complete command, so if the user says \u201chold position\u201d while screen  is displayed, game software  then stops displaying screen  and causes the selected characters to perform the selected action in the game environment (both members of the team hold their position). Similarly, the combination of team item  and fire at will item  is a complete command, so if the user says \u201cfire at will \u201d while screen  is displayed, game software  then stops displaying screen  and causes the selected characters to perform the selected action in the game environment (both members of the team fire their weapons). The combination of team item  and deploy item  is not a complete command. If the user says \u201cdeploy\u201d while screen  is displayed, game software  then displays a level  menu command screen.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 3C","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","326","310","3","326","3","350","1","332","2","344","3","352","354","212","3","212","3"]},"The combination of team item , deploy item , and frag item  is a complete command, so if the user says \u201cfrag\u201d while screen  is displayed, software module  stops displaying screen  and causes the selected characters to perform the selected action in the game environment (both members of the team deploy a frag grenade). The combination of team item , deploy item , and smoke item  is a complete command, so if the user says \u201csmoke\u201d while screen  is displayed, software module  stops displaying screen  and causes the selected characters to perform the selected action in the game environment (both members of the team deploy a smoke grenade).","Although in  only three menu levels are shown, any number of menu levels is within the scope of the invention. In the preferred embodiments the number of menu levels is three for ease of use and to facilitate learning of the various command combinations. Once the user has learned or memorized all of the various command combinations, the user may play the game without using the command menus (non-learning mode).","As stated above in conjunction with , speech recognition module  is context-sensitive. For example, the word \u201cdeploy\u201d is in the vocabulary of speech recognition module . However, speech recognition module  will only recognize the word \u201cdeploy\u201d in the context of a level  command such as \u201cteam\u201d or \u201calpha\u201d. In other words, speech recognition module  will not react to an input level  command unless a level  command has been input, and will not react to an input level  command unless a level  command has been input. The speech recognition module  recognizes sentence-type commands (actor plus action) that game software  uses to control actions of the characters in the game environment.","Although  illustrate command menus , , and  as branching menus that branch from left to right, any other configuration for displaying available commands to the user is within the scope of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["412","212","212","414","212","416","430"]},"In step , game software  displays level  commands on a level  menu command screen. Then in step , speech recognition module  determines whether the user has verbally input a level  command. If not, the method returns to step . If the user has verbally input a level  command, then in step  game software  displays level  commands on a level  command screen. In step , speech recognition module  determines whether the user has verbally input a level  command. If not, the method returns to step . If the user has verbally input a level  command, the method continues with step .","If the input level  command does not have associated level  commands, then in step  game software  executes the commands, whereby a character or characters in the game environment perform the selected action.
