No. 12\/940,986, entitled \u201cIntegrated Repository of Structured and Unstructured Data,\u201d filed on Nov. 5, 2010, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","This disclosure relates generally to database architecture.","Data can be stored in various formats, including in a relational database or as a file. A relational database can include a collection of relations, frequently known as tables. A table in the relational database can correspond to a logical structure in which data can be stored. The table can include a set of data elements or values that are organized using vertical columns and horizontal rows. The logical structure can include, for example, a specified number of columns and a variable number of rows. Each column can have a data type that defines what category of data can be stored in the column. A row of a table can include one or more data fields. Each data field can correspond to a column, and have a data type that corresponds to the data type of the column. The logical structure, as well as relations between data in one table and data in another table can be defined using a database schema, which can be a data model that defines how data in the relational database are represented or accessed. Data in relational databases can be accessed or managed using a script written in a data manipulation language (DML), a data definition language (DDL), or a data control language (DCL).","In addition to being stored in a relational database, data can be stored in a file. The file can include a block of information in the format of a one-dimensional array of bytes. The bytes are stored sequentially. The file can be accessed through an operating system of a computing device or an application program (e.g., a file manager program such as Windows Explorer\u00ae).","Methods, program products, and systems implementing integrated repository of structured and unstructured data are disclosed. An integrated environment is provided for accessing, structured data (e.g., data of a relational database) and unstructured data (e.g., data stored in a text or binary file), including creating, managing, modifying, and searching the structured data and unstructured data. The integrated environment can include an integrated user interface, a set of commands and application programming interface (API), and storage for a relational database and a document repository. The integrated environment can include a database abstraction layer that allows database operations on both the structured data and the unstructured data.","In some implementations, the integrated environment can include integrated search functions that allow search of structured data and unstructured data. An index of a relational database can be integrated with an index of the unstructured data. The index of the relational database can include a data structure created based on one or more columns of a database table, a function, or an expression. The index of the unstructured data can include an index created based on content of the unstructured data. The integrated search functions can be performed on a combined index that includes both the database index and the index of the unstructured data, or performed separately on each of the indices in the backend.","An integrated repository of structured and unstructured data can be utilized to achieve one or more of the following advantages. An integrated environment can provide a user flexibility for managing data by accepting both structured data and unstructured data as input in a single user interface (e.g., a database form). The integrated environment can provide a user flexibility for accessing the data using a single user interface (e.g., a database report). The integrated environment allows the user to view a document outside a database when the user is viewing content of the database. Likewise, the integrated environment allows the user to view content of the relational database when the user is viewing content of the document. The integrated environment allows the user to navigate to a document from the database content and to navigate to the database content from the document. The integrated environment can provide combined database search results and document search results in response to a user query. The database search results and document search results can be presented in a response page that allows the user to quickly view both content of the relational database and the document.","An integrated repository of structured and unstructured data can be utilized to implement contact list management. Document management capabilities of the integrated repository of structured and unstructured data can be advantageous to human resources and personnel tracking where contact lists are used. For example, a resume can be associated with a candidate or a personnel record. Document search from within a database can be used to identify candidates with particular skill sets. Performance reviews and other employee related paperwork can be stored in association with employee records.","Document management capabilities can be advantageously implemented for customer service or sales leads. A personal selling environment can be created, in which letters and other correspondence with each customer can be tracked. Requests for proposals (RFPs) and responses can be stored. Document search can be used to cross reference similar requests and previous proposals.","Document management capabilities can be useful in maintaining group, club, or team membership lists. Membership applications can be stored in association with data records. Biographical entries on members can be used in publications. Document search can be used to locate and associate meeting notes and minutes to group members.","An integrated repository of structured and unstructured data can be utilized to manage events. A relational database can store structured data including details of each event (e.g., date, time, and venue). Event planning often requires numerous documents (e.g., agendas or event schedules) to be associated with an event. An agenda or event schedule can be associated to each event record. Document search can be used to identify past events with a specific speaker or host. Permits and contracts associated with the event can be stored. Document search can be used to identify events based on a schedule. The identified events can be linked to a current event.","An integrated repository of structured and unstructured data can be utilized to manage assets. Structured data can be used to track common details of assets. Unstructured data can be used to store original invoices with each item of the assets. A same invoice can be associated with multiple asset items as needed. Insurance policies or liability waivers can be associated with each asset item. A history of warranty and service requests can be associated with the asset item.","An integrated repository of structured and unstructured data can be utilized to manage product lists. A document management tool can access and manage structured data describing a product. In addition, the document management tool can associate unstructured data (e.g., product data sheets) with each product. The unstructured data can ensure that the most current product information is available to a user managing the product. The user's search on a product detail that is described in a document can return relevant results, even when the detail is not tracked in a database field. A search on a concept that is linked to a specific product can be responded with the product, if the concept is in a design document of the product. The document management tool can store product documentation to provide distribution and indexing of content related to the product. The document management tool can archive product introductions and marketing presentations, including, for example: associating related products to a relevant slide deck; ensuring product slides are updated in response to updating a single document record; and ensuring quick access to sales information when a customer asks about a product.","An integrated repository of structured and unstructured data can be utilized to assist creative project tracking. Database records can be used to track each project in a creative professional environment like advertising or graphic design. Project requirements documents can be associated with each project. Design files can be stored in association with project details for sharing with a team. A proof or thumbnail image can be stored in a catalog. Document association functions can be used to store full resolution files for download. Search capability features can be provided to search past projects for similar requirements to facilitate re-use or avoid duplication. Story-boards for advertising can be searched to check uniqueness. Ad contracts can be searched for contacts with different publications or sources.","An integrated repository of structured and unstructured data can be utilized in education and non-profit industries, where entities often rely on third party organizations and governmental groups for funding. Oftentimes, multiple grants or allocations can provide resources for a group. Some high-level fields related to grants can be tracked by structured data, but some data are document-related. The techniques described in this specification can be utilized to associate grant applications and reports with a particular funding source, and search past application data for key terms to ensure consistency in reporting. A single repository of all documents can prevent information loss in high-turnover organizations.","An integrated repository of structured and unstructured data can be utilized for workgroup document tracking. Workgroups often share files among group members. The files can be shared using a document catalog (described below). Storing files using a document catalog can provide the following advantages: a shared repository allows multiple users to have access to the same version of a file; an archive allows a user to search for previous reports or presentations to avoid duplicating work of others; critical organization documents can be backed up off-site; and document status or other custom attributes can be tracked.","The details of one or more implementations of an integrated repository of structured and unstructured data are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of integrated repository of structured and unstructured data will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","100","140","114","100","140","114"]},"Application server  can include a system that implements methods that allow structured data and unstructured data to be stored in the integrated repository , and methods that allow access and manipulation of data in the integrated repository .","Application server  can include web server , data abstraction layer , and data manager . Webserver  can include a subsystem that includes a web server computer and a web serving application program. The web serving application program can include a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) server program (e.g., Apache\u00ae HTTP server). Webserver  can be configured to receive data access requests and data uploads from client , which can be connected to application server  through communications network . Client  can include a client computer, a web browser that executes on a client computer, or both.","Webserver  can receive document  sent from client  in an upload operation. Document  can include unstructured data to be stored in the integrated repository . The unstructured data can include any data (e.g., text data, binary data, multimedia data) in any format (e.g., in American standard code for information interchange (ASCII) format, or any audio, graphic, or video file format) that is not defined by a schema of database subsystem . Document  can be uploaded by an HTTP request (e.g., HTTP Post) from client . Other known communication protocols are also possible.","Upon receiving document , webserver  can transfer document  to data abstraction layer  for further processing. Data abstraction layer  can include one or more application programs that are configured to cause one or more processors to perform operations of integrating structured data and unstructured data. Some of the operations can include requesting data manager  to perform document analysis on document . The document analysis can include identifying various attributes of document  and generating metadata of the document . The metadata can be stored in metadata database  of database subsystem .","Data abstraction layer  can perform operations of sending document  to document repository . Document repository  can include document server . Document server  can include webserver  (e.g., a Lighttpd\u00ae webserver) that is optimized for high volume and speed-critical document transfer operations. Webserver  can be associated with file system reference  (e.g., a web root directory). File system reference  can refer to document storage subsystem  that is configured to store one or more documents . Document storage subsystem  can include, for example, a local storage system or one or more devices on a storage area network (SAN).","Data manager  can manage data stored in database subsystem . The data stored in database subsystem  can be structured data. Structured data can include data items whose relationship to one another and whose structures are defined in a database schema of database subsystem . Database subsystem  can include metadata database  and client data database . Metadata database  can store attributes (e.g., file type and file size) and other metadata of document . Client data database  can store structured data from client  or to be presented to client , together with document , in an integrated environment.","Upon storing document  in document repository  and attributes and other metadata of document  in database subsystem , application server  can send a response to client . The response can include a response code and one or more default attributes of document  (e.g., type or size). Once client  receives the response, client  can perform at least one of the following options: (1) send another request (e.g., HTTP Post) to upload another document; or (2) send a confirmation to application server . If application server  receives the confirmation, data manager  of application server  can update database subsystem  by providing various attributes of document  for storage (e.g., by committing the metadata of document ).","Metadata database  can serve as a link between documents  stored in document repository  and structured data stored in client data database . A search or select request from client  can be processed by data manager . If content of document  satisfies search or select criteria specified in the request, the structured and unstructured data can be presented to client  in response. The structured and unstructured data can be presented to client  to be displayed in a user interface of client . In addition, the structured and unstructured data can be provided to an application program through an API. In some implementations, the structured and unstructured data can be provided as a web service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":"112"},"Data manager  of application server  can include event logger . Event logger  can update various tables in metadata database . One of the tables being updated can be event table . Event table  can be utilized to record various events including insertion of structured data and unstructured data. An insertion event can occur when, for example, a user creates a new data record, associates a document with the new data record, and inserts the new record into a database. When the insertion event occurs, data can be updated in event table  and in collection table  and document data structure . Collection table  and document data structure  can be tables for integrating structured data and the unstructured data. Collection table  and document data structure  can be tables hosted in client data database .","A part of the insertion event can be an insertion of a collection. The collection can be a structured set of one or more data records in client data database . Within the set, the data records can be organized in specified order (e.g., sort by last name). The set can be associated with a context (e.g., a purpose or an invitation to an event). The set can be exported. The insertion of the structured data can include creating the collection. The insertion of the structured data can include inserting the collection, a record into the collection, or inserting a collection based on a user specified criterion (e.g., a collection of employees working in a same city). Data manager  can insert the collection into collection table .","When the insertion occurs, event logger  can insert a first row into event table . The first row in the event table  can include one or more data items according to a schema defining various data fields of event table . The data fields can include a tenant identifier data field. The tenant identifier data field can correspond to a value that can identify a tenant, which can be a workgroup including one or more users. The data fields can include a collection identifier data field, a row identifier data field, an action data field, a state data field, an event type data field, and an event data data field. The event data data field can store a file name. The file name in the event table can be different from a row identifier. Further details of event table  will be described below in reference to . The first row can have an event type of \u201ccollection,\u201d corresponding to the insertion of the collection.","Another part of the insertion can include inserting information of the document in one or more database tables. Data manager  can insert a row of data into document data structure . Document data structure  will be described in further detail below in reference to . A second row can be inserted into event table . When application server  receives unstructured data, event logger  can insert a second row into event table . The second row can specify an event type indicating that the data received is unstructured (e.g., a type \u201cfile\u201d). The second row can include an identifier of the unstructured data (e.g., a file name) in an \u201cevent data\u201d data field.","Upon detecting an insertion of structured data or reception of unstructured data, indexing agent  can create one or more indices for the inserted collection and the unstructured data. Indexing agent  can include collection event subscriber  that listens to insertion events of collections. Collection event subscriber  can detect the event inserting a collection, identify a collection identifier from the first row of event table , and use the collection identifier to identify the collection from collection table .","Indexing agent  can include file event subscriber  that listens to events of receiving unstructured data (e.g., file upload events). File event subscriber  can detect the event of document uploads and identify a document received. Indexing agent  can create an index of the uploaded document, or invoke another process (e.g., an external text indexing process) to create an index of the unstructured data. Indexing agent  can identify a row in document data structure  using an identifier in event table  and fill a content data field and a metadata data field of document data structure . The content data field can store at least a portion of the unstructured data. The portion can include, for example, a specified number (e.g., 512) of characters from the beginning of the unstructured data.","Indexing data can be modified when unstructured data are deleted or modified. During deletion of unstructured data (e.g., deletion of a document), data manager  can delete records related to the unstructured data from both collection table  and document data structure . Event logger  can log two events (deleting a record from collection table  and deleting a record from document data structure ) in event table . The \u201cevent type\u201d values of the two events can be \u201ccollection\u201d and \u201cfile,\u201d respectively. The \u201caction\u201d values of the two events can be \u201crow deletion\u201d and \u201cfile deletion,\u201d respectively. Collection event subscriber  can pick up the event of the \u201crow deletion\u201d action. File event subscriber  can pick up the event of the \u201cfile deletion\u201d action, and drop the deleted document from indexed documents, or inform an index engine to drop the document.","Unstructured data can be updated. Updating unstructured data can include uploading a new document to replace an existing document, or modifying document data structure . If a new document is uploaded, data manager  can update an existing record in document data structure . Event logger  can log an event into event table . The event can have a type \u201cfile\u201d and action \u201cfile update.\u201dFile event subscriber  can detect the file update indexing event for document data structure . Indexing agent  can extract content and metadata from the index file (created by indexing agent  or by an external indexing process) and insert the extracted content and metadata into document data structure . The replaced document can remain untouched in a document repository until a cleanup daemon utility program deletes the replaced document.","If document data structure  is updated (e.g., when a user modifies a customized document table column \u201cdescription\u201d), data manager  can update an existing record in collection table . Event logger  can log an event in event table  having a type \u201ccollection\u201d and an action \u201cupdate.\u201d Collection event subscriber  can detect the update collection event from collection table .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["240","302","304","302","304"]},"Document table  can include a row identifier data field, a file identifier data field for storing a foreign key to file table , and various descriptive data fields for storing various information of the file (e.g., a \u201ccreated at\u201d data field, \u201ccreated by\u201ddata field, and a \u201cversion\u201d data field).","File table  can include a tenant specific data table that contains information of all uploaded unstructured data. File table  can include a row identifier data field, a file identifier field (e.g., a file name field for storing a file name of the unstructured data as provided by a user), an internal file identifier field (e.g., an internal file name field for storing an internal file name of the unstructured data as automatically generated), a size field for storing a size of the unstructured data, a type field for storing a type of the unstructured data, a content data field and a metadata field whose content will be described below, and a description data field for storing description of the unstructured data.","The content data field of file table  can store a portion of the content of the unstructured data. The metadata data field of file table  can include metadata of the unstructured data. The metadata can be extracted from the unstructured data or generated automatically or manually based on the unstructured data. The metadata can be treated as part of the unstructured data.
