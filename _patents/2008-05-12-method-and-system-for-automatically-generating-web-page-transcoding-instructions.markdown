title: Method and system for automatically generating web page transcoding instructions
abstract: A system and method are provided for generating transcoding instructions to identify and extract a subset of data from a web page. Input describing the subset of data is received where the input describes one or more data fields and, for each data field, respective field values from at least two sample web pages of a web page family for the web site. For each field, respective web page code defining the respective field values may be compared for commonality to find a matching pattern with which to locate the respective field values. The matching pattern comprises a signature for the data field. Transcoding instructions are defined using the matching pattern to locate and extract field values within web pages of the web page family. The subset of data may be expressed in a target format to transcode the web page for particular client machines (e.g. a wireless mobile device).

No. 60\/924,503 filed May 17, 2007, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights.","The present application relates generally to telecommunications and more particularly to a method and system for automatically generating web page transcoding instructions.","Web sites host and provide information using web pages that are communicated electronically via a telecommunications network. Accessing this information by some client computing devices can be challenging. Computing devices are becoming smaller and increasingly utilize wireless connectivity. Examples of such computing devices include portable computing devices that include wireless network browsing capability as well as telephony and personal information management capabilities.","The smaller size of most wireless mobile client devices necessarily limits their display capabilities. Furthermore the wireless connections to such devices typically have less or more expensive bandwidth than corresponding wired connections. The Wireless Application Protocol (\u201cWAP\u201d) was designed to address such issues, but WAP can still provide a very unsatisfactory experience or even completely ineffective experience, particularly where the small client device needs to effect a connection with web sites that host web pages that are directed to traditional full desktop browsers.","A system and method are provided for generating transcoding instructions to identify and extract a subset of data from a web page. Input describing the subset of data is received where the input describes one or more data fields and, for each data field, respective field values from at least two sample web pages of a web page family for the web site. For each field, respective web page code defining the respective field values may be compared for commonality to find a matching pattern with which to locate the respective field values. The matching pattern may define a signature for the data field. Transcoding instructions are defined using the matching pattern to locate and extract field values within web pages of the same web page family. The subset of data may be expressed in a target format to transcode the web page for particular client machines (e.g. wireless mobile device).","In accordance with an aspect there is provided a method of automatically generating transcoding instructions to locate and extract a subset of data from a selected web page of a web site. The method comprises receiving an input describing the subset of data, said input comprising one or more data fields and, for each data field, respective field values from at least two sample web pages of a web page family for the web site; and for each data field: comparing respective web page code defining the respective field values for commonality to find a matching pattern with which to locate the respective field values, said matching pattern comprising a signature for the data field; and defining the transcoding instructions in accordance with the matching pattern to locate and extract field values for the data field within web pages of the web page family.","Comparing respective web page code defining the respective field values may comprise locating the respective field values in the respective web page code. Comparing respective web page code defining the respective field values may further comprise locating object tags within the web page code. The method may further comprising constructing a programmatic data structure representing a hierarchy of object tags within the web page code and reviewing the hierarchy to determine the commonality.","Comparing respective web page code may comprise performing pattern recognition to define a common pattern within the web page code with which to locate the respective field values.","The web page code may comprise markup language in plain text. Each signature may comprise characters selected from the plain text of the web page code.","The method may further comprising automatically defining the input in accordance with a tagging tool that identifies the respective field values from the sample web pages. The web site may comprise an e-commerce web site for making a purchase.","The method may further comprise defining transcoding instructions to express the extracted subset of data in a target format thereby to transcode the web page.","In accordance with another aspect, there is provided a system for automatically generating transcoding instructions to locate and extract a subset of data from a selected web page of a web site. The system comprises a processor and memory coupled thereto, said memory storing instructions and data to configure the processor for: receiving an input describing the subset of data, said input comprising one or more data fields and, for each data field, respective field values from at least two sample web pages of a web page family for the web site; and for each data field: comparing respective web page code defining the respective field values for commonality to find a matching pattern with which to locate the respective field values, said matching pattern comprising a signature for the data field; and defining the transcoding instructions in accordance with the matching pattern to locate and extract field values for the data field within web pages of the web page family.","Yet another aspect provides a computer program product for automatically generating transcoding instructions to locate and extract a subset of data from a selected web page of a web site, the computer program product storing computer readable instructions which when executed by a computer processor configure the processor to: A computer program product for automatically generating transcoding instructions to locate and extract a subset of data from a selected web page of a web site, the computer program product storing computer readable instructions which when executed by a computer processor configure the processor to: receive an input describing the subset of data, said input comprising one or more data fields and, for each data field, respective field values from at least two sample web pages of a web page family for the web site; and for each data field: compare respective web page code defining the respective field values for commonality to find a matching pattern with which to locate the respective field values, said matching pattern comprising a signature for the data field; and define the transcoding instructions in accordance with the matching pattern to locate and extract field values for the data field within web pages of the web page family.","Referring now to , there is illustrated a system  for content navigation via a telecommunications network. In a present embodiment system  comprises a plurality of client computing devices in the form of client machines A and B (collectively ), a web site server  hosting a web site  and a gateway and schema server . Devices  are respectively coupled to communicate with gateway and schema server  to obtain web pages (e.g. ) transcoded from web site .","In the present embodiment, a web server  serves web pages (e.g. ) which comprise web site . The web pages are defined from a plurality of web page family templates A-D (collectively ) and web page content (described further herein below) from data store . For ease within the present embodiment, only a single web site  is shown coupled via gateway and schema server ; however, in another embodiment a plurality of different web sites may be so coupled. In the present embodiment of system , gateway and schema server  is coupled to a schema repository  from which to obtain a signature schema  for a particular web site. Signature schema documents (e.g. ) provide instructions and data with which an engine  of server  can extract data from web pages (e.g. ) and transcode same to a target format to provide transcoded web page data (e.g.  and ) to the respective requesting client machines A and B as described more fully below. Gateway and schema server  may also be coupled to a database  for retrieving\/storing data extracted from web sites in accordance with its operations. The database  may be a relational database storing extracted data from web sites in relation to the defined signature schema. The stored data can be accessed by a Structured Query Language (SQL). Signature schemas for respective web sites may be defined (e.g. coded) using a computing device  as described herein below.","Representative client machines  include any type of computing or electronic device that can be used to communicate and interact with content available via web sites. Each of the client machines  may be operated by a respective user U (not shown). Interaction with a particular user includes presenting information on a client machine (e.g. by rendering on a display screen) as well as receiving input at a client machine (e.g. such as via a keyboard for transmitting to a web site). In the present embodiment, client machine A comprises a mobile electronic device with the combined functionality of a personal digital assistant, cell phone, email paging device, and a web-browser. Such a mobile electronic device may comprise a keyboard (or other input device(s)), a display screen, a speaker, (and other output device(s) (e.g. LEDs)) and a chassis for housing such components. The chassis may further house one or more central processing units, volatile memory (e.g. random access memory), persistent memory (e.g. Flash read only memory) and network interfaces to allow client machine A to communicate over the telecommunication network.","Referring now to , a schematic block diagram shows an exemplary client machine A in greater detail. It should be emphasized that the structure in  is purely exemplary, and contemplates a device that may be used for both wireless voice (e.g. telephony) and wireless data (e.g. email, web browsing, text) communications. Client machine A includes a plurality of input devices which in a present embodiment includes a keyboard and, typically, additional input buttons, collectively , an optional pointing device  (e.g. a trackball or trackwheel) and a microphone . Other input devices, such as a touch screen, and camera lens are also contemplated. Input from keyboard\/buttons , pointing device  and microphone  may be received at a processor . Processor  may be further operatively coupled with a non-volatile storage unit  (e.g. read only memory (\u201cROM\u201d), Erasable Electronic Programmable Read Only Memory (\u201cEEPROM\u201d), or Flash Memory) and a volatile storage unit  (e.g. random access memory (\u201cRAM\u201d), speaker , display screen  and one or more lights (LEDs ). Processor  may be operatively coupled for network communications via a subsystem . Wireless communications are effective via at least one radio (e.g. ) such as for Wi-Fi or cellular wireless communications. Client machine A also may be configured for wired communications such as via a USB or other port and for short range wireless communications such as via a Bluetooth\u00ae radio (all not shown).","Programming instructions that implement the functional teachings of client machine A as described herein are typically maintained, persistently, in non-volatile storage unit  and used by processor  which makes appropriate utilization of volatile storage  during the execution of such programming instructions. Of particular note is that non-volatile storage unit  persistently maintains a web browser application  and, in the present embodiment, a native menu application , each of which can be executed on processor  making use of volatile storage  as appropriate. An operating system and various other applications (not shown) are maintained in non-volatile storage unit  according to the desired configuration and functioning of client machine A, one specific non-limiting example of which is a contact manager application (also known as an address book, not shown) which stores a list of contacts, addresses and phone numbers of interest to user U and allows user U to view, update, and delete those contacts, as well as providing user U an option to initiate telecommunications (e.g. telephone, email, instant message (IM), short message service (SMS)) directly from that contact manager application.","Native menu application  may be configured to provide menu choices to user U according to the particular application (or other context) that is being accessed. By way of example, while user U is activating the contact manager application, user U can activate menu application  to access a plurality of menu choices available that are respective to contact manager application . For example, menu choices may include options to invoke other applications (e.g. a mapping application to map a contact's address) or communication functions (e.g. call, SMS, IM, email, etc.) on the client machine A for a particular contact. Menu application  may be associated to a particular input button (e.g. one of buttons ) and invoked to provide a contextual menu comprised of a plurality of menu choices that are reflective of the context in which the button  was selected. Note that the options in a contextual menu are stored within non-volatile storage  as being specifically associated with a respective application. Menu application  may be therefore configured to generate a plurality of different contextual menus that are reflective of the particular context in which the menu application  is invoked. For example, in an email application where an email is being composed, invoking menu application  would generate a contextual menu that included the options of sending the email, cancelling the email, adding addresses to the email, adding attachments, and the like. The contents for such a contextual menu would also be maintained in non-volatile storage . Other examples of contextual menus will occur to those of ordinary skill in the art.","As noted, gateway and schema server  applies a signature schema to transcode a web page and provide transcoded data to a requesting client machine . Signature schema  may be configured to transcode navigational features of a web site  to provide menu options to menu application  for use when browsing the web site  with browser . The signature schema may further transcode web site content for presentation by the browser .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIGS. 8A-8D","FIG. 8A","FIG. 9A"],"b":["9","9","660","104","650","650","660","652","654","655","652","750","750","652","82","104"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 8B","FIG. 9B"],"b":["660","650","666","666","666","666","666","750","668"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 8C","FIG. 9C"],"b":["660","650","670","670","670","670","750","672","670"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 8D","FIG. 9D"],"b":["660","650","680","750"]},"Returning now to , web server  and gateway and schema server  (which can, if desired, be implemented on a single server) can be based on any commonly available server environments or platforms including a module that houses one or more central processing units, volatile memory (e.g. random access memory), persistent memory (e.g. hard disk devices) and network interfaces to allow servers  and  to communicate over the telecommunications network. Web server  hosts software applications comprising instructions and data for generating and serving web pages dynamically from the template families  and current informational content therefore from data store . Load balancing, security\/firewall, billing, account and other applications may also be present.","Gateway and schema server  hosts software applications comprising instructions and data for proxying requests and responses between the client machines  and web site . In addition to software for maintaining HTTP communications, performing requests, maintaining sessions, handling cookies, etc., engine  may be implemented in software to apply the signature schemas to web pages from web sites. There may be provided an interpreter that interprets the signature schema document and applies the actions against the web page code (as an ASCII (plain text) document) to extract the subset of data to produce a result set. A renderer may be provided to express the subset of data result set (i.e. transcode to a target format such as cHTML (Compact HTML) for a mobile device browser) for transmitting to the client machines also in accordance with the signature schema. A cache feature may also be provided for storing\/retrieving data from database . Caching may comprise storing web pages from the web site as well as extracted data from which to build a relational database of object and elements and their relationships. The gateway and schema server (or a separate server (not shown)) may host a web site engine to provide content extracted from the relational database (e.g. stored web site data) to the client machines .","Devices , schema server  and web site  are coupled via a telecommunication network (not shown) typically comprising a plurality of interconnected networks that may include wired and (at least for device A) wireless networks. It should now be understood that the nature of the network is not particularly limited and is, in general, based on any combination of architectures that will support interactions between client machines  and servers  and . In a present embodiment the network includes the Internet as well as appropriate gateways and backhauls.","More specifically, in the present embodiment, a wireless network for client machine A may be based on core mobile network infrastructure (e.g. Global System for Mobile communications (\u201cGSM\u201d), Code Division Multiple Access (\u201cCDMA\u201d), Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (\u201cEDGE\u201d), Evolution Data-Optimized (\u201cEV-DO\u201d), High Speed Downlink Packet Access (\u201cHSPDA\u201d), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (\u201cUMTS\u201d), etc.) or on wireless local area network (\u201cWLAN\u201d) infrastructures such as the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers (\u201cIEEE\u201d) 802.11 Standard (and its variants) or Bluetooth or the like or hybrids thereof. In the present embodiment of system  it is contemplated that client machine B may be another type of client machine such as a PC (desktop or laptop) configured to include a full desktop computer or as a \u201cthin-client\u201d. Typically such have larger display monitors\/screens than portable machines like A. A wired network for system  and device B can be based on a T1, T3 or any other suitable wired connection.","As previously stated in relation to , each of the client machines  is configured to interact with content available over the network, including web pages on web site . In a present embodiment, client machines A and B may navigate for content using a browser application (e.g. ). As will be explained further below, on client machine A, browser application  may be a mini-browser in the sense that it may be configured to render web pages on the relatively small display  of client machine A. Often, during such rendering, those pages are presented in a format that may be different from how those pages are rendered on a traditional desktop browser application (e.g. browser  of client machine B). Mini-browsers typically attempt to convey substantially the same information as if the web pages had been rendered on a full browser such as Internet Explorer\u00ae, Safari\u00ae or Firefox\u00ae on a traditional desktop or laptop computer like client machine B.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["110","104","102","120","102","104","102","302","120","110","140","304","106","308","110","140"]},"The engine  (for example, in parallel or without waiting for a response from server ) makes a request  to the signature repository  for the signature schema document  for the web site, which request may use the domain in the URL as an identifier for obtaining the document . The engine  receives  the schema. The engine  does not render the web page  per se but instead uses the instructions in the signature schema document  to extract the subset of data from the web page  for transcoding. In the present embodiment signature schema  is configured to transcode the web page  in accordance with the specific characteristics of the requesting client device A, having knowledge of display  capabilities\u2014such as screen size, resolution, and other parameters\u2014useful in determining the way in which the transcoded data is to be displayed on the machine A.","Optionally, the web page  or extracted data or both can be stored  in database . Engine  transmits  the transcoded data  that has been extracted and transcoded to a target format from web page , in accordance with the schema , to the requesting client machine A. As noted above, transcoded data  may comprise transcoded navigational data for menu application  and informational content data (e.g. a list of products and related information from a web page) for displaying by browser application .","Signature schemas are pre-defined documents, and may be eXtensible Markup Language (XML) documents utilizing an SQL-like query language, to incorporate instructions and data with which to intelligently extract the data from web pages (which web pages are typically coded in HTML, DHTML, XHTML, XML, RSS, JavaScript, etc). This extracted data may be transcoded and provided to client machines , or used to dynamically generate a relational database (e.g. ) or both. Each signature schema incorporates an understanding of a particular web site's data including relationships among the various data (e.g. among its primary informational content found in the body of its web pages as well as among such content and associated navigational data (e.g. web page links) that govern the data in the page). As described further herein below, prior knowledge of the web page code including specific identifiers, tags and text (i.e. strings) used within the code (sometimes referred to as \u201csignatures\u201d herein), may be used to define instructions to identify portions of the code of interest and to extract specific data.","As a further feature, transcoding may be configured to provide continuity of browsing\/transactional\/session experience enabling a user to switch client machines (e.g. starting with client machine A and switching to machine B (or vice-versa)). A user may be enabled to start an interaction with a web site and have displayed data (published content and navigational data) on the client machine A. The browsing session may then be continued on a second client machine (B) while retaining the transcoding as provided to the first client machine. For example, a user on a desktop can continue to browse the published content and navigational data of the web site as previously experienced on a mobile device, using only a portion of the desktop screen (for example) for data display.","In accordance with the present embodiment, a signature schema document may be defined for all the pages of a particular web site. Large data-driven web sites (e.g. ) don't maintain thousands of individual web pages per se. The sites typically adopt a few page family templates  and dynamically populate these with pertinent content from database  comprising information (e.g. weather, stock data, news, shopping\/product data, patent data, trade-mark data etc.) as applicable when a client requests a particular page. Each template represents a family of pages having objects and attributes.

the XML code snippet of Table 1, instructions at line 4 are for verifying that the web page under consideration and the signature schema relate to the same web site\/domain\u2014eshop.ca. Instructions at lines 9-15 are for determining the particular page family to which the web page under consideration belongs. A respective signature that defines the particular page family has been previously identified for use to distinguish the page. The engine  processes the <page type> tag by registering the identification strings for each page family. When a web page is obtained by the engine as input, the engine may be able to identify the page family by its unique string ref=\u201d and the command provides the related tag within the signature schema document where further instructions for the particular web pages are found:\n\n","For example, at line 10, the instructions identify a web page using the alternative signatures \u201cCompare products\u201d or \u201cSort Products\u201d. Web pages with these strings are of the same family type. The instructions at line 10 provide a reference tag to further instructions for this family, providing a link to instructions for the list_elements page family with and ID of mylist1 (see lines 16-17). Similarly the other lookup instructions provide references to the specific instructions within the signature schema document for handling a web page of each web page family. Representative instructions for some of the web page families are provided in Table 1, for example, at lines 16-17 and 18-29 with others omitted for brevity.","With reference to the extraction instructions for one of the web page families (e.g. item_elements id=\u201cmyitem1\u201d) at lines 18-29, the instruction at line 20 advances the scan pointer within the text file of the web page code to a beginning limit of a region of interest indicated by a signature reference. This establishes an upper limit for review within the text file. Though not shown in this table, an end limit may be defined as well (See Table 4). Further such instructions at lines 22-28 may comprise commands to locate the subset of data using \u201csignatures\u201d such as string identifiers that uniquely identify the data within the region of interest. In the present example the instructions locate and extract a plurality of elements, namely, product image, title, price, sale price and description for a product of the item web page family. For example, instructions at line 23 extract a string in between the first \u201c&lt;img src=&quot;\u201d and \u201c&quot;\u201d that appears after next appearance of \u201clargeimageref\u201d. The string returned is the path (relative URL at web site eshop.ca) to the product image. By advancing a search scan pointer within the web code to a particular location, references before that location can be skipped when searching. Any prior instances of a signature string such as \u201clargeimageref\u201d may be ignored. In this way, otherwise ambiguous signature references can be avoided.","The example in Table 1 shows at least some of the instructions (e.g. lines 23-27) including one or more directional references relative to the signatures to locate and extract the subset of data. For example, directional references such as \u201cbefore\u201d or \u201cafter\u201d command the engine to extract the data that is in a relative position in the web page before or after the signature string (i.e. ref=). Moreover, such instructions may further include at least one of a start reference or an end reference further pinpointing the location of the data in accordance with that direction. Additional directional reference information is discussed herein with reference to code snippets in other Tables and the discussion of an embodiment of signature transcoding engine syntax presented below.","The example within Table 1 demonstrates the extraction of data and the establishment of relationships between objects and elements within a same page of a web site. However, signature schema documents may further capture relevant attributes of an object across pages. For example, a user of client machine A may click through a number of web pages in eshop.ca to get to a specific product page (e.g. Department\u2192Product Category\u2192Product Sub-Category\u2192Specific Product, such as TV & Video>19\u2032-21\u2033 TVs>LCD TVs>BrandX Product. The navigational hierarchy representing a categorization may be captured and associated to the extracted objects and there elements.","For brevity, certain instructions were omitted from Table 1. Tables 2-4 provide representative instructions for further web page families for e-shop.ca that may be read with Table 1. Table 2 below provides representative instructions, e.g. for lines 16 and 17 of Table 1, including instructions for a web page family related to a list of items\/products for sale. Whereas instructions at lines 22-28 provided product data extraction instructions for a web page family showing a single item (i.e. product), the instructions of Table 2 provide additional instructions that repeat product data extractions for each product in the list.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0073"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"XML Signature Schema Snippet for Product List Page Family of E-Shop.ca"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"238pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","<list_elements id=\u201cmylist_1\u201d>"]},{"entry":["2","\u2003<paging>"]},{"entry":["3","\u2003\u2003<page_variable value=\u201cpage\u201d \/>"]},{"entry":["4","\u2003\u2003<page_start value=\u201c0\u201d \/>"]},{"entry":["5","\u2003\u2003<lookup type=\u201cpex\u201d action=\u201cget_string\u201d name=\u201clink\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003ref=\u201cNext&amp;nbsp\u201d location=\u201cbefore\u201d start=\u201c&lt;a"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003class=\u201d end=\u201c&lt;\/a&gt;\u201d include_sz=\u201c1\u201d strip_tags=\u201c1\u201d \/>"]},{"entry":["6","\u2003<\/paging>"]},{"entry":["7","\u2003<actions>"]},{"entry":["8","\u2003\u2003<lookup type=\u201cpex\u201d action=\u201cmove_ptr\u201d ref=\u201cSort or compare products\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003ref_alt_1=\u201cSort products\u201d \/>"]},{"entry":["9","\u2003<\/actions>"]},{"entry":["10","\u2003<element>"]},{"entry":["11","\u2003\u2003<lookup type=\u201cpex\u201d action=\u201cget_string\u201d name=\u201clink\u201d ref=\u201cthumbnail\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003location=\u201cbefore\u201d start=\u201c&lt;ahref=&quot;\u201d end=\u201c&quot;&gt;\u201d \/>"]},{"entry":["12","\u2003\u2003<lookup type=\u201cpex\u201d action=\u201cget_string\u201d name=\u201cimage\u201d ref=\u201cthumbnail\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003location=\u201cmiddle\u201d start=\u201c&quot;\u201d end=\u201c&quot;\u201d \/>"]},{"entry":["13","\u2003\u2003<lookup type=\u201cpex\u201d action=\u201cget_string\u201d name=\u201ctitle\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003ref=\u201cclass=&quot;tx-strong-dgrey&amp;quot;\u201d location=\u201cafter\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003start=\u201c&lt;a href=\u201d end=\u201c&lt;\/a&gt;\u201d include_sz=\u201c1\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003strip_tags=\u201c1\u201d \/>"]},{"entry":["14","\u2003\u2003<lookup type=\u201cpex\u201d action=\u201cget_string\u201d name=\u201cprice\u201d ref=\u201cpricepill\/\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003location=\u201cafter\u201d start=\u201c\/\u201d repeat_start=\u201c1\u201d end=\u201c.gif\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003tolerance=\u201c1\u201d \/>"]},{"entry":["15","\u2003\u2003<lookup type=\u201cpex\u201d action=\u201cmove_ptr\u201d ref=\u201cpricepill\/\u201d \/>"]},{"entry":["16","\u2003<\/element>"]},{"entry":["17","<\/list_elements>"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"If the engine  identifies that the page is of the \u201cmylist1\u201d family, the engine determines the location in the signature schema document that contains the signature for the objects and elements of that family and applies the instructions therefor.

For example, data replacing the candidate data  may be selected and captured (not shown) from the rendered web page A through \u201cdrag and drop\u201d or highlighting\/copying user gestures.","User interface  may be predefined to present candidate desired data (i.e. for particular desired data types that are expected to be found on web pages for such web sites of a similar genre). That is, a user interface  for an e-commerce web site selling products may be defined to present \u201cproduct title\u201d, \u201cimage\u201d, \u201cprice\u201d, etc. If a particular candidate value was incorrect, for example, product image A, title B, etc., such may be selected and dropped or copied into form  of interface . Optionally, the interface may permit the user to add data types (fields and field values) to the presented data. In association with these actions, tool  examines the associated HTML source code\/tags of the rendered web page for capturing this data. Desktop tagging may be useful to assist with the identification of the desired data within the web page code so that signatures therefor within the web page code of similar pages may be determined for defining the signature schema documents.","Although the desktop tagging tool  and the automatic signature generation tool  are described in relation to computing device , it will be understood that any one of the client machines  may be configured to comprise the tools  and . Further, it will be understood that the exemplary operation of the automatic signature tool  may be implemented similarly on the client machines . Similarly, the flow of interactions may apply similarly for either one or both of the computing device  or the client machine .","Although signature schema documents  may be manually coded, these activities may be time consuming and subject to human error. Therefore, by providing an automatic signature tool  to automate coding of signature schema, transcoded web pages (e.g. , ), and thus transcoded web sites, may be readied for use faster and more reliably.","Referring to  shown are exemplary operations  of the automatic signature generation tool . A detailed example of two sample web pages used to define a signature schema will be presented below. At , the automatic signature generation tool  receives an input identifying the desired data that is to be located and extracted, that is, for which signatures and instructions are desired. Tool  receives an input identifying a set of fields and corresponding field values for extraction from at least two sample web pages of a web page family. The fields and field values have also been referred to as elements herein. That is, the fields may refer to the categories or attributes by which an object (such as an item for sale) may be defined. For example a product object such as a camera may have the following fields: image, title, price, description. The values for each of the fields related to the camera may be referred to as field values. The field value for the title field may include \u201cBrandX 7.2 MP Digital Camera\u201d.","The input identifying the fields and field values for extraction as defined in , may be provided by: a manual review of the web page to identify desired fields (e.g. locating the desired image within object tags of a web page) and to indicate the content type of various tags in the web page (e.g. navigation, title, price, image, item description, etc.). Alternatively, the input fields and field values of step  may be semi-automated using the desktop tagging tool  to highlight portions on the web page and therefore visually select which content data corresponds to what meaning (e.g. to select the elements on a page linked to a field). Further alternately, the desktop tagging tool  may be used to automatically populate fields and estimated values for the fields and to allow a user to confirm\/correct estimated fields (e.g. by using heuristics or other rules automatically applied in combination with pre-defined locations of fields (e.g. confidence intervals) to web pages to identify likely data) provided by tagging tool  or other module (not shown).","At , each identified field and corresponding field value is located within object tags of each of the at least two sample web pages. For example, if for the first sample web page, the input received identifies an image field having the value \u201cproduct_image.gif\u201d, then this value is first located within an object tag of the first web page. For example, the object tag may be: <img src=\u201cproduct_image.gif\u201d> and it is the second image object tag (e.g. a second instance of the <img tag) in the code of the web page that contains this object tag. The received input further identifies that for the second web page, the identical field type (e.g. image field) has a value of \u201csample_image.gif\u201d. It is determined that the second image object tag in the code of the web page is associated with the identified image field (e.g. the object tag may be <img src=\u201csample_image.gif\u201d>).","At , the automatic signature generation tool  compares the object tags of identical fields (e.g. image field) between the two sample web pages to identify a commonality between the object tags for the identical fields (such as common location, string identifiers, attribute type, and other patterns (i.e. a pattern comprising characters that describe a set of strings that can uniquely identify a field value)) within the plain text (ASCII) web page code. A pattern may include \u201cstring1\u201d*\u201csting2\u201d where * represent 0 or more characters between the characters of \u201cstring1\u201d and \u201cstring 2\u201d.","In the above example, the commonality between the two identified object tags may be that the object tag was the second instance of the \u201cimg\u201d attribute within the code of each web page; that the object for the two sample web pages starts with \u2018src=\u201c\u2019 and that \u2018\u201d\u2019 ends the string that provides the field value for each object. For example, the object tag of the first web page provided the string \u201cproduct_image.gif\u201d. Further, the object tags corresponding to each web page and having the identical image field type may be identified by the attribute \u201c<img\u201d.","At , automatic signature generation tool  uses the commonality between object tags of identical fields of the two sample web pages to define instructions to locate and extract the desired data, which instructions comprise a portion of the signature schema  for web pages of the same family type. Operations  may be repeated for each of the identified fields and field values (elements) to determine the commonality and patterns between the two sample web pages, in turn defining signatures and instructions with which to define at least a portion of signature schema . Further, operations  may be repeated for other web pages of other family types in the web site to generate the instructions to code other respective portions of schema .","An example of the operations , , , and  will now be described with reference to two illustrative sample web pages (and their illustrative HTML code in Table 6). As described earlier, pre-identified fields and field values indicating the subset of data to be located and extracted from the web page code for this web page family are provided (Table 5) for each of the sample web pages (for operations ). As also described, the pre-defined fields may either be identified manually by the user or using the desktop tagging tool  including estimated locations of the fields to generate the desired fields and field values.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0110"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 5"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Example Fields and Field Values of Two Sample Web Pages"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Item1",{}]},{"entry":[{},"Image","Product_image.gif"]},{"entry":[{},"Title","Product Title"]},{"entry":[{},"Price","$79.99"]},{"entry":[{},"List Price","$99.99"]},{"entry":[{},"Description","This is a description for Product title"]},{"entry":[{},{},"made by Product Manufacturer"]},{"entry":[{},"Item2"]},{"entry":[{},"Image","Sample_image.gif"]},{"entry":[{},"Title","Sample Title"]},{"entry":[{},"Price","$99.99"]},{"entry":[{},"List Price","$109.33"]},{"entry":[{},"Description","This is a description for Sample title"]},{"entry":[{},{},"made by Sample Manufacturer"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0111"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 6"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Example HTML Web Pages Document of the Two Sample Web"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Item1.html"]},{"entry":[{},"<html>"]},{"entry":[{},"<head><\/head>"]},{"entry":[{},"<body>"]},{"entry":[{},"<img src=\u201dcompany_logo.gif\u201d class=\u201dimage\u201d \/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<div class=\u201dproduct\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"<h1>Product title<\/h1>"]},{"entry":[{},"<h2>Product Manufacturer<\/h2>"]},{"entry":[{},"<img src=\u201dproduct_image.gif\u201d \/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<br>"]},{"entry":[{},"List Price: <strong> $99.99 <\/strong>"]},{"entry":[{},"<br \/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<br>"]},{"entry":[{},"Our Price: <strong> $79.99 <\/strong>"]},{"entry":[{},"<br \/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<p>"]},{"entry":[{},"This is a description for Product title made by Product Manufacturer"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/p>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/div>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/body>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/html>"]},{"entry":[{},"Item2.html"]},{"entry":[{},"<html>"]},{"entry":[{},"<head><\/head>"]},{"entry":[{},"<body>"]},{"entry":[{},"<img src=\u201dcompany_logo.gif\u201d class=\u201dimage\u201d \/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<p>"]},{"entry":[{},"disclaimer"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/p>"]},{"entry":[{},"<div class=\u201dproduct\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"<h1>Sample title<\/h1>"]},{"entry":[{},"<h2>Sample Manufacturer<\/h2>"]},{"entry":[{},"<img src=\u201dsample_image.gif\u201d \/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<br>"]},{"entry":[{},"List Price: <strong> $109.33 <\/strong>"]},{"entry":[{},"<br \/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<br>"]},{"entry":[{},"Our Price: <strong> $99.99 <\/strong>"]},{"entry":[{},"<br \/>"]},{"entry":[{},"This is a description for Sample title made by Sample Manufacturer"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/p>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/div>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/body>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/html>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"As noted, automatic signature generation tool  repeats operations -

Tool  may initially identify \u201csrc\u201d as an attribute corresponding to the image field and scan the source (HTML document) of the Item1 web page for src=\u201cproduct_image.gif\u201d. It does find a match (as it ought to since the field was previously selected from this code) and the location thereof. It then scans item2 but no match is found in item2. Next the automatic signature generation tool looks at \u201c<img\u201d within the source document of item1. It determines that it is the second match (corresponding to the \u201cimg\u201d attribute). Once the object tag corresponding to the image field and field value has been located within item1, the automatic signature generation tool  examines Item2 for the image field having value of sample_image.gif. When looking at Item2, the second object tag having the image attribute also provides the object that contains the image. Now that a matching object corresponding to the same field type (e.g. image) has been found, a similar heuristic is used by the automatic signature generation tool  to locate the result from within the object. If the object is a text node, the process is complete. Text nodes are easily distinguished by their respective tags in the code. Otherwise, the start and end of the object corresponding to the image field may need to be located. Using pattern recognition techniques, it is found that the pattern \u2018src=\u201c\u2019 starts the string and that \u2018\u201d\u2019 ends the string.

The resulting structure may be a tree, which defines the parent, siblings and children of each object. The operations may identify the key objects that contain the data required for the signature schema document . Once a particular object is identified as being a desired data field (i.e. is one of the fields in Table 5), the uniqueness of the object may be identified by examining its properties (for example class, style, id) within the structure. If the properties of the object are not unique, then the task to identify the uniqueness for the object would expand to its parent, siblings and children. For example, if the object is a text node of the tree (or other hierarchical structure), the object may use the properties of its parent to assist with the identification of is uniqueness for expression as a signature. The operations may expand in all directions uniformly (i.e. examine parent, then previous sibling, then next sibling, then first child). The properties of each of these items may also be merged with the desired object to build out the uniqueness. This process would then be repeated on the parent, then the previous sibling, etc, until a unique identifier was found. Once a unique identifier was found, an expression would be created for the signature.","Accordingly, in view of the above, the automatic signature generation tool  provided by the computing device  provides the signature schema  for a new web page family using at least two sample web pages. As illustrated in steps  and , the tool  compares two or more delimiters (pertaining to a common schema of the definition of the pages) from each of the sample web pages in order to identify common uses of the delimiters (and their contents).

Indirect hierarchical links can extend \u201cvertically\u201d upwards or downwards via multiple links in the same direction. Traveling up the hierarchy to find a common direct or indirect superior, and then down again can nevertheless \u201chorizontally\u201d link all parts of the hierarchy, which are not vertically linked to one another.

Instead, the sites encrypt specific pages that contain user information, for example login, signup, checkout, and account management pages. One reason why all content is not encrypted may be that SSL\/TLS is resource intensive and reduces scalability. Another reason why all content is not encrypted may be that SSL\/TLS increase response times for the end user due to the time spent encrypting and decrypting content. Examples of web sites that follow this model include online stores, news sites, sports information and weather. Therefore, since the number of SSL\/TLS pages is relatively small, signature schema can be created to define a mobile friendly layout. Another benefit of the signature schema, is that each field in an HTML form can be classified and populated with user data from an external application. It will be understood that each individual SSL\/TLS page will likely require its own respective page family template within a schema.","In contrast to ,  shows a client machine C comprising a browser application C similar to browser  for communicating with web site  via gateway and schema server .
