{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","Some Example Embodiments","DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Service providers (e.g., wireless, cellular, etc.) and device manufacturers are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by, for example, providing compelling network services. These services are leading to vast amounts of data (structured and binary) which need to be managed, stored, searched, analyzed, etc. Over the last decade, the internet services have accumulated data in the range of exabytes (10bytes). Although most of this data is not structured in nature, however, it must be stored, searched and analyzed appropriately before any real time information can be drawn from it for providing services to the users.","In order to provide high availability of such a huge amount of data, most systems backup their entire dataset regularly and under specific conditions. In such systems, in case of the occurrence of adverse conditions, the whole dataset can be recovered (e.g. restored from the backup). However, providing backup of a total dataset is the most conservative way of ensuring data security and in any case leading to data losses, the system can always recover at least to the last state prior to the loss. However with large amounts of data, backing up exabytes or petabytes of data is no longer feasible from either cost or recovery perspective.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach for providing criticality based data backup in which only data which is deemed critical at the time of backup, is backed up.","According to one embodiment, a method comprises determining one or more state trajectories associated with one or more information management processes operating on at least one information space. The method also comprises processing and\/or facilitating a processing of the one or more state trajectories to determine criticality information associated with one or more data items of the at least one information space. The method further comprises determining (a) one or more data backup processes, (b) one or more data restoration processes, (c) one or more parameters for the one or more data backup processes, the data restoration processes, or a combination thereof, or (d) a combination thereof based, at least in part, on the criticality information.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises at least one processor, and at least one memory including computer program code for one or more computer programs, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to, with the at least one processor, cause, at least in part, the apparatus to determine one or more state trajectories associated with one or more information management processes operating on at least one information space.

The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Examples of a method, apparatus, and computer program for providing criticality based data backup are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.","As used herein, the term \u201ccomputation closure\u201d identifies a particular computation procedure together with relations and communications among various processes including passing arguments, sharing process results, selecting results provided from computation of alternative inputs, flow of data and process results, etc. The computation closures (e.g., a granular reflective set of instructions, data, and\/or related execution context or state) provide the capability of slicing of computations for processes and transmitting the computation slices between devices, infrastructures and information sources.","As used herein, the term \u201ccloud\u201d refers to an aggregated set of information and computation closures from different sources. This multi-sourcing is very flexible since it accounts and relies on the observation that the same piece of information or computation can come from different sources. In one embodiment, information and computations within the cloud are represented using Semantic Web standards such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), RDF Schema (RDFS), OWL (Web Ontology Language), FOAF (Friend of a Friend ontology), rule sets in RuleML (Rule Markup Language), etc. Furthermore, as used herein, RDF refers to a family of World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifications originally designed as a metadata data model. It has come to be used as a general method for conceptual description or modeling of information and computations that is implemented in web resources; using a variety of syntax formats. Although various embodiments are described with respect to clouds, it is contemplated that the approach described herein may be used with other structures and conceptual description methods used to create distributed models of information and computations.","In one embodiment, according to a definition by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models. The essential characteristics of the cloud model consist of on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured Service.","The on-demand self-service characteristic of the cloud model enables a consumer to unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service's provider.","The broad network access characteristic of the cloud model provides capabilities available over the network that can be accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, laptops, and PDAs).","Based on the resource pooling characteristic of the cloud model, the provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, network bandwidth, and virtual machines.","The rapid elasticity of the cloud model provides rapid and elastic, and in some cases automatic, provision of capabilities to quickly scale out and rapid release to quickly scale in. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time.","According to the measured service characteristic, cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.","Furthermore, the service models associated with the cloud model include Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS), Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).","The Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS) provides, to the customer, the capability to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email). According to this service model, the consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.","The Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides, to the customer, the capability to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages and tools supported by the provider. According to this service model, the consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.","The Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides, to the customer, the capability to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. According to this service model, the consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems; storage, deployed applications, and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).","Additionally, a cloud model can be deployed as a private cloud, a community cloud, a public cloud, or a hybrid cloud. In one embodiment, according to a private cloud model, the cloud infrastructure is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on premise or off premise. Alternatively, a community cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premise or off premise. A public cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services. Finally, a hybrid cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load-balancing between clouds).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"There are situations in which a cost effective backup\/recovery mechanism is highly beneficial. In one embodiment, a provider of maps and navigation systems may start collecting three dimensional (3D) images in order to be able to provide better details for maps and navigation. The volume of data for just one of the services provided may rise from the current volume (about 2 petabytes) to 50 petabytes in the next two years. As a result, the cost of backing up the data may rise by 25 folds in two years. However, if only the data needed for retaining the accuracy of pictures were backed up and some of the image granularity was to be compromised, the volume of the 2 years prospect of data could be reduced to 10 petabytes resulting in a net cost increase of only 5 folds over two years time for the purpose of backup.","In another embodiment, a provider of maps and navigation may need to recover 50 petabytes of data due to a disaster which takes the data center down. In order to recover the 50 petabytes of data, depending on the network speed, it may take up to 24 hours to recover the full dataset. However if only a fraction of data is backed up; and the system is given the ability to recover to a reasonable state, then it may only take around 5 hours to recover to an operational state.","Therefore, a key issue that needs to be addressed is how to enable applications to determine (e.g. tag) criticality of the data they handle, determine data criticality in real time, and use the criticality information to make effective decisions on backing up the data.","Although backing up all the data is not an efficient way of providing availability, backing up only the data space which is critical can ensure a cost effective and a more efficient recovery mechanism for a data platform. Additionally, time sensitiveness of data may affect data recovery.","To address this problem, a system  of  introduces the capability to provide criticality based data backup and recovery. In one embodiment, the data backup platform  treats data management process as a regular periodic motion of a dynamic information flow of a certain number of information trajectories. For example, an information trajectory, similar to a motion trajectory, provides a mapping of information flow through information spaces -","In one embodiment, the process for prediction of the state of information constitutes of sequences of observation of the most recent state trajectory (attractor). The trajectory defines a finite set of possible future states at given point in the (nearest) future. This knowledge is then leveraged in controlling the process management, identifying the most critical parts of the data and determining the optimal working parameters, including information fragments, for the process. The set of possible future states can be further reduced by observing the history of the aspects and by extracting the patterns in their sequences. The transition between the states can be initiated by means of aspects (e.g. regulation rules, semantic rules). The aspects can represent any possible impact of any external entity that can utilize that particular intelligent information management process. Predicting the future impacts (information consumers and providers) to the system significantly improves the accuracy of the state trajectory prediction, and therefore, improves overall utilization of any fragments of information.","In one embodiment, the prediction process is based, at least in part, on power consumption. Various end-to-end setups, for example for communication between user equipments and computation clouds may have different power budgets and constraints (e.g. using battery vs. main power). The power consumption associated with connection maintenance and data transfer between devices varies and can be considered in prediction process.","In one embodiment, future latency requirement (e.g. performance requirement) for each storage unit is estimated by monitoring the local and remote workloads. The storage consumers may provide additional latency requirements for the prediction process.","In one embodiment, due to dynamic nature of communication systems, some storage providers may not be available at all times. This compromises the reliability and availability of the data. In order to provide data to consumers in such conditions, redundancy of data can be increased. For example, data can be replicated to several storage providers or it can be dispersed to minimize the data loss if one or more storage provides become unavailable.","In one embodiment, operational strategies are selected in terms of one or more of the dimensions power consumption, performance, and reliability as described. For example a strategy can aim at minimizing the power consumption while meeting the latency and reliability constraints. Latency minimization and reliability maximization strategies are constructed in a similar way. Furthermore, by introducing weighting factors for each dimension, multiple (or all) dimensions can be optimized simultaneously.","The operational strategies may consider storage space constraints as a prime limitation of any physical storage device. In one embodiment, the prediction process constitutes of sequences of observations of the most recent state trajectory. It is noted that there is a natural relationship between the amount of storage space with any of the parameters of power consumption, performance, and reliability.","In one embodiment, the process of identifying the most critical parts of the data and determining the optimal working parameters may include information fragments, consume a particular additional storage and computational space which may cause additional power consumption and changes in reliability and performance (in particular latency). If the critical content is replicated, the predicted blocks of data incur additional storage space needs and consumption is growing further. In that scope any increase of a redundancy (in terms of pure disperse or replication, or a combination thereof) leads to changes in terms of power consumption, data reliability and performance, thus providing a relationship between storage space and computational consumption and the three parameters.","As shown in , the system  comprises sets -of user equipments (UEs) -having connectivity to the data backup platform  via a communication network . By way of example, the communication network  of system  includes one or more networks such as a data network, a wireless network, a telephony network, or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), a public data network (e.g., the Internet), short range wireless network, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network, and the like, or any combination thereof. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), wireless LAN (WLAN), Bluetooth\u00ae, Internet Protocol (IP) data casting, satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like, or any combination thereof.","The UEs -are any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, notebook computer, netbook computer, tablet computer, personal communication system (PCS) device, personal navigation device, personal digital assistants (PDAs), audio\/video player, digital camera\/camcorder, positioning device, television receiver, radio broadcast receiver, electronic book device, game device, or any combination thereof, including the accessories and peripherals of these devices, or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE  can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.).","In various embodiments, different flow diagrams can be considered as the main sequence of data management process. For example, in one embodiment, the access pattern to the data can be assumed to be a \u201cread any, write many\u201d access which is energy efficient and masks the latency. Additionally, it can be initially assumed that a number of data requests per a certain period of time is viewed as an infinite moving average.","In one embodiment, the future states can be predicated based on the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model which is a statistical model fitted to time series data in order to predict future values (e.g. states) of the data.","In one embodiment, broken bursts or streams are detected and requests per period are pre-processed via wavelet analysis which is a mathematical method for cutting up data into different frequency components, so that each component can be analyzed with a resolution matched to its own scale.","In one embodiment, following the prediction of future states and detection of streams of data, the run-time spectrum data components are detected leading to the detection of most critical content (data).","In one embodiment, upon the detection of critical data, a spectral forecast using the ARIMA model is performed based on the detected run-time spectrum components, the performance (e.g. Input\/output per second or IOPS) or a combination thereof for bandwidth mapping estimation and allocation.","In one embodiment, repeatable run-time spectrum components may represent local request, while non-repeatable run-time spectrum components represent external requests (e.g. feedbacks).","In one embodiment, the data model is reconstructed based on data model characteristics calculation and the tracking of information trajectory, using predictive controller and information trajectory.","In one embodiment, the efficiency is estimated based on content reliability (feedback) from storage providers. Additionally, the error estimation and tracking is performed for further optimization.","In one embodiment, the workload model is considered based, at least in part, on feed-forward control scheme which can be represented in form of single-input single-output (SISO) model. The workload model is also bound with information trajectories of information flow which characterize the user and revise the workload as part of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) model.","It is noted that a corresponding single-input single-output (SISO) model can be considered as a part of distributed data management in case of multiple content producers and multiple content consumers, where the MIMO model is rendered. And, such MIMO model can be used to represent a distributed computing environment which is a dynamically changing system with multitude of uncertainties. A certain type of distributed control can provide robust infrastructure to monitor the status of the dynamically changing system.","By way of example, the UEs -and the data backup platform  communicate with each other and other components of the communication network  using well known, new or still developing protocols. In this context, a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network  interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node, from generating and receiving physical signals of various types, to selecting a link for transferring those signals, to the format of information indicated by those signals, to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.","Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises (1) header information associated with a particular protocol, and (2) payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols, the packet includes (3) trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet, its destination, the length of the payload, and other properties used by the protocol. Often, the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different, higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet, typically include a physical (layer 1) header, a data-link (layer 2) header, an internetwork (layer 3) header and a transport (layer 4) header, and various application (layer 5, layer 6 and layer 7) headers as defined by the OSI Reference Model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["103","103","201","203","205","207","209","211"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 9"],"b":["300","103","300"]},"In one embodiment, per step  of process  of , the state trajectory generator  determines one or more state trajectories associated with one or more information management processes operating on at least one information space -of computation clouds -","The state trajectory generator  may determine the one or more information state trajectories based, at least in part, on various determination factors such as, for example, an inference action, a conceptual clustering, an analogy creation, one or more working conditions, a fault prediction, one or more usage patterns, a workload estimation, or a combination thereof.","The inference action is related to actions leading to inference of the data. The state trajectory generator  can use the inference actions to determine how each action can provide a future state from a current state. The conceptual clustering consists of clustering the data not only based on the inherent structure of the data but also the descriptions available on the data, such as for example, data associated with an event, news, location, etc. The state trajectory generator  can use the conceptual clustering to determine information state trajectories based on commonality or differences among conceptual clusters the data is part of. The analogy creation includes creating interpretations of data using other related data. The working conditions, fault prediction, usage pattern, and workload estimation are other determination factors, associating extra metadata to the data items of the information space -, in order to be able to analyze and categorize the data in a more efficient way and provide trajectories with higher accuracy.","In one embodiment, per step  of , the criticality module  processes and\/or facilitates a processing of the one or more state trajectories to determine criticality information associated with one or more data items of the at least one information space -","In one embodiment, per step  of , the criticality module  processes and\/or facilitates a processing of the one or more state trajectories to determine time-sensitivity information associated with the one or more data items of the at least one information space -","In one embodiment, per step  of , the criticality module  processes and\/or facilitates a processing of the one or more state trajectories to determine one or more future states of the one or more information management processes, the at least one information space -, the one or more data items, or a combination thereof.","In one embodiment, per step  of , the filtering module  determines one or more patterns associated with one or more historical observations of the one or more state trajectories. The historical observations may be stored in storage  and analyzed by the filtering module  for extracting patterns associated with data access.","In one embodiment, per step  of , the filtering module  causes, at least in part, a filtering of the one or more future states determined by the criticality module  based, at least in part, on the one or more patterns.","In one embodiment, per step  of , the criticality module  determines power consumption information, performance information, reliability information, or a combination thereof associated with the at least one information space -, the one or more information management processes, one or more data backup processes, one or more data restoration processes, or a combination thereof.","In one embodiment, the power consumption information, the performance information, the reliability information, or a combination thereof are determined based, at least in part, on one or more workload models.","In one embodiment, per step  of , the central workload estimator  causes, at least in part, a binding of the one or more workload models with the one or more state trajectories.","In one embodiment, per step  of , the central workload estimator  determines to establish a relationship among the one or more workload models and one or more other workload models associated with one or more storage providers associated with the at least one information space -, one or more other information spaces, or a combination thereof.

The central workload estimator  estimates a workload model using the information trajectory generated by the information trajectory generator (ITG) , the information (e.g. requirements) provided by the consumers\/providers , the reference model or content reliability from storage providers , or a combination thereof. However, even though the workload model is valuable for the local workload forecasting, it does not have an actual relationship with the workload models of other storage providers , , . . . , provided by their own local workload estimators (WEs) , , . . . , . Using such relationships between storage providers  and -a distributed storage management mechanism can be developed.","In one embodiment, the central workload estimator  provides a mechanism for relating the local workload estimators -and establishes an aggregated workload model (shown by arrow ) based on the local workload models of each storage providers -, through MIMO model shown as MIMO system entity . It is noted that the distributed data management in the form of predictive control in cooperation with relationship management and information trajectory construction, as described, provides estimation and prediction of connectivity issues as well as structural changes of distributed storage system.","Furthermore, it is noted that in order to construct a model of a certain type of system (or part of the system) the system or its components should be identified in a blind way (as black-boxes). The main idea of such identification is to determine basic transfer characteristics of system (or components) for the further analysis and a certain type of model creation. A typical approach in this case is to capture input and output signals of a system and use a certain analysis to identify the system model. To undertake such identification, the time-series of input and output signals can be processed with Fast Fourier transform (FFT) to the frequency domain, to determine spectral characteristics of the system.","In one embodiment, from device connectivity point of view three states can be determined as disconnected, connected and transitional state between them. All the three states are exploited by workload models and are monitored by the central workload estimator , the local workload estimators -, or a combination thereof.","In one embodiment, any request burst or content access pattern by a provider\/consumer such as a UE -, a process of the computation spaces -, or a combination thereof, is clearly identified by the filtering module  based on one or more appropriate spectrum components.","In one embodiment, for a repeatable run-time spectrum component such content access pattern is defined by the criticality module  as a reliable request and, consequently, as a reliable connection with corresponding request owner. However, for a non-repeatable run-time spectrum component the criticality module  defines such content access patter as a non-reliable request and, consequently, any corresponding request owner is recognized as a suspect to be recognized as a non-reliable.","In one embodiment, the data backup platform  maintains a robust relationship between reliable request owners and forecasts a break point when any reliable request owner becomes non-reliable and vice versa. This can be achieved by the analysis of the request owner's history chain.","It is noted that, in order to create the described functionality, through a spectrum components analysis, a certain form of spectral forecasting procedure should be in place. It is important to note that such procedure should be applicable for single-input single-output (original FF scheme), single-input multiple-output (recombination of FF scheme with multiple output), multiple-input single-output (target model), or a combination thereof. The most general case, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) model can be considered as a recombination of all the cases stated.","It is further noted that, model identification process is based, at least in part; on observation of input\/output signals (access bursts or just requests) thus a signal consistency checking is necessary. Wavelet analysis can provide checking that can ensure that observed signal (which is taken within time window) is consistent. One of the main benefits of such approach is the ability to capture the consistency of the whole system. It means that the reliability of the systems' input-output signals is checked as well as a consistency of system transfer characteristics.","It is also noted that, the MIMO modeling approach is flexible in redefinition of inputs\/outputs and generalization of non-square models. From the practical point of view it means a simple and robust mechanism of increasing\/decreasing complexity while maintaining the system in boundaries of stable operational modes. Such approach can be efficiently applied for modeling an uncertain and changeable environment. According to the targeted environment (distributed storage infrastructure with multitude of uncertainties) model can fit and describe the cases such as (1) joining node, new input AND output synthesis (AND because while online, a node can behave as input and output), (2) leaving node, input OR output removal (OR because the moment of removal can identify only one of the possible type, input or output) wherein two sub-cases can be recognized as (2a) voluntary leaving process (this defines correct and in-order de-registration and any link\/pointer removal process from the routing table), from the MIMO model perspectives it means controllable pole which is moving towards the boundary of the stability area; thus can be observed and potential result predicted, and (2b) non-voluntary leaving process (this defines any type of failure, it means incorrect and out-of-order leaving, including omitting any de-registration process). (3) update node, no input\/output related topology activity (by definition should provide mechanism of stability status update), and (4) node under normal operation.","In one embodiment, considering N storage consumers that are willing to communicate with M storage providers, and assuming that a set k of simultaneous transfers takes place, the following model for this multi-access environment can be constructed (MIMO basic definition):\n\n\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwherein, S=(S, S, . . . , S) is the transferred data vector which comprises of k packets; each is transmitted with a power P, with reliability factor R and latency L.\n","Furthermore, H=(h, h, . . . , h) is M*|k| workloads cross-coupling matrix (eventually provides storage management subsystem characteristics), where the hrepresents the impact from i-th storage consumer in the set of k at the j-th storage provider and are in the state-space of \u03be(P, R, L). The vector wcan be complex-valued characteristics of uncertainties, modeled by means of noise. In fact his a combined weight function of power, reliability and latency parameters and can be represented in the form of h=\u03c6P+\u03c1R+\u03c3L, where \u03c6, \u03c1, \u03c3 are corresponding weights (or weight functions).","In one embodiment, for example, the system may need to consume minimum power while maintaining the reliability and latency factors within a certain range. Additionally, the system may need to provide a guaranteed latency factor while keeping reliability factor within a thresholds and tracking power consumption and minimizing it in any possible way. As a result of these conditions, two main stages are essential to construct a distributed workload model and corresponding predictive control. Firstly, the system his identified as a black-box (blind identification). The local workload estimators -(N-input M-output system identification) can be considered as parts of the MIMO model. Secondly, the control mechanism of identified model is constructed using weight functions. The predictive control is based on content (data) providers\/consumers workload estimation feed-forward component models.","In one embodiment, various backup mechanisms such as, for example skewed backup , non-uniform backup , or a combination thereof is used.","In one embodiment, the central workload estimator  manages the support facilities for the skewed data backup  and the non-uniform content backup  by constructing behavioral models of the access patterns.","In one embodiment, a backup content distribution (not shown) cooperates with the central workload estimator  during all operational time. A backup content distribution can serve the role of a black-box that can be predicted with help of workload model approximation method (ex. ARIMA) and therefore is used for the storage control framework. In that sense autoregressive models capture input\/output behavior of that black-box.","In one embodiment, the request rate, not only for a particular data object, but for the whole storage provider (consumer\/provider ) is considered. The access pattern can be formed as a combination of Read and Write requests that are issued at a certain request rate by consumers or producers. The workload model used by the central workload estimator , the local workload estimators -, or a combination thereof, represents forecasted request rate of a system (e.g. a UE -) payload as a function y(t) that depends on series of actual request rate x(t) (Read and Write requests).

Coefficients \u03b1, \u03b2can be identified using frequency transform methods such as, for example, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) because spectrum domain and model coefficients have the same information.","In one embodiment, in order to realize the statements above, a feed-forward control scheme for the distributed storage model can be defined. Using feed-forward workload estimation and predictive workload detection the most relevant content (data) can be identified and reassigned.","It is important to note that local content backup mechanisms can be managed by feed-forward component. According to the estimated workload, feed-forward component can elaborate the necessary impacts on content backup and represent appropriate impacts from any remote request (consumer\/provider ).","In one embodiment, the MIMO model identification and predictive control design can be determined using any known techniques. In general, having estimated cross correlation and correspondingly cross power spectrum, a recombined spectrum domain analysis is undertaken. It can be estimated through cross cumulant spectrum analysis.","In one embodiment, as an initial step, a cross polyspectra matrix for magnitude and for phase retrieval is estimated. The main purpose of using the matrix is to separate repeatable run-time (RRT) spectrum component and non-repeatable run-time (NRRT) components, and, to predict break points when the transformation between them happens (direct and indirect way). By definition, the RRT spectrum component identifies a most relevant content access and also can be recognized as a reliable request. On the contrary, the NRRT spectrum component identifies all least relevant content access and can be recognized as a non-reliable request. Spectrum component type identification process, in fact, is based on basic stability analysis. It means, while constructing a workload model by means of the coefficients identification in spectrum domain, an appropriate model stability analysis can be undertaken. The model stability analysis can identify fluctuations between RRT and NRRT states of spectrum components.","In one embodiment, following the stability analysis, calculation of the system model can be undertaken and the reconstruction of the whole system model can follow. During the reconstruction a necessary optimization through error estimation and tracking can be done.","In one embodiment, multiple devices may be collaborating (connected and interacting via shared content). Since every device has a workload model, every model can reflect a certain impact from any other workload model of any other device. By means of such impacts a correlation aspect can be identified. Any existing correlation aspect can be unified under a MIMO system. In that sense, parameters that were stated above (RRT and NRRT) can be recognized as aspects of such correlation.","As was previously stated, access pattern to any content is formed as a combination of Read and Write requests that are issued at a certain request rate by consumers or producers . In general, any particular workload model represents forecasted request rate of a system (e.g. UE -) payload as a function y(t) that depends on series of actual request rate x(t) (Read and Write requests).","In one embodiment, each workload model reflects a certain impacts not only from local accesses, but from any external consumer\/provider . It means that such impacts (spectrum components, in case of frequency domain analysis) should have major visible shape in such external workload model and minor visible shape in any workload model which has been remotely accessed by content consumer\/provider .","In one embodiment, a multitude of workload estimator models can be presented in the form of a consolidated entity with multiple-input and multiple-output channels. To the better extent, according to the actual computing environment the number of such entities can be more than one.

An attractor is a set to which a dynamic system evolves after a long enough time. That is, points that get close enough to the attractor remain close even if slightly disturbed. A trajectory of the dynamical system in the attractor does not have to satisfy any special constraints except for remaining on the attractor.","As seen in , the space within the closed line  represents a trajectory of active states (circles) for information management process i between time points A and B.

Assuming that process i is a relevant process for the information fragment F and predicted state  can benefit from the information fragment F, then the information fragment F can be determined as recyclable for process i. Otherwise, if the information fragment F is determined to be reusable for a state (such as  which is too far off from the predicted future states for process i), then the state trajectory generator  may identify information fragment F as non-recyclable for process i since the probability of it being reused within time frame B to C is low.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0120"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["107","107","503","107","107"],"i":["a","i","a","i "]},"In one embodiment, UEs , , and belong to the same user and in combination provide a personal cloud  for the user.

The processor  may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors (DSP) , or one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) . A DSP  typically is configured to process real-world signals (e.g., sound) in real time independently of the processor . Similarly, an ASIC  can be configured to performed specialized functions not easily performed by a more general purpose processor. Other specialized components to aid in performing the inventive functions described herein may include one or more field programmable gate arrays (FPGA), one or more controllers, or one or more other special-purpose computer chips.","In one embodiment, the chip set or chip  includes merely one or more processors and some software and\/or firmware supporting and\/or relating to and\/or for the one or more processors.","The processor  and accompanying components have connectivity to the memory  via the bus . The memory  includes both dynamic memory (e.g., RAM, magnetic disk, writable optical disk, etc.) and static memory (e.g., ROM, CD-ROM, etc.) for storing executable instructions that when executed perform the inventive steps described herein to provide criticality based data backup. The memory  also stores the data associated with or generated by the execution of the inventive steps.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0158","num":"0157"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 1"],"b":"1001"},"Pertinent internal components of the telephone include a Main Control Unit (MCU) , a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) , and a receiver\/transmitter unit including a microphone gain control unit and a speaker gain control unit. A main display unit  provides a display to the user in support of various applications and mobile terminal functions that perform or support the steps of providing criticality based data backup. The display  includes display circuitry configured to display at least a portion of a user interface of the mobile terminal (e.g., mobile telephone). Additionally, the display  and display circuitry are configured to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal. An audio function circuitry  includes a microphone  and microphone amplifier that amplifies the speech signal output from the microphone . The amplified speech signal output from the microphone  is fed to a coder\/decoder (CODEC) .","A radio section  amplifies power and converts frequency in order to communicate with a base station, which is included in a mobile communication system, via antenna . The power amplifier (PA)  and the transmitter\/modulation circuitry are operationally responsive to the MCU , with an output from the PA  coupled to the duplexer  or circulator or antenna switch, as known in the art. The PA  also couples to a battery interface and power control unit .","In use, a user of mobile terminal  speaks into the microphone  and his or her voice along with any detected background noise is converted into an analog voltage. The analog voltage is then converted into a digital signal through the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) . The control unit  routes the digital signal into the DSP  for processing therein, such as speech encoding, channel encoding, encrypting, and interleaving. In one embodiment, the processed voice signals are encoded, by units not separately shown, using a cellular transmission protocol such as enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, and the like, or any combination thereof.","The encoded signals are then routed to an equalizer  for compensation of any frequency-dependent impairments that occur during transmission though the air such as phase and amplitude distortion. After equalizing the bit stream, the modulator  combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator  generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission, an up-converter  combines the sine wave output from the modulator  with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer  to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA  to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems, the PA  acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP  from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer  and optionally sent to an antenna coupler  to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally, the signal is transmitted via antenna  to a local base station. An automatic gain control (AGC) can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone, any other mobile phone or a land-line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), or other telephony networks.","Voice signals transmitted to the mobile terminal  are received via antenna  and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier (LNA) . A down-converter  lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator  strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer  and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)  converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker , all under control of a Main Control Unit (MCU)  which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit (CPU).","The MCU  receives various signals including input signals from the keyboard . The keyboard  and\/or the MCU  in combination with other user input components (e.g., the microphone ) comprise a user interface circuitry for managing user input. The MCU  runs a user interface software to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal  to provide criticality based data backup. The MCU  also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display  and to the speech output switching controller, respectively. Further, the MCU  exchanges information with the DSP  and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card  and a memory . In addition, the MCU  executes various control functions required of the terminal. The DSP  may, depending upon the implementation, perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally, DSP  determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone  and sets the gain of microphone  to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile terminal .","The CODEC  includes the ADC  and DAC . The memory  stores various data including call incoming tone data and is capable of storing other data including music data received via, e.g., the global Internet. The software module could reside in RAM memory, flash memory, registers, or any other form of writable storage medium known in the art. The memory device  may be, but not limited to, a single memory, CD, DVD, ROM, RAM, EEPROM, optical storage, magnetic disk storage, flash memory storage, or any other non-volatile storage medium capable of storing digital data.","An optionally incorporated SIM card  carries, for instance, important information, such as the cellular phone number, the carrier supplying service, subscription details, and security information. The SIM card  serves primarily to identify the mobile terminal  on a radio network. The card  also contains a memory for storing a personal telephone number registry, text messages, and user specific mobile terminal settings.","While the invention has been described in connection with a number of embodiments and implementations, the invention is not so limited but covers various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements, which fall within the purview of the appended claims.
