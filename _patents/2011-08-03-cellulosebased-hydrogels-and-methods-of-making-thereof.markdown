Pneumatic side action grips can be used to secure the samples (#2712-019, Instron). Samples can be tested with a constant extension rate (for example, of about 2 mm\/min) until failure. In accordance with the invention, tear strength is calculated as the force at failure divided by the average thickness (N\/mm).","In some embodiments, the wet cellulose hydrogel has a tear strength of from about 0.10 N\/mm to about 0.60 N\/mm. In some embodiments, the tear strength is from about 0.20 N\/mm to about 0.40 N\/mm, or from about 0.25 N\/mm to about 0.35 N\/mm.

In some embodiments, the strain to failure ranges from about 20% to about 30%, or from about 25% to about 30%.","In some embodiments of the invention, suture retention strength of cellulose hydrogels can be characterized as a measure of their feasibility for surgical implementation. In some embodiments, suture retention can be important for cellulose hydrogels to secure and maintain their position, for example, during surgery, healing and function. For example, in some embodiments, a surgeon must rely on the ability of the implantable material to not only accept suture without tearing during needle insertion, but also to retain the suture without tearing away from the sutured edge of the implant. To perform suture retention strength studies, cellulose hydrogel samples can be cut from cellulose sheets. For example, samples can be cut to be rectangles 2 cm\u00d74 cm. The samples can be tested using a 500N capacity tabletop mechanical testing system (#5942R4910, Instron) with a 5N maximum static load cell (#102608, Instron). Pneumatic side action grips can be used to secure the samples (#2712-019, Instron). Before testing, the thickness of the sample can be measured at three points along one of the short edges (designated the top edge). The sample can then be secured in the stationary (bottom) pneumatic grip, with half of the sample inside of the grip, and a suture was threaded through the sample once in the center of the sample with a bite size of 2 mm from the top edge. For example, Ethicon Ethilon 10-0 ophthalmic sutures can be used (7756G and 7711G, Ethicon, Inc.). Both ends of the suture can be secured in the movable (top) pneumatic grip. See  for a diagram of the sample setup. Samples can be tested with a constant extension rate (for example, of 10 mm\/min) until failure. The suture retention strength can be taken to be the force at failure divided by the average sample thickness (N\/mm).","In some embodiments, the suture retention strength of wet cellulose hydrogels is from about 0.05 N\/mm to about 0.30 N\/mm. In some embodiments, the suture retention strength is from about 0.08 N\/mm to about 0.23 N\/mm, from about 0.1 N\/mm to about 0.2 N\/mm or from about 0.12 N\/mm to about 0.18 N\/mm.

In some embodiments, transmittance at 550 nm is measured. As transmittance is dependent upon thickness, the thickness of each sample can be measured with calipers prior to loading in the spectrophotometer.

This method directly measures the number of oxygen molecules diffusing though the material by measuring an electric current generated by the reduction of oxygen at the cathode. In a single polarographic determination, four samples of the same material with different thicknesses can be used. This results in a linear relation between the inverse of oxygen transmissibility and the sample thickness. The sample can be placed onto the surface of the electrode (cell), fixed gently by pressing toward the electrode and retained with an o-ring. Then, a saline solution (e.g., 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4) is poured into the reservoir on the material, and the system is ready for the measurement of the electric current. The system is held in a humidity chamber at 35\u00b0 C. with high humidity (the polarographic cell and the saline solution were in the humidity chamber prior the measurement to achieve equilibrium conditions). The saline solution and the sample are saturated with atmospheric oxygen. To remove it, nitrogen gas is bubbled through a glass frit while monitoring current, until the current decreases to nearly zero. Once most of the oxygen is removed, air is bubbled into the solution, and the increase in electric current is observed as the oxygen molecules react with the cathode. The current is recorded until it reaches a stationary state.","In some embodiments, the cellulose content of the wet cellulose hydrogel is about 2% to about 9% by weight.

For example, samples can be heated from room temperature to about 400\u00b0 C. and their masses are measured during the heating. The mass lost during the temperature increase reflects the water content and the remainder, the cellulose content.","In some embodiments, the cellulose hydrogel has a thickness of about 10 \u03bcm to about 2500 \u03bcm.

Different thicknesses can be produced, depending on the intended use.","In some embodiments, the cellulose hydrogel can be provided in the desired thickness using a single layer of the hydrogel material, or using multiple layers of the hydrogel material. In some embodiments, the cellulose hydrogel comprises a plurality of layers or plys. For example, a plurality of (i.e. two or more) layers of cellulose hydrogel material, can be bonded together to form a multilaminate structure. In some embodiments, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, or more cellulose hydrogel layers are bonded together to provide a multilaminate material.

In certain embodiments, a cellulose fiber layer is rotated between about 5-90 degrees relative to an adjacent layer. In some embodiments, the cellulose fibers are substantially aligned relative to the other cellulose fibers in the same layer. In some embodiments, the fibers can be aligned by a process selected from the group consisting of wet drawing (stretching wet gels to cause alignment of fibers), syringe pump synthesis (ejecting fibers through an array of syringes forming the gel from these aligned fibers), subjecting the fibers to electric or magnetic fields (fields interact with charged particles on the cellulose), and a combination thereof.

In some embodiments, the cellulose hydrogel comprises one or more layers of cellulose of bacterial origin and one or more layers of cellulose of plant origin.","In some embodiments, the cellulose hydrogel is a composite comprising cellulose and one or more synthetic polymers. In some embodiments, the one or more synthetic polymers are selected from the group consisting of hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA), poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA), polyacrylamide, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyethyleneoxide (PEO), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), and silicones.","The synthetic or natural polymer can be added to the cellulose before, during or after the cellulose forms a gel. In some embodiments, the synthetic polymer forms a gel and is added to the cellulose hydrogel in a layered fashion. In some embodiments, the cellulose hydrogel comprises alternating layers of cellulose and one or more synthetic polymers. In some embodiments, the synthetic or natural polymer is layered on top of the cellulose hydrogel.","In some embodiments, the cellulose hydrogel is prepared by a process comprising:","(i) contacting cellulose with a solvent to activate the cellulose;","(ii) optionally removing the solvent from the activated cellulose;","(iii) substantially dissolving the activated cellulose to form a solution; and","(iv) allowing the solution to gel.","In some embodiments, the process further comprises: (v) drying the gel and rehydrating the gel, to create a re-wet cellulose hydrogel. In some embodiments, a salt, such as LiCl, is added to step (i) directly, and step (ii) is omitted. In some embodiments, step (ii) is performed, and a solvent is added to the activated cellulose to substantially dissolve it. In some embodiments, the solvent includes a salt, such as LiCl.","In some embodiments, the cellulose content of the solution of (iv) is from about 1.0% to about 6.5% weight\/volume (wt\/vol). In some embodiments, the cellulose content is from about 1.5% to about 6.0% wt\/vol, from about 2.0% to about 5.0% wt\/vol, or from about 2.5% to about 3.0% wt\/vol.

In some embodiments, the gel is washed for several hours in running water to remove all salts\/solvents. In one embodiment, the mold is a contact lens mold.","In some embodiments, the solvent of step (i) is selected from the group consisting of dimethylacetamide, water, methanol, acetone, ethanol and a combination of water and ethanol.","Any suitable technique can be used for removing the solvent of step (i), if desired, including decanting the solvent from the reaction mixture.","The activated cellulose can be substantially dissolved in any solvent suitable for such dissolution. In some embodiments, the solvent for dissolving the cellulose is selected from the group consisting of cupriethylenediamine (CED), cadmiumethylenediamine (Cadoxen), LiCl\/dimethylacetamide (LiCl\/DMAc), Ca(SCN)\/water, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BmimCl), NaOH\/water, N-methyl-morpholine-N-oxide (NMMO)\/water, and 1-allyl-3-methyllimidazolium chloride.

In some embodiments, the drying temperature can be in the range of about 25-90\u00b0 C., and the drying time varies based on the hydrogel's thickness. In some embodiments, sheets of cellulose hydrogel are dried or dehydrated between glass plates lined with Teflon film in an oven above 100\u00b0 C. for several hours, preferably about 5 hours.","In some embodiments, the gel is dried by a solvent exchange followed by supercritical CO. When drying the gel by a solvent exchange process followed by supercritical CO, in one embodiment, gels are immersed in a solvent, for example, methanol, and placed under a vacuum in a chamber. The gel then undergoes a purge cycle and the methanol is replaced by liquid CO. Solvents other than methanol can also be used, including acetone.","Any suitable technique or conditions for rehydrating the gel may be used, including, in some embodiments, rehydrating the gel in tap or deionized water for several hours. In some embodiments, the gel is rehydrated in a substantially sterile aqueous solution, such as saline, or buffered saline. In some embodiments, the gel is rehydrated in biological growth medium such as DMEM.","The cellulose hydrogels of the invention can be provided and packaged in a dehydrated or hydrated state. Dehydration of the cellulose hydrogel can be achieved by any means known in the art. For example, dehydration can be accomplished by lyophilization, including, for instance, freeze-drying or evaporative cooling techniques, air-drying, heating, or the like. When desired, a suitable aqueous medium can be used to rehydrate a dehydrated material of the invention prior to use. In some embodiments, the aqueous medium can be pure water or a physiologically acceptable solution such as phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).","In some embodiments, the packaging material is impermeable to water to prevent the cellulose hydrogel membrane from drying out, and be able to withstand a sterilization process, if desired.","In some embodiments, the cellulose hydrogel membrane is sterilized before or after packaging. Such sterilization procedures can include, for example, gamma irradiation and electron beam sterilization or autoclave.","The cellulose hydrogels of the invention have many uses, including, for example, as contact lenses, wound dressings, including transparent bandages, ocular bandages, corneal onlays, corneal inlays, and for corneal replacement, including partial or full-thickness corneal implants. Other uses of the cellulose hydrogels include, without limitation, wound healing applications, tissue regenerative applications, cardiovascular applications, orthopedic applications, and urologic applications. Still other applications of the cellulose hydrogels of the invention include drug delivery systems, including sustained-release delivery systems, osmotic membranes (for drug delivery or other uses), chemical or biological sensor membranes, transparent structural material, diapers or sanitary napkins due to their absorbent properties, breast or other cosmetic implants, as well as other medical devices in which the cellulose hydrogels of the invention would be suitable.","In some embodiments, the cellulose hydrogel is used as a soft contact lens for vision correction.

Force can then applied, by a spring clamp, for example, to keep the first half together with the second half of the mold. The mold can then be placed in a humidity chamber having a suitable relative humidity and temperature. In some embodiments, the relative humidity is from about 35% to about 55% (for example 40%), while the temperature is from about 30\u00b0 C. to about 50\u00b0 C. (for example, about 40\u00b0 C.). After a sufficient period of time, about 48 hours in one embodiment, the clamp or other force applied can be removed and the mold opened. Any excess cellulose and gel can then be trimmed, as desired. The lens can then be stored in a suitable buffer, including, for example, PBS. In particular, one method for making a cellulose hydrogel contact lens in accordance with the invention is described in Example 5 and illustrated in .","In some embodiments, after the contact lens is removed from the mold it may undergo additional processing steps such as trimming, edge chamfering, cleaning, sterilization, hydration, polishing, coating with an antireflective coating, and packaging for shipment. In some embodiments, the contact lens will be coated or imbibed with an adjuvant, for example a neutral alkane mineral oil, such as DRAKEOL-20 or SOOTHE, which augments and fortifies the oil layer of the tear film by reducing evaporation of the aqueous component of the tear film while lubricating the action of the eye lids.","In some embodiments, the contact lens cellulose hydrogel has a refractive index of about 1.34, a base curve radius of from about 7.9 to about 8.4 mm, a center thickness of between about 65 and 110 microns, and a spherical front radius of from about 8.6 to 9.0 mm.","In some embodiments, the present invention also provides kits and packaging and solutions comprising the cellulose hydrogel contact lens of the invention, and optionally instructions for their use, as described further below.","In some embodiments, the cellulose hydrogel contact lenses are packaged in blister packages or glass vials. In some embodiments, the cellulose hydrogel membranes are stored in saline or deionized water in the packages. In some embodiments, the cellulose hydrogel contact lenses may tend to stick to itself and to the package. Therefore, in some embodiments, the packaging solutions for blister-packs are formulated to reduce or eliminate folding and sticking. In some embodiments, the packaging solutions may include a polymer to improve comfort of the cellulose hydrogel membrane. In some embodiments, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is added to packaging solution. The packaging solution can include polyethylene oxide (PEO)\/polypropylene oxide (PPO) block copolymers, such as poloxamers or poloxamines, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,832,856.","In some embodiments, the contact lenses are packaged in a blister pack. Examples of typical art blister packs are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,704,468, 4,392,569, 5,620,088, 5,620,088, 4,691,820, 5,823,327, 5,853,085, and EP Publication Nos. 1092645 A1, 1092645, and 0129388, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In some embodiments, the lenses are packaged in a blister pack polypropylene receptacle (herein after referred to as a \u201cboat\u201d), topped by a multi-layer film consisting of polyethylene, aluminum, a bonding agent and polypropylene. In some embodiments, the boat is an injection molded plastic which has high stiffness but is capable of limited elastic deflection and includes a preformed recess. The boat is filled with a suitable storage solution, such as saline, and receives a single lens in situ. In some embodiments, blister pack is autoclaved using steam and pressure to terminal sterility. These blister packs can be presented to the subject or health care provider in boxes of individual packs or as multiple blister strips. In some embodiments, the lenses are kept hydrated while in the package. Preferably, the package is well sealed and should minimize water vapor transmission through the boat and laminated layer to maximize the shelf life and prevent drying out of the contact lenses contained therein. In use, the user removes the laminated material from a flange formed on the boat by peeling back the cover to expose the cellulose hydrogel membranes immersed in a hydrating solution.","In at least some embodiments, the contact lenses will be corrective of vision and can be single vision, bifocal, trifocal, and progressive. In some embodiments, the peripheral edges to the lenses will be chamfered or beveled to round the peripheral edges so as to prevent snagging onto the eyelid wiper during blinking","Additionally, in other embodiments of the present invention, the cellulose hydrogel can be configured or used for other treatments of the eye of a subject. In some embodiments, the hydrogel can be used to repair or replace the cornea and\/or conjunctiva tissue of the eye. For example, the biocompatible material may be implanted in the treatment of corneal epithelial defects such as corneal ulcers (breaks in the outer layer of the epithelium of the cornea) and\/or for ocular surface reconstruction.","The cellulose hydrogels of the invention also can be useful for replacing all or a portion of the cornea of an eye. In some embodiments, at least a portion of a damaged or diseased cornea of a subject is removed, and the cellulose hydrogel of the invention is implanted in its place. The implant can be attached to the eye in any suitable fashion. In some embodiments, the implant is attached using sutures. In some embodiments, the subject is a human or other mammal. Corneal implants incorporating a cellulose hydrogel of the present invention may be provided in a shape corresponding to all or a portion of a native cornea. The implant can be provided as single-layer or multiple-layer of cellulose hydrogel material to provide the desired thickness.","In some embodiments, the hydrogel can be used as a corneal onlay. As used herein, a \u201ccorneal onlay\u201d is an ophthalmic implant or device configured for placement between the epithelium or an epithelial cell layer and Bowman's membrane of an eye. In comparison, a contact lens is configured for placement over the epithelium of an eye. A corneal onlay may thus be located after placement entirely over the Bowman's membrane, or may include one or more portions extending into the Bowman's membrane. Such portions preferably constitute a minor portion of the device, for example, less than 50% of the area or volume of the device.","In some embodiments, the hydrogel can be used as a corneal inlay. As used herein, a \u201ccorneal inlay\u201d is a device or implant configured to be placed in the stroma of an eye. Corneal inlays may be placed in the stroma by forming a flap or a pocket in the stroma. Corneal inlays are placed below the Bowman's membrane of an eye.","Medical implants incorporating the cellulose hydrogel of the invention can be provided in a variety of shapes, including planar (e.g. sheet-form) and non-planar shapes. Exemplary non-planar shape implants include implants configured to have a concave surface, e.g., to substantially correspond to a convex surface of eye tissue against which the implant will reside. Thus, certain implants of the invention will have a convexo-concave structure in their relaxed state, for example in the case of a parabolic shape or a segment of a sphere (e.g. hemisphere). Such an implant may in some cases serve as a lens.","Application of the teachings of the present invention to a specific problem is within the capabilities of one having ordinary skill in the art in light of the teaching contained herein.

In a separate beaker, 8 grams of LiCl was dissolved in 100 ml DMAc, and stirred at 350 rpm. The DMAc was decanted from the activated cellulose powder and the LiCl\/DMAc solution was poured onto the cellulose, and stirred for 10 minutes. The resulting transparent solutions were poured into desired molds and allowed to \u201cgel\u201d overnight. The gels were de-molded and washed in running water for several hours.","The hydrogels were subjected to various analyses, including Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to determine 1) whether there were any chemical differences between different varieties of cellulose, 2) how different phases of cellulose compare (raw powder, wet hydrogel, dry gel, re-wet gel) and 3) whether the gels were washed successfully. As shown in , there were no significant chemical differences between the varieties of cellulose and the washing procedure was successful.","X-ray diffraction analysis was performed to determine whether there were any differences in crystallinity between the varieties of cellulose and how crystallinity compared between the raw powder and hydrogel phases. The degree of crystallinity (I=1\u2212(I\/I)) was calculated according to Buschle-Diller and Zeronian, 45, 967 (1992).

Tear Strength","The tear strength of cellulose hydrogels in three different states (hydrated, dehydrated, and rehydrated) was characterized. All samples were made to conform to the geometry stated in ASTM standard D 624-00, sample type C. Samples in the hydrated state were made by pouring the cellulose+LiCl\/DMAc solution into a mold with the appropriate sample geometry. Cheesecloth was placed in the ends of the mold before pouring to assist in gripping the hydrated gels during testing. Hydrated samples were allowed to gel overnight, washed in running tap water for 2-4 hours, soaked in tap water with frequent water exchange for 24-48 hours, and stored in tap water. Sheets of cellulose hydrogel were made by pouring the cellulose LiCl\/DMAc solution onto a glass plate and allowing to gel overnight. Sheets were dehydrated between glass plates lined with Teflon film in an oven above 100\u00b0 C. for approximately 5 hours. The sheets were then rehydrated in tap water for several hours. Samples were cut from rehydrated sheets by hand and either returned to water (rehydrated) or allowed to air dry (dehydrated). The thickness of all samples was measured prior to testing in three locations near the site of tearing (at the apex, above and below the apex) and the three values were averaged to obtain the sample thickness. All samples were tested using a 500N capacity tabletop mechanical testing system (#5942R4910, Instron) with a 5N maximum static load cell (#102608, Instron). Pneumatic side action grips were used to secure the samples (#2712-019, Instron). Samples were tested with a constant extension rate of 2 mm\/min until failure. The tear strength was calculated as the force at failure divided by the average thickness (N\/mm). Two different cellulose materials (Avicel 101 and Aldrich 4) and two different concentrations (2 g and 5 g) were characterized and compared in each state (hydrated, dehydrated, and rehydrated). See . Tear strength of typical contact lenses is 0.37-0.49 N\/mm.","2. Suturability Characterization","Methods","The suture retention strength of cellulose hydrogels was characterized as a measure of their surgical feasibility. Cellulose hydrogels in three states (hydrated, dehydrated, and rehydrated) were characterized. Samples were cut from cellulose sheets as described above. Samples were cut in rectangles 2 cm\u00d74 cm. The testing procedure described by Trowbridge et al. was modified for use in this study (Trowbridge, E. A., Lawford, P. V., and Crofts, C. E. Pericardial heterografts: a comparative study of suture pull-out and tissue strength. 11 (1989) 311-14). All samples were tested using a 500N capacity tabletop mechanical testing system (#5942R4910, Instron) with a 5N maximum static load cell (#102608, Instron). Pneumatic side action grips were used to secure the samples (#2712-019, Instron). Before testing, the thickness of each sample was measured at three points along one of the short edges (designated the top edge). The sample was then secured in the stationary (bottom) pneumatic grip, with half of the sample inside of the grip, and a suture was threaded through the sample once in the center of the sample with a bite size of 2 mm from the top edge. Ethicon Ethilon 10-0 ophthalmic sutures were used (7756G and 7711G, Ethicon, Inc.). Both ends of the suture were secured in the movable (top) pneumatic grip.  shows a diagram of the sample setup, and  shows results of the testing. Samples were tested with a constant extension rate of 10 mm\/min until failure. The suture retention strength was taken to be the force at failure divided by the average sample thickness (N\/mm).","3. Puncture Testing","Puncture strength was measured according to the method described by Radebaugh et al. (Radebaugh et al., 45, 1988, p 39-46). A schematic of their setup is shown in , and the fixture used for testing is shown in . Rather than fixing the hydrogel between two plates using screws, which can pinch or tear the gel, the hydrogels were secured to the fixture with cyanoacrylate.

This method directly measures the number of oxygen molecules diffusing though the material by measuring an electric current generated by the reduction of oxygen at the cathode. In a single polarographic determination, for example, four samples of the same material with different thicknesses can be used. This results in a linear relation between the inverse of oxygen transmissibility and the sample thickness. The sample is placed onto the surface of the electrode (cell), fixed gently by pressing toward the electrode and retained with an o-ring. Then, a saline solution (0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4) is poured into the reservoir on the material, and the system is ready for measuring the electric current. The system is held in a humidity chamber at 35\u00b0 C. with high humidity (the polarographic cell and the saline solution are in the humidity chamber prior the measurement to achieve equilibrium conditions). The saline solution and the sample are saturated with atmospheric oxygen. To remove the oxygen, nitrogen gas is bubbled through a glass frit while monitoring current, until the current decreases to nearly zero. Once most of the oxygen is removed, air is bubbled into the solution, and the increase in electric current is observed as the oxygen molecules react with the cathode. The current is recorded until it reaches a stationary state.","Two drops of PBS buffer are added to the cavity in the bottom half of a contact lens mold, an embodiment of which is illustrated in . The cavity is covered with a 2 cm\u00d72 cm sheet of cellulose (which can be substituted with a cellulose hydrogel of the invention). 1-2 more drops of PBS buffer are placed on top of the cellulose. The top half of the contact lens mold is then put over the bottom half. A spring clamp is then applied to keep the halves together. The mold is then placed in a humidity chamber at 40% relative humidity and 40\u00b0 C. After 48 hours, the clamp is removed and the mold is opened. The excess cellulose and gel is then trimmed and removed as necessary. The lens is then stored in PBS buffer.","All references, including publications, patent applications, and patents, cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each reference were individually and specifically indicated to be incorporated by reference and were set forth in its entirety herein."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The skilled artisan will understand that the drawings, described below, are for illustration purposes only.
