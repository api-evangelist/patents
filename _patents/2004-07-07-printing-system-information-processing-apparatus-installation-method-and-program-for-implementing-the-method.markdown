Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a printing system which is constructed on a network including a server apparatus, client apparatuses, and printers usable by the client apparatuses, an information processing apparatus for use in the printing system, an installation method for the printing system, and an installation program for implementing the method.","2. Description of the Related Art","Methods of installing a printer driver include an OS-dependent type. In the case of an OS-dependent method which is dependent e.g. on Windows (registered trademark), a user selects addition of a printer from a window of the properties of a printer, and then inputs necessary information through an interactive user guide called Wizard, to thereby install a printer driver. With a view to minimizing user operation, there is also conventionally employed a method using an installer, similarly to the case of installing an application program.","However, when either of the above-mentioned installation methods is employed in an environment where numerous client apparatuses are used by numerous users, such as company users, it becomes necessary to carry out the operation of installing printer drivers in all of the client apparatuses, and therefore the total number of man-hours needed for the operation cannot be neglected from an economical point of view. Further, the installation of a printer driver in a client apparatus requires a predetermined skill level or higher. Therefore, it becomes necessary to prepare a detailed manual for the installing operation, or provide tutorials for all the users of the client apparatuses. In the worst case, a network administrator has to carry out an enormous amount of work for installing a printer driver in each of the client apparatuses. In short, the number of man-hours needed for the installing operation increases with an increase in the number of the client apparatuses.","As a method capable of minimizing the number of man-hours needed for installation of printer drivers, there has been proposed a method called Point & Print installation, which uses a print server, e.g. in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2003-140852.

Also, the CPU  opens various registered windows in response to commands e.g. by a mouse cursor or the like (not shown) on the display , and executes various data processes.","The clients  to  are similar in arrangement to the server  described above, and therefore description thereof is omitted.","Next, a description will be given of the arrangement of each of the printers  to , with reference to .  is a block diagram showing the arrangement of the printer  in . The printers  to  are identical in arrangement, and therefore the following description will be given of the arrangement of the printer  as a representative.","As shown in , the printer  includes a controller  that controls the operation of the printer . The controller  is provided with a network I\/F  for connection to the LAN . The network I\/F  obtains print information, such as text, graphics, and images, outputted in printer language forms, from the clients  to  via the LAN . The obtained print information is supplied to a CPU  via a system bus .","The CPU  expands the print information from the clients  to  in a work area of a RAM , according to a control program stored in a program ROM of a ROM  or in an external memory , and sends image data as an image signal for each page, to a printer section (printer engine)  via the system bus  and the printer section I\/F , to thereby control the printer section  to record the image signal on sheets on a page-by-page basis.","The ROM  includes not only the program ROM, but also a font ROM and a data ROM.

The clients  to  are identical in software configuration, and therefore the following description will be given of the software configuration of the client  as a representative.","As shown in , in the client , an application  stored in an external memory is loaded into a RAM and executed. When printing is carried out according to the application  using e.g. the printer , a graphic engine  which is enabled by being loaded into the RAM, similarly to the application , is used for outputting (image drawing). The graphic engine  loads a printer driver  provided on a printer-by-printer basis into the RAM from the external memory, and converts an output from the application  into a control command for the printer  using the printer driver . The printer control command obtained by the conversion is sent to a system spooler  loaded into the RAM by the OS, followed by being outputted to the printer  via the LAN .","In the present embodiment, the server  has the function of carrying out push installation, as described above. According to the push installation, a printer driver is distributed from the server  to the clients  to  via the LAN , and installed thereon. The push installation includes a process executed by the server  for changing the settings of the clients  to  concerning the apparatus configuration of the printers  to , in accordance with a change in the apparatus configuration.","Now, a description will be given of a reference example of the system as a precondition for the present invention, with reference to , before describing the push installation of a printer driver in each of the clients  to  by the server  and the operation of changing the settings of the clients  to  concerning the apparatus configuration of the printers  to .  is a block diagram showing the reference example of the system as the precondition for the present invention.","In the reference example of the system, as shown in , a server , a client , and a printer  are interconnected via a network, and a driver corresponding to the printer  is installed in the client  using the push installation. More specifically, the driver corresponding to the printer  is installed from the server  in the client  via the network (step S).","The driver  installed in the client  includes driver device data . The driver device data  contains conditions for limiting driver functions and device options. Further, the driver  has the function of automatically obtaining apparatus configuration information on the printer  via the network. With this function, apparatus capability acquisition (step S) and apparatus configuration acquisition (step S) are performed via the network. Information obtained through the apparatus capability acquisition includes information indicative of whether the printer is a color printer or a monochrome printer and information indicative of resolution of the printer, for example. Information obtained through the apparatus configuration acquisition includes information indicative of whether or not one or more optional devices, such as a double-sided printing mechanism and a staple mechanism, are provided. As a result, the driver device data , the apparatus capability information , and the apparatus configuration information  are inputted to the client . Then, the client  evaluates the three kinds of data with respect to each other to thereby configure settings concerning the apparatus configuration of the printer .","For example, when a double-sided printing mechanism is mounted in the printer  as an optional device, the client  inputs again the driver device data , the apparatus capability information , and the apparatus configuration information , as described above, and evaluates the three kinds of data with respect to each other to thereby configure the settings concerning the apparatus configuration of the printer . As a result, the user  using the client  is allowed to designate double-sided printing when using the printer .","It should be noted that an application executed on the client  generally controls output therefrom with reference to the capability of the printer  the information indicative of which is passed thereto from the driver  via the OS.","Next, a description will be given of the push installation of a printer driver in the clients  to  by the server , according to the present embodiment, with reference to .  is a diagram showing a memory map of the RAM  on the server  in ;  is a schematic diagram of a system for push installation by the server in ;  is a schematic diagram useful in explaining the operation of the system for push installation in ;  is a diagram showing examples of driver data, apparatus configuration data, and operator additional conditions; and  is a schematic diagram showing an example of operation of a filter  in .","As shown in , in the printing system of the present embodiment, the server  is managed by an operator  as an administrator of the system, and therefore the server  is an administrator apparatus. The clients  to  are user apparatuses used by a plurality of users  to , respectively. The printers  to  are shared printers which can be used by the clients  to .","In the server , printing-related processing programs  are loaded into the RAM  as shown in . The printing-related processing programs  include an installation control program for achieving push installation of printer drivers and changing settings of the clients  to  concerning the apparatus configuration of the printers  to .  shows a state where not only the printing-related processing program , but also an application , related data , an OS , and a BIOS  are loaded on the RAM . Further, in , a free area in RAM  is shown as a free memory .","The installation control program includes an acquisition module for acquiring the apparatus configuration information on each of the printers  to  from the printer via the LAN , a coupling module for coupling the acquired apparatus configuration information on each of the printers  to  to driver data corresponding to the printer, and an installation module for installing the driver data coupled with the apparatus configuration information on each of the printers  to  in the clients  to  via the LAN . The driver data corresponding to each of the printers  to  is stored in the database . The apparatus configuration information on each of the printers includes an apparatus name, a generation time of the apparatus configuration information, and option information indicative of presence or absence of one or more optional devices.","Further, the installation control program includes an additional condition setting module for setting additional conditions for limiting the capability of each of the printers by an input operation by the operator (administrator), a filter generating module for generating a filter adapted to the set additional conditions, and a filter installing module for installing the generated filter at a predetermined location in a printer capability informing path on the LAN . When having been set, the additional conditions are coupled to the driver data to which the apparatus configuration information on each of the printers has been coupled. The driver data having the set additional conditions and the apparatus configuration information coupled thereto is installed in the clients  to  via the LAN .","More specifically, in the present embodiment, as shown in , the server  acquires apparatus configuration information  from each of the printers  to  via the LAN . The acquired apparatus configuration information  is automatically coupled to driver data  corresponding to each of the printers  to . The driver data  is a driver program for forming the printer driver. After the apparatus configuration information  has been coupled to the driver data , the operator  can set the additional conditions  using a utility . When having been set, the additional conditions  are coupled by the utility  to the driver data  having the apparatus configuration information  coupled thereto. The driver data  having the apparatus configuration information  and the additional conditions  thus coupled thereto is bundled into an install set, and then installed in the clients  to  via the LAN  (push installation). In this way, the drivers  corresponding to the respective printers  to  are installed in each of the clients  to .","Although in the present embodiment, the acquired apparatus configuration information  and the driver data  are automatically coupled to each other, the apparatus configuration information  and the driver data  may be coupled using the utility . In this case, the acquired apparatus configuration information  and the driver data  are readably managed, and read out to be coupled to each other.","Further, when the additional conditions  are set, a filter  adapted to the additional conditions is generated by the utility , and installed on an apparatus capability notification paths . The apparatus capability notification path  connects between the respective clients  to  and an arbitrary point accessible to the client on the LAN . The arbitrary point is provided at a location where the information on the apparatus capability of each of the printer  to  is held, i.e. a predetermined location within the memory of each of the clients  to , a predetermined location within the memory of the server , or a predetermined location within the memory of another server, for example. The information on the apparatus capability of a printer which is returned to each of the clients  to  is converted through the filter  into information on the apparatus capability adapted to the conditions of the filter , followed by being returned to the client. Therefore, the additional conditions  referred to by the driver  on each of the clients  to  agree with the apparatus capability information  having passed through the associated filter .","Examples of the driver data , the apparatus configuration information , and the additional conditions  attached to a driver are shown in . The driver data  includes conditions for limiting the driver functions and the device options. In the driver data  shown in , for example, capability of color printing (<Color>TRUE<\/Color>) and nullity of double-sided printing (<Duplex>OFF<\/Duplex>) are described as default device functions. Double-sided printing is a function enabled when a double-sided unit (double-sided printing mechanism) as an optional device is mounted in a printer, and therefore the effectiveness of double-sided printing is nullified by default. In the apparatus configuration information  acquired from the printer, the double-sided printing function is described as effective (<Duplex>ON<\/Duplex>). That is, the illustrated printer is provided with a double-sided unit, and is capable of performing double-sided printing. When the apparatus configuration information  is coupled to the driver data , the double-sided printing function becomes effective. The apparatus configuration information  also contains a generation time thereof. Therefore, even when a plurality of pieces of apparatus configuration information have been added, the latest apparatus configuration information can be selected from them. Further, as shown in the additional conditions , the operator can set a condition that \u201ca guest user is not allowed to carry out color printing\u201d, as an additional condition. The effects of this condition will be described hereinafter.","It should be noted that these data are coupled for the purpose of adding conditions for limiting optional devices which are not usually mounted, to thereby limit the functional range of a printer. This causes an increase in the data size, but facilitates later updating of the data. When there is very little probability of updating, it is also-possible to delete entries associated with options for devices which are not mounted, thereby limiting the functional range. This method is advantageous in reducing the data size.","Next, a description will be given of the operation of the filter  with reference to .","When the operator  sets the additional conditions  shown in , i.e. the condition that \u201ca guest user is not allowed to carry out color printing\u201d, using the utility , the filter  for filtering the apparatus capability information that is delivered to an associated node on the LAN  is installed at the node, which makes it possible to limit the printing function on a user-by-user basis.","As shown in , for example, when the filter  with the condition of \u201ca guest user is not allowed to carry out color printing\u201d added by the operator  is installed in a path through which the apparatus capability information  of any of the printers  to , e.g. information indicating that color printing is allowed is transmitted, a power user  receives apparatus capability information  indicating that color printing is allowed. As a result, a printing setup screen  that allows color setting is displayed on the client.","On the other hand, a guest user  receives apparatus capability information  indicating that color printing is not allowed. As a result, a setup screen  for monochrome printing only is displayed on the associated client, which means that the associated printer cannot be used for color printing, but it can be used only for monochrome printing. In other words, no item associated with color printing is displayed on the setup screen .","Although in the foregoing, the case where the additional condition of \u201ca guest user is not allowed to carry out color printing\u201d is set has been described by way of example, it is naturally possible to provide a condition associated with a department of a company, for example, and thereby allow the department alone to carry out color printing. Further, if a printer is capable of recognizing each user or the user's authority, it is possible to filter information transmitted by a printer itself to the client used by the user.","Next, a description will be given of an operation carried out by the server  for installing a printer driver in the clients  to , with reference to FIG. .  is a flowchart showing a process executed by the server  in  for installation of a printer driver in the clients  to . The process shown in  is executed by the CPU  of the server  reading the installation control program into the RAM  from the external memory  and executing the same.","When a printer driver for the printer  is installed in the clients  to  from the server ,  as shown in , first, in a step S, the CPU  of the server  acquires the apparatus configuration information  from the printer  via the LAN , and then couples the acquired apparatus configuration information  to the driver data  in the next step S. Then, in a step S, the CPU  determines whether or not the operator  has selected to add any additional conditions. The selection by the operator  as to whether or not to add any additional conditions is carried out on a screen displayed on the display  by the utility .","If it is determined in the step S that addition of additional conditions has been selected, in a step S, the CPU  sets the conditions inputted by the operator  on the screen displayed on the display  by the utility , as the additional conditions . Then, in a step S, the CPU  couples the set additional conditions  to the driver data . Thereafter, in a step S, the CPI  sets the filter  configured to the same conditions as the set additional conditions  on the apparatus capability notification path . Then, the CPU  proceeds to a step S.","If it is determined in the step S that addition of additional conditions has not been selected, the CPU  skips over the steps S to  to the step S.","In the step S, the CPU  bundles either the driver data  having the apparatus configuration information  and the additional conditions  coupled thereto or the driver data  having only the apparatus configuration information  coupled thereto, into an install set of the printer driver. Then, in a step S, the CPU  performs installation of the printer driver in the clients  to  using the install set, followed by terminating the present process.","Thus, in each of the clients  to , an API (Application Programming Interface) of the OS is called, and the installation of the printer driver is carried out.","Next, a description will be given of a printing process executed by the clients  to , with reference to .  is a flowchart showing the printing process executed by one of the clients  to  in . The process shown in  is carried out by the CPU of the client reading the printer driver from the memory into the RAM and executing the same.","As shown in , first in a step S, the client awaits input of a printing setup instruction, and then acquires the apparatus capability information  in a step S. The acquisition of the apparatus capability information  is performed via the associated apparatus capability notification path . If the filter  has been set in the path , apparatus capability information corresponding to conditions of the filter  is acquired. In the present example, it is assumed that the filter  is set to a condition limiting the user's authority, e.g. the condition that \u201ca guest user is not allowed to carry out color printing\u201d.","Then, in a step S, the client awaits input of a user ID. When the user ID is inputted, it is determined in a step S whether or not any limiting condition associated with the inputted user ID has been set, with reference to the set additional conditions. If a limiting condition associated with the user ID has been set, the client displays a setup screen with a limiting condition displayed thereon (e.g. the screen  in ) in a step S. On the other hand, if no limiting condition associated with the user ID has been set, the client displays a setup screen without a limiting condition displayed thereon (e.g. the screen  shown in ) in a step S.","Then, in a step S, the client awaits completion of setup by the user on the setup screen with a limiting condition displayed thereon or the setup screen without a limiting condition displayed thereon. If the setup is completed, the client carries out printing in a step S, followed by terminating the present process.","As described above, according to the present embodiment, by coupling the apparatus configuration information  to the driver data , a printer driver having the apparatus configuration information selected therein in advance can be installed in each of the clients  to  from the server  via the LAN . As a result, the server  (administrator) can change the settings of the clients  to  concerning the apparatus configuration of the printers  to , on its (his\/her) own initiative. Further, the users  to  do not have to acquire the apparatus configuration information.","Furthermore, the operator  can control apparatus capabilities available to a user according to whether he\/she is authorized to use the capabilities by adding conditions on a user-by-user basis and setting the additional conditions as the filter  on the apparatus capability notification path . Moreover, the setting of the filter  make capability of s it possible to prevent variation in capabilities of a printer available to users (clients  to ) from being caused due to respective different information acquisition paths being given to the users.","It is to be understood that the object of the present invention may also be accomplished by supplying a system or an apparatus with a storage medium in which a program code of software, which realizes the functions of the above described embodiment is stored, and causing a computer (or CPU or MPU) of the system or apparatus to read out and execute the program code stored in the storage medium.","In this case, the program code itself read from the storage medium realizes the functions of the above described embodiment, and therefore the program code and the storage medium in which the program code is stored constitute the present invention.","Examples of the storage medium for supplying the program code include a floppy (registered trademark) disk, a hard disk, an optical disk, a magnetic-optical disk, a CD-ROM, a CD-R, a CD-RW, a DVD-ROM, a DVD-RAM, a DVD-RW, a DVD+RW, a magnetic tape, a nonvolatile memory card, and a ROM.
