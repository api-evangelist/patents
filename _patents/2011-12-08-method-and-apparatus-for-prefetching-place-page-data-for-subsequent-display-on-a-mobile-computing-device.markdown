title: Method and apparatus for pre-fetching place page data for subsequent display on a mobile computing device
abstract: A computer-implemented method and system for pre-fetching place page data from a remote mapping system for display on a client computing device is disclosed. User preference data collected from various data sources including applications executing on the client device, online or local user profiles, and other sources may be analyzed to generate a request for place page data from the remote mapping system. The user preference data may indicate a map feature such as a place of business, park, or historic landmark having the characteristics of both a user's preferred geographic location and the user's personal interests. For example, where the user indicates a geographic preference for “Boston” and a personal interest for “home brewing” the system and method may request place page data for all home brewing or craft beer-related map features near Boston.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to pre-fetching place page data for subsequent display on a mobile computing device during periods of no connectivity with the source of the place page data.","The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.","Many mobile computing devices such as cellular phones, tablet computers, notebooks, etc., incorporate global positioning system (GPS) applications and related hardware. When actuated on the device, the GPS applications may communicate with a GPS transmitter or other GPS hardware on the device and a backend application server to provide a digital map of an area around the device's current position to a user, as well as label data and place page data.","However there may be circumstances when the mobile computing device is in an area with limited network, cellular, or other communication access with the backend application server, which limits, or otherwise precludes, immediate, real time access to such data, potentially adversely affecting the user's experience.","Features and advantages described in this summary and the following detailed description are not all-inclusive. Many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims hereof. Additionally, other embodiments may omit one or more (or all) of the features and advantages described in this summary.","A computer-implemented method may pre-fetch place page data to a mapping application executing on a client computing device from a remote mapping system for subsequent display on the client computing device. The method may comprise analyzing user preferred geographic location data and user personal interests data to determine user preference data. The user preferred geographic location data may include data indicating a particular map location that is preferred by a user of the client computing device. The user personal interest data may include data indicating personal interests of the user. The method may also match the user preference data with place page data of the remote mapping system. The place page data may include text, graphics, and data feed data describing a map feature corresponding to both a particular map location that is preferred by the user and a personal interest of the user. The method may also send the matched place page data from the remote mapping system to the client computing device and store the matched place page data in a cache memory of the client computing device. The stored place page data may then be subsequently retrieved from the cache memory of the client computing device without further communication between the remote mapping system and the client computing device.","The user preferred geographic location data may include one or more of a city name, an address, an airport code, or global positioning system coordinates. This user preferred geographic location data may be indicated by one or more of a GPS position that was flagged using the mapping application, a geographic location returned to the client computing device by the remote mapping system, and a geographic location having an indicated preference. Furthermore, the user personal interests data may be retrieved from one or more of a social networking application, an e-mail application, and a web browser of the client computing device. The user personal interests data includes one or more of user profile data, social networking data, web browser history data, e-mail text, and calendar appointment data.","In another embodiment, a computer-implemented method for pre-fetching place page data from a remote mapping system to a mapping application may subsequently display the place page data on a client computing device executing the mapping application during conditions of no connectivity between the remote mapping system and the client computing device. This embodiment may periodically send user preferred geographic location data and user personal interests data from the client computing device to a backend user preferences system. The client computing device may receive place page data from the remote mapping system in response to the sent user preferred geographic location data and user personal interests data. The place page data may include one or more of text, graphics, and data feed data describing a map feature corresponding to both a particular map location that is preferred by the user and a personal interest of the user. This received place page data may then be stored in a cache memory of the client computing device and subsequently retrieved without further communication between the remote mapping system and the client computing device.","A client computing device may include a processor and a memory storing an application and instructions for execution by the processor. The instructions may be for using the processor to periodically cause user preferred geographic location data and user personal interests data to be sent from the client computing device to a backend user preferences system via a network connection. The user preferred geographic location data may include data indicating a particular map location that is preferred by a user of the client computing device. The user personal interest data may include data indicating personal interests of the user. The client computing device may also include a transceiver for receiving place page data from a remote mapping system via the network connection. The place page data may be received in response to the sent user preferred geographic location data and user personal interests data. The place page data may include one or more of text, graphics, and data feed data describing a map feature corresponding to both the particular map location that is preferred by the user and the personal interest of the user. Further, a cache memory may store the place page data received by the transceiver, and a mapping module may include instructions to cause the processor to display the received place page data from the cache memory without further communication between the remote mapping system and the client computing device.","A remote mapping system embodiment may also comprise a processor and a memory. The memory may be in communication with the processor and store a map controller including instructions for execution by the processor. First instructions may cause the processor to receive a request for place page data corresponding to user preference data generated by a user preferences system in communication with the map controller. The user preference data may include a combination of user preferred geographic location data and user personal interests data generated by a client computing device. The user preferred geographic location data may include data indicating a particular map location that is preferred by a user of the client computing device and user personal interest data may include data indicating personal interests of the user. Second instructions may cause the processor to match the user preference data with place page data of the remote mapping system. The place page data may include one or more of text, graphics, and data feed data describing a map feature corresponding to both a particular map location that is preferred by the user and a personal interest of the user. Third instructions may cause the processor to send the matched place page data from the remote mapping system to the client computing device for storage in a cache memory of the client computing device. The client computing device may be configured to subsequently retrieve the matched place page data from the cache memory without further communication between the remote mapping system and the client computing device.","The figures depict a preferred embodiment for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art may readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles described herein.","Embodiments of systems and methods for efficiently transferring place page data that is logically linked to map data from a place page data server to a client device are discussed below. To render a map image in a web browser, mapping application, or another application, the client device may request map data from the map server via a communication network, and the map server in response may provide vector data that describes map graphic content as well as place page data that describes features of the rendered vector data. More particularly, vector data may specify various geometric shapes (e.g., using mathematical descriptions) for map features and indicate how these shapes should be positioned for rendering various map features such as roads, buildings, parks, bodies of water, etc. on the client computing device. Place page data may describe each map feature using text, graphics, web pages, etc. The map server also may specify which visual styles the client device should apply to various vector-based descriptions of map features.","Graphical data to render a map image on a mobile computing device is relatively data (and thus memory) intensive. Place page data may be separately pre-fetched or pre-downloaded via a network connection before it is requested by the user so that this place page data is available independent of all or some of the memory burden of accompanying map tile data. For example, data logically associated with the digital map data may include label data for the various buildings, roads, and other graphic elements of the map. Other data may include place page data that provides detailed information about various buildings, businesses, points of interest, or other graphic elements or \u201cfeatures\u201d of the map. Place page data may be requested separately from the graphic elements of a map from a place page data server via a network connection between a mobile computing device and the server. This place page data may then be stored in a cache memory of the mobile computing device. The place page data may then be available at times of low connectivity between the mobile device and the server, or in situations where the graphic map data may be unnecessary for navigation. For example, the place page data may be useful without accompanying graphic map data in dense, urban areas where the user is aware of his or her location, but is not aware of various businesses or other information about his or her location.","As described below, user preferences, expressed interests, social networking information, etc., may be analyzed to determine locations for place page data that may be of interest to the user. The place page data may be pre-fetched to the mobile device, either at the request of a place page module at the mobile device or pushed to the mobile device by a backend server.","The user interest analysis may determine one or more businesses or other places of interest at the user's current or preferred geographic locations. This analysis may be performed at the backend or the mobile device and may consider all, or portions of, data related to the user's online expressed personal interests (e.g., social networking profile, professional profile, personal or business listing information, etc.), geographic interests, or combination of data. In further embodiments, the system may use data related to where the user spends most of his or her time, searches the user has performed via searching modules, trips the user has planned, information in e-mails sent or received by the user, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["100","102","104","106","108","106","102","106","110","112","114","115","100","114","114","102","114","106","140"]},"A mapping system server , which may be in the form of one or more servers, may send and receive map tile data  from a map tile data repository , and place page data  from a place page data repository  that corresponds to geographical features of the map tile data . In some embodiments, the mapping system  and the system server  may send computer-executable instructions and data to allow the mapping module  to render a digital map in a display component  of the client device . While using the mapping module, , a user may indicate one or more preferred geographic locations A. For example, after a map search result is returned to the device  (as described below), a user may cause the mapping module  to execute instructions to flag a particular location (e.g., address, map feature, GPS point, etc.) within the returned search result as a \u201cfavorite\u201d or otherwise indicate that a particular map location is preferred by the user. Geographic locations for which the user has indicated a preference (e.g., mapping module search results favorites, hometown, favorite cities, planned trips, etc.) may be collected at the device  and instructions of the user preferences module  may be executed to determine additional preferred geographic locations A at which the user is likely to request place page data from the mapping server .","In some embodiments, user personal interests data  may be determined at the client device  or retrieved from various sources. The user personal preferences data may indicate the user's personal interests (e.g., food, hobbies, sports teams, etc.). For example, the user preferences module  may execute instructions to determine or collect a user's personal interests data  from various local and remote sources (e.g., a personal profile saved at the client computing device , online personal profile and interest data from social networking and other sites, profile data from other applications executing on the device , etc.). The user personal interests data  may also be collected from a variety of applications and modules executing on the client device  or in communication with the device  (e.g., a mapping application, a web browser, a user activity tracking module, a trip planning module, an email module, a social networking system, etc.) and stored in a user preferences data repository . The data  may include a user profile stored on the device , user preferences from applications executing on the device  (e.g., favorite locations as saved during execution of a mapping module , a social networking application that includes a user profile, interests, and other data, etc.), a web browsing history, e-mail text, a calendar appointment for travel, etc. The data  may be analyzed at the client device  to determine a user's geographic and personal interests.","The combination of user preferred geographic location data A and user personal interests data  indicates businesses or other map features for which the user may request place page data  in the future. Place page data  may then be pre-fetched for those geographic and personal interests and stored in a cache memory  of the client device memory  for possible display to a user during a period of low connectivity to the mapping system  or at any other time.","In another embodiment that determines user geographic and personal preferences data at the backend , user geographic\/personal preferences data A may be collected from online resources  that are associated with a user and analyzed to determine geographic and personal interest locations at which the user is likely to request place page data from the mapping server , or user preferences and interests that may indicate businesses or other map features for which the user may request place page data in the future. The user geographic\/personal preferences data A may be collected from a variety of online resources  linked by a common user account. For example, a backend server  may include a module  with instructions that, upon execution, collect information related to web searches conducted by the user, social networking profile information, user subscriptions to news feeds related to the user's interests, searches related to a mapping module , etc. The data A may be analyzed at the client device  to determine a user's geographic preferences A and personal interests . Place page data  may then be pre-fetched from a place page data repository  for those interests at the user's preferred geographic locations and stored in a cache memory  of the client device memory  for possible display to a user during a period of low connectivity to the mapping system  or at any other time. Other embodiments may determine user geographic location preferences and personal interests data using a combination of front end  and backend  components.","In response to a request from a client computing device , the mapping system  may process and send graphics, text, and other data for a map image to be displayed on a client computing device . A client device  request may also cause the mapping system  to send place page data  that may be displayed with the graphic map tile data  or be linked to the displayed map tile data . The place page data  may be displayed in the display  of the device  with or without also displaying the map tile data  that includes features that are described by the place page data . The graphic components (i.e., map tile data ) and text or other data (i.e., place page data) may be processed and sent to the device  together or separately. When the client computing device  requests data ,  from the mapping system , the system  may generate each map tile  with or without place page data  according to a vector graphics format. The client device  (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet computer, etc.) may locally rasterize the vector data corresponding to each map tile for display at the device .","In an embodiment, the system  retrieves the requested data from various servers. For example, the mapping system server  may include a processor and a computer-readable memory that stores a map controller in the form of computer instructions, for example, that may be executable on the processor directly (e.g., as compiled code) or indirectly (e.g., as a script interpreted by another application executing on the processor ). The computer-readable memory may include volatile memory to store computer instructions and data on which the computer instructions operate at runtime (e.g., Random Access Memory or RAM) and, in an embodiment, persistent memory such as a hard disk, for example. In an embodiment, the map controller includes a dynamic feature controller  () that generates vector data for various map elements that are provided as map content to the client device . As used herein, a map feature (or simply feature) may correspond to an individual map element such as a building or an aggregation of several map elements such as several buildings, a park, and several pedestrian paths of a college campus. In general, a map feature may be described using vector data. Place page data  may include data that describes business and\/or administrative aspects of the map tile features including textual information, images, data feeds, web content for the map features (i.e., businesses, landmarks, etc.), etc.","In some embodiments, the mapping module  receives vector data that specifies both graphical characteristics of map features as well as place page data  that describes these features. Vector data specifies the map features as geometric shapes using mathematical descriptions of points and paths connecting the points. For example, rather than specifying each pixel that makes up a raster image of a line segment, vector data may specify the two endpoints of the line segment and indicate that the two endpoints are connected by a straight line. The mapping module  then may apply place page data  as appropriate to the specified line segment, so that the line segment is displayed with a particular title, description, etc. As another example, the vector data may specify the contour of a building, and the corresponding place page data  may specify the name, description, web page, contact information, address, etc., of the building. In other words, rather than receiving raster images from the map server , the mapping module  may receive instructions for drawing a map image on an output device  of the client computing device  and execute the instructions to generate a raster map image. In some cases, however, vector data also may include raster images as certain component elements that cannot be easily represented in a vector format.","In other embodiments, the mapping module  receives only place page data  corresponding to a requested, preferred, or predicted geographic location, as described herein. Rather than the vector format described above for receiving map tile data , the system  may respond to a request from the device  by sending place page data in a common text (e.g., SMS, ANSI, ASCII) or in a proprietary format for both image and text display and formatting on the device . For example, a user activity module  on the client device , a remote user preferences system , or a combination of modules and systems may include instructions to process user geographic\/personal preferences data A (including geographic preferences A and personal interests ). Processing this data A may determine geographic and personal interest locations at which the user is likely to request place page data  from the mapping server , or user preferences and interests that may indicate businesses or other map features for which the user may request place page data .","For simplicity, the client device  is illustrated with a single processor  to execute various modules stored in the device memory , as described herein. The client device  in other embodiments may include additional processing units (not shown) such as a graphics processing unit (GPU) configured to facilitate image rendering on the output device , for example. Further, the mapping module  may utilize a library of graphics functions for efficiently generating a map image as well as place page data , or place page data  alone. For example, the memory  may store a plugin, such as an OpenGL\u00ae or Direct3D\u00ae library, having functions for rendering graphics which various applications executing on the client , including the mapping module , may access via an application programming interface (API). In another embodiment, the memory  stores a plugin particularly suitable for browser applications, such as WebGL\u00ae, for example. Also, in some embodiments, the memory  stores additional software components that facilitate efficient rendering of images and place page data  via the output device . For example, the memory  may store an Adobe\u00ae Flash\u00ae plugin or an O3D plugin.","Now referring to , a map controller  may include various functions and operate as a module in the memory of the client computing device  or in the server  of , for example, or the various functions may be split among the client computing device  and the server , as described above. According to an embodiment, the map data controller  is implemented as a set of instructions that are stored on a computer-readable medium and executable on one or more processors. For example, referring back to , the map data controller  and its various functions may be distributed among the memories ,  and processors , .","According to an embodiment, the map controller  includes a dynamic feature controller , a map tile generator , a place page data generator , and a map request processor . The map request processor  may be configured to process requests from client devices, such as the client device , for map data  and\/or place page data  corresponding to specified or user preferred geographic regions. Each request may correspond to a single electronic message or a series of electronic messages, depending on the scenario and\/or embodiment. For example, the map request processor  may receive a request for map data corresponding to a two-mile-wide region centered at latitude 41\u00b0 52\u2032 43\u2033 and longitude \u221287\u00b0 38\u2032 11\u2033. The map request processor  may also receive a request for place page data  corresponding to personal interests , A within that region. The request may also indicate a zoom level for which map data is being requested which determines an amount of map tile data  and place page data  that will be returned by the mapping system . Depending on the scenario (i.e., requesting map tile and place page date together or separately), the map request processor  may receive a request for map data and a request for place page data  in a single electronic message, e.g., a single HTTP message, or separately in respective electronic messages.","After the map request processor  receives a request for map data  and\/or place page data  from a client device, the map controller  provides appropriate data to the client device via one or more electronic messages. In some embodiments, the map request processor  may includes instructions to determine what type of data is being requested and execute a function call to one or more of the map tile generator  or the place page data generator  to retrieve the requested data from the appropriate data repository , . The map tile generator  may include instructions to generate map data as a set of map tile descriptors, such that each map tile descriptor describes a map tile, i.e., a portion of a map image of a certain size (e.g., 256 by 256 pixels). The size of a geographic region represented by an individual map tile depends on the zoom level with which the map tile is associated, so that a single map tile at a lower zoom level illustrates a larger geographic area than a single map tile at a higher zoom level. The map tile generator  may generate each map tile descriptor according to a vector graphics format, and a client device, such as the client device  of , may locally generate a raster image for each tile. The map tile generator  may retrieve the requested data from a map database such as the map tile database . The place page data generator  may generate place page data  in conjunction with the response to the request for map data, or in response to a request for place page data  alone. In some embodiments, the place page data generator  includes instructions to generate place page data  from multiple entries of the data repository  that correspond to a requested geographic region or a preferred geographic region A. The place page data generator  may also include instructions to generate place page data  from multiple entries of the data repository  that correspond to one or both of the requested\/preferred geographic region A and user personal interests data . For example, where a user requests map tile data for \u201cBoston\u201d and user profile or other data indicates that a hobby of the user is \u201chomebrewing\u201d the map request processor  may employ one or more of the map tile generator  or the place page data generator  to return map tile data  and\/or place page data  corresponding to homebrewing shops or craft beer-related businesses in the Boston area. Similarly, the map request processor  may retrieve place page data  corresponding to the user's personal interests  where that place page data  is associated with businesses and other map features that are also within areas of the user's geographic preferences A. For example, when a user's preferred location A includes \u201cChicago\u201d and the user's personal interests include \u201chomebrewing\u201d then place page data  for homebrewing shops and craft beer-related businesses may be requested from the map controller  and stored in a cache memory  of the device  with the user initiating a particular request for the data .","When providing graphic map data to a client device, the map controller  may separate map tile data  from place page data . In some cases, the map controller  may provide vector data that describes map content without providing the corresponding place page data  to the client device at the same time (if, for example, the client device already has the necessary place page data) or, conversely, may provide place page data  without providing the vector data for graphical map content to which the place page data  applies (for rendering a geographic region at a more detailed zoom level and using place page data  that was sent with a previous request for the geographic region at a different zoom level, for example). Further, in some scenarios, the map controller  provides vector data and place page data  at the same time (e.g., in a same electronic message or a series of electronic messages). For example, when the map request processor  receives a request for map data and queries the map data repository  for map tile data , the label and place page controller  queries the place page data repository  for place page data  that corresponds to the geographical area of the requested map tile data . As with the map tile data , the amount of place page data corresponding to the requested map data  may depend on the zoom level with which the map tile is associated. For example, a single map tile at a lower zoom level illustrates a larger geographic area and, thus, corresponds to more label and place pace data  than a single map tile at a higher zoom level. In some embodiments, the place page data generator  may query the place page data repository  for only the data  that is visible at the zoom level of the requested map data . In other embodiments, the place page data generator  may query the repository  for more data  that corresponds to other zoom levels than would be visible at the zoom level of the requested map data . Furthermore, the place page data generator  may query the repository  for data  that corresponds to expressed or predicted user interests before the data  is explicitly requested by a user. The place page data generator  may then insert the retrieved place page data  in the vector containing the requested map tile data  or may send the data  separately from the map tile data . The client device  may locally rasterize the vector data for each tile including the data , may provide a link to the data  in the created map image, or may store the retrieved place page data  in a cached memory  of the device .","The dynamic feature controller  may be communicatively coupled to the map tile generator  and place page data generator  and configured to determine which map elements are associated with the requested map data and generate vector-based or other descriptions of these map elements. For example, the dynamic feature controller  may determine that, in response to a request for map data corresponding to zoom level Zi for a certain geographic region, vector descriptors corresponding to interstate highways, large bodies of water, etc. must be generated, whereas in response to another request for map data corresponding to zoom level Zj for the same geographic region, additional vector data corresponding to local roads and buildings must be generated. Further, in some cases, the dynamic feature controller  generates different sets of vector data for different map types. For example, a terrain map may include map elements that are not included in a basic map for the same geographic region and zoom level.","In some embodiments, the user preferences system  () may include a user preferences system server  that includes a module  with instructions to receive preferred geographic region A and user personal interests data  (geographic\/personal preferences data A) that is pushed from the device  or to pull preferred geographic region A and user personal interests data  from the device . For example, the user preferences data repository  may receive and store data from a variety of other modules and applications executing on the client device  or in communication with the device  (e.g., a web browser, a user preferences tracking module, a trip planning module, an email module, a social networking module, etc.). The client device  may then forward the data  to the user preferences system  for analysis. Similarly, the mapping module  may collect geographic preferences data A and then forward that data to the user preferences system  for analysis. In some embodiments, the client device  may periodically forward a web browser history, e-mail text including geographic locations or personal interests, travel documents, online profiles including geographic or personal preferences data, or other data generated or received by applications executing on the client device  to the user preferences system . Where the preferred geographic region A and user personal interests data  is received by the user preferences system , the module  may analyze the data A to determine both geographic locations and the types of businesses or other map features that the user will likely request mapping system data in the future. The user preferences system module  may also include instructions to generate requests for place page data  corresponding to the user geographic\/personal interests data A locations. Further instructions at the module  may then forward the generated requests to the map request processor  of the mapping system . The map request processor  may then forward the request to the place page data generator  to retrieve place page data  corresponding to the geographic locations determined from the user's geographic\/personal preferences data A. The retrieved data  may be filtered by user geographic\/personal preferences to only return data  that matches those preferences. For example, where the system  determines that the user will likely request data for Boston and the preference data includes a user interest in \u201cmuseums\u201d the generator  may use user geographic\/personal interests data A to only return place page data  corresponding to museums in Boston. When the user geographic\/personal interests data A is analyzed at the backend by the module  to determine likely future geographic locations and personal interests for the user, the label and place page generator  may execute instructions to push the place page data  from the place page data repository  to the cache memory  of the client device . When the data A,  is analyzed at the front end, a module on the client device (e.g., the mapping module, etc.) may implement the functions of the label and place page generator  and pull the place page data  from the place page data repository  to the cache memory  of the client device .","In some embodiments, the user preferences system server  may store the user geographic\/personal preferences data A in one or more data repositories . For example, the user geographic\/personal interests data A may include the user's profile information, social networking information, browser search history data, e-mail and other message data, trip planning data, mapping system favorites, or other data indicating expressed or likely geographic and personal interests of the user. The module  may include computer-executable instructions to analyze the data stored in the data repositories , as described herein. Analysis of the user geographic\/personal interests data A by the module  may determine the subject or type of data requests that the user preferences system server  may send to the mapping system  and the label and place page generator .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","204","117","118","119","120","202","202","200","202","202","200","202","204","200","204","204","204","204","204","1","118","204","106","204","204","204","1","204","120","204","204","120","204","202","204","202","200"],"i":["a","a ","a ","a ","b","a ","a","b ","b","c ","a "]},"The place page data , may include various groups of information that describe characteristics of the features  within a map tile .

In some embodiments, block  includes instructions to cause the mapping system  to send place page data  to a cache memory  of the client device . As discussed above, because place page data  is relatively lightweight compared to map tile data, block  might initially send place page data  to the computing device . Furthermore, in areas where the user is familiar with his or her surroundings and does not require a map for navigation, place page data  alone may be sufficient for finding businesses or other map features of personal interest to the user. Later, map tile data  may be retrieved and the place page data may be layered onto the map tile data  and graphically displayed together. The method  may also send the retrieved place page data  to a mapping module  executing on the client computing device .","At block , the client computing device , mapping module , or user activity module  that received the place page data , may execute instructions to store the received data within a cache memory .

Modules may constitute either software modules (e.g., code or instructions embodied on a machine-readable medium or in a transmission signal, wherein the code is executed by a processor) or hardware modules. A hardware module is tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system) or one or more hardware modules of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.","In various embodiments, a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.","Accordingly, the term \u201chardware module\u201d should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired), or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. As used herein, \u201chardware-implemented module\u201d refers to a hardware module. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware modules comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor, for example, to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.","Hardware modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware modules. Accordingly, the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connect the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example, one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).","The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise processor-implemented modules.","Similarly, the methods or routines described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or processors or processor-implemented hardware modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the processor or processors may be located in a single location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment or as a server farm), while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.","The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a \u201ccloud computing\u201d environment or as a \u201csoftware as a service\u201d (SaaS). For example, at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers (as examples of machines including processors), these operations being accessible via a network (e.g., the Internet) and via one or more appropriate interfaces (e.g., application program interfaces (APIs).)","The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the one or more processors or processor-implemented modules may be located in a single geographic location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment, or a server farm). In other example embodiments, the one or more processors or processor-implemented modules may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.","Some portions of this specification are presented in terms of algorithms or symbolic representations of operations on data stored as bits or binary digital signals within a machine memory (e.g., a computer memory). These algorithms or symbolic representations are examples of techniques used by those of ordinary skill in the data processing arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. As used herein, an \u201calgorithm\u201d is a self-consistent sequence of operations or similar processing leading to a desired result.
