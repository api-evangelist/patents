In particular, the present invention is directed to a method for mitigating spatial aliasing that takes advantage of the forward motion of towed array elements (hydrophones) to overcome the frequency constraints imposed on beam forming by the spatial separation of the array elements.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","The Nyquist criterion describes the sampling rate required for a given frequency without aliasing. Similarly, if an array of sensors (hydrophones) is coherently processed to determine the direction of an incoming acoustic signal through beam forming, then the separation of the array elements determines the maximum frequency that can be processed without producing an alias in direction. If the beam forming limits are exceeded, however, spatial aliasing occurs in the form of grating lobes as graphically illustrated that interfere with the interpretation of the direction of the incoming signal. Grating lobes appear at an aliased look direction that is a function of both source direction and frequency, so a loud, multi-tonal signal will produce grating lobes that are present at multiple look directions, interfering with the interpretation of the number of signals present. Grating lobes are caused by spatial under sampling. What is needed is a method for mitigating spatial aliasing to avoid grating lobes.","It is a general purpose and object of the present invention to mitigate spatial aliasing to avoid grating lobes from a loud, multi-tonal source. The above object is accomplished with the present invention through the use of a method that employs the motion of a towed array of hydrophones to generate at least one synthetic array element for each real sensor to compensate for spatial under sampling. Acoustic energy is detected and converted to an electronic signal by a towed array of hydrophones. This signal is processed by a data processing computer system. In the present invention, the electronic signal is processed in the data processing computer system such that it is time delayed thereby generating a synthetic element. The time delay is based on the forward motion of the array and the desired separation distance of the synthetic element along the array. The electronic signal is then filtered into frequency bins using a bank of filters, such as a fast Fourier transform (FFT) as is also done for the real sensor data. The frequency components in the medium due to the source of the electronic signal are then estimated, after which the neighborhood of frequency bins containing energy from each frequency component are identified. The energy due to each source frequency component is then phase corrected to compensate for the initial time delay that generated the synthetic element. Traditional beam forming is then performed on the signals from both the real array elements and the synthetic array elements to generate a graphical representation of a multi-tone signal that will indicate the source direction and look direction associated with an acoustic source that is detected by the towed array of hydrophones.","Referring to  there is illustrated a towed array of hydrophones  moving underwater in a particular direction as indicated by the arrow at a velocity V. In one embodiment the array is being towed by an underwater vehicle. There is also illustrated an underwater acoustic energy source  generating acoustic energy. In one embodiment, this energy source could be a surface vessel or an underwater vessel. The hydrophones  detect the acoustic energy at a look direction or look angle \u03b8 and convert it to a digital electronic signal. The towed array  is connected to a data processing computer system .","Referring to  there is illustrated an embodiment of the method for mitigating spatial aliasing in the form of a flow diagram. The first step  of the method is for the data processing computer system  to receive the digital electronic signal from the towed array of hydrophones .","The second step  is to process the electronic signal in order to generate at least one synthetic towed array element for each real sensor, wherein the synthetic array element will allow for more sampling. The processing involves time delaying the electronic signal received from the towed array . The time delay is accomplished according to the following formula: \u0394=d\/2V. Wherein V is the speed of the motion of the towed array  and d is the current separation distance between the physical array elements (hydrophones)  in the towed array  as illustrated in . The acoustic signals or samples received by the physical array elements  are represented as follows: x[n] sampled from x(t). The samples assigned to the synthetic elements as a result of the time delay are",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"x","mrow":{"mi":"m","mo":"-","mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]}}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"n"}}}},"br":{},"sub":["m","t","m ","t "],"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["14","10"],"sup":"th "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["s","m"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["k","s"]},{"mi":"t","mn":"1"}],"mo":","}}},{"msub":{"mi":"S","mn":"0"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"msup":[{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":[{"mi":["\u03c9","s"]},{"mi":"t","mn":"1"}]}},{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":"-","mi":"j"},{"msub":{"mi":["k","s"]},"mo":"\u00b7","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["r","m"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":"t","mn":"1"}}}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}]}],"mo":"="},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"sub":["1","t ","m","1","m","0","s"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u0394","t"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mi":"d","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"V"}}},"mo":","}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["s","m"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["k","s"]},{"mi":"t","mn":"1"}],"mo":","}}},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["s","m"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["k","s"]},{"mi":"t","mn":"0"}],"mo":","}}},{"msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"j"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["\u03c9","s"]},"mfrac":{"mi":"d","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"V"}}}},"mo":"."}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"j"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"msub":[{"mi":["k","s"]},{"mi":["\u03b8","s"]}],"mfrac":{"mi":"d","mn":"2"},"mi":"cos"}}}],"mo":"="}}},"br":{},"sub":["s ","s ","s"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00005","num":"00005"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"m","mo":"-","mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]}},{"msub":{"mi":"s","mrow":{"mi":"m","mo":"-","mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]}}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["k","s"]},{"mi":"t","mn":"0"}],"mo":","}}},{"mi":"by","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["s","m"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["k","s"]},{"mi":"t","mn":"1"}],"mo":","}}},{"msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["\u03c9","s"]},"mfrac":{"mi":"d","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"V"}}}},"mo":"."}]}],"mo":[",",","]}}}},"The third step  is to filter the electronic signal received from the towed array through a bank of filters into its frequency components.

This spreading is known as leakage and needs to be addressed because the leakage propagates as a function of the phase of the original tone.
