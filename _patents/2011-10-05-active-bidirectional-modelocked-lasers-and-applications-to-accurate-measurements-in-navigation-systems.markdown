title: Active bidirectional mode-locked lasers and applications to accurate measurements in navigation systems
abstract: In various embodiments, systems and methods can be structured to provide efficient active bidirectional mode-locked lasers, which can be used as intracavity phase interferometer (IPI) sensors. Stable bidirectional mode-locking can be achieved by a combination of a passive mechanism, a passively driven active mechanism, and a beat note detection system. Such systems can be used in guidance, navigation, and control systems, where attitude control of a vehicle relies on accurate measurements of its position and motion. In various embodiments, a detection system can be based on an all fiber intracavity phase interferometer (IPI) active laser capable of delivering accurate simultaneous measurements of all three degrees of rotation and position in a single, compact, cost effective unit. A variation of the same system can include a linear cavity laser for accurate measurements of acceleration without the use of any inertial masses. Additional apparatus, systems, and methods are disclosed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION(S)","GOVERNMENT INTEREST STATEMENT","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/390,049 filed 5 Oct. 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. (NSF) ECS-925526 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.","In guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems, the attitude of a vehicle must be constantly monitored. Such vehicles include satellites, airplanes, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), submarines, ICBNs, other aircraft, and other moving craft. At any given time, attitude control of such a vehicle depends upon precise measurement of its three dimensional angular changes (\u201cpitch\u201d, \u201croll\u201d, and \u201cyaw\u201d) and its position relative to a frame of reference such as shown in . An error of a single degree could send a vehicle off course, several miles away from its intended trajectory. To ascertain their precise location, vehicles use a number of different on-board instruments. Some instruments are designed for relative (inertial motion) sensing and some instruments are designed for absolute (relative to a target) attitude sensing. For instance, to obtain a complete assessment of a satellite's attitude, navigation controls rely on inertial measurements (autonomous sensing), and absolute measurements (relative to a reference), both detected using two or more separate instruments.","A first class of devices is meant to detect the rate of change (rotation and acceleration) in the attitude of the vehicle, relative to its own inertial frame (autonomous sensing). Some of the most commonly used instruments in this detection system include \u201cspinning mass\u201d, \u201claser\u201d, and \u201chemispherical resonator\u201d gyroscopes, the latter being particularly expensive. The most common inertial navigation systems, however, use ring He\u2014Ne lasers. This concept is more than 40 years old and is outdated. It has the following shortcomings: (i) a high power consumption\/low efficiency, (ii) a lifetime limited by the vacuum tube technology, (iii) nonlinearity and zero response at low rotation rate (dead band), and (iv) configurations that occupy a large volume. Another commonly used system is the fiber optic gyro, FOG, which is a passive device that measures a phase shift through interference. In a FOG, the difference in phase induced by rotation (Sagnac effect) is translated into a difference in intensity. As a result, a FOG device can provide a considerably smaller signal to noise ratio and sensitivity than an active laser gyro based on frequency measurement.","A second class of instruments senses the position of an aircraft relative to outside objects. The most common instruments are: \u201chorizon sensors\u201d, \u201corbital gyrocompasses\u201d, \u201csun sensors\u201d, \u201cstar trackers\u201d, and \u201cmagnetometers\u201d.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings that show, by way of illustration and not limitation, various example embodiments of the invention. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice these and other embodiments. Other embodiments may be utilized, and structural, logical, and electrical changes may be made to these embodiments. The various embodiments are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as some embodiments can be combined with one or more other embodiments to form new embodiments. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","210","215","210","220","210","215","215","210","220","210","215","215","210","210","200","210","215","220"]},"Laser  can include a fiber ring laser. Laser  can include a linear laser. Modulation controller  can include a pair of modulators biased for no transmission in an absence of a controlling pulse. Fiber ring laser , modulation controller , and detection unit  can be arranged as an intracavity phase interferometer to simultaneously measure rotation and position relative to a reference magnetic field. Fiber ring laser , modulation controller , and detection unit  of system  can be arranged in a navigation system of a vehicle. Operation of system  can include making attitude measurements for a vehicle. Operation of system  can include measuring acceleration. With laser  realized as a linear laser, system  can include an accelerometer constructed from the linear laser.","In an embodiment, a sensitive sensor can be adapted to operate as either an absolute or reference attitude sensor. This sensitive sensor can provide measurements of both position relative to a target using a magnetometer and all three degrees of rotation (pitch, yaw, and roll) at once. In addition, the active mechanism can be adapted to be used in a linear laser, and work as an accelerometer.","In GNC systems, attitude control of a vehicle rely on accurate measurements of its position relative to a reference and motion (inertial measurements). In various embodiments, a detection system can be based on an all fiber intracavity phase interferometer (IPI) active laser capable of delivering extremely accurate simultaneous measurements of all three degrees of rotation (pitch, yaw, and roll) and position in a single, compact, cost effective unit. A variation of the same system can be made on a linear cavity laser for extremely accurate measurements of acceleration without the use of any inertial masses.","In various embodiments, a system can simultaneously measure rotation () and position relative to earth's magnetic field (). Such a system can be realized with a pure solid state laser that combines the compactness and small volume of a FOG with the frequency response of an active gyro. This laser system can outperform existing laser gyros, because of the absence of dead band and associated nonlinearity in the inertial response. This concept has been demonstrated with bulk lasers for the measurement of minute displacements, magnetic fields and nonlinear index of refraction, and recently the feasibility of such an approach was demonstrated in the bidirectional mode-locked operation of a fiber laser. A basic principle, in various embodiments, includes the use of a mode-locked laser as an IPI, where two ultrashort pulses counter-circulate in the laser cavity.","Through the cavity resonance condition, a small phase difference between the two pulses, which can be caused by rotation, acceleration, or a magnetic field, translates into a frequency difference between the two output trains of pulses emitted by the laser. The frequency difference between the two output trains of pulses emitted by the laser can be picked-up as a beat note on a detector. In this approach, a phase shift of \u0394\u03c6=4 nano radians can be directly translated into a frequency difference \u0394\u03c6\/(2\u03c0\u03c4)=0.05 Hz, where \u03c4=P\/c is the round-trip time of a pulse in a laser cavity of perimeter P=4 m and c is the speed of light. In IPI, two main factors can determine the performances of a laser sensor: one being the size of the resonator or the round trip time \u03c4and the other being the pulse duration \u03c4. In situations where the goal is to measure a small phase shift \u0394\u03c6, due for instance to a magnetic field or a change in index, the beat note \u0394\u03bd is largest for the shortest cavity, which corresponds to smallest \u03c4. In the case of inertial measurements (rotation or acceleration), the measured beat frequency is proportional to the size of the laser. If the quantity to be measured is rotation, the differential phase shift induced by rotation is the Sagnac phase shift \u0394\u03c6=8\u03c0A\u03a9\/(c\u03bb) and the measured beat note is:\n\n\u0394\u03bd=4\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere A is the area of the laser, \u03bb is the wavelength, \u03c1 a shape factor, and \u03a9is the rotation rate to be measured.\n","A mode-locked fiber laser gyro can have a considerably larger geometrical factor than conventional lasers, thus making it an appealing choice for rotation measurements. In an embodiment, an IPI sensor can be based on an active bidirectional mode-locked fiber ring laser, where the laser loop area can be used as an effective rotation sensor. The loop can be encircled around an area inside a vehicle of considerable shape factor for high sensitivity to rotation. As an example, consider a satellite with a cross-section dimension of 1 m\u00d71 m. A bidirectional mode-locked fiber ring laser with a perimeter P=4 m, at a wavelength \u03bb=1.5 \u03bcm, when shaped into a square, has the shape factor \u03c1=6.7\u00b710Hz\/s, which is relatively large. In such a laser, \u0394\u03bd=0.1 Hz, which has been demonstrated with a discrete component laser, corresponds to a rotation sensitivity of 0.7\u00b0\/day.","In an embodiment, an all fiber IPI can be built such that the laser generates two intra-cavity counter-circulating pulses, that is, the laser operates in a bidirectional mode-locking. The laser can be mode-locked by a combination of a passive mechanism and an active mechanism, which can be passively driven using a pair of amplitude modulators. These modulators are used to control the crossing points and threshold conditions of the system, which provides active modulation of the loss.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","312","314","310","310","300","313","316","1","316","2","316","3","316","4","317","318","1","2","315","1","315","2","311","1","311","2","323","1","323","2","324","322","119","321"],"sub":["cw","ccw"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","408","409","1","409","2","426","1","426","2","427","1","427","2","400","1","2","415","1","415","2","403","415","1","415","2","416","1","416","2","416","3","410"],"sub":["cw ","ccw "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","510","510","512","514","510","510","513","517","518","1","2","515","1","515","2","511","1","511","2","523","1","523","2","524","522","519","521"],"sub":["\u03a61","\u03a62"]},"A loss modulation control system can be realized as an electronic feedback mechanism integrated to the laser system arrangement to provide laser stabilization, threshold gating, and crossing-point control. The laser stabilization is provided to maintain a time basis for the modulator's driving signals, which is synchronous with the oscillation rate of the laser itself. In the event of a sudden change in the repetition rate of the laser, for example temperature drifts effectively changing the overall cavity's length, or any other systematic mechanism, a RF signal can be adjusted accordingly. Instead of using an isolator, as is used with unidirectional mode-locked fiber lasers, a pair of amplitude modulator, such as modulators - and - of  and modulators - and - of  for example, can be used. These modulator pairs effectively work as an \u201copening\u201d (loss lowering) and \u201cclosing\u201d (loss increasing) threshold gating device. In addition to actively controlling the threshold of the system using the repetition rate of the laser itself, the presence of two modulators allows the control of the location where the two pulses cross as they undergo an entire round-trip travel, providing the crossing-point control.","Intracavity phase interferometry has been demonstrated as the most sensitive phase detector, and has been applied to the detection of magnetic fields, spatial displacements, and nonlinear index of refraction, just to name a few. Its significance comes from the fact that it detects frequency difference \u0394\u03bd (beat note), rather than amplitude difference, between two counter-circulating light modes in a laser, by beating them together on a detector. There are however numerous challenges to overcome in implementing an efficient IPI. For instance, the smallest beat note that can be measured is limited by linear scattering from the media where the counter-propagating light interact. It can introduce a no response region known as \u201cdead band\u201d, which is the region that limits the detection of the beat note. That is to say that, if r is the field linear backscattering coefficient of the medium, the dead band, or minimum measurable beat note \u0394\u03bd, is:\n\n\u0394\u03bd\/(2\u03c0\u03c4),\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere \u03c4is the round trip time of the laser cavity.\n","Using mode-locked lasers for IPI reduces the deadband, because backscattering only occurs at the crossing points and is scaled down by the width of the pulse (r=\u03b3c\u03c4with \u03b3 being a constant of the medium). Therefore, the shorter the pulse duration \u03c4, the smaller is the dead band \u0394\u03bd. As an example, for a typical single-mode fiber (\u03b3=2.76\u00b710m), and a pulse duration of 100 ps, the dead band \u0394\u03bd=0.22 Hz. For 100 fs pulses, which is common in fiber laser systems, \u0394\u03bd=2.2\u00b710Hz. A challenge here is to prevent the crossing point from moving at each round-trip, since the signal exists only if the two pulses trains overlap on the detector. A computer simulation of the nonlinear-polarization mode-locked operation, for a fiber laser implementation, has identified the cause of jitter in the crossing point, as being due to the coupling between small perturbation to the fiber and group velocity. Indeed, the fiber birefringence is affected by a small fiber motion, resulting in a modified loss at a polarizing element PBS, hence a pulse amplitude change, which changes the saturation condition in the gain fiber, in turn modifying the group velocity. It has been determined that a difference in group velocity between the counter-circulating pulses, results in a change of the arrival time of a pulse at the beat note (measurement) plane. This effect is detrimental to the beat note detection, as it compromises the overlapping of the pulse at the interference plane by degrading the fringe contrast. Solutions to this extreme sensitivity may include (i) maintaining a rigid and temperature controlled fiber structure, and (ii) actively controlling the delay line of the measurement interferometer such as by using XC  of .","Since the interface where the pulses meet is a limiting factor on the sensitivity of the system, a method has to be devised to control the crossing point of the two intracavity pulses and prevent phase coupling between them. In addition to that, reaching the potential limit of an IPI sensor poses, however, a serious challenge, because of the difficulty of interfering the ultrashort pulses on the detector. Indeed, any differential change in group velocity causes the crossing point of the pulses to drift. This is particularly true in fiber lasers, where even a small change in the phase of one pulse, for example due to a change in fiber temperature or stresses, may, in some cases, result in a group velocity change sufficient to move the pulses' crossing point by one entire pulse duration. Furthermore, as the two counter-propagating pulses travel along the laser, the order in which they pass through the different elements of the cavity causes the system to appear non-symmetric between the two. As a result, the pulses experience different threshold conditions and will display a difference in peak intensities \u0394I, creating a bias on the beat note response \u0394\u03bd,\n\n\u0394\u03bd=(\/\u03bb)\u0394\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nwhere nis the average nonlinear index of refraction of the laser, vis group velocity, and \u03bb is the wavelength.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIG. 6B"],"sub":"min"},"To create an efficient active bidirectional mode-locked laser to be used as an IPI sensor, one must: (i) actively control the location of the crossing points to eliminate frequency lock-in, (ii) construct a device to suppress the beat note bias \u0394\u03bd, and (iii) minimize the crossing point drift to enhance the fringe visibility (contrast) at the interference plane.  show embodiments of systems that provide efficient active bidirectional mode-locked lasers, which can be used as IPI sensors.

A procedure similar to the one for the crossing point control circuit is applied here, where a small dithering signal (DITHER) is introduced to the system and monitored by the LIA to determine the direction that the control signal must follow. Since the bias correction can be applied to either pulse train sequence, a mixing of the bias control signal to the timing window that it takes a sequence to pass through the two modulators must be made. This can be accomplished by multiplying the control signal to the output signal of a flip-flop circuit which sets at the leading edge of a pulse from that particular sequence just before it passes through the first modulator and re-sets just after it passes through the second modulator, thus ensuring that the controlling signal only acts on the desired pulse train. The signals used on the input to the flip-flop are tapped from the signals used on the input to the OR gates - and - in . With the calibrator signal applied to the bias ports of the modulators only at the time of a given sequence, only the peak intensity corresponding to that sequence will be affected, forcing the system to a situation of \u0394I=0.","In various embodiments, a single mechanism is implemented to measure both absolute and relative attitude of a vehicle, in lieu of the significant number of instruments currently used for that purpose. An innovative IPI method uses an active bidirectional mode-locked laser to provide both a direct measurement of the attitude rotation vectors (pitch, yaw, and roll) and an indirect method to determine the vehicle's relative location using information of the earth's local magnetic field.","An optical gyroscope is an instrument which responds to motion. Its performance is based on the capacity to sense a phase differential between two counter-propagating beams (Sagnac Effect).

Inside the sample, light will be right circularly polarized for a pulse coming from one direction, and left circularly polarized for the pulse coming in the opposite direction. The counter-propagating pulses passing through this area will experience a different phase shift proportional to the magnetic field, and a beat note will be detected as described in Eq. (4). A single mode fiber can be used, for example, as the sample material. Because the loops can be the same used for rotation measurements, they can be made in large areas, and, thus, part of the detected beat note will be sensitive to rotation as well. This bias, imparted to the system due to motion, must be factored out from the beat note. The rotation contribution \u0394\u03bd, measured in a previous detection cycle, should be subtracted from the measurement \u0394\u03bdinvolving the magnetic loop.

Here, again, switching from one measurement to the other, in this case rotation to magnetic (position) sensing, can be timed using a logic circuit to drive the Pockel cells. As in the inertial measurement case, the timing between rotation and position measurement is completely arbitrary and depends only on how many cycles per beat note measurement is desired, and limited only by the response of the Pockel cells.","In various embodiments, in addition to relative and absolute aircraft detection, a mechanism to detect acceleration is provided. Such a mechanism can work as follows. A linear cavity with two pulses per cavity round trip is the limit of a stretched-out ring laser. In the ring laser, the two intracavity pulses cross always at the same point related to the laboratory frame, while the carrier frequency makes an interference pattern that is related to an absolute frame of reference (i.e. not accelerating). As mentioned, the measured beat note \u0394v represents the change \u0394\u03c6 of the carrier to envelope phase at each cavity round-trip \u03c4=P\/c, i.e. \u0394v=\u0394\u03c6\/\u03c4. In the linear cavity with two pulses per cavity round-trip, the two intracavity pulses also cross always at the same point relative to the laser or laboratory frame, close to the one end mirror of the cavity, as sketched in . One pulse, upon reflection on M, experiences a Doppler shift, (v\/c)\u03bd, where \u03bd is the light frequency, and v the mirror velocity. When the other pulse hits the other mirror (M), the Doppler shift is (v+a\u03c4\/2)\u03bd\/c, where \u201ca\u201d is the acceleration and \u03c4is the round trip time. The beat note measured is the difference in Doppler shifts, a\u03c4\u03bd\/2c. The application to acceleration measurement does not involve any inertial mass, as opposed to standard accelerometers.","The crossing point in the laser cavity in  can be controlled with the insertion of the active scheme, as shown for example in . After reflection on the left mirror shown in , the pulse A is reflected on an output coupling plate and sent to a delay line to make it interfere with pulse B that has been reflected on the right mirror. A number of cavity round-trips can be added in the detection delay line, to increase the sensitivity to acceleration. A long delay line can be constructed with a dispersion compensated fiber, and efficiently used in vehicle acceleration sensing. If N is the ratio of this delay to the cavity length L, the acceleration that can be resolved is:\n\n=(\u03bb\/)\u0394\u03bd\u2003\u2003(5)\n\nFor example, with a delay line of 3 km, and a cavity with \u03c4=10 ns, N\u22481000. At a wavelength of 1.5 \u03bcm, with a minimum resolvable \u0394\u03bd\u22481 Hz (the case of an unstabilized cavity), the minimum detectable acceleration is a\u22481.5\u00b710\/(10\u00d710)=0.15 m\/s. This figure can be improved by 10with stabilization brought by the active mechanism, leading to a sensitivity to acceleration of 100 \u03bcm\/s. This approach can be realized as a purely optical approach, with a low power fiber laser, and not involving any moving or deformable mass.\n","In various embodiments, improvements\/innovations can be realized for navigation systems, such as aircraft navigation systems. The systems and processes described herein can provide highly accurate measurements. Unlike conventional motion detection devices used in satellite's navigation systems, an all fiber IPI sensor, for example, in accordance with various embodiments provides an innovative and unique way to detect rotation, which not until recently had only been implemented with discrete component solid state lasers. The all fiber IPI sensor, for instance, is fundamentally different from the standard passive Fiber Optical Gyro (FOG), which is a passive device in which the measured difference in phase induced by rotation is translated into a difference in intensity. To illustrate this performance difference, assume, for instance, that a rotation results in a phase difference of \u0394\u03c6=4 nano radians. For such a small phase difference, cos(\u0394\u03c6)\u22481\u22122\u0394\u03c6. A detector has to resolve a change in intensity better than one part in 10, which is comparable to distinguishing a change of 1 nanovolt in a signal of 10 million volts. The best voltmeter on the market today specifies 8.5 digit resolution, at least several orders of magnitude away from measuring this phase shift. In the approach described herein, a phase shift of \u0394\u03c6=4 nano radians is directly translated into a frequency \u0394\u03c6\/(2\u03c0\u03c4)\u22480.05 Hz (in a laser cavity of perimeter P=4 m), corresponding to a sensitivity to rotation of 0.37\u00b0\/day. Stabilization of the cavity perimeter may improve these figures by several orders of magnitude, making it better than any navigational optical gyroscope of today.","Various systems and processes described herein can provide versatility. Not only can such systems perform inertial measurements, these systems can simultaneously detect position. Because the architectures of the electronics components are not sophisticated, the main loop of the system can be easily scaled down to a compact sized machine. Furthermore, such systems can be applied to a variety of vehicles, such as airplanes, guided missiles, submarines, UAVs, and satellites, just to name a few.","In various embodiments, systems and processes described herein can provide an innovative active approach to bidirectional mode-locking that solves three major problems associated with its application to IPI. With respect to frequency unlocking, using bidirectional mode-locked lasers as IPIs is always challenging, because of the difficulty to keep the counter-circulating pulses from crossing at a highly scattering interface, for example a splice in a fiber or a saturable absorber in a laser. By controlling the location of the crossing-points, systems and processes in various embodiments of the invention provides a solution to the scattering problem, the systems and processes described herein demonstrate a mechanism to control the crossing point using an easy to implement logic circuit.","With respect to crossing point stabilization, systems and processes in various embodiments of the invention provide a method to nullify the effects of crossing point drifts using a feedback system designed to maximize the fringe visibility of the beat note. Such systems can be implemented with simple electronics devices.","With respect to beat note bias suppression, systems and processes in various embodiments of the invention provide a method to eliminate non-symmetrical cavity effects on the peak intensity of the counter-propagating pulses. A bias suppression mechanism can be used that acts directly on the modulation of the system, effectively changing its threshold conditions.","In guidance, navigation, and control systems, attitude control of a vehicle must rely on accurate measurements of its position (relative to a reference), and motion (inertial measurements). To ascertain its precise attitude, spacecrafts, for example, use a number of sophisticated, on-board, instruments, such as sun\/horizon sensors, star trackers, orbital gyrocompasses, for position determination, and spinning mass, hemispherical resonators, and laser gyros for inertial navigation. This later class of sensors is predominantly dominated by He\u2014Ne and fiber optic gyro technology, which typically are high power consuming, shock sensitive, low efficiency instruments, some of which contain moving mechanical parts subject to wear offs and jam, not to mention the fact that they are particularly expensive. In various embodiments, an innovative, detection system can be based on an all fiber intracavity phase interferometer (IPI) active laser capable of delivering extremely accurate simultaneous measurements of all three degrees of rotation (pitch, yaw, and roll), and position in a single, compact, cost effective unit. The position measurement may be realized using a magnetometer.","Mode-locked fiber lasers provide a sensing mechanism that can be used as IPIs and deliver measurements with unlimited precision and lower energy consumption without the need for any moving mechanical parts. In various embodiments, a system using mode-locked fiber lasers as IPIs can provide high sensitivity inertial and position measurements using a single detection mechanism. It has the potential to considerably improve the sensitivity and reliability of vehicle attitude sensing, with the potential of becoming the new standard for the next generation of sensors in navigation systems. Rotation and position can be detected using an all fiber IPI sensor, which may be implemented in integrated form. Such systems can be designed to be applicable to spacecrafts, since these systems are lightweight, sensitive, and have low power consumption. However, in other type of aircrafts, such as unmanned aerial vehicles or commercial aircrafts, the recording of fast motion may be averaged out.","In guidance, navigation, and control systems, attitude control of a vehicle rely on accurate measurements of its position (relative to a reference), and motion (inertial measurements). In various embodiments, a detection system can be based on an all fiber intracavity phase interferometer (IPI) active laser capable of delivering extremely accurate simultaneous measurements of all three degrees of rotation (pitch, yaw, and roll), and position in a single, compact, cost effective unit. A variation of the same system can be made on a linear cavity laser for extremely accurate measurements of acceleration without the use of any inertial masses.","Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that any arrangement that is calculated to achieve the same purpose may be substituted for the specific embodiments shown.
