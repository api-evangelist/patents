{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was made with United States Government support under Contract No. HSSCHQ-04-C-00342 awarded by the Department of Homeland Security. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to improved measurement of bore sight error in directed energy systems by reducing backscatter induced \u201cself tracking.\u201d A compact instrument enables placement of the instrument such that the image of the laser beam, as retro reflected, scattered and diffracted, forms outside the tracking field of view avoiding self tracking errors.","Laser\/infrared tracking systems exist for both air and land-based applications. One application is a counter measure to man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), small anti aircraft missiles. These countermeasure systems operate with tight tolerances that are difficult to achieve. For example, bore sight alignment is a demanding issue. Typically, bore sight measurements require accuracy of the order of 10 \u03bcrad. This is difficult to measure without interference from artifacts. It is also difficult to maintain, so these measurements should be made frequently.","Retro reflection is also a particularly important issue. The jam laser is typically very powerful and the tracker very sensitive. If the tracker sees even a small fraction of the retro reflected jam laser from the measurement apparatus, it may begin to track that instead of the reference target, a phenomenon called \u201cself tracking.\u201d Retro reflection from most devices and surfaces used in beam profile and measurement cameras is typically several orders of magnitude larger than the limits for the onset of this effect for most trackers. Practical experience has shown that elimination of this artifact is difficult both to achieve and to verify.","Measurement of the pointing of a beam directed under control of a tracker requires an instrument that both locates the beam in angular space and isolates it from the tracker providing the pointing, unless closed loop tracking (around the backscattered beam) is the intent.","Test devices have generally been ad-hoc devices built without an understanding of back scatter and how to suppress it. Backscatter contaminates pointing device management and can require unrealistic input signals for tracking (i.e. increasing it enough to overwhelm the backscatter component). These Ad hoc methods are unreliable and involve high maintenance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","105","110","115","120","120","105"]},"The alternative, often used, is to add a reference laser beam to augment the black body tracker output. While this is useful it too is susceptible to misalignment, adding to the overall complexity. With a compact pointing instrument, the mount is smaller and more rigid making reference lasers less prone to lose alignment themselves. Typically, a reference laser is used to get near alignment and use the black body for a final measurement, either to achieve final alignment or to measure the residual error.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","205","210","215","210","220","225","205","230","235","240","245","235","250","250"]},"Laser retro reflection is assumed to be a spherical wave front leaving the measurement camera. When it returns to the lens used by the beam analysis camera, it is collimated and sent back towards the UUT where it can enter its tracker aperture and be imaged in competition with the black body produced target.","What is needed is a test method and device that is simple to build, rugged, reliable and has backscatter reliably reduced to prevent self tracking. Such a device can be used for lab testing, alignment check prior to range testing, flight line testing of installed jammers, and calibration of all multi aperture directable jammers.","Embodiments solve the problems shown in  by addressing the ways that retro reflection can reach the tracker aperture and suppressing them. Elements include: 1) placing the test instrument within critical ranges of the unit under test and 2) minimizing or eliminating the use of beam splitters.","Embodiments include two approaches for controlling problems indicated in : 1) using a shared objective system to reduce the alignment sensitivity to deflection, shown in ; and 2) making a two objective system small to reduce the bending moments, as shown in . Shared objective systems have the advantages of simpler alignment and maintenance of bore sight. A shared objective embodiment has the added benefit that it can test a jammer in any orientation by use of an annular mirror to split the incoming laser beam from the outgoing target beam as shown in . Paired module systems can use smaller active objectives allowing smaller instruments with cost savings that can offset the higher cost of maintaining two instruments in alignment.","Invention embodiments provide a compact instrument that enables placement of the instrument such that the image of the laser beam, as retro reflected, scattered and diffracted, forms outside the tracking field of view. This geometry also enables the placement of a baffle to block this radiation without losing the target beam.","In a shared objective embodiment as shown in , the target source and beam profile and location camera are located at the focus of an off-axis Cassegrain objective. A two objective embodiment can use two different focal lengths.","Target power, as projected from the black body source, decreases as the square with objective focal length. The target beam is near parallel as it leaves the objective. Thus, the requirement for the objective aperture to fill the tracker window is that the width of the outer annulus equals the tracker aperture diameter plus whatever distance it moves under tests such as vibration. Beam position resolution improves with test objective focal length. Thus, the objective focal length is a compromise between obtaining sufficient beam location resolution and target irradiance at the UUT tracker aperture.","Embodiments include a low-backscatter test method comprising providing a test instrumentation configuration comprising a tracking target; forming an image of a jam laser; mapping far field of the jam laser image; and locating the jam laser image, wherein the image as retro reflected, scattered and diffracted forms outside tracking field of view, avoiding self tracking errors. In another embodiment, the test instrumentation configuration is a Cassegrain test instrumentation configuration. In yet another embodiment, the Cassegrain test instrumentation configuration comprises a shared objective. For other embodiments, the Cassegrain test instrumentation configuration comprises two objective pointing measurement instruments, and the test instrumentation configuration comprises an annular mirror.","Other embodiments include a low-backscatter unit under test (UUT) instrumentation apparatus comprising at least one mirror reflecting a laser source; and a camera receiving radiation from the laser source, whereby an image is formed wherein the image as retro reflected, scattered and diffracted forms outside tracking field of view. Yet other embodiments comprise a Cassegrain configuration, a shared objective, and two objective pointing measurement instruments. For other embodiments, the Cassegrain configuration provides a frontal aperture thereby reducing instrument size and facilitating construction and alignment. Other embodiments comprise an annular mirror. While for yet others, the annular mirror separates incoming and outgoing beams. In an embodiment, the annular mirror enables elimination of beam splitters and their scatter. For yet other embodiments, the UUT comprises a beam pointing device. In others, the beam pointing device comprises a jammer. Another embodiment comprises an outer mirror and an internal mask, whereby substantially all of the outer mirror blocks direct transmission of retro reflected jammer laser to UUT tracker. Yet other embodiments comprise a compact layout, dust resistant package whereby near field retro-reflection is suppressed and whereby mirror cleanliness is maintained. In another embodiment, high resolution at full aperture is required only near center of field and only to diffraction limit of central aperture as defined by the annular mirror, thereby relaxing tolerances. For another embodiment, smaller apertures provide shorter design dimensions thereby relaxing tolerances and increasing rigidity, supporting units under test (UUTs) in all rotation orientations.","Yet another embodiment is a low-backscatter unit under test (UUT) instrumentation apparatus comprising at least one mirror, the at least one mirror comprising an off-axis Cassegrain mirror and at least one annular mirror, wherein the center of the annulus of the at least one annular mirror is offset with respect to the tracking aperture of the UUT; and a laser source reflected by the at least one mirror, whereby an image is formed wherein the image as retro reflected, scattered and diffracted forms outside the tracking field of view of tracker of the UUT.","The features and advantages described herein are not all-inclusive and, in particular, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and not to limit the scope of the inventive subject matter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","305","310","315","320","325","330","335","315","340","325","330"]},"This embodiment is used for pointing error (i.e. bore sight error) measurements and illustrates the shared objective approach with the elimination of refractive and pellicle beam splitters. This embodiment includes use of the annular mirror  in an off-axis optical system (by virtue of off-axis paraboloid ). Annular mirror  is also shown in inset elevation. With the output laser projected down the center, UUT  can be tested in any orientation. Annular splitting mirror  performs the additional function of restricting back scatter from the camera focal plane to the center of the objective. The tracker of UUT  is located to collect radiation only from the outer part of the objective aperture. Thus, annular mirror  achieves a geometrical optical separation of the target beam from the returning retro-reflected UUT laser beam. Diffraction analysis shows that this separation is not always sufficient but this double use of the annular mirror contributes to this invention.","The use of a single mirror in this configuration and installation on an optical table prevents the instrument from being close to the unit under test. The mirror has a back focus equal to its focal length and back focal space is used for the target source and camera elements. The limited off-axis distance of the paraboloid keeps the UUT out of this area.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["400","325","405","410","415","420","425","415","410","430","435","405","430","435","440"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["500","405","505","510","515"]},"The Huygens Fresnel integral describes the diffraction of the beam for purposes of estimating its profile. The Huygens Fresnel theory is that the central portion of the beam is little affected by the confining aperture in the annular mirror, but the outer portions of the beam behave as though they were originating at the edge. This portion of the beam approximates a spherical wave originating at the edge of the aperture. The Huygens Fresnel integral is widely accepted as the method of calculating the contributions from the entire aperture at any point beyond the aperture.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 4"],"b":"435"},"The annular aperture is in the beam as it expands as a near spherical wave from the measurement camera focus. When this beam reaches the outer mirror of the objective, the core becomes a virtual plane wave propagating along the center of the aperture and well clear of the UUT tracker when near enough that it has not spread due to unavoidable beam divergence. This is the view of a collimator.","The backscatter at the tracker aperture is estimated by evaluating the Huygens Fresnel integral over the tracker aperture. This estimates the fraction of the beam getting to the tracker. If geometric analysis shows that an image of the inner annular mirror aperture is imaged in the UUT track window, it has a direct line of sight to the backscatter beam. Virtually all of the power at the tracker aperture forms an image of the backscatter UUT laser beam. If this image forms outside the UUT tracker window, it has no such line of sight and all it \u201csees\u201d is scatter of the \u201cfringe\u201d radiation that diffracted from the core to the outer part of the objective. For intermediate cases, the amount of back scatter reaching the tracker window is approximately proportional to the fraction of the inner aperture it \u201csees\u201d.  shows the case of the core missing the window;  shows the intermediate case, and  shows the worst case.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 6A","b":["600","605","605","610","615","605","625","625","605","620","610","615","615"]},"Inside this fringe critical range, the tracker forms a large image of  far enough below the focal plane that no rays forming the image intersect the tracker focal plane. Many trackers accept track images only inside a small subset of the array which has the result of increasing the allowable separation between the UUT and the test instrument. The effects of radiation scattered inside the tracker camera assembly are not included in the analysis of this embodiment. Because this image is formed off the array, it is possible to block it by means of a baffle without compromising the integrity of the projected target image if this is necessary.  depicts a baffle. For typical dimensions of UUTs and instruments, this condition holds to a distance of about 1 meter.","For the shared objective configuration, the laser aperture (the hole in the annular mirror) is inside the instrument. This produces a near spherical wave Fresnel diffraction pattern as previously described. As also previously described, the outer fringe radiation is scattered by the mirror as described by the Bi-Directional Reflection Distribution Function (BRDF) and imaged on the tracker focal plane. Because it has no direct path the UUT tracker aperture, it will appear to originate from this surface. For this geometry and a moderately clean mirror, this produces a total back scatter power in the 10range. Since this is well inside the hyper focal distance of most trackers, this image is a moderately shaded (most intense at the top in this case) largely featureless blob. If this covers an n-by-m array, each pixel will see a radiation level of about 10\/(n-by-m) of the total back scatter power.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 6B","FIG. 6B"],"b":["650","655","655","660","665"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","705","710","715","720","725","705","725","730","720"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","805"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 7"],"b":"900"},"The radiation reaches the tracker aperture by scattering as described by the BiDirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) of the mirrors. Direct reflection does not occur because this fringe radiation reaches the objective by effectively being diffracted out of a straight line from the profiler focal plane. Because radiation, after diffraction, propagates in a straight line, this fringe radiation is reflected away from the tracker. Only the indirect scatter as described by BRDF formalism can get to the UUT tracker aperture. BRDF depends on the cleanliness of the surface. Thus, a dust resistant enclosure suppresses backscatter. At distances where only the fringes are imaged, the tracker is usually far too close to focus these fringes well enough to resolve them. A two objective instrument can have the entrance and exit aperture external and therefore be virtually free of the fringing background.

The more readily computed Fraunhofer diffraction approximation is valid when Fis less than 1 (typically at a range of over 100 meters). The Huygens Fresnel integral predicts the total power that falls in the image with virtually all of it forming the core image. This amount of this that reaches the tracker focal plane array scales approximately as the ratio of the area on the array to the total area of this image.
