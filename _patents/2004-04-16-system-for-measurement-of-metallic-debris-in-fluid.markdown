title: System for measurement of metallic debris in fluid
abstract: A debris sensor arrangement is positioned within an enclosed body of fluid for detecting the presence of metallic debris particles therein. Debris detection involves exposure of cantilever beams to the fluid when magnetized within an electromagnetic field to attract the metallic debris particles thereon and induce vibratory motion thereof at a resonant frequency varied by changes in the density of the debris particles magnetically held thereon. Measurement of the resonance frequency reflecting the density of the debris particles within the fluid being tested thereby monitors the corresponding wear of machinery reflected by the debris density.

Other generally known optical fiber systems for monitoring metallic debris require algorithms to discern the metallic debris from air bubbles and other anomalies. It is an important object of the present invention to provide a relatively smaller and less intrusive system for the detection and measurement of metallic debris reflecting machinery wear.","Pursuant to the present invention, metallic debris is detected and measured directly within fluid enclosure while the fluid is undergoing flow therein from machinery for example. Magnetic attraction of particles of the metallic debris within such fluid onto cantilever beams of a generally known type associated with micro-mechanical systems is involved. The cantilever beams are positioned so that vibratory motion thereof is induced by electromechanical forces applied through a magnetic field which also establishes the magnetic attraction of the metallic debris onto the cantilever beams while the fluid is undergoing flow and monitors changes in resonance frequency of the vibratory motions reflecting variations in debris density within the fluid being tested reflecting wear of the machinery.","Referring now to the drawing in detail, pursuant to one embodiment of the present invention wear of machinery  for example is monitored by detection of debris within fluid enclosure such as a pipe  as shown in . Fluid  as shown in , such as non-turbulent water or lubricating oil, is to be tested for the presence of metallic debris therein, such as suspended non-magnetic particles  imparting a relatively low viscosity to the fluid  so as to enable detection of the debris particles  by a micro-mechanical type of sensor arrangement .","Referring now to , the debris sensor arrangement  embodies a plurality of vibratory cantilever beams , ,  and  of different lengths anchored at one end thereof within the pipe  by a support  in overlying relation to electromagnetic coils . The cantilever beams , ,  and  undergo vibratory motion when rendered magnetic within an electromagnetic field generated by the underlying electromagnetic coils , upon electrical energization thereof as hereinafter explained. Under the electromagnetic forces thereby exerted on the cantilever beams \u2013 by the electromagnetic coils , their vibratory motions resonate at a resonance frequency dependent on their mass and the quantity of the metallic debris particles  deposited thereon by magnetic attraction. Because of such magnetic adherence of the metallic debris particles  onto the cantilever beams \u2013, changes in resonant frequency is detected by a resonance frequency sensor  diagrammed in , of a standard microbeam electronics type. The frequency sensor  is operationally connected to a data process indicator  to monitor debris density of the particles  in the fluid . A selective control  is connected to the data process indicator  for controlling supply of electrical energy from a power source  to the magnetic field coils  in accordance with the debris density being monitored.","The debris sensor arrangement  as hereinbefore described is utilized to detect the density of the metallic debris particles  within the body of fluid  being tested while undergoing flow within the pipe . The pipe  may constitute a lubrication line extending from the machinery  through which machinery wear is reflected by change in cantilever vibratory motion frequency detected by the sensor  for monitoring machinery wear reflected by debris density through the data process indicator  and to control changes in energization of the magnetic coil  through the selective control . According to other embodiments of the present invention, the debris sensor arrangement  may alternatively be located in other installation enclosures such as a debris storage tank associated for example with food or drug manufacturing or water purification systems for indication of use or wear therein by monitoring of debris density.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 1\u20135"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
