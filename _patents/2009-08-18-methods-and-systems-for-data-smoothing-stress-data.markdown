{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for government purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The present invention relates generally to data smoothing techniques. More particularly, the present invention provides methods and systems for data smoothing raw data such as stress data and for transforming the raw data to provide individual service life predictions from measured stress data.","The life limiting event of modern rockets is typically structural failure of the solid propellant. A failure may be a crack in the propellant or an interface bond separation that causes an unacceptable deviation in thrust or over pressurization leading to case failure. Conventionally, current service life predictions for rocket motors treat large populations of rocket motors as equivalent for the risk of failure and retire the group when that risk exceeds a predetermined threshold. This process tends to be conservative and the desired reliability threshold set by the customer is typically very high. The result is numerous rocket motors are removed from service, even though they may have many years of service life left.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,301,970 to Biggs et al. entitled \u201cCUMULATIVE DAMAGE MODEL FOR STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF FILED POLYMERIC MATERIALS,\u201d the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference, discloses a stochastic cumulative damage model, A Global Engineering Model of Damage (AGEMOD), to forecast the probability of solid propellant structural failure. This process uses a simplified generic service history to create a temperature profile for the group of motors being modeled. A linear visco-elastic material model (LVEM) is employed to relate the temperatures the motors are subjected to, with the stresses induced in the propellant from thermal contraction. AGEMOD utilizes a Linear Cumulative Damage (LCD) calculation to forecast the reliability. This approach is a stochastic process because AGEMOD uses a Monte Carlo type simulation to model variation about the temperature and mechanical properties.","Additionally, significant advances have been made with respect to small stress sensors. These small stress sensors are miniature in size, produced in high volume, and utilize low power to provide data collection. There are a number of ongoing efforts to embed stress sensors in solid rocket motors, enabling collection of data specific to each motor and reduction of errors in the damage calculation. Utilizing embedded sensors enables the load history of individual units to be collected and analyzed, as part of an individual service life determination. This approach enables the removal of just those units whose forecast reliability has dropped to unacceptable levels. The majority of the population can remain in use until those units experience an event or degradation of properties that cause their reliability to drop. This approach is a far more efficient approach to the management of the fielded inventory and provides significant cost savings.","However, the stress sensors provide data collection over many years resulting in hundreds of thousands or millions of data points. In order for this data to be useful, the volume of data must be reduced, while the significant damage events are retained.","In various exemplary embodiments, the present invention provides methods and systems for data smoothing raw data such as stress and temperature data. The present invention can utilize various techniques to smooth data such as dropping data using a stress threshold, dropping data by resample (or decimation), and smoothing by dynamic binning. Additionally, the present invention can utilize a transform function to estimate stress from a stress sensor to areas of peak stress. In an exemplary application, the present invention can be utilized to reduce stress and temperature data collected by a plurality of embedded stress sensors in a rocket motor for purposes of computing service life of the motor.","In an exemplary aspect of the present invention, a data smoothing method for reducing raw stress data includes receiving a data set of raw stress data; transforming the data set responsive to a transform function that accounts for the difference between the location of the gage and of the point of interest; and smoothing the raw stress data to reduce the quantity of the data set while retaining significant stress events. The data smoothing method can further include calculating a service life prediction from the reduced data set. The data smoothing method also can further include measuring the raw stress data with a plurality of embedded sensors in a rocket motor. The transform function is configured to estimate peak stress from the raw stress data set at a peak stress point in the rocket motor. The data smoothing method can further include determining a transform coefficient responsive to the geometry of the rocket motor. Optionally, the smoothing includes applying dynamic binning to the raw stress data. The dynamic binning is controlled by a dynamic stress bin trigger including a change in stress that prompts a new bin and a minimum and maximum allowable bin size, and the dynamic binning includes fewer bins in a low stress region relative to a high stress region. Alternatively, the smoothing further includes resampling the raw stress data responsive to a predetermined frequency. The smoothing can also further include dropping the raw stress data responsive to a stress threshold.","In another exemplary aspect of the present invention, a method of computing a service life prediction of a device based on measured stress includes receiving a plurality of stress measurements from one or more embedded stress sensors; smoothing the raw stress data to reduce the quantity of the data set while retaining significant stress events; calculating a service life prediction from the reduced data set; and removing the device from service responsive to the service life prediction. The method can further include applying a transform function to the raw stress data to estimate peak stress from the raw stress data set at a peak stress point in the device. The smoothing can include applying dynamic binning to the raw stress data, where the dynamic binning is controlled by a dynamic stress bin trigger including a change in stress that prompts a new bin and a minimum and maximum allowable bin size, and where the dynamic binning includes fewer bins in a low stress region relative to a high stress region. Optionally, the smoothing further includes resampling the raw stress data responsive to a predetermined frequency; and dropping the raw stress data responsive to a stress threshold.","In yet another exemplary aspect of the present invention, a data smoothing system includes means for data input and output; one or more processors coupled to memory and the means for data input and output, where one or more processors are configured to: receive a data set including raw stress data; transform the data set responsive to a transform function; smooth the raw stress data to reduce the quantity of the data set while retaining significant stress events; and calculate a service life prediction from the reduced data set The data smoothing system can further include a plurality of embedded sensors in a rocket motor, the plurality of embedded sensors are configured to measure the raw stress data. The transform function is configured to estimate peak stress from the raw stress data set at a peak stress point in the rocket motor. To smooth includes applying dynamic binning to the raw stress data, where the dynamic binning is controlled by a dynamic stress bin trigger including a change in stress that prompts a new bin and a minimum and maximum allowable bin size, where the dynamic binning includes fewer bins in a low stress region relative to a high stress region; resampling the raw stress data responsive to a predetermined frequency in the low stress region; and dropping the raw stress data responsive to a stress threshold in the low stress region.","In various exemplary embodiments, the present invention provides methods and systems for data smoothing raw data such as stress data.

In an exemplary application, the present invention can be utilized to reduce stress and temperature data collected by a plurality of embedded stress sensors in a rocket motor for purposes of computing service life of the motor.","The LCD approach utilized in AGEMOD is also the mechanism that can be used by hand to quantify the damage. In order to use this mechanism to estimate damage, a number of physical parameters must be determined. A series of constant strain rate tensile tests to failure have to be performed, with the propellant of interest covering a range of temperatures and strain rates. The data from these tests is manipulated to yield the time to failure, t, and applied stress, \u03c3, as described by the relationship in equation 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["log","\u03c3"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"B"}},{"mi":"log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":["t","f"]},{"mi":["a","T"]}]}}}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"mi":"log","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":"\u03c3","mn":"0"}}],"mo":"+"}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"The physical parameters that are determined include the temperature shift factor, a, damage exponent, B, and the applied stress that causes fracture in unit time, a. A temperature shift factor is determined for each temperature at which constant strain rate tensile tests were performed.

The ratio of the time spent at each load, t, to the time to failure at that stress level is the damage fraction, as shown by equation (3). These fractions are additive, their sum being a mean estimate of the total damage as a result of the stress history examined. What is implied by equation (3) is when these fractions sum to unity, failure is imminent.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"D","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mi":"t","msub":{"mi":["t","f"]}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}}},"Polymeric materials may undergo an internal tearing process when subjected to a sustained load. This damage process continues until macroscopic failure occurs. The stress data can be used to determine fatigue damage to the structure. Damage, D, is calculated by performing a numerical integration of the formula equation:\n\n=([\u03c3\u2212\u03c3])\u222b([\u03c3()\u2212\u03c3]())\u2003\u2003(4)\n","Here, the parameter \u03c3is the stress that will cause failure in unit time, t, \u03c3 is the threshold stress below which failure will not occur irrespective of load time, and a(t) is the time-varying (because, in general, temperature is changing with time) propellant temperature shift factor. These parameters, along with the exponent B, are measured by performing laboratory tests on tensile coupon samples. Shift factors are derived from relaxation modulus and tensile data. The remaining parameters are derived from uniaxial constant rate tensile tests (performed at a number of temperatures and strain rates) and creep testing. \u03c3(t) is the input stress history of interest and may be any complex sequences of stresses. The overall load sequence used may be the outcome of the structure's service environment, rather than a specific sequence of stresses. Note that in the cumulative damage model, failure is imminent when D reaches unity.","Although the LVEM model is reasonably accurate at reproducing the visco-elastic behavior of solid propellants, there is a recognized need for improvement. The attempts of engineers and scientists to develop a non-linear model have, to date, proven inadequate. There are efforts to bypass these models and eliminate the errors they introduce by directly measuring the stress levels in the propellant. The LCD approach relies on a stress based failure criterion, and therefore can use stress data produced by embedded stress sensors.","In various exemplary embodiments, the present invention provides mechanisms to capture damage controlling parts of raw data histories (i.e., the stress data). The relation between damage and stress in propellants suggests that the peak stress levels cause most of the damage, i.e.,\n\n\u2003\u2003(5)\n","Referring to , a solid propellant rocket motor  is illustrated with multiple embedded stress sensors -according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The data smoothing techniques of the present invention are described herein with respect to data collected from the stress sensors -. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the data smoothing techniques could also be applied to any large set of data points which must be reduced while retaining significant events.","In an exemplary operation, a solid propellant rocket motor similar to 10 was stored in a magazine for an extended time period in a rather benign environment. The data collected represents conditions very similar to what is seen by a vast number of deployed rocket motors, making this data set a very good example of the \u201ctypical\u201d data from a fielded motor.","The solid propellant rocket motor  includes an analog motor design having a grain keyhole slot . In an exemplary embodiment, two different solid propellant rocket motors  were used with the grain keyhole slot  of different depths, one shallow and one deep, (a single slot in an otherwise circular port grain design) to gather data from the sensors .  illustrates the bore geometry with the relative locations of the four embedded sensors -that were in each motor . The first sensor is positioned at 180\u00b0 and at a length position L\/2, where L is the length of the motor . The second sensor is positioned at 180\u00b0 and at a length position L\/2 minus 3 inches. The third sensor is positioned at 60\u00b0 and at a length position L\/2, and the fourth sensor is positioned at 60\u00b0 and at a length position L\/2 minus 3 inches. The solid propellant rocket motors  were temperature cycled hot to cold, such that the solid propellant rocket motors  with shallow slots  would crack. These conditions are far worse than deployed motors are expected to encounter.","In various exemplary embodiments, the present invention provides data smoothing using stress sensor data from the sensors . The sensors  can collect data periodically (e.g., hourly, etc.)-over an extended period of time (e.g., years), thus each sensor  can produce on the order of hundreds of thousands to millions of data points. Disadvantageously, these data points can be computationally intensive to process and algorithms such as the AGEMOD can handle only hundreds of data points. It is difficult to modify these algorithms to handle this large quantity of data points.","The sensors  can be mounted directly on a case wall . This location on the case wall  offers a stable anchor and in this location the sensors  are less likely to increase the peak stresses in the motor . The stress at the case wall can be significantly different than the peak stresses in the motor . Accordingly, because the damage analysis is interested in using the peak stresses, the peak stresses must be ascertained from the sensor data. In addition to performing data smoothing of the sensor data, the present invention utilizes a transform algorithm to estimate the peak stresses from the sensor data.","As noted earlier, AGEMOD currently accepts a temperature history and uses a LVEM model to calculate stresses and then uses the stress to calculate damage. Advantageously, the present invention bypasses the LVEM model using the collected stress data directly in the damage calculation providing a more accurate assessment of damage based on real data for individual motors . Additionally, the data smoothing of the present invention provides a more efficient calculation.","Referring to , a flowchart illustrates data smoothing of stress data  according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The present invention can utilize three mechanisms of data smoothing. The sensor data is also processed through a transfer function to relate the sensor data to the peak stresses in the propellant. Accordingly, the present invention provides the three mechanisms of data smoothing and the transform function on raw stress sensor data. Additionally, the AGEMOD software has been modified to accept the smoothed stress data directly.","First, the data smoothing of stress data  first obtains a data set (step ). For example, the data set can be from one or more stress sensors  or the like. Additionally, the present invention contemplates other mechanisms for obtaining stress data. Once the data set is obtained, a transform algorithm is performed on the data set (step ). The transform algorithm relates measured stress values to peak stress values which may be incurred at locations different from the measurements. Next, the transformed data set is smoothed. The data smoothing of stress data  includes three mechanisms to reduce the size (i.e., \u201csmooth\u201d the data set). The three mechanisms include dropping data using a stress threshold (step ), dropping data by resample (or decimation) (step ), and smoothing by dynamic binning (step ). The data smoothing of stress data  can use one or more of these mechanisms. Further, these mechanisms can be applied in any order.","Referring to , graphs illustrate raw stress data and dropping the raw stress data based on a stress threshold  according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Here, the stress threshold  is applied to the raw stress data, and all data points below the stress threshold  are dropped. This concept leverages the phenomena that for composite propellants there is some minimal applied stress, \u03c3, at which little or no damage occurs, so stresses at or below this level can be considered negligible. This minimum stress threshold  is used to drop all data points with stress values below the threshold, from the data set. Additionally, the stress threshold  can be user configurable. Through experimentation, it was determined that to be effective in reducing the volume of stress data, the stress threshold  had to be considerable, but then the error introduced grew unacceptably large. However, the stress threshold  can be utilized with the other mechanisms to reduce the volume of stress data.","Referring to , a graph illustrates resampling (or decimating) raw stress data according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Here, a set frequency is utilized to delete data, i.e., dropping data by resample (or decimation) deletes data with the set frequency, (e.g., return every fourth observation) without regard to value. This result is the resample frequency which is adjustable (e.g., none deleted to one out of every two data points deleted).","Decimation or resample is another simple yet powerful technique to reduce the volume of data. Used alone, over the entire data set, this brute force mechanism can delete the few points that make up short time, high stress events. Used in that way also introduces unacceptably large errors. It does however make sense to use this technique selectively in the low stress regions. For example, decimation can be applied with a maximum stress threshold, where the raw stress data is decimated in just the low stress regions of choice preserving all of the original data in the high stress peaks. Specifically, decimation can be applied to user-defined valleys in the raw stress data.","Referring to , a graph  illustrates single-stage dynamic binning of raw stress data according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The smoothing process by dynamic binning can be controlled by three parameters. The first parameter includes a dynamic stress bin trigger, the value is the magnitude of change in stress that prompts a new bin. The other two parameters are the minimum and maximum allowable bin size. These two parameters allow a user greater control in obtaining the overall desired reduction in data volume while retaining the peak stress events.","Here, to test the robustness of the data reduction scheme, the dynamic binning was applied to exemplary raw stress gauge data  and the result is dynamic binning stress data . The raw stress gauge data  was collected based on four sensors embedded in a motor analogue and the raw stress gauge data  represents averaged data collected by all four sensors averaged. Each sensor collected temperature and stress profiles that lasted a set number of days. The first set of days of the profile includes post-manufacture curing, storage, and transport. Next, the motors went into a well controlled oven where the motors were cold cycled, seventeen times, followed by cold dwell. The dynamic binning stress data  shows a new bin for a predetermined change in stress. In a region  of low stress there are relatively few bins compared to a region  of high stress. The raw stress gauge data  includes over 15,000 data points while the dynamic binning stress data  includes less than fifty data points.","The present invention can utilize stress smoothing by binning with a constant interval and binning with a dynamic interval. In static binning (i.e., constant interval), the data assigned to the x-axis is divided into segments of equal size or bins. Then the y-axis data within each bin is averaged. For example, data could be reduced using this static binning process with a bin size over a number of days and the stress values within each bin averaged. This approach may reduce the original number of data points to just a few points, i.e. the damage is calculated solely from the average stress over the duration of the bin interval. For example, comparing the reduced data to original data in an exemplary operation shows that it does retain some of the contour expected to be important. For example, in the exemplary operation, it was determined that static binning introduced an error of 2.3%.","In an effort to improve the fidelity of the reduction process, dynamic binning may be used. In dynamic binning, the bin size is large in regions of low stress and small in the regions of high stress. The large bins produce a greater reduction of the data, while the small bins preserve the fidelity of the peak stresses. The bin definitions can be guided by the dynamics in the stress. A new bin can be defined each time the stress increased or decreased a predetermined amount of pounds per square inch, approximately. Advantageously, this mechanism can result in the same number of data points as the static binning but it retains more of the fidelity in the peak stress regions. It is also clear that the bins are larger in the low stress regions and smaller in the high stress peaks. For example, in the exemplary operation, it was determined that dynamic binning introduced an error of just 1.4%. Further, another exemplary operation with multiple sensors determined that dynamic binning introduced an error below 1%.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["60","62","64","66","68","68","64","66"]},"Referring to , a graph  illustrates dynamic binning applied to sensor data from thermal cycling the motor  of  according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.

In a region  of low stress there are relatively few bins compared to a region  of high stress. The raw stress gauge data  includes over 15,000 data points while the dynamic binning stress data  includes less than 50 data points. The difference in calculated damage between these two data sets is less than 1.5%.","Referring to , as illustrated in step  of , the embedded stress sensors require a transfer algorithm to estimate the stresses in the grain regions where they are highest, from the sensor data. There has been recent work by Little et al. (Final Report: KTA 4-29 MECHANICAL AGING OF SOLID ROCKET MOTORS; April 2006) to develop an algorithm that indicates the relation may be just a simple coefficient, determined from the ratio of the sensor stress to the peak stress, in the region desired. In the exemplary motors (e.g., ), the grain keyhole slot  tips are the location of the peak stresses, by design, while the sensors  are bonded to the case wall . Since the peak stresses in the motor are not directly measured, they can be estimated then using the LVEM model. Although this simple approach does not include the effect of prior loading on the current state of mechanical properties, it is computationally tractable and has proven reasonably accurate when used to model such motor tests.","Using the high stresses of each temperature cycle a set of transfer coefficients, i.e. the ratio of the model slot tip to case wall gage measured stress and an additive constant, can be calculated. The higher the coefficient, the greater the damage calculated. Transform coefficients depend on grain geometry; hence the values must be tailored to different motor designs.  illustrates end effects  and circumferential effects  of stress on a motor.  is a contour plot showing different stress levels  on the motor for the end effects  and the circumferential effects . From the geometry, a sensor to peak transform function can be developed, i.e. peak \u03c3\/\u03c3. For example, the Inventors have determined that for a typical motor such as the one illustrated in , a multiplicative factor is approximately 3. A constant i.e. shift constant, may be added after the gage stress is multiplied by this factor to account for end effects, if the sensor is not mounted at some longitudinal location where the peak stress occurs.","Referring to , a block diagram illustrates a server  for executing data smoothing according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The server  can be a digital computer that, in terms of hardware architecture, generally includes a processor , input\/output (I\/O) interfaces , network interfaces , memory , and a data store . The components (, , , , and ) are communicatively coupled via a local interface . The local interface  can be, for example but not limited to, one or more buses or other wired or wireless connections, as is known in the art. The local interface  can have additional elements, which are omitted for simplicity, such as controllers, buffers (caches), drivers, repeaters, and receivers, among many others, to enable communications. Further, the local interface  can include address, control, and\/or data connections to enable appropriate communications among the aforementioned components.","The processor  is a hardware device for executing software instructions. The processor  can be any custom made or commercially available processor, a central processing unit (CPU), an auxiliary processor among several processors associated with the server , a semiconductor-based microprocessor (in the form of a microchip or chip set), or generally any device for executing software instructions. When the server  is in operation, the processor  is configured to execute software stored within the memory , to communicate data to and from the memory , and to generally control operations of the server  pursuant to the software instructions.","The I\/O interfaces  can be used to receive user input from and\/or for providing system output to one or more devices or components. User input can be provided via, for example, a keyboard and\/or a mouse. System output can be provided via a display device and a printer (not shown). I\/O interfaces  can include, for example, a serial port, a parallel port, a small computer system interface (SCSI), an infrared (IR) interface, a radio frequency (RF) interface, and\/or a universal serial bus (USB) interface.","The network interfaces  can be used to enable the server  to communicate on a network, such as to a client or the like. The network interfaces  can include, for example, an Ethernet card (e.g., 10BaseT, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet) or a wireless local area network (WLAN) card (e.g., 902.11a\/b\/g\/n). The network interfaces  can include address, control, and\/or data connections to enable appropriate communications on the network.","A data store  can be used to store data, such as raw sensor data, smoothed sensor data, and the like. The data store  can include any of volatile memory elements (e.g., random access memory (RAM, such as DRAM, SRAM, SDRAM, and the like)), nonvolatile memory elements (e.g., ROM, hard drive, tape, CDROM, and the like), and combinations thereof. Moreover, the data store  can incorporate electronic, magnetic, optical, and\/or other types of storage media. In one example, the data store  can be located internal to the server  such as, for example, an internal hard drive connected to the local interface  in the server .","The memory  can include any of volatile memory elements (e.g., random access memory (RAM, such as DRAM, SRAM, SDRAM, etc.)), nonvolatile memory elements (e.g., ROM, hard drive, tape, CDROM, etc.), and combinations thereof. Moreover, the memory  may incorporate electronic, magnetic, optical, and\/or other types of storage media. Note that the memory  can have a distributed architecture, where various components are situated remotely from one another, but can be accessed by the processor .","The software in memory  can include one or more software programs, each of which includes an ordered listing of executable instructions for implementing logical functions. In the example of , the software in the memory system  includes a suitable operating system (O\/S)  and a smoother program . The operating system  essentially controls the execution of other computer programs, such as the smoother program , and provides scheduling, input-output control, file and data management, memory management, and communication control and related services. The operating system  can be any of Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista (all available from Microsoft, Corp. of Redmond, Wash.), Solaris (available from Sun Microsystems, Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif.), LINUX (or another UNIX variant) (available from Red Hat of Raleigh, N.C.), or the like.","The smoother program  includes computer executable code configured to perform a transform function and data smoothing on raw data according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. For example, the smoother program  can be configured to execute the data smoothing of stress data  in . The smoother program  can first perform the transform function. This operation can be controlled by two parameters, a shift constant added to stress values and a multiplicative factor as described above in .","As described herein, the stress threshold mechanism is inadequate by itself, but is available in the smoother program  as a brute force first-pass operation. This mechanism is controlled by the user with a single stress threshold value input. The decimation process is an available option controlled by a single stress threshold value and a frequency input. The threshold defines the maximum stress value decimation will be performed on. Decimation is therefore performed on all values below the threshold, but leaves the data above the threshold pristine. Again, the intention is to preserve the fidelity in the high stress events while accomplishing much of the reduction of data points in the low stress regions. Alai to this end, the dynamic binning is applied in two stages, the first stage is the low stress region and the second is a high stress region. The boundary between the stages is defined by a stress threshold below which is the first stage and above is the second stage. Each stage has a set of controlling parameters including a dynamic stress bin trigger value to create bins and a minimum and maximum limit on the bin sizes. The two stages and their separate controlling parameters allow a much greater density of bins above the threshold compared to below.","To operate the smoother program , a user can click a smoother icon and the program starts. A raw stress temperature data file can be loaded and this is accomplished by clicking a button named \u201cload file\u201d on the input page, browsing and selecting the desired file. All of the parameters can be set on the input page or the default values can be used without change. To execute the program, the button \u201crun\u201d must be clicked. To examine the results, the output tab must be clicked selecting the output page. This page displays the raw stress profile, the profile resulting from dynamic binning and the profile resulting from decimation and binning (if decimation is used). The resulting profiles can individually be downloaded to a file. The user can select either the export decimated or the export binned button to send that data set to a file. The user is prompted to provide a name for the file to be saved under.","The smoother program  can include interactive features that allow the user to change all of the controlling parameters; the stress threshold, the resample frequency, the resample threshold, the first and second stage dynamic stress bin trigger, minimum and maximum bin size and the stage threshold The feature that enables adjusting of these parameters consists of a combination numeric input and up and down arrows. The smoother program  can retain the last value of each parameter used as the default for the next time the smoother program  is used.","An output of the smoother program  includes a reduced data set. Additionally, the existing AGEMOD program has been modified for the direct input of this reduced data set. These modifications include a new input file format to AGEMOD, calculating the damage directly from stress measured by the sensor, and checking the process by comparison to the results obtained from the original temperature based routine. Accordingly, this modified AGEMOD code can be run with either temperature or stress as the input.","Alternatively, the smoother program  can include a single package that performs all tasks automatically. For example, here the smoother program  can automatically read a file, smooth the data, calculate damage for the raw and smoothed data, calculate the error, adjust the smoothing parameters to minimize the error and repeat the process until the error is smaller than some acceptable threshold. For example, the smoother program  could be part of a \u201cmissile readiness\u201d on-board system. Like a car dashboard, there will be a green light for when the missile is good and when this software calculates unacceptable damage a red light will indicate the missile is no good.","Advantageously, the smoother program  provides an enormous reduction in time\/labor. As a practical matter, the automation of the data smoothing through the smoother program  has made feasible the individual evaluation of rocket motors fitted with stress sensors and data loggers. As currently envisioned there will be multiple stress sensors embedded in each rocket motor and each sensor would be queried multiple times per day. Each sensor would create a stress profile and that eventually may include twenty or more years of the motor's history. Each of the data files includes tens of thousands of data points that may need to be evaluated for that motor's individual service life evaluation. Prior to the smoother program , the capability to handle such numerous and large data files did not exist. These individual service life predictions eliminate a considerable amount of waste associated with the generic service life predictions.","Although the present invention has been illustrated and described herein with reference to exemplary embodiments and specific examples thereof, it will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that other embodiments and examples may perform similar functions and\/or achieve like results. All such equivalent embodiments and examples are within the spirit and scope of the present invention and are intended to be covered by the following claims.","Finally, any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations (for example, by using the term \u201cabout\u201d) that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention is illustrated and described herein with reference to the various drawings, in which like reference numbers denote like method steps and\/or system components, respectively, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 9"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
