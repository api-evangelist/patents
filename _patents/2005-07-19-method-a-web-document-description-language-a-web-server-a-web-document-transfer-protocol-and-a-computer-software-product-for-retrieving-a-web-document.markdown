{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to a method for retrieving a web document. More particularly, the present invention relates to a web document description language, a web server, a web document transfer protocol and a computer software product.","The invention is based on a priority application, EP 04291846.6, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","The Internet comprises mainly web servers and clients. A web server is a computer that delivers (serves up) hyper text mark-up language (HTML) pages. Every web server has an internet protocol (IP) address and possibly a domain name. If a client requests a resource via a uniform resource locator\/identifier (URL\/URI) a request is sent to a server corresponding to the URL\/URI.","A web document is a representation of information in a description language like HTML, or XHTML, that is dedicated to be transferable (according to a certain protocol) from a server to a client and that (the information) could be rendered, i.e. presented, at the client.","Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is the underlying protocol used by the server and the client. HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions a web server and client should take in response to various commands. For example, when requesting a URL in at a client, this actually sends an HTTP command to the web server directing it to fetch and transmit the requested page.","The other main standard that controls how the world wide web works is hyper text markup language (HTML), which governs how web pages are formatted and displayed.","HTTP is called a stateless protocol because each command is executed independently, without any knowledge of the commands that came before it. This is the main reason that it is difficult to implement web sites that react intelligently.","HTML and HTTP are specified by the world wide web consortium.","The current set of common methods for HTTP is GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE and CONNECT. The GET method retrieves whatever information (in the form of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be returned as the entity in the response and not the source text of the process, unless that text happens to be the output of the process.","The semantics of the GET method can change to a \u201cconditional GET\u201d if the request message includes an If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-Range header field. A conditional GET method requests that the entity be transferred only under the circumstances described by the conditional header field(s). The conditional GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary network usage by allowing cached entities to be refreshed without requiring multiple requests or transferring data already held by the client.","The semantics of the GET method change to a \u201cpartial GET\u201d if the request message includes a range header field. A partial GET requests that only part of the entity be transferred. The partial GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary network usage by allowing partially-retrieved entities to be completed without transferring data already held by the client.","All HTTP entities are represented in HTTP messages as sequences of bytes and the concept of a byte range is meaningful for any HTTP entity used for partial GET method. A byte range operation may specify a single range of bytes, or a set of ranges within a single entity.","In order to realize (dynamic) reactive or interactive web sites other technologies have to be involved. The form technique for client server interaction is for example enhanced by a simple object application protocol integration in Xforms. There are certain web server enhancements like application servers that generate dynamical web pages or web servers that are enabled to execute servelets, e.g. Tomcat, active server pages, or script languages like Java script or PHP.","Current internet transfer protocols are neither suited to exchange nor to interact on a semantical (content based) level. They mainly support navigation by hyper-linking and transferring information based on address, like URIs, i.e. a referential interaction.","The process of retrieval is usually separated into a page providing means like forms to formulate a request that is forcing a query in some foreign presentation, e.g. a database, generating from the query result a new page and delivering the new page to the requesting party.","Current developments like Xcerpt, which is a declarative, rule-based query and transformation language for XML, inspired by logic programming, fail to embed or integrate similarly presented information. (Instead of the path-based navigational approach taken by languages like XSLT and XQuery, Xcerpt uses pattern-based, positional queries, where a pattern is an \u201cexample\u201d of the database containing variables for binding content.)","When seeking for special content search engines have to aggregate published content to make them indexed accessible, e.g. via pattern matching search or e.g. a Boolean query on a database. Internet search engines usually are powerful clusters of computers with huge databases storing indexed web content, continuously scanning and\/or referring links per keyword or search expression.","The problem to be targeted by this invention is to enhance the retrieval capabilities of a network like the Internet and to enhance cohesion of relating web documents by replacing the straightforward (referential) approach that is currently followed (i.e. instead of providing a manifold of search engines assembling summary information, providing automatically summarizing self-organizing web documents).","Currently it is not possible to ask a server whether the server provides a page satisfying a certain property. Such a property might be for instance a unification condition.","Unification informally is a generalization of pattern matching that is the logic programming equivalent of instantiation in logic. When two terms, e.g. web documents, are to be unified, they are compared with each other in order to identify information for adapting them to be similar. Variable parts, e.g. a place holder or a wild card, are bound or instantiated that the both documents are similar. This concept could for instance be realized with Robinson's algorithm. The result of unification is either failure or success with a set of variable bindings, known as a \u201cunifier\u201d. There may be many such unifiers for any pair of terms. An overview about the theory of unification is provided by Baader and Snyder in their Chapter on Unification Theory in \u201cThe Handbook of Automated Reasoning\u201d, Elsevier Science Publishers, 1999.","The retrieval capabilities are enhanced, i.e. the problem is solved by a method for retrieving a web document provided by a web server, where the method comprising the following steps\n\n","When using unification within the analyzing the resulting web document might contain variables. Furthermore it should be noted that the information exchange is no more directed as in the former client server method, i.e. the bindings could be propagated from requesting site to serving site and vice versa.","The problem is solved inter alia by a web document description language comprising expression means for publishing information for distribution and for retrieving interactive information, further comprising expression means for actively requesting a web document analysis according to inspection requirements and expression means for integrating an analyzing result.","And the problem is solved by a web document transfer protocol comprising the steps of\n\n","The problem is solved inter alia by a web server comprising receiving means for receiving a web document request, retrieval means for retrieving a web document, and replying means for replying the web document, the web server further comprising inspection means for analyzing the content of the web document according to inspection requirements, and the replying means being adapted to reply an analyzing result.","In other words: Add an application programming interface for analyses with respect to syntactic terms to web documents, where the web documents comprise placeholders (variables), suited to embed analysis results. Preferably this analysis is unification based. That could be a syntactic unification of web documents with variables, a matching mechanism, i.e. a restrictive unification, or even a unification modulo a certain theory, a so called semantic unification, a unification with or without constraints, an analysis with respect to any congruence relation instead of equality, etc.","Formally a unification problem is abstractly treated as a set of relating (hypermedia) objects O, . . . , On comprising variables X, . . . , Xm with respect to relations R, . . . Rk, e.g.\n\nO1(X1,X2) R1 O2(X2,X3)\n\nO2(X2,X3) R2 O3(X4)\n\nO1(X1,X2) R1 O3(X4)\n","A solution is a variable binding i.e. a mapping X->S, X->S, X->S, and X->S such that\n\nO1(S1,S2) R1 O2(X2,X3)\n\nO2(S2,S3) R2 O3(S4)\n\nO1(S1,S2) R1 O3(S4)\n\napplies. In words that the placeholders are substituted (instantiated) by substitutes (real objects) that fulfill the constraint, i.e. such that the objects are in relation.\n","Accordingly, it is an object and advantage of the present invention to provide dynamic web document resources with interfaces that allow content and structure based information access and exchange.","Another advantage of the present invention is that it generalizes the well known request reply interaction metaphor of web documents. The invention generalizes the current servers and clients, e.g. browsers. The concept is easy to understand and easy to deploy. It enhances information retrieval and consistency, hence large deployment expected. There are efficient unification algorithms available that might be applicable for this purpose.","A further advantage of the present invention is that it reduces memory and processing requirements especially for search engines due to the distribution of the analysis complexity (natural distribution, load balancing). When applying unification the analysis even becomes associative and commutative which has the advantage of a high degree of freedom for the distribution of the unification (analyzing); i.e. associativity and commutativity of unification supports parallel distributed processing\n\nunify(, unify())=unify(unify(),)\n\nunify()=unify().\n\nAnd the invention supports future \u201cWEB-centric\u201d applications like the semantic web heavily depending on content (information) exchange.\n","Those of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the following description of the present invention is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. Other embodiments of the invention will readily suggest themselves to such skilled persons from an examination of the within disclosure.","Web content unification (information adaptation) will play a central role in intelligent multimedia collaboration and communication. Especially access and retrieval of multimedia information within a browser need to be enhanced. Pure address based access is not suitable. Neither ontology and hierarchies nor search engines are suited to handle information presentation and retrieval within networks apropriately.","Currently there are a bunch of search engines and access methods for multimedia information, e.g. Netscape's funnel, google, personalized portals, uniform resource (locators) identifiers, hierarchical or relational organizations of information, etc. The basic information exchange is syntactic pattern matching using an interview. This is inefficient and hides information (e.g. shapes or contexts) within an interview process.","Therefore it is suggested to enhance web document access for queries with syntactic terms comprising variables, suited for unification and perform a matching or even a unification as a retrieval mechanism at a web server.","The current HTML documents provide hyper reference concepts for fetching a document as a whole. This is disadvantageous concerning e.g. search engine applications or semantic networks. The current trend to overcome this lack of information retrieval is to collect, analyze, compute, and store (index) web pages by robots and the like.","Currently, as shown in , a client C, usually a web browser, requests (1) req using a resource identifier ID like a URI a web document D from a server S. The server S retrieves (2) ret in a second step the requested document D and replies (3) rep with the document D or more precisely with a description of the document, e.g. HTTP, according to a certain transfer protocol, e.g. http, to the client C. The client C presents (4) pre this document D.","HTML\/http technique allows to request and transfer complete web documents (or partial prefixes). Applying this technique is well known e.g. by search engines collecting continuously (or storing simply a dictionary of) web page information, i.e. web documents, and aggregating the information for textual retrievals.","In the following the Java application programming interfaces for certain classes are used to explain the invention.","An instance of the class HttpURLConnection is used to make a single request but the underlying network connection to a HTTP.

string is realized by setOuterHTML(Element elem, String htmlText).","What this implementation explicitly shows is that it lacks to support any scanning for document for contents: The invention provides an enhanced document (search result document and searched document) interaction capability by an information retrieval API. Such an API might be at first glance a syntactic match, e.g.\n\npublic boolean matches(DocumentExpression regex)\n\ntelling whether or not \u201cthis\u201d (the web document object itself) matches the given regular document expression. An invocation of this might yield exactly true if, and only if, this (document) matches the given regular expression.\n","Alternatively it might even unify semantically or structurally both documents with a side effect of instantiating variables within this document.","The method could be associated e.g. to the HTMLdocument class. As a result the objects, i.e. the documents could gradually exchange information via the suggested interaction method, namely a unification, a constrained unification or an generalized unification where the equality is a specified equivalence relation. A comfortable interface might be\n\nunifyElements(VariableHTMLdocument htmlExpression, Constraints constraints, Relation relation)\n\nthat returns a unifier, i.e. a substitution of elements binding the free variables in the htmlExpression, such that the HTMLdocument and the htmlExpression where the variables are substituted are in relation under the constraints.\n","The collaboration enabled by this enhancement is shown in . A client C requests (1) req in a first step a unifier (or a matcher of a web document) specified by a resource identifier ID and a unification problem RE like the above parameters. The server S then has to evaluate, i.e. to carry out a corresponding reply. It has to analyze, retrieve and compute (2) anl\/ret the requested unifier in a second step. After that the server S should communicate (3) rep the result web document D with the information binding BI, which is in case of unification a unifier. The client C could the receive this information and embed it (4) emb\/pre in a further step into an already loaded web document, or simply present it.","The generalization of requests in combination with the analysis and inspection methods at a server allows queries with wild cards. Such a retrieval (also a unification problem) might for instance be: \u201cdear telco-vendor server could you please provide me all the page bodies of your pages containing the word \u201cproduct\u201d and \u201cmobile\u201d having also a link to a product sheet pdf.\u201d The tricky effect is that expressions containing all correspond simply to variables, type and structure information like product, mobile or .pdf are handled by unification separating valid pages from a defined set of all pages defined by an expression defining a set of pages, i.e. the ones that are located at a telco-vendor server. Even the server address could be unified applying this concept.","A distributor might use this automatically collected information for providing a page with an aggregation of the information\u2014without inter-linking the sites and taking care about referential (link) integrity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},"The figure and the scenario illustrate that such enhanced web documents seems to be morphing entities. They seem to live and alter as soon as the result of foreign embedded unifying web documents alter. The example also shows that the load is distributed through the whole network. And the example teaches that a server can act as a client in a canonical way.","In summary the retrieval of information is enhanced by accessing a web document via an inspection mechanism informing the retriever about the content (semantics).","Abstracting the example from the client server implementation and focussing on the web documents and transfer protocol leads to . There, a web document D is shown having an embedded web document D\u2032, itself having an embedded document D\u2033, recursively. The description of document D contains a unification request that is assumed to lead to a corresponding unifier binding BI by inspecting ins a foreign document D\u2032 and integrating or embedding emb the result of the inspection, e.g. the aforementioned unifier. The foreign document D\u2032 might itself contain a unification request that is assumed to lead to a corresponding unifier binding BI\u2032. And, recursively it leads to a corresponding unifier binding BI by inspecting ins\u2032 a further foreign document D\u2033 and embedding emb\u2032 the result of the inspection. In order to avoid infinite cyclic relationships the protocol might not allow to involve an already involved document.","Although illustrative presently preferred embodiments and applications of this invention are shown and described herein, many variations and modifications are possible which remain within the concept, scope, and spirit of the invention, and these variations would become clear to those of skill in the art after perusal of this application.","For instance the retrieval process could be arranged so that the final unifier, i.e. the catenation of all intermediate unifiers could be carried out at the initial request originator.","As a unification mechanism e.g. syntactical unification might be applicable with e.g. Martelli, Montanari algorithm although a lazy form of unification e.g. variable matching, weak unification, plain pattern matching, e.g. with the algorithm of Knuth, Morris, and Pratt might be feasible.","There are fast recombination mechanisms for terms with variables known, e.g. the union find algorithm that could be applied for concatenation and for rendering a presentation of an aggregated web document. It should be noted that all techniques applicable to terms apply also to web documents, since these are merely presented as a (labeled) tree, i.e. a term. Thus concepts like sub-term, substitution, unification, rewriting etc. apply straight forward. In case of ambiguous unification results a corresponding iterator could provide all results.","In order to teach the connection between a web document and a representing term the following HTML 4.01 (see e.g. HTML 4.0 W3C Specification) example is given. Similar techniques apply to any structured markup like document presentation languages, e.g. XHTMS, SGML, XML, etc.","An HTML document is usually composed of three parts: a line containing version information, a declarative header section (delimited by the HEAD element), and a body, which contains the document's actual content.

Logic and therefore Prolog is based on the mathematical notions of relations and logical inference. Prolog is a declarative language meaning that rather than describing how to compute a solution, a program consists of a base of facts and logical relationships (rules) which describe the relationships which hold for the given application. Rather then running a program to obtain a solution, the user asks a question. When asked a question, the run time system searches through the data base of facts and rules to determine (by logical deduction) the answer.","Among the features of Prolog are logical variables meaning that they behave like mathematical variables, a powerful pattern-matching facility (unification), a backtracking strategy to search for proofs, uniform data structures, and input and output are interchangeable.","Often there will be more than one way to deduce the answer or there will be more than one solution, in such cases the run time system may be asked to find other solutions (e.g. by back-tracing or providing alternatives in parallel).","In other words: the invention is to equip the web of documents with an inference mechanism allowing to exchange syntactically specified parts of said documents.
