{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["Because of their relatively small size and form, mobile electronic devices such as smart phones, personal navigation devices (PNDs), personal digital assistants (PDAs), and so forth, offer several practical advantages with respect to providing maps and map-related content to a user. For example, because of their small form and consequent portability, mobile electronic devices are capable of providing real-time navigational instructions to users in a convenient fashion, while the users are in route to a destination.","Mobile electronic devices may be used to enhance a wide variety of fitness and sporting activities. Cycle computers and sport watches are examples of mobile electronic devices that are used by cyclists and runners to measure performance data and to provide information that is useful to the cyclist or runner. Cycle computers and sport watches commonly measure speed, distance traveled, cadence, heart rate, calories burned, and so forth, and display this data to their users. Increasingly, these devices are being equipped with global positioning system (GPS) receivers to provide position determining functionality. This functionality allows the devices to furnish navigation information to the cyclists and runners who use them.","Techniques are described that may be implemented in a mobile electronic device providing navigation functionality to facilitate the selection of a route to a destination from multiple route options. In one or more implementations, route selection information is displayed on a display of the mobile electronic device to facilitate selection of a route to a destination. The route selection information describes one or more routes to the destination and includes one or more metrics, associated with each route, identifying a characteristic of the route (e.g., a difficulty rating, topography, total climb distance, number of turns, and so on). A map may then be displayed on the display to furnish navigation information for the selected route to facilitate navigation to the destination.","This Summary is provided solely to introduce subject matter that is fully described in the Detailed Description and Drawings. Accordingly, the Summary should not be considered to describe essential features nor be used to determine scope of the claims.","Overview","Mobile electronic devices commonly used in fitness and sporting activities include cycle computers, sport watches, golf computers, smart phones providing fitness or sporting applications (apps), hand-held GPS devices, and so forth. These devices may be equipped to provide position determining functionality, allowing the devices to furnish navigation information to their users. For example, a cycle computer equipped with a GPS receiver may be configured to furnish turn by turn directions for routing a cyclist to a desired destination. Typically, mobile electronic devices equipped to provide navigation functionality automatically select the shortest or fastest route to the destination without user intervention. Other mobile electronic devices may allow for route planning. However, these devices typically must be coupled to a computer such as a desktop or laptop computer so that the route may be planned using software loaded onto the computer and downloaded to the device.","Exercisers engaged in fitness and sporting activities often wish to explore multiple routes to a common destination. The selection of alternative routes may provide new and interesting experiences for the user. For example, a jogger may intentionally run a different route on Tuesday than on Monday. Moreover, some routes may offer a greater or lesser physical challenge to the user than the most direct or fastest route. For example, a cyclist who bikes to work each day via the same route may want to explore alternative routes to explore new areas of his or her locale, or to increase the physical challenge experienced.","Accordingly, techniques are described that may be implemented in a mobile electronic device equipped to provide navigation functionality to facilitate the selection of a route to a destination from multiple route options. The route selection techniques described are well suited for use by mobile electronic devices configured for use during fitness and\/or sporting activities such as cycle computers, sport watches, golf computers, smart phones providing fitness or sporting applications (apps), hand-held GPS devices, and so forth. However, it is nevertheless contemplated that the techniques may be implemented in any mobile electronic device that includes navigation functionality.","In one or more implementations, the techniques may be implemented as one or more software modules stored in the memory of the device and executed by the processing system of the device. As described herein, the processing system may execute the module(s) to generate one or more routes to a destination from a determined geographic position using map data stored in memory of the device. Each of the one or more routes includes a metric describing a characteristic of the route, such as a difficulty rating, topographic information (e.g., an elevation profile for the route), total climb distance, number of turns, and so on. Route selection information is then displayed on a display of the mobile electronic device to allow a user of the device to select a desired route from the generated routes. In implementations, the route selection information includes a graphical display of the routes and the metric associated with each route (e.g., a graphical display of topographic information describing the elevation profile of the route). A route may then be selected from the one or more routes available via an input by the user to an input device (e.g., touchscreen, input buttons, etc.) of the mobile electronic device. A map may then be displayed on the display to furnish navigation information for the selected route to facilitate navigation to the destination.","The techniques described herein thus allow the user of the mobile electronic device to select a route, which may not be the shortest or fastest route to the destination, based upon a variety of criteria. Thus, the user may explore multiple routes to a common destination. Routes that offer greater or lesser physical challenge may be selected depending on the goals of the user. For instance, the user may select a route that is more time efficient (e.g., has a lesser number of turns, includes paved terrain, has a lower climb distance, etc.) when traveling to work, and may select a workout-centric route (e.g., a greater number of turns, a gravel terrain, a higher climb distance, etc.) when traveling home from work. Other examples are possible.","In the following discussion, an example mobile electronic device environment is first described. Exemplary procedures are then described that may be employed with the example environment, as well as with other environments and devices without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.","Example Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","102","102","102","102","102","102","102"]},"In , the mobile electronic device  is illustrated as including a processor  and a memory . The processor  provides processing functionality for the mobile electronic device  and may include any number of processors, micro-controllers, or other processing systems, and resident or external memory for storing data and other information accessed or generated by the mobile electronic device . The processor  may execute one or more software programs that implement the techniques and modules described herein. The processor  is not limited by the materials from which it is formed or the processing mechanisms employed therein and, as such, may be implemented via semiconductor(s) and\/or transistors (e.g., electronic integrated circuits (ICs)), and so forth.","The memory  is an example of device-readable storage media that provides storage functionality to store various data associated with the operation of the mobile electronic device , such as the software program and code segments mentioned above, or other data to instruct the processor  and other elements of the mobile electronic device  to perform the techniques described herein. Although a single memory  is shown, a wide variety of types and combinations of memory may be employed. The memory  may be integral with the processor , stand-alone memory, or a combination of both. The memory may include, for example, removable and non-removable memory elements such as RAM, ROM, Flash (e.g., SD Card, mini-SD card, micro-SD Card), magnetic, optical, USB memory devices, and so forth.","The mobile electronic device  is further illustrated as including functionality to determine position. For example, mobile electronic device  may receive signal data  transmitted by one or more position data platforms and\/or position data transmitters, examples of which are depicted as the GPS satellites . More particularly, mobile electronic device  may include a position-determining module  that may manage and process signal data  received from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites  via a GPS receiver . The position-determining module  is representative of functionality operable to determine a geographic position through processing of the received signal data . The signal data  may include various data suitable for use in position determination, such as timing signals, ranging signals, ephemerides, almanacs, and so forth.","Position-determining module  may also be configured to provide a variety of other position-determining functionality. Position-determining functionality, for purposes of discussion herein, may relate to a variety of different navigation techniques and other techniques that may be supported by \u201cknowing\u201d one or more positions. For instance, position-determining functionality may be employed to provide position\/location information, timing information, speed information, and a variety of other navigation-related data. Accordingly, the position-determining module  may be configured in a variety of ways to perform a wide variety of functions. For example, the position-determining module  may be configured for outdoor navigation, vehicle navigation, aerial navigation (e.g., for airplanes, helicopters), marine navigation, personal use (e.g., as a part of fitness-related equipment), and so forth. Accordingly, the position-determining module  may include a variety of devices to determine position using one or more of the techniques previously described.","The position-determining module , for instance, may use signal data  received via the GPS receiver  in combination with map data  that is stored in the memory  to generate navigation instructions (e.g., turn-by-turn instructions to an input destination or POI), show a current position on a map, and so on. Position-determining module  may include one or more antennas to receive signal data  as well as to perform other communications, such as communication via one or more networks  described in more detail below. The position-determining module  may also provide other position-determining functionality, such as to determine an average speed, calculate an arrival time, and so on.","Although a GPS system is described and illustrated in relation to , it should be apparent that a wide variety of other positioning systems may also be employed, such as other global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), terrestrial based systems (e.g., wireless-phone based systems that broadcast position data from cellular towers), wireless networks that transmit positioning signals, and so on. For example, positioning-determining functionality may be implemented through the use of a server in a server-based architecture, from a ground-based infrastructure, through one or more sensors (e.g., gyros, odometers, and magnetometers), use of \u201cdead reckoning\u201d techniques, and so on.","The mobile electronic device  includes a display  to display information to a user of the mobile electronic device . In embodiments, the display  may comprise an LCD (Liquid Crystal Diode) display, a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) LCD display, an LEP (Light Emitting Polymer) or PLED (Polymer Light Emitting Diode) display, and so forth, configured to display text and\/or graphical information such as a graphical user interface. The display  may be backlit via a backlight such that it may be viewed in the dark or other low-light environments.","The display  may be provided with a touch screen  to receive input (e.g., data, commands, etc.) from a user. For example, a user may operate the mobile electronic device  by touching the touch screen  and\/or by performing gestures on the screen . In some embodiments, the touch screen  may be a capacitive touch screen, a resistive touch screen, an infrared touch screen, combinations thereof, and the like. The mobile electronic device  may further include one or more input\/output (I\/O) devices  (e.g., a keypad, buttons, a wireless input device, a thumbwheel input device, a trackstick input device, and so on). The I\/O devices  may include one or more audio I\/O devices, such as a microphone, speakers, and so on.","The mobile electronic device  may also include a communication module  representative of communication functionality to permit mobile electronic device  to send\/receive data between different devices (e.g., components\/peripherals) and\/or over the one or more networks . Communication module  may be representative of a variety of communication components and functionality including, but not limited to: one or more antennas; a browser; a transmitter and\/or receiver; a wireless radio; data ports; software interfaces and drivers; networking interfaces; data processing components; and so forth.","The one or more networks  are representative of a variety of different communication pathways and network connections which may be employed, individually or in combinations, to communicate among the components of the environment . Thus, the one or more networks  may be representative of communication pathways achieved using a single network or multiple networks. Further, the one or more networks  are representative of a variety of different types of networks and connections that are contemplated including, but not limited to: the Internet; an intranet; a satellite network; a cellular network; a mobile data network; wired and\/or wireless connections; and so forth.","Examples of wireless networks include, but are not limited to: networks configured for communications according to: one or more standard of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), such as 802.11 or 802.16 (Wi-Max) standards; Wi-Fi standards promulgated by the Wi-Fi Alliance; Bluetooth standards promulgated by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group; and so on. Wired communications are also contemplated such as through universal serial bus (USB), Ethernet, serial connections, and so forth.","The mobile electronic device  through functionality represented by the communication module  may be configured to communicate via one or more networks  with a cellular provider  and an Internet provider  to receive mobile phone service  and various content , respectively. Content  may represent a variety of different content, examples of which include, but are not limited to: map data, which may include route information; web pages; services; music; photographs; video; email service; instant messaging; device drivers; real-time and\/or historical weather data; instruction updates; and so forth.","The mobile electronic device  is illustrated as including a user interface , which is storable in memory  and executable by the processor . The user interface  is representative of functionality to control the display of information and data to the user of the mobile electronic device  via the display . In some implementations, the display  may not be integrated into the mobile electronic device and may instead be connected externally using universal serial bus (USB), Ethernet, serial connections, and so forth. The user interface  may provide functionality to allow the user to interact with one or more applications  of the mobile electronic device  by providing inputs via the touch screen  and\/or the I\/O devices . For example, the user interface  may cause an application programming interface (API) to be generated to expose functionality to an application  to configure the application for display by the display  or in combination with another display. In embodiments, the API may further expose functionality to configure the application  to allow the user to interact with an application by providing inputs via the touch screen  and\/or the I\/O devices .","Applications  may comprise software, which is storable in memory  and executable by the processor , to perform a specific operation or group of operations to furnish functionality to the mobile electronic device . Example applications may include fitness application, exercise applications, health applications, diet applications, cellular telephone applications, instant messaging applications, email applications, photograph sharing applications, calendar applications, address book applications, and so forth.","In implementations, the user interface  may include a browser . The browser  enables the mobile electronic device  to display and interact with content  such as a webpage within the World Wide Web, a webpage provided by a web server in a private network, and so forth. The browser  may be configured in a variety of ways. For example, the browser  may be configured as an application  accessed by the user interface . The browser  may be a web browser suitable for use by a full resource device with substantial memory and processor resources (e.g., a smart phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), etc.). However, in one or more implementations, the browser  may be a mobile browser suitable for use by a low-resource device with limited memory and\/or processing resources (e.g., a mobile telephone, a portable music device, a transportable entertainment device, etc.). Such mobile browsers typically conserve memory and processor resources, but may offer fewer browser functions than web browsers.","The mobile electronic device  is illustrated as including a navigation module , which is storable in memory  and executable by the processor . The navigation module  represents functionality to access map data  that is stored in the memory  to provide mapping and navigation functionality to the user of the mobile electronic device . For example, the navigation module  may generate navigation information that includes maps and\/or map-related content for display by display . As used herein, map related content includes information associated with maps generated by the navigation module  and may include route information, POIs, information associated with POIs, map legends, controls for manipulation of a map (e.g., scroll, pan, etc.), street views, aerial\/satellite views, and the like, displayed on or as a supplement to one or more maps.","In one or more implementations, the navigation module  is configured to utilize the map data  to generate navigation information  that includes maps and\/or map-related content for display by the mobile electronic device  independently of content sources external to the mobile electronic device . Thus, for example, the navigation module  may be capable of providing mapping and navigation functionality when access to external content  is not available through network . It is contemplated; however, that the navigation module  may also be capable of accessing a variety of content  via the network  to generate navigation information including maps and\/or map-related content for display by the mobile electronic device  in one or more implementations.","The navigation module  may be configured in a variety of ways. For example, the navigation module  may be configured as an application  accessed by the user interface . The navigation module  may utilize position data determined by the position-determining module  to show a current position of the user (e.g., the mobile electronic device ) on a displayed map, furnish navigation instructions (e.g., turn-by-turn instructions to an input destination or POI), calculate traveling distances and times, and so on.","As illustrated in , the navigation module  further includes a route selection module , which is also storable in memory  and executable by the processor . The route selection module  causes the display  of the mobile electronic device  to be configured to display route selection information . In the implementation shown, the route selection information  is illustrated in the format of a map page  that includes a route graphic  representing a route that may be traversed by a user of the mobile electronic device  (e.g., by the user, by a vehicle (e.g., a bicycle) operated by the user in or on which the mobile electronic device  is mounted or carried or some combination thereof). The route describes a path that the user may traverse from a starting point to a destination. In an implementation, the starting point may be a geographic position determined by the position-determining module  of the device , such as the current geographic location of the device . However, the starting point may also be manually designated by the user through the user interface . As discussed herein below, the route selection module  further includes functionality to cause the display  to, sequentially or simultaneously, display additional route graphics  for one or more alternate routes (e.g., a second route, a third route, and so forth) that may also be traversed by the user to the same destination point. The route represented by each route graphic  can comprise, without limitation, any navigable path, trail, road, lane, street, pike, highway, tollway, freeway, interstate highway, sidewalk, combinations thereof, or the like, that may be traversed by a user of the mobile electronic device .","The route selection module  may include functionality (or may invoke functionality provided by the navigation module ) to generate one or more routes to a destination from a starting point. These routes may, for example, be generated using map data  stored in memory  of the device . For instance, utilizing the A* search algorithm, or other path-finding and graph traversal algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, the route selection module  may identify a plurality of routes from the starting point to the destination. In some implementations, the map data  may include a plurality of node segments (e.g., path segments) which may be costed using various factors like speed, distance, time, elevation, difficulty, and the like, to compute the plurality of routes using A* and\/or other path-finding algorithms. Thus, for instance, the route selection module  may generate three routes having the three shortest distances between the starting point and the destination, generate two routes having the easiest and hardest difficulty between the starting point and the destination, generate multiple routes having minimal, maximum, and average elevation changes between the starting point and the destination, generate all possible routes that may be traversed within a given time period such as within 10, 15, 30, 60 minutes of the shortest route, combinations thereof, and the like. As discussed in more detail below, the user may provide input to control how the route selection module  performs costing to tailor the generated routes to specific user needs.","In at least some instances, the starting point may be the current geographic position of the mobile electronic device  determined by the position determining module . However, it is contemplated that the starting point may be input by the user of the mobile electronic device via the display  and touch screen  and\/or I\/O devices . Similarly, the destination may be entered or selected by the user of the mobile electronic device . The destination may be entered as latitude\/longitude information associated with a location, an address, a POI, a user-selected point (e.g., user selects a desired destination point via the touch screen ) on a map displayed by the display , a destination selected from content  received via the communication module  and\/or stored in memory  by the mobile electronic device  (e.g., a webpage, an email, a text message, a photograph, etc.), and so on.","In some configurations, the route selection module  may select possible routes using historical route information stored within a local route database on the device  and\/or accessible through a remote route database using the communication module . The route database(s) may include a plurality of previously-traversed routes that may be searched, indexed, compiled, analyzed, or otherwise selected for travel by the user. Based on the current position, or another designated starting point, the route selection module  may identify stored routes that include or otherwise relate to the designated starting point. These corresponding stored routes may be presented to the user, in addition to or as an alternative to the calculated routes discussed above, for review and selection. For example, the corresponding routes accessed from the route database may include a difficult route starting at the current location, a short route ending at the current location, a long route including the current location, a scenic route including a user designated location, a composite route generated from one or more stored routes corresponding to the current location, combinations thereof, and the like. The presentation of the stored routes may include community data such as user comments regarding the stored routes, user ratings, etc.","The route selection information  may be displayed in a variety of ways. For instance, in the example implementation illustrated in , the route selection information  is displayed on a common map page  in an overlay configuration. As shown, multiple route graphics  representing alternate routes to the destination are simultaneously overlaid together on the map page . The route graphics  may be identified by providing indicia that distinguish each route graphic  from the other route graphics  displayed (e.g., a first route graphic  is identified with a first indicia (a solid line), a second route graphic  is identified with a second indicia (a dashed line), a third route graphic  is identified with a third indicia (a dotted line), and so forth). It is contemplated that a variety of indicia (other than line type) may be employed to distinguish the different routes. For example, the different route graphics  may have different hues (e.g., colors), line weights, symbols, or the like to distinguish them from other route graphics . Where routes overlap, the indicia of the route graphics  may be combined, or the indicia of one route graphic  may be displayed over the other route graphics (e.g., the most direct route, the fastest route, and so on may be displayed). It is contemplated, that the specific indicia used (e.g., hues (colors), text, line types and weights, shading, etc.) may be selected to match or coordinate with display characteristics of the user interface  of the mobile electronic device .","In another example implementation, illustrated in , the route selection information  is displayed using scrollable, sequential, or otherwise discrete map pages . In this implementation, each route graphic  may be displayed in a separate instance of the map page . The various instances of the map page  may then be scrolled onto and off of the display  to facilitate selection of a desired route by the user. For example, as shown, a first route graphic  may be displayed in a first instance of the map page , a second route graphic  may be displayed in a second instance of the map page , a third route graphic  may be displayed in a third instance of the map page , a fourth route graphic  may be displayed in a fourth instance of the map page , and so forth. The user may provide a gesture to the touch screen  (e.g., swiping a finger across the touch screen  (a \u201cflick\u201d) to scroll through the map pages  to review the different routes provided by the route selection module . For example, the user gestures across the touch screen  to move from a first map page , which displays a first route graphic , to a second map page , which displays a second route graphic , and so forth. Of course, the various instances of the map pages  may be accessed through methods other than, or in addition to, scrolling or touch scrolling. For example, the instances of the map page  may be accessed using any portions of the user interface  and\/or through utilization of the I\/O devices .","The route selection module  may be configured to determine one or more metrics  for each generated route to describe a characteristic or characteristics of the route. These metrics  may be furnished to the user as part of the route selection information  to help the user distinguish a desired route from the route options provided. As shown in , the route selection module  may cause the metrics  to be associated with the route graphic  displayed by the display  (e.g., the metrics  for each route may be displayed on the map page  proximate to the route graphic  representing the route).","Metrics  may be determined to describe a variety of characteristics of the route. In the examples illustrated, the metrics  comprise topographic information  about the route and\/or a rating  calculated for the route. These metrics  are described in more detail below by way of example. However, it is contemplated that a wide variety of metrics  may be determined. For example, metrics  describing the availability of bicycle lanes, the scenic beauty of a route, the number of other users of devices in a particular system currently traversing a route, combinations thereof, and so forth, may be provided.","Topographic information  can include a wide variety of information that describes some characteristic of the route. For example, topographic information  may include information describing an elevation profile of the route, the number of turns or curves along the route, the total climb distance of the route from the starting point to the destination, maximum elevation change over a given distance (maximum slope), visual representation of terrain traversed by the route, combinations thereof, and so forth. The topographic information  may be acquired by the route selection module  from a variety of sources. For example, the topographic information  may be stored with the map data  in memory , acquired from content  accessed via the network  by the communication module, and so on. In implementations, the topographic information  is geo-referenced (e.g., cross-referenced with geo-spatial coordinate information, e.g., latitude, longitude, altitude, and so on) to identify the topography associated with the selected route(s).","In the examples illustrated in , the route selection module  () may cause topographic information  comprising an elevation profile  associated with each route to be displayed as part of the map page  proximate to the route graphic  representing the route.","In , the elevation profiles  are displayed within a pane  (e.g., defined by a window, frame, etc.) of the common map page  in an overlay configuration (the elevation profiles  are overlaid together within the pane ). As shown, each elevation profile  may be keyed to its respective route graphics  via indicia shared by the elevation profile  and the route graphic  (e.g., a first route graphic  and its associated elevation profile  are identified with a shared first indicia (a solid line), a second route graphic  and its associated elevation profile  are identified with a shared second indicia (a dashed line), a third route graphic  and its associated elevation profile  are identified with a shared third indicia (a dotted line), and so forth). As noted, it is contemplated that a variety of indicia (other than line type) may be employed to distinguish the different routes. For example, the different route graphics  and associated elevation profiles  may be distinguished from one another by different hues (e.g., colors), line weights, symbols, or the like to distinguish them from other route graphics . Where elevation profiles  overlap, the indicia of the elevation profiles  may be combined, or the indicia of one elevation profile  may be displayed over the other elevation profiles  (e.g., the elevation profile  of the most direct route, the fastest route, and so on may be displayed). Again, it is contemplated, that the specific indicia used (e.g., hues (colors), text, line types and weights, shading, etc.) may be selected to match or coordinate with display characteristics of the user interface  of the mobile electronic device .","In , the elevation profile  of each route graphic  is displayed in a pane  of each separate instance of the map page . As noted, the various instances of the map page  may then be scrolled or otherwise changed onto and off of the display  to facilitate selection of a desired route by the user. Thus, as shown, a first route graphic  and its associated elevation profile  may be displayed in a first instance of the map page , a second route graphic  and its associated elevation profile  may be displayed in a second instance of the map page , a third route graphic  and its associated elevation profile  may be displayed in a third instance of the map page , a fourth route graphic  and its associated elevation profile  may be displayed in a fourth instance of the map page , and so forth. As described, the user may provide a gesture to the touch screen  (e.g., swiping a finger across the touch screen  to scroll through the maps  to review the different routes provided by the route selection module . For example, the user gestures across the touch screen  to move from a first map page , which displays a first route graphic  and its associated elevation profile , to a second map page , which displays a second route graphic  and its associated elevation profile , and so forth. Of course, the various instances of the map page  and associated profiles  may be accessed through methods other than, or in addition to, scrolling or touch scrolling. For example, the instances of the map pages  and associated profiles  may be accessed using any portions of the user interface  and\/or through utilization of the I\/O devices .","As noted above, the metrics  may also comprise a rating  furnished instead of, or in addition to, the topographic information  or other metrics. A variety of rating schemes are possible. For instance, in the implementation illustrated, the rating  comprises a difficulty rating that furnishes a ranking describing a level of difficulty encountered by the user while navigating the route. The ratings  may have a variety of formats. For example, ratings  may be formatted as a numeric rating (e.g., a rating of \u201c1\u201d for low difficulty through \u201c10\u201d for high difficulty), as discrete difficulty levels (e.g., \u201cHigh,\u201d \u201cMedium,\u201d and \u201cLow,\u201d or \u201cDifficult,\u201d, \u201cAverage,\u201d and \u201cEasy\u201d), combinations thereof, and so on. For instance, in the example shown in , a low rating  (e.g., a difficulty rating of \u201c1\u201d through \u201c5\u201d) may indicate that the route traverses terrain which is relatively easy to navigate and\/or that there is little traffic present on the route. The route may have an at least substantially paved surface, be relatively flat (e.g., has minimal climb distance, such as fifty (50) feet or less), have a low number of turns (e.g., ten (10) turns or less), and so forth. Conversely, a high rating  (e.g., a difficulty rating of \u201c6\u201d through \u201c10\u201d) may indicate that the route traverses terrain that is relatively difficult to navigate. The route may include unpaved sections (e.g., gravel or dirt roadways), is relatively steep (e.g., has a high climb distance, such as five hundred (500) feet), have a high number of turns (e.g., fifty (50) turns or more), and so forth. In an implementation, the ratings  may be preprogrammed (e.g., into the map data ) or may be calculated based on pre-determined criteria. In another implementation, the ratings  may comprise a user-defined difficulty rating entered by the user (e.g., the user enters a user-selected difficulty rating, the user overrides the default difficulty rating with a user-selected difficulty rating, etc.).","A variety of criteria may be considered to determine the rating  of a route. Such criteria may include, but are not limited to: the route width, the surface of the route (e.g., loose gravel vs. paved route), the number of other vehicles and\/or individuals that utilize the route during a specified time period (e.g., route may be busier at 8 A.M. than at 2:00 PM due to people going to work, etc.), the number of hills associated with each route, a grade (e.g., steepness) of each hill in the route, a terrain rating of the route, a total climb distance (e.g., the climb distance from the starting point to the destination point, the climb distance from the lowest elevation point of the route to the highest elevation point of the route, etc.), real-time or historical weather associated with the route (e.g., bad weather such as rain may increase difficulty), combinations thereof, and so forth.","As shown, the route selection module  may further cause distance\/time information  to be displayed on the map page(s) . The distance\/time information  may include a distance to and\/or an estimated time remaining to the desired destination from the current position of the mobile electronic device . In implementations, the navigation module  may utilize the determined position of the device  from the position-determining module  and the map data  to determine the distance\/time information . The distance\/time information  may be dynamically updated by the navigation module  as the mobile electronic device  is moved. For example, the distance and time to the destination may decrease as the mobile electronic device  is brought nearer to the destination. Conversely, the distance and time to the destination may increase as the device  is taken farther away from the destination. The distance\/time information may vary for each route to the destination depending on factors such as the length of the route, posted speed limits along the route, and so forth.","The route selection module  includes functionality to receive a desired route selection from a user of the mobile electronic device . For example, where route selection information  is presented in the overlay configuration illustrated in , the user may select a desired route by providing an input proximate to the desired route graphic  (and\/or elevation profile ) via the touch screen  (e.g., tapping the user's finger proximate to the route graphic  on the touch screen ). The user may then cause the selected route to be navigated via selection of an input (e.g., by tapping touch screen  over the \u201cGo!\u201d button ).","Where route selection information  is presented in separate map pages as illustrated in , the user may \u201cflick\u201d scroll to the map page  displaying the desired route graphic  and metric . The user may then select the route via an input (e.g., by tapping touch screen  over the \u201cGo!\u201d button ). In this example, it is contemplated the user may also select the desired route by tapping the user's finger proximate to the displayed route graphic . Of course, any portions of the user interface  and\/or I\/O devices  may be used to select a desired route.","The route selection module  (or the navigation module ) may then cause a map  to be displayed on map page  by the display , as shown in , to furnish navigation information  for the selected route to facilitate navigation to the destination. As illustrated, the navigation information  may include turn-by-turn directions  (e.g., \u201cIn 0.5 miles turn right onto Main St.\u201d) and indicia ,  indicating the position of the user along the route graphic  and\/or the elevation profile . However, it is contemplated that a wide variety of navigation information  may be provided. For example, navigation information  that may be provided may include, but is not limited to: depictions of terrain, buildings, and so forth along the route; speed limit information; traffic information; road construction information; weather information; predicted time of arrival; distance and time to the destination; and upcoming turn information. Audio and other visual cues may also be provided by the device  to assist navigation along the desired route. For example, audible turn-by-turn voice directions may be given to direct the user along the desired route.","Generally, any of the functions described herein can be implemented using software, firmware, hardware (e.g., fixed logic circuitry), manual processing, or a combination of these implementations. The terms \u201cmodule\u201d and \u201cfunctionality\u201d as used herein generally represent software, firmware, hardware, or a combination thereof. The communication between modules in the mobile electronic device  of  can be wired, wireless, or some combination thereof. In the case of a software implementation, for instance, the module represents executable instructions that perform specified tasks when executed on a processor, such as the processor  with the mobile electronic device  of . The program code can be stored in one or more device-readable storage media, an example of which is the memory  associated with the mobile electronic device  of .","Example Procedures","The following discussion describes procedures that may be implemented in a mobile electronic device providing navigation functionality. Aspects of the procedures may be implemented in hardware, firmware, or software, or a combination thereof. The procedures are shown as a set of blocks that specify operations performed by one or more devices and are not necessarily limited to the orders shown for performing the operations by the respective blocks. In portions of the following discussion, reference may be made to the environment  of , A, and B. The features of techniques described below are platform-independent, meaning that the techniques may be implemented on a variety of commercial mobile electronic device platforms having a variety of processors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIGS. 1"],"b":["300","302","304","2","2","150","152","154","154","160","158"]},"In one or more implementations, the route selection information including metrics for each route may be displayed in an overlay configuration (Block ), as illustrated in . In other implementations, as illustrated in , the route selection information for each route may be displayed on a scrollable or sequential map display (Block ). In such implementations, the user may \u201cflick\u201d scroll through each map display by providing a gesture to the mobile electronic device (e.g., swiping a finger across the touch screen of the mobile electronic device, engaging a key of the mobile electronic device, or the like). Other implementations are possible.","A selection is then received, from the user via an input to the mobile electronic device, that includes a route chosen from the one or more routes presented (Block ). In one or more implementations, the selection may be received via an input provided to a touch screen (Block ) of the mobile electronic device. For example, as shown in , the user may select the route he or she wishes to traverse by using the touch screen  (e.g., by tapping the \u201cGo!\u201d button ). In other implementations, the user may select a desired route by tapping the touch screen  in a position proximate to the desired route's route graphic (and\/or elevation profile).","A map of the selected route is then displayed on the display device (Block ). The map is configured to furnish navigation information for the selected route to facilitate navigation to the destination. As shown in , the map  and navigation information  may be comprised of map and\/or map-related content , ,  associated with the route to the destination. The navigation information  may be generated utilizing position data to show a current position of the user on the displayed map, furnish navigation instructions (e.g., turn-by-turn directions to the destination), calculate traveling distances and times, and so on.","Although techniques to facilitate the selection of a route to a destination from multiple route options have been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the appended claims are not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described.
