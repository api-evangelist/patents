No. 60\/664,317, filed Mar. 23, 2005.","The instant invention involves novel compounds which are useful as inhibitors of leukotriene biosynthesis.","Inhibition of leukotriene biosynthesis has been an active area of pharmaceutical research for many years. The leukotrienes constitute a group of locally acting hormones, produced in living systems from arachidonic acid. Leukotrienes are potent contractile and inflammatory mediators derived by enzymatic oxygenation of arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase. One class of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors are those known to act through inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO).","The major leukotrienes are Leukotriene B(abbreviated as LTB), LTC, LTDand LTE. The biosynthesis of these leukotrienes begins with the action of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenases on arachidonic acid to produce the epoxide known as Leukotriene A(LTA), which is converted to the other leukotrienes by subsequent enzymatic steps. Further details of the biosynthesis as well as the metabolism of the leukotrienes are to be found in the book Leukotrienes and Lipoxygenases, ed. J. Rokach, Elsevier, Amsterdam (1989). The actions of the leukotrienes in living systems and their contribution to various diseases states are also discussed in the book by Rokach.","In general, 5-LO inhibitors have been sought for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, asthma and inflammatory conditions including arthritis. One example of a 5-LO inhibitor is the marketed drug zileuton (ZYLOFT\u00ae) which is indicated for the treatment of asthma. More recently, it has been reported that 5-LO may be an important contributor to the atherogenic process; see Mehrabian, M. et al., Circulation Research, 2002 Jul. 26, 91(2):120-126.","Despite significant therapeutic advances in the treatment and prevention of conditions affected by 5-LO inhibition, further treatment options are needed. The instant invention addresses that need by providing novel 5-LO inhibitors which are useful for inhibiting leukotriene biosynthesis.","The instant invention relates to compounds of Formula Ia which are leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors, methods for their preparation, and methods and pharmaceutical formulations for using these compounds in mammals, especially humans.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0008"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"23.20mm","wi":"67.65mm","file":"US07553973-20090630-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The compounds of Formula Ia are useful as pharmaceutical agents to slow or halt atherogenesis.

The instant invention also provides methods for preventing or reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic disease events, comprising administering a prophylactically effective amount of a compound of Formula Ia to a patient who is at risk of developing atherosclerosis or having an atherosclerotic disease event.","Additionally, the instant invention involves the use of compounds of Formula Ia as anti-asthmatic, anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective agents.

This inhibition of the mammalian biosynthesis of leukotrienes indicates that the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions thereof are useful to treat, prevent, or ameliorate atherosclerosis in mammals, and especially in humans. Therefore, the compounds of this invention can be used for the treatment of atherosclerosis comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention to a patient in need of such treatment. A further aspect of this invention involves a method for preventing or reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis, comprising administering a prophylactically effective amount of a compound of this invention to a patient in need of such treatment. Atherosclerosis is characterized by the deposition of atheromatous plaques containing cholesterol and lipids on the innermost layer of the walls of large and medium-sized arteries. Atherosclerosis encompasses vascular diseases and conditions that are recognized and understood by physicians practicing in the relevant fields of medicine. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease including restenosis following revascularization procedures, coronary heart disease (also known as coronary artery disease or ischemic heart disease), cerebrovascular disease including multi-infarct dementia, and peripheral vessel disease including erectile dysfunction, are all clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis and are therefore encompassed by the terms \u201catherosclerosis\u201d and \u201catherosclerotic disease.\u201d","A compound of the instant invention may be administered to prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence, or recurrence where the potential exists, of a coronary heart disease (CHD) event, a cerebrovascular event, and\/or intermittent claudication. Coronary heart disease events are intended to include CHD death, myocardial infarction (i.e., a heart attack), and coronary revascularization procedures. Cerebrovascular events are intended to include ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (also known as cerebrovascular accidents) and transient ischemic attacks. Intermittent claudication is a clinical manifestation of peripheral vessel disease. The term \u201catherosclerotic disease event\u201d as used herein is intended to encompass coronary heart disease events, cerebrovascular events, and intermittent claudication. It is intended that persons who have previously experienced one or more non-fatal atherosclerotic disease events are those for whom the potential for recurrence of such an event exists.","Accordingly, the instant invention also provides a method for preventing or reducing the risk of a first or subsequent occurrence of an atherosclerotic disease event comprising the administration of a prophylactically effective amount of a compound of this invention to a patient at risk for such an event. The patient may already have atherosclerotic disease at the time of administration, or may be at risk for developing it.","The method of this invention serves to prevent or slow new atherosclerotic lesion or plaque formation, and to prevent or slow progression of existing lesions or plaques, as well as to cause regression of existing lesions or plaques. Accordingly, one aspect of this invention involves a method for halting or slowing the progression of atherosclerosis, including halting or slowing atherosclerotic plaque progression, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention to a patient in need of such treatment. This method also includes halting or slowing progression of atherosclerotic plaques existing at the time the instant treatment is begun (i.e., \u201cexisting atherosclerotic plaques\u201d), as well as halting or slowing formation of new atherosclerotic plaques in patients with atherosclerosis.","Another aspect of this invention involves a method for regression of atherosclerosis, including regression of atherosclerotic plaques existing at the time the instant treatment is begun, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention to a patient in need of such treatment.","Another aspect of this invention involves a method for preventing or reducing the risk of atherosclerotic plaque rupture comprising administering a prophylactically effective amount of a compound of this invention to a patient in need of such treatment.

Leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors also act as inhibitors of tumor metastasis and exhibit cytoprotective action.","The cytoprotective activity of a compound may be observed in both animals and man by noting the increased resistance of the gastrointestinal mucosa to the noxious effects of strong irritants, for example, the ulcerogenic effects of aspirin or indomethacin. In addition to lessening the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the gastrointestinal tract, animal studies show that cytoprotective compounds will prevent gastric lesions induced by oral administration of strong acids, strong bases, ethanol, hypertonic saline solutions, and the like. Two assays can be used to measure cytoprotective ability. These assays are: (A) an ethanol-induced lesion assay and (B) an indomethacin-induced ulcer assay and are described in EP 140,684. In particular, the compounds of the invention would be useful to reduce the gastric erosion caused by co-administration of a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor such as rofecoxib (VIOXX\u00ae), etoricoxib (ARCOXIA\u2122), celecoxib (CELEBREX\u00ae) and valdecoxib (BEXTRA\u2122), and low-dose aspirin.","In addition, the compounds of this invention can also be used for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As described in S. Kilfeather, Chest, 2002, vol 121, 197, airway neutrophilia in COPD patients is believed to be a contributing source of inflammation and is associated with airway remodeling. The presence of neutrophils is mediated in part by LTB, and treatment with the instant compounds could be used to reduce neutrophilic inflammation in patients with COPD.","Furthermore, the compounds of this invention could be used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease; see Manev, H. and Manev, R., \u201c5-(5) (5) Medical Hypotheses (2006) 66, p. 501-503.","The term \u201cpatient\u201d includes mammals, especially humans, who use the instant active agents for the prevention or treatment of a medical condition. Administering of the drug to the patient includes both self-administration and administration to the patient by another person.

The term \u201cprophylactically effective amount\u201d is intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue, a system, animal or human by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician.","The magnitude of prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a compound of this invention will, of course, vary with the nature of the severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular compound and its route of administration. It will also vary according to the age, weight and response of the individual patient. In general, the daily dose range for anti-asthmatic, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic or anti-atherosclerotic use and generally, uses other than cytoprotection, lie within the range of from about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg per kg body weight of a mammal, preferably 0.01 mg to about 10 mg per kg, and most preferably 0.1 to 1 mg per kg, in single or divided doses. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases. As examples, the total daily dosage amount may be selected from, but not limited to, 1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 125 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg and 250 mg in single or divided daily doses.","In the case where an oral composition is employed, a suitable dosage range for anti-asthmatic, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic or anti-atherosclerotic use is, e.g., from about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg of a compound of this invention per kg of body weight per day, preferably from about 0.1 mg to about 10 mg per kg and for cytoprotective use from 0.1 mg to about 100 mg (preferably from about 1 mg to about 100 mg and more preferably from about 10 mg to about 100 mg) of a compound of this invention per kg of body weight per day.","For use where a composition for intravenous administration is employed, a suitable dosage range for anti-asthmatic, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherosclerotic or anti-allergic use is from about 0.001 mg to about 25 mg (preferably from 0.01 mg to about 1 mg) of a compound of this invention per kg of body weight per day and for cytoprotective use from about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg (preferably from about 1 mg to about 100 mg and more preferably from about 1 mg to about 10 mg) of a compound of this invention per kg of body weight per day.","For the treatment of diseases of the eye, ophthalmic preparations for ocular administration comprising 0.001-1% by weight solutions or suspensions of the compounds of this invention in an acceptable ophthalmic formulation may be used.","The exact amount of a compound of this invention to be used as a cytoprotective agent will depend on, inter alia, whether it is being administered to heal damaged cells or to avoid future damage, on the nature of the damaged cells (e.g., gastrointestinal ulcerations vs. nephrotic necrosis), and on the nature of the causative agent. An example of the use of a compound of this invention in avoiding future damage would be co-administration of a compound of this invention with an NSAID that might otherwise cause such damage (for example, indomethacin). For such use, the compound of this invention is administered from 30 minutes prior up to 30 minutes after administration of the NSAID. Preferably it is administered prior to or simultaneously with the NSAID, (for example, in a combination dosage form).","The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of this invention as an active ingredient and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human with an effective dosage of a compound of the present invention. For example, oral, rectal, topical, parenteral, ocular, pulmonary, nasal, and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols, and the like. For use in treating or preventing atherosclerosis and related disease events, oral formulation is preferred.","The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), ocular (ophthalmic), pulmonary (nasal or buccal inhalation), or nasal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy.","For administration by inhalation, the compounds of the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or nebulisers. The compounds may also be delivered as powders which may be formulated and the powder composition may be inhaled with the aid of an insufflation powder inhaler device. The preferred delivery system for inhalation is a metered dose inhalation (MDI) aerosol, which may be formulated as a suspension or solution of a compound of this invention in suitable propellants, such as fluorocarbons or hydrocarbons.","Suitable topical formulations of a compound of this invention include transdermal devices, aerosols, creams, ointments, lotions, dusting powders, and the like.","In practical use, the compounds of this invention can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous).

Human 5-lipoxygenase was purified from Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus rvH5LO (8-1) containing the coding sequence for human 5-lipoxygenase as described by Percival et al., (Eur. J. Biochem 210, 109-117, 1992).

Reactions were initiated by the addition of the purified 5-lipoxygenase and the rate of conjugated diene production was followed for 5 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was performed in a Costar UV plate (Cat. # 3635) and the absorbance changes at 238 nm were recorded with a Molecular Devices UV\/VIS 96 well spectrophotometer (Spectra Max 190) using SOFTmax PRO software. Enzymatic activity was calculated from the optimal rate of the reaction by a linear fit of the increase in absorbance at 238 nm over 36 seconds. When the rate of diene formation is low (<0.01 Absorbance Unit\/min) the linear fit is performed over 180 seconds. The results are expressed as percentage of inhibition of the reaction rate relative to controls (typically between 0.001-0.005 Absorbance Unit\/min) containing the DMSO vehicle.","Fresh blood was collected in heparinized tubes by venipuncture from consenting volunteers. These volunteers have no apparent inflammatory conditions and have not taken any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for at least 4 days prior to blood collection. Plasma was separated from the blood of each individual volunteer by centrifuging approximately 10 mls of blood. A 50 mM stock solution of the calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma, St Louis, Mo., USA) in DMSO was diluted 40 fold with each volunteer's plasma to obtain a 1.25 mM working solution. A 250 \u03bcl aliquot of each blood was pre-incubated with either 0.5 \u03bcl of vehicle (DMSO) or test compounds in DMSO at 37\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes. This was followed with the addition of 5 \u03bcl of either plasma or the 1.25 mM working solution (for each experiment, the blood and plasma was from the same volunteer) resulting in a final concentration of 25 \u03bcM of A23187. The blood mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes then centrifuged at 1500 g at 4\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes. The supernatant plasma was collected from all samples and stored at 4\u00b0 C.

The intermediate 24 is then transformed using trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride, in the presence of an amine such as triethylamine, in a neutral solvent such as dichloromethane, to the corresponding triflate 25.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0186"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00019","num":"00019"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00019","he":"115.74mm","wi":"72.98mm","file":"US07553973-20090630-C00019.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0187"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00020","num":"00020"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00020","he":"18.88mm","wi":"30.31mm","file":"US07553973-20090630-C00020.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"To a 80\u00b0 C. suspension of NaH (60 g, 1500 mmol, 60%) in toluene was added 1-(2-hydroxy-4-methylphenyl)ethanone (100 g, 666 mmol; also known as 2\u2032-hydroxy-4\u2032-methylacetophenone) in 800 mL of toluene over 1 h.
