{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application is related to, and claims priority from, U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/423,429 entitled \u201cINTERACTION ARCHITECTURE FOR THE TV\u201d to Daniel S. Simpkins, filed on Dec. 15, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention describes social networking techniques, devices, systems and software which can be used in conjunction with social networks associated with a television, e.g., a family social networking tool.","Technologies associated with the communication of information have evolved rapidly over the last several decades. Television, cellular telephony, the Internet and optical communication techniques (to name just a few modes of communications) combine to inundate consumers with available information and entertainment options. Taking television as an example, the last three decades have seen the introduction of cable television service, satellite television service, pay-per-view movies and video-on-demand, both of the latter being made available by cable, fiber-optic, and satellite service providers, as well as over the internet (e.g., Netflix\u00ae). Whereas television viewers of the 1960s could typically receive perhaps four or five over-the-air TV channels on their television sets, today's TV watchers have the opportunity to select from hundreds, thousands, and potentially millions of channels of shows and information. Video-on-demand technology, currently used primarily in hotels and the like, provides the potential for in-home entertainment selection from among thousands of movie titles.","Today, social sites like Facebook and LinkedIn allow users to form communities of friends and colleagues. Using these applications, users can naturally form communities of the people relevant to them\u2014these communities are thus centered around the user. While they are very useful in achieving their purpose of enabling individuals to create individualized communities which may then be selectively linked together to create a global network of individualized communities, these social networks present their own challenges, e.g., related to privacy, and not everyone is comfortable with being part of a global community despite their advantages.","An alternative social networking idea is proposed herein\u2014a community built around the TV or, more specifically, the community space the TV is in itself. That community could then, of course, expand from there (just like Facebook and LinkedIn can from their center of a person), or alternatively could be a substantially closed, mini-community that provides an enhanced social networking tool that is centered around a close knit group of people, e.g., a family or work group. Since the TV is a group device, this imbues it with a natural social component and an immediate community, namely the group of people who physically share that space (whether it's a household, work, or commercial location).","Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide social networking techniques, devices, systems and software (applications) which facilitate the usage of the TV as a social networking tool centered about a group of people.","It is therefore a general aspect of the invention to provide a visual whiteboard which can be provided as an application, or component of a TV internet browser, for operation on a smart TV. The visual whiteboard provides a lightweight social networking mechanism, e.g., for groups who have physical access to the same smart TV. Content identifiers or other group information can be posted to the visual whiteboard by the authorized users for subsequent display on the corresponding smart TV.","According to an embodiment, a TV internet browser includes a display region for displaying web content on a television; a cursor, displayed over the web content, and movable in response to pointing input received by the TV internet browser; an input interface for receiving said pointing input and user selection input; and a visual whiteboard component configured to display content identifiers in a list on the television, the list being accessible only by a group of authorized users, wherein the content identifiers can be selected via the user selection input to launch corresponding content for output on the television.","The following detailed description of the invention refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention. Instead, the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims.","In order to provide some context for this discussion, an exemplary aggregated media system  in which the present invention can be implemented will first be described with respect to . A discussion of social networking tools and techniques according to exemplary embodiments begins in detail following the header entitled \u201cVisual Whiteboard\u201d below. Those skilled in the art will appreciate, however, that the present invention is not restricted to implementation in this type of media system and that more or fewer components can be included therein. Therein, an input\/output (I\/O) bus  connects the system components in the media system  together. The I\/O bus  represents any of a number of different of mechanisms and techniques for routing signals between the media system components. For example, the I\/O bus  may include an appropriate number of independent audio \u201cpatch\u201d cables that route audio signals, coaxial cables that route video signals, two-wire serial lines or infrared or radio frequency transceivers that route control signals, optical fiber or any other routing mechanisms that route other types of signals.","In this exemplary embodiment, the media system  includes a television (TV)\/monitor , a video cassette recorder (VCR) , digital video disk (DVD) recorder\/playback device , audio\/video tuner  and compact disk player  coupled to the I\/O bus . The VCR , DVD  and compact disk player  may be single disk or single cassette devices, or alternatively may be multiple disk or multiple cassette devices. They may be independent units or integrated together. In addition, the media system  includes a microphone\/speaker system , video camera  and a wireless I\/O control device . According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the wireless I\/O control device  is a 3D pointing device according to one of the exemplary embodiments described below. The wireless I\/O control device  can communicate with the entertainment system  using, e.g., an IR or RF transmitter or transceiver. Alternatively, the I\/O control device can be connected to the entertainment system  via a wire.","The entertainment system  also includes a system controller . According to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the system controller  operates to store and display entertainment system data available from a plurality of entertainment system data sources and to control a wide variety of features associated with each of the system components. As shown in , system controller  is coupled, either directly or indirectly, to each of the system components, as necessary, through I\/O bus . In one exemplary embodiment, in addition to or in place of I\/O bus , system controller  is configured with a wireless communication transmitter (or transceiver), which is capable of communicating with the system components via IR signals or RF signals. Regardless of the control medium, the system controller  is configured to control the media components of the media system  via a graphical user interface described below.","As further illustrated in , media system  may be configured to receive media items from various media sources and service providers. In this exemplary embodiment, media system  receives media input from and, optionally, sends information to, any or all of the following sources: cable broadcast  (e.g., via coaxial cable, or optionally a fiber optic cable), satellite broadcast  (e.g., via a satellite dish), very high frequency (VHF) or ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio frequency communication of the broadcast television networks  (e.g., via an aerial antenna), telephone network  and cable modem  (or another source of Internet content). A \u201csmart\u201d TV can also include an Internet connection , e.g., an Ethernet port or WLAN transceiver. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the media components and media sources illustrated and described with respect to  are purely exemplary and that media system  may include more or fewer of both. For example, other types of inputs to the system include AM\/FM radio and satellite radio.","More details regarding this exemplary entertainment system and frameworks associated therewith can be found in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,046,705. Alternatively, social networking tools in accordance with the present invention can be used in conjunction with other systems, for example computer systems including, e.g., a display, a processor and a memory system or with various other systems and applications.","Remote devices which operate as 3D pointers may also be used in conjunction with social networking tools described below, but are not required. Such devices enable the translation of movement, e.g., gestures, into commands to a user interface. An exemplary 3D pointing device  is depicted in . Therein, user movement of the 3D pointing can be defined, for example, in terms of a combination of x-axis attitude (roll), y-axis elevation (pitch) and\/or z-axis heading (yaw) motion of the 3D pointing device . In addition, some such devices can also measure linear movement of the 3D pointing device  along the x, y, and z axes to generate cursor movement or other user interface commands. In the exemplary embodiment of , the 3D pointing device  includes two buttons  and  as well as a scroll wheel .","It is anticipated that 3D pointing devices  will be held by a user in front of a display  and that motion of the 3D pointing device  will be translated by the 3D pointing device into output which is usable to interact with the information displayed on display , e.g., to move the cursor  on the display . For example, rotation of the 3D pointing device  about the y-axis can be sensed by the 3D pointing device  and translated into an output usable by the system to move cursor  along the yaxis of the display . Likewise, rotation of the 3D pointing device  about the z-axis can be sensed by the 3D pointing device  and translated into an output usable by the system to move cursor  along the xaxis of the display . It will be appreciated that the output of 3D pointing device  can be used to interact with the display  in a number of ways other than (or in addition to) cursor movement, for example it can control cursor fading, volume or media transport (play, pause, fast-forward and rewind). Input commands may include operations in addition to cursor movement, for example, a zoom in or zoom out on a particular region of a display. A cursor may or may not be visible. Similarly, rotation of the 3D pointing device  sensed about the x-axis of 3D pointing device  can be used in addition to, or as an alternative to, y-axis and\/or z-axis rotation to provide input to a user interface.","According to one embodiment, two rotational sensors  and  and one accelerometer  can be employed as sensors in 3D pointing device  as shown in . Although this exemplary embodiment employs inertial sensors to sense motion it will be appreciated that the present invention is not so limited and examples of other types of sensors which can be used in conjunction with other exemplary embodiments are provided below. The rotational sensors  and  can, for example, be implemented using ADXRS150 or ADXRS401 sensors made by Analog Devices. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of rotational sensors can be employed as rotational sensors  and  and that the ADXRS150 and ADXRS401 are purely used as an illustrative example.","Unlike traditional gyroscopes, these exemplary rotational sensors use micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology to provide a resonating mass which is attached to a frame so that it can resonate only along one direction. The resonating mass is displaced when the body to which the sensor is affixed is rotated around the sensor's sensing axis. This displacement can be measured using the Coriolis acceleration effect to determine an angular velocity associated with rotation along the sensing axis. If the rotational sensors  and  have a single sensing axis (as for example the ADXRS150s), then they can be mounted in the 3D pointing device  such that their sensing axes are aligned with the rotations to be measured. For this exemplary embodiment of the present invention, this means that rotational sensor  is mounted such that its sensing axis is parallel to the y-axis and that rotational sensor  is mounted such that its sensing axis is parallel to the z-axis as shown in .","It will be appreciated that different sensor packages may be available which could lead to other exemplary implementations. For example, the two 1-D rotational sensors  and  could be replaced by a single, 2D rotational sensor package which provides outputs of rotational motion along, e.g., the y and z axes. One exemplary 2-D rotational sensor is the InvenSense IDG-300, although it will be appreciated that other sensors\/sensor packages may also be used. The rotational sensors ,  can be 1-D, 2-D or 3-D sensors. The accelerometer  can, for example, be a 3-axis linear accelerometer, although a 2-axis linear accelerometer could be used by assuming that the device is measuring gravity and mathematically computing the remaining 3value. Additionally, the accelerometer(s) and rotational sensor(s) could be packaged together into a single sensor package. A magnetometer could be used to replace either or both of the accelerometer(s) and\/or rotational sensor(s). Other variations of sensors and sensor packages may also be used in conjunction with these exemplary embodiments.","The exemplary embodiments are not limited to the industrial design illustrated in , but can instead be deployed in any industrial form factor, another example of which is illustrated as . In the exemplary embodiment of , the 3D pointing device  includes a ring-shaped housing , two buttons  and  as well as a scroll wheel  and grip , although other exemplary embodiments may include other physical configurations. The region  which includes the two buttons  and  and scroll wheel  is referred to herein as the \u201ccontrol area\u201d , which is disposed on an outer portion of the ring-shaped housing . More details regarding this embodiment can be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/480,662, entitled \u201c3D Pointing Devices\u201d, filed on Jul. 3, 2006, the disclosure of which is incorporated here by reference.","Such 3D pointing devices have numerous applications including, for example, usage in the so-called \u201c10 foot\u201d interface between a sofa and a television in the typical living room as shown in . Therein, as the 3D pointing device  moves between different positions, that movement is detected by one or more sensors within 3D pointing device  and transmitted to the television  (or associated system component, e.g., a set-top box (not shown)). Movement of the 3D pointing device  can, for example, be translated into movement of a cursor  displayed on the television  and which is used to interact with a user interface. Details of an exemplary user interface with which the user can interact via 3D pointing device  can be found, for example, in the above-incorporated U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/768,432 as well as U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/437,215, entitled \u201cGlobal Navigation Objects in User Interfaces\u201d, filed on May 19, 2006, the disclosure of which is incorporated here by reference.","Visual Whiteboard","A living room television set is likely to be used and watched by several people in a household. If someone has a smart TV, this transforms the TV usage scenarios from being merely passive watching experiences into those associated with a shared digital hub for Internet content. A smart TV operating as a shared digital hub might encourage a number of new behaviors and interactions such as:","1. Active and passive users; the former will be the ones engaged in browsing and searching for content (videos, emails, updates from social networks, etc.); the latter will be those who may (initially) merely observe the ongoing activities on the screen, whether from walking past the shared social space or sitting on the couch.","2. Consumption of video and audio content will predominate (but not eliminate) the textual.","3. Individuals wanting to synchronize their browsing information (e.g., history, bookmarks) between their various devices or environments (e.g., work computer, office laptop, home PC).","4. Individuals wanting to save online videos for watching later at home on their TV.","5. Individuals wanting to share videos with other members of the local group.","6. Local groups wanting to share videos with people outside the immediate group.","It will be appreciated that the foregoing are just some of the examples of expected interactions which may occur as smart TVs are introduced into the homes and workplaces. New tools will be needed to support such interactions. For example, TV-based Internet browsers can support the first two items listed above, an example of which is found in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20110231484, entitled \u201cTV Internet Browser\u201d, filed on Mar. 22, 2011, to Burgess et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated here by reference. With the inclusion of some cross-browser bookmarking technology (e.g., a la Xmarks), such a TV-based Internet browser could also support the bookmarking aspect of item #3 as well. Items 4 through 6 are interesting because they add convenience to the user and support a core activity of the social digital age: the ability to push and receive \u201cpersonalized\u201d media\u2014that is, content that has been selected (hand-picked in a sense) by other members of a user's community.","A mechanism for direct sharing of information via the social graph would be particularly powerful at the scale of the TV local community. Consider, in this regard, the difference between an individual randomly finding a funny cat video posted on a large site like Digg, or alternatively seeing that same video as a result of it being shared within your more limited Twitter group or your family at home. This idea gains even more relevance when it is promoted by those with whom you share a physical space at some point of your daily routine (\u201cDid you see that funny cat video I sent you???\u201d).","Existing, individualized social networking services do enable experience sharing, however such experience sharing is primarily among \u201cvirtual\u201d friends in large groups that don't share a physical space. That is, generic sharing is supported by existing social networks, but their features don't exclusively promote the local video sharing interactions happening around the physical TV. Accordingly, embodiments discussed herein provide local community tools which are designed to promote local installations and shared experiences associated with a group that can also (at times) share a same physical location, e.g., in the home's living room.","Such tools are intended to, for example, make it easy for a smart TV user to share videos with other local users. According to an embodiment, this involves the provision of a visual whiteboard which is displayed on the television that lists, for example, recently selected pages\/links and videos by any user in a manner analogous to a family's kitchen corkboard, refrigerator whiteboard or an electronic bulletin board. Alternatively, the visual whiteboard could be more sophisticated and include smart TV user accounts\/profiles, comments, ratings, etc. Various other features of visual whiteboards according to exemplary embodiments can include:\n\n","Various use case scenarios exist for a visual whiteboard tool associated with a smart TV according to these embodiments. For example, users often get emails with YouTube videos from parents and siblings who live in different households. Such emails or links can be sent directly to the visual whiteboard if the other person was a part of the small group authorized to add content to the whiteboard (or if the other person was temporarily authorized to do so). To further understand the benefits of visual whiteboards associated with embodiments, consider the following exemplary use case scenario.","Use Case Scenario:","George Jetson is at work and receives an email from a colleague, containing a funny cat video. He watches 5 seconds of the clip, chuckles, and hits the \u201cAdd to Visual Whiteboard\u201d button on his browser, i.e., in this example George's browser operating on his work computer is cross-linked to his TV Internet browser at home. A notification briefly alerts him of the success of the operation. George continues working and later receives another email, this time it's a longer video about the ongoing problems of a gas leak on Saturn. He watches 3 minutes of it and thinks that he should save it for watching it with his son, Elroy, who is writing a school essay on the topic. Again he performs the \u201cadd to Visual Whiteboard\u201d to add this to the visual whiteboard associated with his home television.","Meanwhile, his wife Jane who is home today, takes a break from her work to catch up on some of web-only episodes of her favorite sitcom. She uses the TV Internet browser operating on the family TV in the living room and notices the new videos George added to the visual whiteboard. George clearly wanted the family to later see these videos, so she peruses the visual directory and decides to watch the short cat video, which turns out be very funny. She saves the gas leak video for later because it would probably be good to watch it when the rest of the family gets together.","Judy, the sixteen year old, has returned from school and is doing some web browsing before starting her homework for the day. She too finds an interesting video about fashion that she thinks her mother might like to watch. Instead of huddling around her bedroom laptop, she \u201cAdds to Visual Whiteboard\u201d and proceeds to the living room where she and Jane watch the video, now listed on the whiteboard, together. Subsequently they remove it from the whiteboard because they know neither George now Elroy will care for it.","In the evening when the entire family is assembled for dinner, George insists they all become more informed about the gas leak spill on Saturn. George, Jane, Judy, and Elroy all go to living room and watch the video together. Before proceeding to the dinner table George decides that the two videos he added today were entertaining and educational, so he selects to share the visual whiteboard with his boss, Cosmo, who needs to relax from the worries of managing Spacely Sprockets. The interface prompts George for Cosmo's email address and a link is sent with information to the latter.","Cosmo is checking email that night from home and gets the message from George. He is curious about the possibility of sharing a visual whiteboard, e.g., as part of a TV Internet browser, so he installs it on his already-connected-to-the-TV computer. He then follows the simple instructions to link his visual whiteboard with the Jetson's whiteboard. In a matter of minutes he is presented with a set of videos that the Jetsons decided to share with friends. Cosmo doesn't care for videos with animals, but he is certainly concerned about the financial implications of the Saturn gas leak, so he proceeds to watch that video.","From the foregoing, it will be apparent that a visual whiteboard tool displayed on televisions according to embodiments is likely to enhance the social networking among small groups of people for shareable media items having a group, rather than an individual, focus. The visual whiteboard can, for example, be implemented as a document, web page, or other mechanism having certain attributes, e.g., (a) displayable on a television, (b) as part of (or connected to) a TV Internet browser application, (c) with limited access by members of a small group, e.g., a family, and (d) including simple functions (e.g., add item, erase item, play item) which allow the visual whiteboard to function essentially as short-term, group oriented messaging and storage of links or pointers to media items that are intended to be shared with other members of the group who share physical access to the same television. Such visual whiteboards provide for a simple and group oriented social experience that provides a lightweight local sharing feature which will be compelling for stressed and busy families, without the noise and complexity of today's high data rate, individual focused, social networks.","Thus according to an embodiment, a TV internet browser can include a display region for displaying web content on a television, a cursor, displayed over the web content, and movable in response to pointing input received by said TV internet browser; an input interface for receiving said pointing input and user selection input; and a visual whiteboard component configured to display content identifiers in a list on the television, the list being accessible only by a group of authorized users, wherein the content identifiers can be selected via the user selection input to launch corresponding content for output on the television. In addition to, or as an alternative to, content identifiers associated with videos and\/or music, the visual whiteboard can also have applications or screen areas reserved for particular family members or topics\u2014like when the user will be home, what's for dinner, who's coming over, etc. As mentioned earlier, embodiments wherein the visual whiteboard is incorporated into a TV Internet browser can include some or all of the elements of the TV Internet browser described in the above-incorporated by reference '484 U.S. Patent Publication.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","620"]},"Systems and methods for processing data according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention can be performed by one or more processors executing sequences of instructions contained in a memory device.
