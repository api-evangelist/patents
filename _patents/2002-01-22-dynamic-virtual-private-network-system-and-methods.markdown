{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates to the field of communications systems and, more particularly, the invention relates to a system and method for dynamic management of Internet Protocol (IP) Virtual Private Networks.","Internet Protocol (IP) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are overlaid on top of public IP networks to provide connectivity between geographically disperse locations in lieu of connections owned or leased exclusively for a private network. They allow businesses to connect branch offices, telecommuters, field representatives, and partners\/suppliers to a central location using the Internet or an Internet Service Provider's (ISP's) public, shared IP network to securely transmit private data. IP VPNs can also consist of specifically defined groups of end-users who use the Internet or an ISP's public, shared IP network to securely transmit private data. The most common forms of IP VPNs are intranet VPNs, remote access VPNs (or dial VPNs), and Extranet VPNs. IP VPNs have all the characteristics of a private network even though they use a shared public infrastructure, and are offered by ISPs to business customers who want to leverage the efficiencies of a public network, but desire the security of a private network. IP VPNs aim to provide the reliability, performance, quality of service, and security of traditional WAN environments using less costly and more flexible ISP facilities.","The IP VPN solutions available today are cost effective because they are implemented on a shared network infrastructure. IP VPNs eliminate expensive leased line connections and long-distance dial-ups, reduce administrative overhead, and provide the flexibility needed to meet ever-changing network requirements. Extranet VPNs offer very definite cost and security benefits over alternatives.","Today's Internet Service Provider (ISP) network architecture supports access to the Internet for dedicated, remote, and mobile access users and provides the foundation for current IP VPN service offerings. In a typical ISP network architecture, such as depicted in , dedicated access customers () use an access router () to connect to the ISP's network () by means of low-speed access networks (), for example, private line T-1, frame relay, xDSL and the like. Remote users () connect to the ISP by means of the PSTN and mobile users () connect to the ISP by means of a wireless network, both of which are low-speed access networks. Edge routers () provide access to the ISP's core network. The ISP connects to the Internet (), or other ISPs, by means of peering routers (). Servers (-) sitting in the ISPs Network Operations Center (NOC) or Data Center provide authentication, authorization, and accounting functions. Servers providing additional IP services such as DHCP address assignment, DNS name resolution, web hosting and the like also reside in the ISP's Data Center.","Traditionally, IP VPNs are statically provisioned by a ISP's Network Operations Center (NOC) personnel at which time customers specify the IP VPN's topology, user membership, and security levels. Creating or deleting an IP VPN, or changing its topology, or security parameters, requires a call by the subscriber to their ISP whose personnel perform the IP VPN management. This process incurs a provisioning delay and impacts potential revenue that could be generated by the ISP.","New generations of advanced IP applications are emerging that require the specific levels of QoS, access restrictions, data integrity, and group confidentiality that an IP VPN service can offer. These applications may be used for limited, pre-determined times by large and dynamic bases of subscribers. However, the concept of a limited-time IP VPN service, as well as an IP VPN service automatically being made available at a certain time, cannot be implemented using current networking technologies. Therefore, ISP network resources dedicated to the IP VPN service sit idle when the IP VPN is not in use.","The invention comprises a system and method for dynamically managing IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) in a manner enabling subscriber access to IP VPN services on an as-needed basis.","Apparatus according to one embodiment of the invention comprises: a plurality of internet protocol (IP) services aggregation switches for communicating between respective access networks and a core network, each of the IP services aggregation switches communicating with at least one respective user; and a dynamic virtual private network (VPN) manager, for providing customer network management and policy server functions including a user interface enabling remote management of a VPN by a user; wherein the VPN having a defined quality of service (QoS) parameter and a defined security parameter with associated billing rates, at least one of the QoS parameter and the security parameter being adapted in response to user commands provided to the dynamic VPN manager.","To facilitate understanding, identical reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate identical elements that are common to the figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 6","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","210","220","230","240","250","260","260","250","270","210","280","210","270","270","280","200"]},"The VPN administrator may also delegate a subset of his\/her roles and responsibilities to other personnel. The actions that can be performed by these delegates are controlled by Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) technology. The delegated roles\/responsibilities can include activities (such as creation, modification, deletion) of Dynamic IP VPNs or D-VPN administrative authority over a portion of the IP network (for example, a departmental IP VPN). The VPN administrator and\/or the delegates may be employees of the ISP (e.g., ISP NOC personnel) or employees of ISP customers (e.g., an enterprise network administrator).","The Customer Network Management (CNM) system  is a service-level OSS. The CNM  presents a browser-based interface to the business customer's VPN Administrator, or ISP network management personnel, which is used to manage the business customer's IP VPN services. Management of IP VPN services includes creating, changing, and deleting IP VPN services and parameters, the management of QoS classes, profiles, security options, ASP services, as well as billing and SLA verification. The CNM system also interfaces to the ISP's Service Level Management (SLM) system, where it is used by the ISP's internal network managers to monitor the metrics associated with IP VPN services.","The CNM  presents a browser-based interface to the business customer's end-users. Examples of options presented to end-users include the ability to increase access bandwidth based on service or application needs, change QoS parameters (e.g., delay, guaranteed bit rate and the like), and select an ASP service (e.g., subscribe to an on-line course).","The CNM  retrieves data from the Inventory System . This data comprises topology (access bandwidth), customer information (security levels, QoS parameters, service subscriptions and the like), along with routing and tunneling parameters. The CNM  updates data in the Inventory System when the VPN Administrator  adds and deletes users, changes QoS parameters, adds an ASP service and performs other such functions. The CNM  also updates the Inventory System  when an authorized end-user modifies one or more IP VPN parameters.","The CNM  sends a message to the billing system  when necessary to support usage-based billing. For example, the billing system is informed if an end-user accessed an ASP-provided service. The CNM also sends a message to the SLA and SLM managers, if applicable. For example, if the customer's SLA contract includes one or more parameters that can be changed dynamically, then the SLA manager may need to be notified.","Once a D-VPN transaction is authorized, the CNM  sends a message to the Policy Server , which controls the implementation of the information from the Inventory System , e.g., routing and tunneling parameters. Then the Policy Server  sends messages to the Element Management Systems (EMSs) , which have direct interfaces to the network elements . For example, an end-user request to increase access bandwidth might require that an EMS  send a message to a network element  to change a configurable parameter.","The Dynamic IP VPN technology of the invention advantageously employs IP VPNs with Directory Enabled Networking and web-based Subscriber Service Selection. The invention places IP VPN management into the hands of the user and Network Operations personnel to enable rapid service selection results, lowering ISP operations costs, and subsequently reducing the cost to the end-user. Also described are a target architecture and framework as well as several types of services that are supported by D-VPN technology. The Dynamic IP VPN technology leverages advances in IP Service Switches, Integrated Access Devices (IADs), and the underlying service and network management techniques to enable subscriber self-provisioning of IP VPN services and to allow the application of temporal parameters to these services. The D-VPN technology also enables applications to perform IP VPN management operations, without user intervention, by means of, for example, a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).","The disclosed D-VPN technology utilizes IP bandwidth management, IP VPNs, and Directory Enabled Networking to provide an integrated platform from which subscriber self-provisioning is possible. It may be implemented as a distributed technology, with components in a subscriber's CPE and in the ISP's core network and data centers. Working in concert, these components provide secure, manageable, bi-directional IP QoS, potentially with different classes of service, over any IP VPN topology, in addition to the key subscriber self-provisioning capability to modify these services on demand.","A single user interface may be used to manage the above-described example, an ISP's NOC or Data Center and is accessible to remote customers by means of a web interface. A remote user, at a customer location, is able to access this interface and use it to dynamically manage the bi-directional IP QoS of their IP flows and to dynamically manage their IP VPN services. That is, bi-directional IP QoS comprises managing IP flows in both directions across an access network. In order to dynamically control QoS in both directions across the access network, a D-VPN enabled device should be used at each end of the access link. The device on the customer premises manages the QoS in the direction towards the ISP core network. The ISP's edge device manages the QoS in the direction towards the customer.","In addition, a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) is provided that can be invoked by applications to perform Dynamic IP VPN management activities without human intervention. Applications are therefore able to hide the complexities of IP VPN management from end-users by utilizing these APIs. As will be seen from subsequent examples, this set of D-VPN management APIs enables the transparent management of IP VPNs from an end user perspective, thereby providing customized, on-demand IP VPN services to the end-user. Finally, this transparent management of IP VPN services enables many more end-users to reap the benefits of IP VPN services than do so today. In one embodiment, the API is executed within an Enhanced Application Portal (discussed below). Those skilled in the art, and informed by the teachings of this disclosure, will realize that the API may be executed in any of the processing components or servers providing the communications, storage and processing requirements discussed herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},"In the architecture  of , a first group of dedicated access customers A communicate with a low speed access network A via an enhanced integrated access device (IAD) A. Similarly, a dial-in user A and wireless user A communicate with the low speed access network A via respective communications links. The low speed access network A communicates with a high speed core network  via an IP services aggregation switch A. The high speed core network  communicates with the Internet  via a router A, and with a data center or ISP NOC via a router B.","The data center includes a network management server , an authentication server , a Directory Server (which may or may not be an LDAP Directory Server) , various IP services servers , a billing server  and a Dynamic VPN manager . The Dynamic VPN manager  comprises an enhanced application portal , an optional application and registration server , a policy server  and a statistics server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["36","30","310","37","38","30","30","10","320","320","10","30","30","36","37","38"]},"The architecture  of  differs from the architecture  of  in that the architecture  of  includes a Dynamic VPN manager , replaces the customer access routers  with enhanced services aggregation switches B and performs various functions which will be described in more detail below.","It is noted that the D-VPN technology of the present invention may also be incorporated in end-user remote or wireless devices, depending on the device's processing power. However, even if the device's processor isn't capable of supporting D-VPN technology, the end-user may still utilize network-based D-VPN services provided by the IP Services Aggregation Switch.","The enhanced IAD  has the combined functionality of an access router as well as the capability to provide converged access to next generation network services, such as converged voice and data. Each Enhanced IAD  is managed by the ISP and is used to connect the customer to the ISP's access network . The Enhanced IAD  is the demarcation point for all services provided by the ISP and provides the interfaces to support these services. Therefore, in addition to Ethernet (10\/100Base-T, Gigabit Ethernet), the Enhanced IAD  should provide one or more customer-facing POTS, Private-Line (T-1\/FT-1), Channelized DS-1, Frame Relay and other interfaces. The Enhanced IAD  is responsible for aggregating and converting these services into the format required by the access network.","The Enhanced IAD  also supports IP services such as routing, IP QoS, IP VPN, Encryption, and Tunneling. It provides key IP services on IP flows that are flowing away from the customer and towards the access network. The Enhanced IAD's IP VPN and QoS configurations can be managed by a policy server and the Enhanced IAD also collects statistics that can be used for billing purposes and SLA verification and management.","The IP Services Aggregation Switch  provides advanced IP services on IP flows that are flowing towards the customer. The combination of Enhanced IAD and IP Services Aggregation Switch provides the bi-directional aspect of Dynamic IP VPN services. The IP Services Aggregation Switch also provides the endpoints for network-based D-VPN Enhanced IADs and have an unmanaged access link to the ISP's edge. The IP Services Aggregation Switch's IP VPN and QoS configurations can be managed by a policy server and the IP Services Aggregation Switch also collects statistics that can be used for billing purposes and SLA verification and management. The IP Services Aggregation Switch provides network edge functionality for many customers.","The Dynamic VPN Manager  implements the Customer Network Management and Policy Server functions described above with respect to . It comprises an Enhanced Application Portal , optional Application Registration Server  and Policy Server . These elements can be kept on separate hardware platforms or collapsed onto one platform as software modules.","The Enhanced Application Portal  provides a single, web-based user interface for D-VPN services. The user interface may be adapted in operation to existing portals, such as Netscape's NetCenter. However, unlike existing portals, the Enhanced Application Portal  is able to direct the configuration of network elements. The Enhanced Application Portal communicates with the Directory Server to access profile information when an IP VPN service is requested, and interfaces to a billing server to record the use of value-added services.","In one embodiment, the Enhanced Application Portal provides an interface with greater network management capabilities that would be accessed by ISP personnel. In other words, ISP network management personnel would access the same Enhanced Application Portal as ISP subscribers do. Based on their login credentials an RBAC authentication system instructs the Enhanced Application Portal to provide ISP network management personnel with additional management capabilities (e.g., management access to the entire ISP network) than those provided to the ISP subscriber. Therefore, the ISP is advantaged by only needing to deploy one IP VPN management system rather than a management system for their subscribers (possibly one management system per customer) and a separate management system for the ISP network management personnel.","The optional Application Registration Server  is used by Application Server Providers (ASPs) to load their application into the ISP network. Information about how the application is accessed and billed, as well as the application profiles, are loaded into the Directory Server by means of the Application Registration Server.","The Policy Server  downloads policies to the network elements , the Enhanced IADs  and IP Services Aggregation Switches . The Policy Server extracts profiles from the directory, converts them into commands understood by the different network elements , and downloads these commands to the network elements when requested by the Enhanced Application Portal .","The remaining servers in the Data Center provide the support structure for D-VPN. The Directory Server  is where user authentication information, application profiles, and all other network information is stored. The Statistics Server  is used to collect traffic information for SLA verification and provides a web-based user interface for customer access. The Network Management Server  implements the Element Management System functionality described above with respect to  and is used to configure the network elements . The Billing Server  records value-added service access information for eventual processing by down-stream billing systems.","IP VPN services use tunneling and security technology to overlay a virtual network on top of a publicly available IP network. Various classes of IP VPN topologies are used, such as end-to-end services, network-based services, and hybrid services. The difference between the topology classes rests with where the endpoints of their tunnels reside. End-to-end topologies have their tunnel endpoints on the customer premises. Network-based topologies have their tunnel endpoints in the ISP's network, typically in their edge routers. Hybrid topologies have some tunnel endpoints on the customer premises and some in the ISP network. By incorporating D-VPN technology in customer premises devices and ISP edge routers, the dynamic management of these classes of IP VPN topologies is enabled.","The inventors contemplate that the users of D-VPN technology include ISPs and, primarily, their business customers (though residential customers may also benefit). Business customer users include both VPN Administrators and end-users. The ISP's operations staff will use these D-VPN capabilities to manage their own IP VPNs, and to manage IP VPNs they sell to business customers who prefer that the ISP manage their IP VPNs. Residential end-users will also benefit from certain aspects of D-VPN technology; namely, the application controlled management of IP VPNs described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]},"The user's D-VPN Request is received by the Enhanced Application Portal (1), which forwards an authorization request (2) to the ISP's Authentication Server. The Authentication Server returns (3) a confirm or deny response based on the user's authorization level. If the authorization is denied, the Enhanced Application Portal returns (4) an appropriate message to the user.","Otherwise, the D-VPN Request is forwarded (5) to the Policy Server, which requests that (6) the Directory Server retrieve the specified profile from the directory. The Directory Server returns (7) the profile to the Policy Server, which converts the profile into configuration parameters for the affected network elements. The Policy Server then transmits (8) the configuration parameters to the network elements. Each network element returns (9) a success or failure indication back to the Policy Server in response to the configuration request.","If the configuration request failed for any network element, the Policy configuration that was in place prior to the user issuing the D-VPN Request. The Policy Server returns (10) the result of the configuration effort back to the Enhanced Application Portal. The Enhanced Application Portal returns (11, 12) the results of the configuration request back to the user. The Billing Server (14) is notified upon successful completion of the D-VPN Request. Absent the failure of a network element configuration request (or other failure), the Dynamic Virtual Private Network Service is initiated (13).","D-VPN Framework and Example D-VPN Enabled Services","The Dynamic IP VPN technology of the present invention places IP VPN management into the hands of the subscriber and Network Operations personnel. A VPN Administrator or end-user can surf or graphically navigate to a web page and create, modify, or delete IP VPN services on-demand. Once these modifications have been submitted, configuration of network elements occurs automatically and the new IP VPN parameters instantaneously take effect.","In addition, the D-VPN technology supports QoS parameters such as bandwidth, delay, and jitter, as well as security capabilities such as encryption, authentication, and filtering. To facilitate the provisioning of these types of services, in one embodiment the ISP supplies QoS and security provisioning templates (i.e., profiles) that are accessed by the customer to apply QoS and security parameters to their underlying Dynamic IP VPN topology. For example, a security profile contains predefined values for parameters used in the establishment of IPSec tunnels. The provisioning templates also help the ISP manage the build-out of their networks by limiting the number of QoS and security choices that users may make.","Network-based applications, such as videoconferencing, are associated with an Enhanced Application Portal, whereby an application's selection implicitly specifies its connectivity, QoS, and security profile. This configuration parameters are pushed to relevant network elements on demand as part of making the application available to a subscriber.","SLA verification information is stored on-line for web-based access by the customer. Billing information is captured and stored for the ISP to enable Usage-based Billing. The billing records contain the value-added service accessed by the customer, when the value-added service began, and its duration.","The above-described D-VPN technology is an enabling technology. The following four services, for example, are based on this technology:\n\n","The following sections describe three example service offerings that are enabled by Dynamic IP VPN technology: (1) Guaranteed Bandwidth, (2) Customer IP VPN Management, and (3) On-Demand Application Subscription. It should be noted that although the descriptions refer to dedicated access customers, the framework is the same for remote and wireless customers as well.","Guaranteed Bandwidth Service","The Guaranteed Bandwidth service is used to provide bi-directional, layer-3 bandwidth management across an access network that has limited bandwidth; for example T-1 access or DSL access. The Guaranteed Bandwidth service allows an end-user to guarantee levels of bandwidth to certain IP flows. For example, to ensure that a file transfer receives 384 Kbps of bandwidth out of a 1.5 Mbps T-1 access link. It should be noted that every end of an IP flow must traverse an access link and that this service can therefore be used to manage the bandwidth for each of these access links.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","510","520","570","530","540","550","560","550","550","550","550","560"]},"Once the bandwidth guarantee has been named and saved for future use, it can be activated using a screen similar to that depicted by  (described below). It can also be recalled, modified, and stored again using a screen similar to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","30","610","30","610","30","10","620","620","610","620","610","600","40","70","10","20"],"sub":["1","2 ","1 ","2 ","1","2"]},"For purposes of this discussion, it is assumed that the first user USERdesires a guaranteed bandwidth service, illustratively an e-commerce service from the second application service provider ASP. The guaranteed bandwidth service is provided as follows: (1) The first user USERcontacts the enhanced application portal  within the Dynamic VPN Manager  of the data center. This contact occurs via a web-based interface, to request, modify or delete a bandwidth guarantee for a certain IP flow across the low speed access network A. (2) The enhanced application portal authenticates the user and verifies that the user is authorized to request a bandwidth guarantee. The user interacts with a user interface screen (such as described above with respect to ) to specify the IP flow and bandwidth, which the enhanced application portal  then forwards to the policy server . If the user is requesting a predefined bandwidth profile, then (3) the policy server  retrieves the profile from the Directory Server , converts the policy into commands understood by the IP services aggregation switch  and enhanced IAD , and transmits the policy to these devices. If the user is requesting a new bandwidth guarantee, the policy server transmits the new request to the appropriate network elements in the command form adapted to these network elements. In this instance, the user is given the option of (4) naming and storing the new bandwidth specification in the directory for future use. If either the enhanced IAD  or IP services aggregation switch  cannot satisfy the request, then the device(s) unable to satisfy the requests informs the policy server  of this condition and the operation is aborted. The end user is then informed of the termination of the operation.","If the request is successful, the enhanced IAD  and IP services aggregation switch  are configured (5) to provide the requested bandwidth to the specified IP flow. The end user is informed of the successful processing of the guaranteed bandwidth request, and the billing the bandwidth guarantee is terminated, either by the end user or by the expiration of a duration parameter, the enhanced application portal  directs the policy server  to return the enhanced IAD  and IP services aggregation switch  to their default settings for the specified IP flow, and the billing server  is directed to cease billing for the service.","Thus, in the above example, an IP Virtual Private Network  is dynamically configured by the first user USERto place the user in communication with the high speed core network . Also in communication with the high speed core network  is the application service provider ASP(in this example) providing the desired service. ISP network management personnel can also use this same procedure to provide bandwidth guarantees between users and ASPs thereby streamlining their current mode of operation, which today requires many activities in order to do so.","Customer IP VPN Management Service","Customer IP VPN Management allows customer VPN Administrators to create, modify, and teardown IP VPN services on demand. VPN Administrators can specify the endpoints, QoS and security level of the IP VPN service as well as the creation time and duration of the service and save this IP VPN Service Definition for future use. Customer IP VPN Management also supports a \u201crepeat\u201d function whereby the VPN Administrator can specify that an IP VPN service of a given duration be created at repetitive times, such as every week, month, or year.","The ISP can also provide a limited set of QoS, or class of service, profiles (for example, Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze, etc.) and security profiles (for example, Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, etc.) that may be applied to the IP VPN service. A QoS profile contains values for the bandwidth, delay, jitter and the like that would be applied to the service. The security profiles specify the type of encryption, the type of tunneling, the packet discard policy and the like that are used by the IP VPN service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","710","720","730","740","750","760","770","750","750","750","750","750","750","750","770"]},"Once the Dynamic IP VPN has been named and saved for future use, it can be activated using a screen similar to that depicted by  (described below).

The Policy Server retrieves the service information from the directory, converts it into the appropriate commands and pushes these commands out to the affected network elements (5). If any affected network element cannot satisfy the request, it informs the Policy Server, the operation is aborted, and the VPN Administrator is informed.","Otherwise, at this point, the affected Enhanced IADs and IP Service Aggregation Switches will have been configured with the appropriate filters, QoS parameters, and security parameters to satisfy the Customer IP VPN Management request. The end-user is informed of the successful processing of the request and the Billing Server (6) is notified of the Customer IP VPN Management service activity. When an active D-VPN is torn down, either by the VPN Administrator or by the expiration of its duration, the Enhanced Application Portal directs the Policy Server to remove the D-VPN's configuration parameters from the affected network elements and informs the Billing Server to stop billing for this service.","On-Demand Application Subscription Service","Network-based applications can be provided by Application Service Providers (ASPs). For this ISP service, an application must first be registered with an Internet Service Provider before it can be accessed by the ISP's end-users. After the ASP and ISP have reached a business agreement to offer the ASP's application on the ISP's network, the ISP will probably require that the application undergo an acceptance testing procedure to ensure that the application functions as advertised and that it does not have any negative effects on the ISP's network. Once the acceptance testing procedure has been completed, the application is ready to be registered on the ISP's network.","Registering the application with the Internet Service Provider allows the ASP to store an application profile that describes the connectivity, security, QoS, and billing information required by the application. Multiple profiles can be stored for the same application, reflecting different qualities of service, levels of security, and billing rates for the application. Once an application has been registered, it is available for use by the ISP's customers. End-users can access the application on-demand, for example an archived video stream, or they can request that the application be made available at a certain time for a specified duration, for example schedule a videoconference.

Otherwise, the Enhanced Application Portal forwards the application profile to the Policy Server (5), which converts the application profile into appropriate commands and pushes them out to the affected network elements (6).","If any affected network element cannot satisfy the request, it informs the Policy Server, the operation is aborted, and the end-user is informed.

When the user leaves the game, the application invokes another API to remove the user from the IP VPN. The API allows an application to perform the operations described for the Guaranteed Bandwidth (), Customer IP VPN Management (), and On-Demand Application Subscription () services without the need for manual intervention. The application utilizes the API to perform these operations transparently to the user, thus sparing the user of the complexities of IP VPN management. Hence, a user effects the management of an IP VPN simply by running an application that hides the IP VPN management from the user. The user doesn't even know they are managing an IP VPN. This is readily seen to be a powerful extension to the prior art, opening up the benefits of IP VPN services to a whole new class of users.","Various modifications to the D-VPN supporting the game may be made. For example, when the game becomes full a particular IP VPN may be closed such that the IP VPN is unable to be selected. For example, if the Desert Storm IP VPN is full, in one embodiment the Desert Storm selection is removed from the select engagement pull down menu . In one embodiment, additional IP VPNs are generated to enable multiple games for","The network may automatically create the various games, and only allow a predefined group of users to play the games on a regular basis. For example, if a group of friends wishes to compete at a predefined time, the above-described D-VPN technology allows reservation of the necessary network resources (connectivity, QoS, security and the like) at the predefined date and time. That is, the IP VPN is set up for the predefined group at a predefined interval, an IP VPN is provisioned and awaiting access by the members of the group. In this case, the IP VPN may be secured by preventing access from other players.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0098"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 13"],"b":["1300","1310","1311","1312","1313","1314","1315","1316","1311","1316"]},"The conferencing application is especially well-suited where sets of user groups need to communicate with each other via a secure means (such as an IP VPN) on a non-permanent but fairly regular basis. The D-VPN technology of the present invention allows these user groups (which may be modeled as a set of end-points) to be defined and stored in the network ahead of time, with easy to remember names. Security levels and quality of service levels are assigned to these user groups as well. That is, for each of the selectable IP VPNs, a list of end points, security and QoS policies are associated with the IP VPN. Once the user selects a particular IP VPN, the D-VPN technology configures the network to provide the desired connectivity, security and QoS such that each user in the closed user group is included within the IP VPN.","In another embodiment of the invention (discussed below with respect to ), the invention is utilized within the context of a Universal Mobile Telecommunications Services (UMTS) packet transport network. In such a packet transport network, a device utilizing the system is assigned a specific Gateway GPRS (Generalized Packet Radio Service) Support Node (GGSN) based upon the most frequent or \u201chome\u201d location of the device. Thus, routing of communications may be inefficient and costly since the home GGSN is always utilized. However, in this embodiment a D-VPN manager (such as a D-VPN manager  as discussed above) cooperating with the various systems (such as the home GGSN) determines the location of a device connecting to the UMTS, retrieves routing policies associated with that device, and provides the routing policies to the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN). The SGSN then causes the device communications to be routed through the GGSN closest to the device, rather than the home GGSN. That is, the GGSN near the communicating device becomes, in effect, the home GGSN. In this manner, the cost to both the user and service provider of communications in non-home areas is reduced, while the QoS is improved.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0101"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 14","FIG. 14","FIG. 14"],"b":"1410","sub":["1 ","1 ","1 ","1 ","2 ","2 ","1 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0102"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 14","FIG. 14"],"b":"70","sub":["1 ","1 ","1 ","2 ","2 ","2 "]},"Those skilled in the art, and informed by the teachings of this disclosure, will realize that the above-described D-VPN-enabled routing updates to the UMTS packet transport networks can be accomplished in real-time to facilitate a user on the move (e.g., in an automobile or train).","In another embodiment of the invention, the D-VPN technology is incorporated into a Code Division Multiple Access 2000 (CDMA-2000) packet transport network. CDMA-2000 is an alternative 3G wireless technology to UMTS.
