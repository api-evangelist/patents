{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/096,674 filed 12 Sep. 2008, and to EP Application Serial No. 08164104.5 filed 10 Sep. 2008, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The present invention relates to specific 2-carboxamide cycloamino urea derivatives, as new, alpha-selective phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibitor compounds, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs thereof and processes for their production. This invention also relates to compositions of these compounds, either alone or in combination with at least one additional therapeutic agent, and optionally in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. This invention still further relates to methods of use of these compounds, either alone or in combination with at least one additional therapeutic agent, in the treatment of a number of diseases, in particular, those mediated by one or more of abnormal activity of growth factors, receptor tyrosine kinases, protein serine\/heroine kinases, G protein coupled receptors and phospholipid kinases and phosphatases.","Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) comprise a family of lipid kinases that catalyze the transfer of phosphate to the D-3\u2032 position of inositol lipids to produce phosphoinositol-3-phosphate (PIP), phosphoinositol-3,4-diphosphate (PIP) and phosphoinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP) that, in turn, act as second messengers in signaling cascades by docking proteins containing pleckstrin-homology, FYVE, Phox and other phospholipid-binding domains into a variety of signaling complexes often at the plasma membrane ((Vanhaesebroeck et al., 70:535 (2001); Katso et al., 17:615 (2001)). Of the two Class 1 PI3Ks, Class 1A PI3Ks are heterodimers composed of a catalytic p110 subunit (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4 isoforms) constitutively associated with a regulatory subunit that can be p85\u03b1, p55\u03b1, p50\u03b1, p85\u03b2 or p55\u03b3. The Class 1B sub-class has one family member, a heterodimer composed of a catalytic p110\u03b3 subunit associated with one of two regulatory subunits, p101 or p84 (Fruman et al., 67:481 (1998); Suire et al., 15:566 (2005)). The modular domains of the p85\/55\/50 subunits include Src Homology (SH2) domains that bind phosphotyrosine residues in a specific sequence context on activated receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, resulting in activation and localization of Class 1A PI3Ks. Class 1B PI3K is activated directly by G protein-coupled receptors that bind a diverse repertoire of peptide and non-peptide ligands (Stephens et al., 89:105 (1997)); Katso et al., 17:615-675 (2001)). Consequently, the resultant phospholipid products of class I PI3K link upstream receptors with downstream cellular activities including proliferation, survival, chemotaxis, cellular trafficking, motility, metabolism, inflammatory and allergic responses, transcription and translation (Cantley et al., 64:281 (1991); Escobedo and Williams, 335:85 (1988); Fantl et al., 69:413 (1992)).","In many cases, PIP2 and PIP3 recruit Aid, the product of the human homologue of the viral oncogene v-Akt, to the plasma membrane where it acts as a nodal point for many intracellular signaling pathways important for growth and survival (Fantl et al., 69:413-423 (1992); Bader et al., 5:921 (2005); Vivanco and Sawyer, 2:489 (2002)). Aberrant regulation of PI3K, which often increases survival through Aid activation, is one of the most prevalent events in human cancer and has been shown to occur at multiple levels. The tumor suppressor gene PTEN, which dephosphorylates phosphoinositides at the 3\u2032 position of the inositol ring and in so doing antagonizes PI3K activity, is functionally deleted in a variety of tumors. In other tumors, the genes for the p110\u03b1 isoform, PIK3CA, and for Akt are amplified and increased protein expression of their gene products has been demonstrated in several human cancers. Furthermore, mutations and translocation of p85\u03b1 that serve to up-regulate the p85-p110 complex have been described in human cancers. Finally, somatic missense mutations in PIK3CA that activate downstream signaling pathways have been described at significant frequencies in a wide diversity of human cancers (Kang at el., 102:802 (2005); Samuels et al., 304:554 (2004); Samuels et al., 7:561-573 (2005)). These observations show that deregulation of phosphoinositol-3 kinase and the upstream and downstream components of this signaling pathway is one of the most common deregulations associated with human cancers and proliferative diseases (Parsons et al., 436:792 (2005); Hennessey at el., 4:988-1004 (2005)).","In view of the above, inhibitors of PI3K alpha would be of particular value in the treatment of proliferative disease and other disorders.","WO2004\/096797 discloses certain thiazole derivatives as inhibitors of PI3K gamma and their pharmaceutical use, particularly for the treatment of inflammatory and allergic conditions.","WO 2005\/021519 also discloses certain thiazole derivatives as inhibitors of PI3K gamma and their pharmaceutical use, particularly for the treatment of inflammatory and allergic conditions.","WO 2006\/051270 also discloses certain thiazole derivatives as inhibitors of PI3K alpha and their pharmaceutical use, particularly due to anti-tumor activity.","WO 2007\/129044 also discloses certain thiazole derivatives as inhibitors of PI3K alpha and their pharmaceutical use, particularly due to anti-tumor activity.","In view of the prior art, there is a need to provide further compounds suitable for treatment of proliferative diseases, particularly to provide compounds having improved selectivity and\/or higher\/improved activity.","It has now been found that the 2-carboxamide cycloamino urea derivatives of the formula (I) given below have advantageous pharmacological properties and inhibit, for example, PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase). In particular, these compounds preferrably show an improved selectivity for PI3K alpha with respect to beta and\/or, delta and\/or gamma subtypes. Hence, the compounds of formula I are suitable, for example, to be used in the treatment of diseases depending on PI3 kinases (in particular PI3K alpha, such as those showing overexpression or amplification of PI3K alpha, somatic mutation of PIK3CA or germline mutations or somatic mutation of PTEN or mutations and translocation of p85 cc that serve to up-regulate the p85-p110 complex), especially proliferative diseases such as tumor diseases and leukaemias. Further, these compounds preferably show improved metabolic stability and hence reduced clearance, leading to improved pharmacokinetic profiles.","In a first aspect, the present invention provides compounds of the formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"31.16mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08227462-20120724-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["A represents heteroaryl;","Rrepresents (1) optionally substituted alkyl; (2) optionally substituted cycloalkyl; (3) optionally substituted aryl; (4) optionally substituted amine; (5) optionally substituted sulfonyl; (6) halo;","Rrepresents hydrogen, deuterium or a substituent as defined for R;","Rrepresents hydrogen, halo, optionally substituted alkyl;\n\nwith the exception of (S)-Pyrrolidine-1,2-dicarboxylic acid 2-amide 1-({5-[2-(tert-butyl)-pyrimidin-4-yl]-4-methyl-thiazol-2-yl}-amide).\n"]}},"The invention may be more fully appreciated by reference to the following description, including the following glossary of terms and the concluding examples. For the sake of brevity, the disclosures of the publications cited in this specification are herein incorporated by reference. As used herein, the terms \u201cincluding\u201d, \u201ccontaining\u201d and \u201ccomprising\u201d are used herein in their open, non-limiting sense.","Any formula given herein is intended to represent compounds having structures depicted by the structural formula as well as certain variations or forms. In particular, compounds of any formula given herein may have asymmetric centers and therefore exist in different enantiomeric forms. If at least one asymmetrical carbon atom is present in a compound of the formula (I), such a compound may exist in optically active form or in the form of a mixture of optical isomers, e.g. in the form of a racemic mixture. All optical isomers and their mixtures, including the racemic mixtures, are part of the present invention. Thus, any given formula given herein is intended to represent a racemate, one or more enantiomeric forms, one or more diastereomeric forms, one or more atropisomeric forms, and mixtures thereof. Furthermore, certain structures may exist as geometric isomers (i.e. cis and trans isomers), as tautomers, or as atropisomers.","Any formula given herein is intended to represent hydrates, solvates, and polymorphs of such compounds, and mixtures thereof.","Any formula given herein is also intended to represent unlabeled forms as well as isotopically labeled forms of the compounds. Isotopically labeled compounds have structures depicted by the formulas given herein except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having a selected atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, and chlorine, such as H, H, C, C, C, N, F P, P, S, Cl, I respectively. The invention includes various isotopically labeled compounds as defined herein, for example those into which radioactive isotopes, such as H, C, and C, are present. Such isotopically labelled compounds are useful in metabolic studies (preferably with C), reaction kinetic studies (with, for example H or H), detection or imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in radioactive treatment of patients. In particular, an F or labeled compound may be particularly preferred for PET or SPECT studies. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.","Further, substitution with heavier isotopes, particularly deuterium (i.e., H or D) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements or an improvement in therapeutic index. It is understood that deuterium in this context is regarded as a substituent of a compound of the formula (I). The concentration of such a heavier isotope, specifically deuterium, may be defined by the isotopic enrichment factor. The term \u201cisotopic enrichment factor\u201d as used herein means the ratio between the isotopic abundance and the natural abundance of a specified isotope. If a substituent in a compound of this invention is denoted deuterium, such compound has an isotopic enrichment factor for each designated deuterium atom of at least 3500 (52.5% deuterium incorporation at each designated deuterium atom), at least 4000 (60% deuterium incorporation), at least 4500 (67.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 5000 (75% deuterium incorporation), at least 5500 (82.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 6000 (90% deuterium incorporation), at least 6333.3 (95% deuterium incorporation), at least 6466.7 (97% deuterium incorporation), at least 6600 (99% deuterium incorporation), or at least 6633.3 (99.5% deuterium incorporation). In the compounds of this invention any atom not specifically designated as a particular isotope is meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom. Unless otherwise stated, when a position is designated specifically as \u201cH\u201d or \u201chydrogen\u201d, the position is understood to have hydrogen at its natural abundance isotopic composition. Accordingly, in the compounds of this invention any atom specifically designated as a deuterium (D) is meant to represent deuterium, for example in the ranges given above.","When referring to any formula given herein, the selection of a particular moiety from a list of possible species for a specified variable is not intended to define the moiety for the variable appearing elsewhere. In other words, where a variable appears more than once, the choice of the species from a specified list is independent of the choice of the species for the same variable elsewhere in the formula (where one or more up to all more general expressions in embodiments characterized as preferred above or below can be replaced with a more specific definition, thus leading to a more preferred embodiment of the invention, respectively).","Where the plural form (e.g. compounds, salts) is used, this includes the singular (e.g. a single compound, a single salt). \u201cA compound\u201d does not exclude that (e.g. in a pharmaceutical formulation) more than one compound of the formula (I) (or a salt thereof) is present.","The following general definitions shall apply in this specification, unless otherwise specified:","Halogen (or halo) denotes fluorine, bromine, chlorine or iodine, in particular fluorine, chlorine.

Such salts are formed, for example, as acid addition salts, preferably with organic or inorganic acids, from compounds of formula (I) with a basic nitrogen atom, especially the pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable inorganic acids are, for example, halogen acids, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid. Suitable organic acids are, e.g., carboxylic acids or sulfonic acids, such as fumaric acid or methansulfonic acid. For isolation or purification purposes it is also possible to use pharmaceutically unacceptable salts, for example picrates or perchlorates.

The terms \u201cco-administration\u201d or \u201ccombined administration\u201d or the like as utilized herein are meant to encompass administration of the selected combination partner to a single subject in need thereof (e.g. a patient), and are intended to include treatment regimens in which the agents are not necessarily administered by the same route of administration or at the same time. The term \u201cpharmaceutical combination\u201d as used herein means a product that results from the mixing or combining of more than one active ingredient and includes both fixed and non-fixed combinations of the active ingredients.

Protecting groups are such groups that are no longer present in the final compounds once they are removed, while groups that remain as substituents are not protecting groups in the sense used here which are groups that are added at a starting material or intermediate stage and removed to obtain a final compound. Also in the case of conversions of a compound of the formula (I) into a different compound of the formula (I), protecting groups may be introduced and removed, if useful or required.","The protecting groups may already be present in precursors and should protect the functional groups concerned against unwanted secondary reactions, such as acylations, etherifications, esterifications, oxidations, solvolysis, and similar reactions. It is a characteristic of protecting groups that they lend themselves readily, i.e. without undesired secondary reactions, to removal, typically by acetolysis, protonolysis, solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or also by enzyme activity, for example under conditions analogous to physiological conditions, and that they are not present in the end-products. The specialist knows, or can easily establish, which protecting groups are suitable with the reactions mentioned above and below.","The protection of such functional groups by such protecting groups, the protecting groups themselves, and their removal reactions are described for example in standard reference works, such as J.

Such reactions are known and referred to as substitution reactions. This conversion may take place at the step of the starting material of formula (IIIA or B) or by converting a corresponding compound of formula I.","In a compound of the formula (I) wherein a substituent carries an amino or amino-C-C-alkyl substituent, the amino can be converted into acylamino, e.g. C-C-alkanoylamino or C-C-alkanesulfonylamino, by reaction with a corresponding C-C-alkanoylhalogenide or C-C-alkanesulfonylhalogenide, e.g. a corresponding chloride, in the presence of a tertiary nitrogen base, such as triethylamine or pyridine, in the absence or presence of an appropriate solvent, such a methylene chloride, for example at temperatures in the range from \u221220 to 50\u00b0 C., e.g. at about room temperature.","In a compound of the formula (I) wherein a substituent carries a cyano substituent, the cyano may be converted to an aminomethyl group, e.g. by hydrogenation in the presence of an appropriate metal catalyst, such as Raney Nickel or Raney Cobalt, in an appropriate solvent, e.g. a lower alkanol, such as methanol and\/or ethanol, for example at temperatures in the range from \u221220 to 50\u00b0 C., e.g. at about room temperature.","Salts of a compound of formula (I) with a salt-forming group may be prepared in a manner known per se. Acid addition salts of compounds of formula (I) may thus be obtained by treatment with an acid or with a suitable anion exchange reagent. A salt with two acid molecules (for example a dihalogenide of a compound of formula I) may also be converted into a salt with one acid molecule per compound (for example a monohalogenide); this may be done by heating to a melt, or for example by heating as a solid under a high vacuum at elevated temperature, for example from 130 to 170\u00b0 C., one molecule of the acid being expelled per molecule of a compound of formula I. Salts can usually be converted to free compounds, e.g. by treating with suitable basic compounds, for example with alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal hydrogencarbonates, or alkali metal hydroxides, typically potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide.","Stereoisomeric mixtures, e.g. mixtures of diastereomers, can be separated into their corresponding isomers in a manner known per se by means of suitable separation methods. Diastereomeric mixtures for example may be separated into their individual diastereomers by means of fractionated crystallization, chromatography, solvent distribution, and similar procedures. This separation may take place either at the level of a starting compound or in a compound of formula (I) itself. Enantiomers may be separated through the formation of diastereomeric salts, for example by salt formation with an enantiomer-pure chiral acid, or by means of chromatography, for example by HPLC, using chromatographic substrates with chiral ligands.","It should be emphasized that reactions analogous to the conversions mentioned in this chapter may also take place at the level of appropriate intermediates (and are thus useful in the preparation of corresponding starting materials).","Starting Materials:","The starting materials of the formulae II and III, as well as other starting materials mentioned herein, e.g. below, can be prepared according to or in analogy to methods that are known in the art, are known in the art and\/or are commercially available.

Although trastuzumab has demonstrated durable responses in some patients expressing Her2\/neu-ErbB2, only a subset of these patients respond. Recent work has indicated that this limited response rate can be substantially improved by the combination of trastuzumab with inhibitors of PI3K or the PI13K\/AKT pathway (Chan et al., Breast Can. Res. Treat. 91:187 (2005), Woods Ignatoski et al., Brit. J. Cancer 82:666 (2000), Nagata et al., Cancer Cell 6:117 (2004)).","A variety of human malignancies express activitating mutations or increased levels of Her1\/EGFR and a number of antibody and small molecule inhibitors have been developed against this receptor tyrosine kinase including tarceva, gefitinib and erbitux. However, while EGFR inhibitors demonstrate anti-tumor activity in certain human tumors (e.g., NSCLC), they fail to increase overall patient survival in all patients with EGFR-expressing tumors. This may be rationalized by the fact that many downstream targets of Her1\/EGFR are mutated or deregulated at high frequencies in a variety of malignancies, including the PI3K\/Akt pathway. For example, gefitinib inhibits the growth of an adenocarcinoma cell line in in vitro assays. Nonetheless, sub-clones of these cell lines can be selected that are resistant to gefitinib that demonstrate increased activation of the PI3\/Akt pathway. Down-regulation or inhibition of this pathway renders the resistant sub-clones sensitive to gefitinib (Kokubo et al., Brit. J. Cancer 92:1711 (2005)). Furthermore, in an in vitro model of breast cancer with a cell line that harbors a PTEN mutation and over-expresses EGFR inhibition of both the PI3K\/Akt pathway and EGFR produced a synergistic effect (She et al., Cancer Cell 8:287-297 (2005)). These results indicate that the combination of gefitinib and PI3K\/Akt pathway inhibitors would be an attractive therapeutic strategy in cancer.","The combination of AEE778 (an inhibitor of Her-2\/neu\/ErbB2, VEGFR and EGFR) and RAD001 (an inhibitor of mTOR, a downstream target of Akt) produced greater combined efficacy that either agent alone in a glioblastoma xenograft model (Goudar et al., Mol. Cancer. Ther. 4:101-112 (2005)).","Anti-estrogens, such as tamoxifen, inhibit breast cancer growth through induction of cell cycle arrest that requires the action of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip. Recently, it has been shown that activation of the Ras-Raf-MAP Kinase pathway alters the phosphorylation status of p27Kip such that its inhibitory activity in arresting the cell cycle is attenuated, thereby contributing to anti-estrogen resistance (Donovan, et al, J. Biol. Chem. 276:40888, (2001)). As reported by Donovan et al., inhibition of MAPK signaling through treatment with MEK inhibitor reversed the aberrant phosphorylation status of p27 in hormone refractory breast cancer cell lines and in so doing restored hormone sensitivity. Similarly, phosphorylation of p27Kip by Aid also abrogates its role to arrest the cell cycle (Viglietto et al., Nat. Med. 8:1145 (2002)).","Accordingly, in a further aspect, the compounds of formulas I are used in the treatment of hormone dependent cancers, such as breast and prostate cancers. By this use, it is aimed to reverse hormone resistance commonly seen in these cancers with conventional anticancer agents.","In hematological cancers, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), chromosomal translocation is responsible for the constitutively activated BCR-Abl tyrosine kinase. The afflicted patients are responsive to imatinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as a result of inhibition of Abl kinase activity. However, many patients with advanced stage disease respond to imatinib initially, but then relapse later due to resistance-conferring mutations in the Abl kinase domain. In vitro studies have demonstrated that BCR-Ab1 employs the Ras-Raf kinase pathway to elicit its effects. In addition, inhibiting more than one kinase in the same pathway provides additional protection against resistance-conferring mutations.","Accordingly, in another aspect, the compounds of formulas I are used in combination with at least one additional agent selected from the group of kinase inhibitors, such as Gleevec\u00ae, in the treatment of hematological cancers, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). By this use, it is aimed to reverse or prevent resistance to said at least one additional agent.","Because activation of the PI3K\/Akt pathway drives cell survival, inhibition of the pathway in combination with therapies that drive apoptosis in cancer cells, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, will result in improved responses (Ghobrial et al., CA Cancer J. Clin 55:178-194 (2005)). As an example, combination of PI3 kinase inhibitor with carboplatin demonstrated synergistic effects in both in vitro proliferation and apoptosis assays as well as in in vivo tumor efficacy in a xenograft model of ovarian cancer (Westfall and Skinner, Mol. Cancer Ther. 4:1764-1771 (2005)).","In addition to cancer and proliferative diseases, there is accumulating evidence that inhibitors of Class 1A and 1B PI3 kinases would be therapeutically useful in others disease areas. The inhibition of p110\u03b2, the PI3K isoform product of the PIK3CB gene, has been shown to be involved in shear-induced platelet activation (Jackson et al., Nature Medicine 11:507-514 (2005)). Thus, a PI3K inhibitor that inhibits p110\u03b2 would be useful as a single agent or in combination in anti-thrombotic therapy. The isoform p110\u03b4, the product of the PIK3CD gene, is important in B cell function and differentiation (Clayton et al., J. Exp. Med. 196:753-763 (2002)), T-cell dependent and independent antigen responses (Jou et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 22:8580-8590 (2002)) and mast cell differentiation (Ali et al., Nature 431:1007-1011 (2004)). Thus, it is expected that p110\u03b4-inhibitors would be useful in the treatment of B-cell driven autoimmune diseases and asthma. Finally, the inhibition of p110\u03b3, the isoform product of the PI3KCG gene, results in reduced T, but not B cell, response (Reif et al., J. Immunol. 173:2236-2240 (2004)) and its inhibition demonstrates efficacy in animal models of autoimmune diseases (Camps et al., Nature Medicine 11:936-943 (2005), Barber et al., Nature Medicine 11:933-935 (2005)).","The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound of formula (I), together with a pharmaceutically acceptable excepient suitable for administration to a human or animal subject, either alone or together with other anticancer agents.","The invention further provides methods of treating human or animal subjects suffering from a cellular proliferative disease, such as cancer.

Representative kits include a PI3K inhibitor compound (e.g., a compound of formula (I)) and a package insert or other labeling including directions for treating a cellular proliferative disease by administering a PI3K inhibitory amount of the compound(s).","In general, the compounds of formula (I) will be administered in a therapeutically effective amount by any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve similar utilities. The actual amount of the compound of formula (I), i.e., the active ingredient, will depend upon numerous factors such as the severity of the disease to be treated, the age and relative health of the subject, the potency of the compound used, the route and form of administration, and other factors. The drug can be administered more than once a day, preferably once or twice a day. All of these factors are within the skill of the attending clinician. Therapeutically effective amounts of compounds of formulas I may range from about 0.05 to about 50 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day; preferably about 0.1-25 mg\/kg\/day, more preferably from about 0.5 to 10 mg\/kg\/day. Thus, for administration to a 70 kg person, the dosage range would most preferably be about 35-70 mg per day.","In general, compounds of formula (I) will be administered as pharmaceutical compositions by any one of the following routes: oral, systemic (e.g., transdermal, intranasal or by suppository), or parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous) administration. The preferred manner of administration is oral using a convenient daily dosage regimen that can be adjusted according to the degree of affliction. Compositions can take the form of tablets, pills, capsules, semisolids, powders, sustained release formulations, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, aerosols, or any other appropriate compositions. Another preferred manner for administering compounds of the formula (I) is inhalation. This is an effective method for delivering a therapeutic agent directly to the respiratory tract.","The choice of formulation depends on various factors such as the mode of drug administration and bioavailability of the drug substance. For delivery via inhalation the compound can be formulated as liquid solution, suspensions, aerosol propellants or dry powder and loaded into a suitable dispenser for administration. There are several types of pharmaceutical inhalation devices-nebulizer inhalers, metered dose inhalers (MDI) and dry powder inhalers (DPI). Nebulizer devices produce a stream of high velocity air that causes the therapeutic agents (which are formulated in a liquid form) to spray as a mist that is carried into the patient's respiratory tract. MDI's typically are formulation packaged with a compressed gas. Upon actuation, the device discharges a measured amount of therapeutic agent by compressed gas, thus affording a reliable method of administering a set amount of agent. DPI dispenses therapeutic agents in the form of a free flowing powder that can be dispersed in the patient's inspiratory air-stream during breathing by the device. In order to achieve a free flowing powder, the therapeutic agent is formulated with an excipient such as lactose. A measured amount of the therapeutic agent is stored in a capsule form and is dispensed with each actuation.","The invention also relates to formulations wherein the particle size of a compound of formula (I) between 10-1000 nm, preferably 10-400 nm. Such pharmaceutical formulations have been developed especially for drugs that show poor bioavailability based upon the principle that bioavailability can be increased by increasing the surface area i.e., decreasing particle size. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,107,288 describes a pharmaceutical formulation having particles in the size range from 10 to 1,000 nm in which the active material is supported on a crosslinked matrix of macromolecules. U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,684 describes the production of a pharmaceutical formulation in which the drug substance is pulverized to nanoparticles (average particle size of 400 nm) in the presence of a surface modifier and then dispersed in a liquid medium to give a pharmaceutical formulation that exhibits remarkably high bioavailability. Both documents are included by reference.","In a further aspect, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a (therapeutically effective amount) of a compound of formula (I), and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Acceptable excipients are non-toxic, aid administration, and do not adversely affect the therapeutic benefit of the compound of formula I. Such excipient may be any solid, liquid, semi-solid or, in the case of an aerosol composition, gaseous excipient that is generally available to one of skill in the art. Solid pharmaceutical excipients include starch, cellulose, talc, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, dried skim milk and the like.","Liquid and semisolid excipients may be selected from glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol and various oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, e.g., peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, etc. Preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions, include water, saline, aqueous dextrose, and glycols.","Compressed gases may be used to disperse a compound of the formula (I) in aerosol form. Inert gases suitable for this purpose are nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc. Other suitable pharmaceutical excipients and their formulations are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, edited by E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Company, 18th ed., 1990).","The amount of the compound in a formulation can vary within the full range employed by those skilled in the art.

Following a 30 minute incubation at 37\u00b0 C., the mix is quenched by adding 50 \u03bcL of ACN containing the MS internal standard (2 \u03bcM alprenolol). The T=0 min time point is processed by combining 25 \u03bcL of enzyme\u2022substrate mixture directly with 50 \u03bcL of ACN containing the MS internal standard (2 \u03bcM alprenolol). 25 \u03bcL of the cofactor solution is added (2 mM NADPH in 50 mM KPi plus 4 mM MgCl2; optionally including 2 mM UDPGA for CYP+UGT assays) to simulate the complete quenched reaction mixture.","The bulk reactions for the remaining time points are initiated by addition of 125 \u03bcL of cofactor solution (2 mM NADPH in 50 mM KPi plus 4 mM MgCl2) to the remaining 125 \u03bcL of enzyme\u2022substrate mixture. For UGT metabolism, 2 mM UDPGA, is included in the cofactor solution, as well. At specific reaction time points (eg. 5, 15, 30 minutes), reaction aliquots (50 \u03bcL) are removed and reactions are terminated by addition of acetonitrile (50 \u03bcL) containing mass spectrometry internal standard (2 \u03bcM alprenolol).
