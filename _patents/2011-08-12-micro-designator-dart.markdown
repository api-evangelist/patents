title: Micro designator dart
abstract: A micro designator dart engages a target to allow for designation and tracking of the target by transmitting a radio-frequency identification code. The housing of the micro designator dart is configured to enclose its components and deform upon impact with a target to allow a target-engaging member to physically attach the micro designator dart to the target. Also upon impact with the target, an impact-sensitive triggering mechanism in the micro designator dart activates a power source, causing a transmitter to send a predetermined coded infrared signal to the seeker unit of a precision guided munitions system. The micro designator dart may also include a self-destruct device.

Such a device may include, but not be limited to, a rifle, a hand gun, a munitions system, a gas gun, an air gun, a crossbow, a bow, a slingshot, or a human.","As used herein, the term \u201cquasi-unique signal\u201d refers to a predetermined coded infrared signal that may or may not be encrypted on one or more levels and which is identifiable as being transmitted from a specific source.","As used herein, the term \u201cradio-frequency identification module\u201d refers to any device programmed to produce a predetermined coded infrared signal that can be interpreted seeker unit.","As used herein, the term \u201cseeker unit\u201d refers to the component of a precision guided munitions system that locates and tracks the intended target and guides the munitions to the target.","As used herein, the term \u201cself-destruct device\u201d refers to a component designed to destroy itself and the device containing it and which may be comprised of an encapsulated explosive, an acid, a corrosive, or combinations thereof.","As used herein, the term \u201cstructural deformation site\u201d refers to any contour, aperture, perforation, area of different or altered material, weakness or any other structural modification known in the art that allows a housing to specifically change its shape, size, dimensions or other physical properties when force is imparted on that housing.","As used herein, the term \u201ctarget-engaging member\u201d refers to any structure, device, method or material which may permanently or selectively attach a micro designator dart to a surface. A target-engaging member may include, but is not limited to, a piercing structure and may also include magnets, adhesives, methods of biological adhesion, or other method or structure, or combination of methods and structures.","Precision-guided munitions (PGMs) and munitions systems are used to strategically hit a specific target in order to minimize damage to surrounding areas and civilians. Reducing casualties is a goal which dominates tactical decisions when planning military actions.","Improved guided munitions technologies have significantly reduced casualties. For example, the number of civilian deaths for the current Iraq conflict is estimated to be 19 times less than that for the WWII bombings in Germany, and approximately 162 times less than that for the WWII bombings of Japan.","However, ground and aircraft personnel involved in munitions operations which involve \u201ctagging\u201d a target are still at great risk despite the considerable accuracy of the weapons.","Laser-guided PGM systems known in the art require a target to be tagged or tracked by a designator manually operated by a person on the ground or in an aircraft. To tag a target, a human operator, whether on-ground or in an aircraft, aims a laser designator at the target. The laser designator's beam usually occurs in a series of coded pulses, which allows multiple designators to operate in close proximity. The human operator must keep the laser designator on the target until the signal is no longer needed.","Use of a human operator imposes other logistical burdens and costs. Considerable technical planning is necessary to avoid ground and aircraft personnel casualties. In addition, laser target designators cannot be used when it is not practical or safe to place a human operator near enough to the target for tagging.","There is an unmet need for technology which can tag a target without placing ground and air personnel at risk and which is compatible with current guided munitions systems and seeker subsystems.","The present invention is a micro designator dart with a deformable housing which forms at least one internal chamber containing a radio-frequency identification module, a signal transmitter, a controller, a power source, impact-sensitive triggering mechanisms, and a target-engaging member. The target-engaging member attaches the housing to the target, and the act of attachment activates a triggering mechanism. The impact-sensitive triggering mechanism activates the power source, which is operatively coupled to the controller. The controller is configured with software to activate the signal transmitter and initiate transmission of a predetermined coded infrared signal which is received by a remotely located receiver.","Various embodiments of the invention may utilize nanotechnology and micro technology, such as MEMS (Micro-Electronic-Mechanical-Systems), to design a system that could launch and deliver a designator system using a standard rifle or other projectile launcher, therefore leaving the shooter out of danger.","For the purpose of promoting an understanding of the present invention, references are made in the text to exemplary embodiments of a micro designator dart, only some of which are described herein. It should be understood that no limitations on the scope of the invention are intended by describing these exemplary embodiments. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that alternate but functionally equivalent materials, components, and configurations may be used. The inclusion of additional elements may be deemed readily apparent and obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. Specific elements disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one of ordinary skill in the art to employ the present invention.","It should be understood that the drawings are not necessarily to scale; instead, emphasis has been placed upon illustrating the principles of the invention. In addition, in the embodiments depicted herein, like reference numerals in the various drawings refer to identical or near identical structural elements.","Moreover, the terms \u201csubstantially\u201d or \u201capproximately\u201d as used herein may be applied to modify any quantitative representation that could permissibly vary without resulting in a change in the basic function to which it is related.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","10","10"]},"In the exemplary embodiment shown in , radio-frequency identification (RFID) module  is any processing component or memory storage device configured to produce or store a predetermined coded infrared signal that can be interpreted by a precision-guided munitions seeker unit (not shown) to identify a target. In various embodiments, the predetermined coded infrared signal may be a quasi-unique or encrypted signal. Before launching micro designator dart , RFID module  transmits the predetermined coded infrared signal to be used by a seeker unit.","Also shown in  is controller , which controls power source  and operatively couples power source  and transmitter . Controller  also controls the operation and performance of RFID module .","In the exemplary embodiment shown in , power source  is a battery that provides power to controller  and, therefore, transmitter . In further embodiments, power source  may be a capacitor, a solar energy converter, MEMS component, NEMS component, accumulator or any other device known in the art that may be used to supply power to controller .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["80","60","80","50"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["30","40","30","10","40"]},"In the exemplary embodiment shown, in order to prevent premature activation, triggering mechanism  is designed not to activate unless micro designator dart  experiences a reverse force of more than 70 foot pounds. In further exemplary embodiments, triggering mechanism  may be configured with more or less sensitivity. In still further exemplary embodiments, triggering mechanism  may be secured for shipping and storage.","In further exemplary embodiments, triggering mechanism  may be designed to not activate from a free fall of less than a specified distance, such as 2 meters. For example, triggering mechanism  may be designed to not activate until an impact force greater than that generated by a 2 meter drop. In still further exemplary embodiments, triggering mechanism  may be configured with an accelerometer or other device capable of measuring accelerations, changes in direction or other forces exhorted upon micro designator dart  which may cause triggering mechanism  to activate or not.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["20","20","20","100","20","20","100"]},"Also shown in  is optional self-destruct device , which is a device to destroy micro designator dart  when necessary. Self-destruct device  is activated by controller . In various embodiments, self-destruct device  may be time-delayed. For example, controller  may be programmed to detonate self-destruct device  at a predetermined time following activation of transmitter . Self-destruct device  may also be configured to activate at another predetermined time. In still further exemplary embodiments, self-destruct device  may be remotely activated. When designed to be remotely activated, self-destruct device  or controller  may require additional signal-receiving and activation components.","In the embodiment shown in , self-destruct device  is an encapsulated explosive. In still further exemplary embodiments, self-destruct device  may contain a substance or device other than an encapsulated explosive, such as an acid, corrosive, or any other destructive substance known in the art to destroy micro designator dart .","In some exemplary embodiments, self-destruct device  may be designed to destroy the entire micro designator dart . Destruction of the entire micro designator dart  may avoid the necessary implementation of counter measure to retrieve any sensitive data or technology. However, in other exemplary embodiments, self-destruct device  may be designed to destroy only specific components of micro designator dart . For example, self-destruct device  may be configured to destroy only controller . In still further exemplary embodiments, self-destruct device  may be configured to destroy a select group of components, such as RFID module , controller  and transmitter .","In further exemplary embodiments, self-destruct device  may be specifically located or arranged within micro designator dart  to destroy specific components or groups of components.","In further exemplary embodiments, self-destruct device  may be designed or programmed to self-destruct upon impact of micro designator dart  with a target. In still further exemplary embodiments, self-destruct device  may be configured to self-destruct  at a specified time following impact.","In still further exemplary embodiments, self-destruct device  may be entirely omitted. For example, micro designator darts  used for training purposes may omit self-destruct device  or other components, such as controller , RFID module , triggering mechanism  or power source  in order to decrease some expenses associated with training. However, in order to preserve the weight, size and accuracy of training, additional weight components may be added to micro designator dart  for training purposes.","In the exemplary embodiment shown in , target-engaging member , impact-sensitive triggering mechanism , power source , RFID module , controller , self-destruct device , and transmitter  are all enclosed within housing .","In some exemplary embodiments, the position and arrangement of target-engaging member , impact-sensitive triggering mechanism , power source , RFID module , controller , self-destruct device , and transmitter  may differ in order to accommodate different housing shapes. For example, when housing  is spherical, components of micro designator dart  may be arranged non-linearly to accommodate the spherical housing.","In further exemplary embodiments, target-engaging member  may be contained within housing  or exposed on the exterior surface of housing .","In some exemplary embodiments, when significant force is not required to attach micro designator dart  to a target, micro designator dart  may be deployed by gas or air guns, crossbow, slingshot, or other low-impact means, including manually (e.g., throwing). For example, the force generated by a crossbow or other similar means of deployment is sufficient to attach micro designator dart  to soft targets, including, but not limited to, vehicles, cars, boats, rafts, unarmored surfaces, stucco, wood, plastics, composites and fabrics. However, the distance micro designator dart  needs to travel to engage a target is also a factor in determining the means of deployment.","In further exemplary embodiments, micro designator dart  may need to be physically altered in order to pierce harder targets, such as concrete, masonry and steel. For example, micro designator dart  may contain an appropriate metal (e.g., titanium), ceramic, polymer or other coatings and\/or structures to enable the \u2018micro dart\u2019 to penetrate hard targets or resistant materials. Greater force is also required to pierce hard targets, and therefore greater speeds, and micro designator dart  may also be adapted to withstand these greater speeds. For example, velocities greater than 500 feet per second, or more than 200 foot pounds of force, are required at impact to penetrate concrete.","In still further exemplary embodiments, the force required to engage a target may be dependent on the composition and materials of micro designator dart , rather than the material of a target. For example, a micro designator dart  made of titanium or hard metal will require more force to deform, as opposed to a micro designator dart  made of plastic.","In some exemplary embodiments, micro designator dart  may be remotely deactivated, and transmitter  remotely turned off. Remotely deactivating micro designator dart  helps prevent against accidental signally. Additionally, a weapon programmed to seek micro designator dart  may be controlled by a forward observer who may deactivate the weapon if micro designator dart  attaches to the wrong target, accidentally begins transmitting or otherwise undesirably activates.","A weapon programmed to seek micro designator dart  may also be programmed to ignore a signal transmitted by micro designator dart . For example, if micro designator dart , or transmitter , is stolen, tampered with, or accidentally deployed or activated, any weapon programmed to seek micro designator dart  may be reprogrammed to ignore the specific signal transmitted by micro designator dart .","In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in , micro designator dart  is approximately the size and shape of a standard bullet with a metallic housing . In further exemplary embodiments, housing  may be contoured or be specifically designed for launching from a specific projectile-launching device, such as a rifle, crossbow, bow, slingshot, or other device. In various embodiments, micro designator dart  may be used with off-the-shelf weapons.","In further exemplary embodiments, micro designator dart  may use nanotechnology and micro technology, such as micro-electronic-mechanical-systems (MEMS) or nano-electronic-mechanical-systems (NEMS), in order to reduce the size and weight of micro designator dart .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","10","20","80","20","10","20","20"]},"In some exemplary embodiments, housing  may be configured with a pierceable membrane or area specifically adapted to be pierced by target-engaging member .
