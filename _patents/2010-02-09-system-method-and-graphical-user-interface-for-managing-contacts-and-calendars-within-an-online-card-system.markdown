No. 12\/638,844, filed Dec. 15, 2009 entitled, \u201cGraphical User Interface, System And Method For Managing Contacts Within An Online Stationery System\u201d.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to the field of network data processing systems. More particularly, the invention relates to an improved architecture and method for managing contacts and calendars within an online stationery system.","2. Description of the Related Art","Web-based systems for designing stationery such as wedding invitations, birth announcements, thank you cards, birthday party invitations, etc, are currently available over the Internet. These services allow a user to enter a personalized message on a stationery template via a Web browser. The service then prints the stationery with the personalized message and mails the printed stationery and envelopes to the end user. The end user then mails the stationery to one or more recipients.","Some online stationery services will also mail stationery directly to recipients on behalf of the end user. In order to do so, the user must provide the stationery service with the names and addresses of the recipients. -illustrate screenshots from one particular stationery Website (www.greetz.com) which provides options for manually entering a new name\/address of a recipient  or importing a group of addresses from an Excel spreadsheet . As illustrated in , upon selecting an Excel spreadsheet from the user's local hard drive, the user is prompted with a plurality of drop-down menus  to identify the data fields for the address lines. Once the import is complete, a list of recipients  is provided as shown in . The end user is permitted to delete names from the list (by selecting a trash icon) but no other mechanism is provided for editing or otherwise managing the list of recipients on the online stationery service.","Consequently, what is needed is an improved system and method for importing and managing contacts within an online stationery service.","A system, method and graphical user interface (GUI) are described for managing a contacts and calendar database within an online stationery\/card service. For example, a system implemented by an online stationery\/card service is described allowing a user to personalize and send non-electronic stationery\/cards, the system comprising: a Web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for designing stationery\/cards and envelopes for the stationery\/cards comprising: an envelope design region for designing an envelope to be used for mailing the stationery\/cards selected by the end user, the envelope design region having a graphical layout corresponding to a paper envelope to be used to mail a stationery card selected by the end user, the envelope design region comprising: a return address region comprising one or more text boxes for entering a return address of the end user; an address region comprising one or more text boxes for entering the address of a recipient, wherein the address region includes a first link to generate a list of contacts in the user's contacts database, wherein upon selection of an entry from the list, the address region is automatically populated with the address corresponding to the selected entry, and a second link to generate one or more options for contacting the recipient when the user does not know the mailing address of the recipient, at least one of the options comprising contacting the recipient by email, wherein a data field for entering the recipient's email address is generated in response to selection of the second link; and a stationery\/card personalization engine executed in response to the user selecting a stationery\/card design, the stationery personalization engine providing the end user with a set of personalization options related to the selected stationery\/card design, and generating personalized stationery with the selected stationery\/card design based on user input.","Described below is a system and method for managing contacts and calendars within an online stationery\/card system. Throughout the description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form to avoid obscuring the underlying principles of the present invention.","It should be noted that the terms \u201cstationery,\u201d \u201ccards\u201d and \u201cgreeting cards\u201d are used interchangeably herein. For example, the term \u201cstationery\u201d may refer to greeting cards (e.g., holiday cards, birthday cards), invitations (e.g., wedding, birthday invitations, etc), and any other form of non-electronic communication and\/or images printed on a medium (e.g., paper, fabric, etc) using any form of printing device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200"]},"At , a contacts import module  manages the importation of contacts from various local and\/or online contact databases identified by the end user. In the illustrated embodiment, the contacts import module  comprises a format conversion module  and a conflict detection and resolution module . As shown in , the format conversion module  reads contacts data from online contacts databases -; local contacts databases  (i.e., \u201clocal\u201d to the user's client computer ); and\/or existing contacts  already stored on the online stationery service  (e.g., the end user may have already established an account on the online stationery service  to send stationery and may have entered information for a set of contacts ). If the online\/local contact formats are supported, determined at , then at , the format conversion module converts the contacts to a format optimized for use on an online stationery service . To perform the format conversion, the format conversion module  parses the contact data in source data structure (e.g., the CSV file, vCard file, etc), extracts the data, and assigns the data to appropriate data fields in the new data structure. Various well known techniques for converting data from one format to another may be employed by the format conversion module . Once converted (and following conflict detection described below), the contacts data is stored in its new format within a contacts database  on the stationery service. Various features associated with this new data format are described in detail below (see, e.g., and associated text).","At , a conflict detection and resolution module  merges the local and\/or online contacts with existing contacts  already stored on the online stationery service  and detects any conflicts which may result from the merge operation. A conflict may result if one or more contacts being imported are already stored within the existing contacts database . In such a case, the conflict detection and resolution module  resolves the conflicts at  using a set of conflict resolution rules (described below). Once all conflicts have been resolved, the data is persisted within the contacts database  and made accessible to end users via the stationery service contacts manager . In one embodiment, the contacts database  is implemented using mySQL. However, various different database formats may be employed while still complying with the underlying principles of the invention (e.g., Microsoft SQL, IBM SQL, etc).","At , the user identifies one or more \u201chouseholds\u201d within the stationery service contacts database . As described below, households are specialized groups of contacts who live at the same address. The concept of a \u201chousehold\u201d is a particularly useful abstraction for an online stationery service  which mails stationery on behalf of a user.","As illustrated in , in one embodiment, all operations to the stationery service contacts database  occur through the stationery service contacts manager . That is, the stationery service contacts database  is used for persistent storage of contacts data containing the features described herein and the stationery service contacts manager  is the application-layer program code used to perform operations on the stationery service contacts database  as described below. The presentation and session management logic  comprises the program code for maintaining user sessions and for dynamically generating Web pages containing (among other things) the graphical user interface (GUI) features for manipulating contacts data as illustrated herein.","Returning to the method of , at , the user selects and personalizes a stationery design. In one embodiment, this is accomplished with a stationery personalization engine  such as that described in co-pending application entitled SAMFDAGOS, Ser. No. 12\/188,721, filed Aug. 8, 2008, which is assigned to the assignee of the present application and which is incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, the stationery personalization engine  performs all of the functions described in the co-pending application as well as the additional functions described herein (e.g., selecting contacts\/households for a stationery mailing via the stationery service contacts manager , selecting between a default message or a personal message for the contacts\/households, etc).","At , the end user creates a default message to be used for a stationery mailing and, at , the contacts and\/or households for the mailing are identified by the end user. If the user wishes to include a personalized message in lieu of the default message for one or more contacts\/households, determined at , then the user selects a contact\/household at  and enters the personalized message for the contact\/household at . If any additional personalized messages are to be included, determined at , then steps  and  are repeated until all personalized messages have been entered.","At , all of the information related to the stationery order, including the selected stationery design, default messages, personalized messages and associated contacts and households are formatted for printing by a print module  which generates a print job . The formatting may include converting the stationery data mentioned above into a format usable by a particular printer. By way of example, a letter press printer may require different formatting than a digital press printer. In one embodiment, the specifications for the print job are encapsulated as metadata in an Extensible Markup Language (\u201cXML\u201d) document and transmitted to an external print service . In one embodiment, the XML document includes a hyperlink (e.g., a URL) to the formatted print job  on the online stationery service . The print service  then accesses the print job by selecting the hyperlink. Regardless of how the print job is accessed, at , the formatted print job  is transmitted to either an internal printer  or an external print service  (e.g., over the Internet). Once printing is complete, the online stationery service  or the print service  mails the stationery to the contacts and\/or households identified by the end user.","Having provided an overview of the method set forth in  and the architecture illustrated in , various specific details associated with managing contacts, generating print jobs and mailing stationery from an online stationery service  will now be provided. It should be noted, however, that the underlying principles of the invention are not limited to the particular architecture shown in  or the particular method set forth in .","In one embodiment, the different graphical user interface (GUI) features described herein are generated by presentation and session management logic  executed on the online stationery service. In one embodiment, various well known functional modules associated within the presentation and session management logic  are executed to receive input, process the input, interact with one or more other modules shown in , and dynamically generate Web pages containing the results. The Web pages are then transmitted to the user's client computer  and rendered on a browser . The Web pages may be formatted according to the well known HyperText Markup Language (\u201cHTML\u201d) or Extensible HTML (\u201cXHTML\u201d) formats, and may provide navigation to other Web pages via hypertext links. One embodiment utilizes Dynamic HTML (\u201cDHTML\u201d), a collection of technologies used together to create interactive Web sites by using a combination of a static markup language (e.g., HTML), a client-side scripting language (e.g., JavaScript), a presentation definition language (e.g., CSS), and the Document Object Model (\u201cDOM\u201d).","Turning now to , in one embodiment, the user is prompted to identify online and offline contacts databases via a series of hyperlinks - (see, e.g., step  in ). In the example shown, the three online links  include Facebook, Gmail and Yahoo! contacts. A set of five links  are provided for importing contacts from different types of CSV files and a set of two links  are provided for importing contacts from different vCard files.","In one embodiment, when importing online address books such as those available from Facebook, Gmail and Yahoo!, the user is asked to provide authentication data such as a user name and a password. The online stationery service  then uses the authentication data to log in to the online service and retrieve the contacts list on behalf of the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["201","203","501","503","501","502","503","505","510","211","200","205"]},"Check-boxes  and  are also provided to import group names with the contacts and to add the imported contacts to a specific group within the user's existing address book . The specific group is identified via a drop-down menu containing a list of available groups. Once the set of contacts are selected within region  the user imports the contacts by selecting an import button .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["601","602"]},"As mentioned above, a conflict detection and resolution module  identifies existing contacts  which match contacts being imported from the various sources - and attempts to resolve any conflicts which may exist between the data. In one embodiment, each conflict is identified to the end user and the user is prompted to specify how to resolve the conflict. For example,  illustrates a Web-based graphical user interface presented to the user which shows the contact data contained in the existing contacts database , the contact data to be imported , and the merged contact data which would result from the import . In one embodiment, the differences between the existing and imported data is highlighted. For example, in , data found in the existing database but not the database to be imported is highlighted with a first color (e.g., orange); and data found in the contacts database to be imported but not the existing contacts database is highlighted with a second color (e.g., green). Thus, the merged contact data  is shown with some entries ,  highlighted in the first color and some entries , ,  highlighted in the second color.","As shown in , some of the conflicting data is combined into corresponding fields within the merged contact . For example, in , the \u201cnotes\u201d field is appended to include notes ,  from both the existing and the imported contacts. However, certain data fields cannot be merged in this manner. For example, if the existing contact  has a different home address than the imported contact , then the conflict detection and resolution module  must select one of the two addresses as the primary home address. In one embodiment, when a conflict of this nature occurs, the default operation of the conflict detection and resolution module  is to keep the data from the existing contact  and to append the data from the imported contact into the notes field of the merged contact . For example, in , the nickname (\u201cAl\u201d), title (\u201cEngineer\u201d) and company (\u201cTiny Prints\u201d) are selected from the existing contact  and the nickname (\u201cDJ Albert\u201d), title (\u201cDJ\u201d) and company (\u201cMr. DJ Productions\u201d) from the imported contact  are appended within the notes field  of the merged contact .","In one embodiment, the user is given the option to select the existing version , the imported version  or the merged version  using a mouse, keyboard, and\/or other cursor control device. A checkbox option  is also provided to allow the user to apply the choice to all remaining contacts to be reviewed. If the checkbox  is not selected, the user will review and select each conflict individually.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["210","810","811","812","801","802","803","212","803","810","811"]},"Multiple contacts and\/or households may be highlighted in region  (e.g., by holding CTRL and selecting with a mouse) and processed by selecting options in region . For example, a drop-down menu of available groups  allows the user to associate the highlighted contacts with a group. An export button  allows the user to export the contacts to a file (e.g., a CSV or vCard file). A \u201cmerge into household\u201d button , when selected, allows the end user to create a new household comprised of the selected contacts. Upon selection of this button, the end user is presented with a field for entering a new household name. As illustrated in , once a new household is created, the household  is displayed within the second region  of the GUI along with other contacts and\/or households. As illustrated, the contacts  associated with the household are displayed beneath the household entry  and indented.","As illustrated in , in one embodiment of the GUI, when a household entry  is selected from within the second region  of the GUI, contacts listed in the second region may be clicked on and dragged into a household detail region  to add the contacts to the household. Multiple contacts may be selected by selecting the CTRL key and highlighting the contacts with a mouse or other cursor control device.","As illustrated in , in one embodiment, a user may select one or more contacts  (e.g., by holding down the CTRL key) and drag the contacts over another contact  in the contact list. Doing so will provide the user the option to either merge the contacts (by selecting a merge button ) or to create a new household with the contacts (by selecting a \u201cnew household\u201d button ).","Returning to , region  also includes a selectable option to \u201csend cards\u201d to the contacts selected in region . Selecting this option causes the stationery personalization engine  to begin the stationery design process using contacts identified by the stationery service contacts manager  (e.g., starting at step  in ). For example, the user will be provided the option to select a stationery template and enter a default message and\/or a personalized message for certain contacts. After the mail order is completed, the print module  will transmit the stationery order to one of the internal printers  or the external print service  and, after printing, the stationery order will be mailed to the selected contacts.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["811","1201","1202","1203","1204","1210","1211","1205","1207","1205","1206","1207","1212"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 14"],"b":["811","1301","1303","212","1410","1401","1402"]},"In addition, a \u201csend card\u201d link ,  is provided for each address in the contact details window which initiates the process of selecting, designing and mailing stationery for the contacts associated with the address (e.g., as described above with respect to the \u201csend card\u201d button in region  of ).","In addition, a \u201creminder\u201d region  is provided within the contact details window to provide reminders of upcoming dates such as birthdays and anniversaries for contacts within the user's contacts list. The layout within the region comprises an indicator of the type of reminder (e.g., birthday), followed by the date of the reminder, followed by a brief description (e.g., 40 years old in 6 months). In one embodiment, certain contact data such as birthdays and anniversaries are identified by the stationery service contacts manager  as reminders. In addition, links are provided ,  to configure automated reminders for the end user. For example, in one embodiment, upon setting a reminder for a particular event, the stationery service contacts manager  will transmit an email, instant message, or SMS message to remind the end user of the event and\/or will update the user's calendar with the event. Various other types of reminders may be employed while still complying with the underlying principles of the invention. In addition, for each reminder, a \u201csend card\u201d link ,  is provided to initiate the process described above to design and mail stationery to the contact associated with the reminder.","In addition, a purchase history region  is provided within the contact details window to display the recent purchase history of the end user. As illustrated, entries within the purchase history include images of the stationery designs  and  recently purchased by the end user, along with an indication of the stationery type and message, and the date that the stationery was purchased.","In addition to using the address validation techniques described above, one embodiment of the invention confirms current mailing addresses by transmitting email messages to contacts. As illustrated in , in response to the selection of a particular contact, a window  is presented asking the end user if an email request should be sent. A default request message is used unless the user selects the checkbox for adding a personal message. If this checkbox is selected a window such as  appears to allow the user to enter a personal message. In one embodiment, upon selection of \u201cadd a personal message\u201d check box, the message field is pre-populated with the default message, which may then be edited by the user.","A GUI for selecting multiple contacts is illustrated at . In this embodiment, contacts to receive the email request are selected via check-boxes. In one embodiment, certain contacts who have specifically asked not to receive requests and\/or for whom the user does not have an email address are grayed out (thereby preventing selection via a checkbox). User selection of a \u201csend request(s)\u201d button from  or a \u201csend request\u201d button within window  will cause the confirmation request email to be sent to the selected contacts.","Both window  (for a single request) and  (for multiple requests) include a \u201cview sample email\u201d link to display a sample request email. The sample request email may be displayed in a new window, a new DHTML layer, or as an in-line DIV (HTML <div> element).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 16","i":"a ","b":["1601","200","1601"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 16","i":"b ","b":["200","200","1602","1603","1604","1603","1604"]},"In addition to providing reminders within the address book window shown in  and the contact details window shown in , one embodiment of the stationery service contacts manager  will automatically generate reminder emails for the end user.  illustrates one such reminder email in which upcoming dates are listed in chronological order and, for each reminder, links are provided to generate a subsequent reminder - (e.g., \u201cremind me again in 3 days\u201d). In addition, for each reminder, a \u201csend a card\u201d link - is provided which, when selected, initiates the stationery design process on the online stationery service  for the associated contact(s) (as described above). In addition, a secondary listing  is provided for those contacts for which the user has not specifically requested a reminder.","As mentioned above, in one embodiment of the invention, the online stationery service  will mail stationery to selected contacts on behalf of the end user. -illustrate one embodiment of the invention for selecting contacts for a stationery mailing. Two tabs - are provided for specifying contacts. The first tab  generates a series of data entry fields  for specifying a new contact name and address (for someone not found in the user's address book). The second tab  provides a list of selectable contacts  from the user's address book . A drop-down menu  is provided to select specific groups of contacts to be displayed within the list . Individual contacts within the list  are selected via check boxes, as illustrated. Regardless of whether the contacts are entered manually or selected from the address book, the user selects an \u201cadd\u201d button  to add the contact information to the set of contacts for the stationery order. Contacts may be added to one of two different groups: a \u201cmail for me\u201d group  which includes contacts to whom the online stationery service  will mail stationery directly; and a \u201caddress+ship to me\u201d group  which includes contacts for whom the online stationery service will print stationery\/envelops and then mail the order to the end user. In -, the \u201cmail for me group\u201d is opened, thereby displaying those contacts selected for a direct-mail option. The \u201caddress+ship to me\u201d group may be displayed in a similar manner upon selection of a hyperlink , as illustrated in . Specifically, in , two separate lists are compiled: a \u201cmail for me\u201d list  and a \u201caddress+ship to me\u201d list .

Moreover, in one embodiment, the recommendation engine  recommends stationery designs based on the preferences of the user and\/or the preferences of the recipient (if known).","In one embodiment, the scheduling service  implements a scheduling algorithm to ensure that stationery\/card orders are delivered within a specified delivery window and\/or on a specific date. For example, the user may specify that a stationery\/card order is to arrive 3-4 days prior to a recipient's birthday. In such a case, the user does not want the card to arrive to soon (e.g., 2 weeks prior to the birthday) or too late (after the birthday). To precisely schedule stationery\/card orders, one embodiment of the scheduling service  evaluates the time required by the print services required to fulfill the order (e.g., thermography, digital press, etc.), the delivery type (e.g., regular mail, FedEx, etc), and the end user preferences.","In one embodiment, three data points are used to determine the delivery date: processing time, fulfillment time, and shipping transit time. The processing time may be based on the type of order. For example, processing time can be 0 days for greeting cards and several days for some stationery cards (e.g., those which require additional review by the online card\/stationery service prior to fulfillment). The processing time is based on business days so it must factor in non-business days such as Holidays and Weekends to determine the number of calendar days required for processing. Fulfillment time is the number of days required to print, finish and ship\/mail the order and is typically between 1-3 days (e.g., depending on the printing requirements). This time is based on business days for the fulfillment site which, in one embodiment, may be different than business days for the processing site. Shipping transit time is estimated based on the fulfillment site physical location and the shipping address of the recipient. The shipping transit time is based on business days for the shipping carrier and may be different than business days for the processing site and fulfillment site. In one embodiment, after computing the sum of the three data points, the system has the number of calendar days required for the order and determines the date that the order must be sent to the processing site in order to be delivered on the specified delivery date.","Presentation and session management logic  generates the Web-based graphical user interface (GUI) features described below, allowing the end user to view and edit the calendar data, contacts data, filtered card recommendations, and scheduling data. As illustrated in , the presentation and session management logic  communicates with each of the other functional modules and\/or communicates directly with the stationery service databases  to retrieve the data needed for display within the GUI. Embodiments of the Web-based GUI features generated by the presentation and session management logic  are set forth below.","In one embodiment, each of the functional modules illustrated in  exposes an application programming interface (API) to provide access to data managed by that module. For example, the contacts manager  exposes an API allowing the calendar service  (and other modules) to access contacts data and vice versa. Alternatively, each of the functional modules may access the database(s)  directly.","In one embodiment, the calendar service  automatically generates calendar events based on the contacts data stored within the contacts database . By way of example, the calendar events may include birthdays, anniversaries, and other significant milestones associated with each of the contacts in the contacts database . In addition, the contacts manager  stores relationship data identifying the relationship between the user and each of the contacts in the user's contacts database  (e.g., identifying the user's spouse, siblings, parents, children, etc.). The calendar service  uses the relationship data to generate calendar events. For example, if the relationship data identifies the user's mother and father, then the calendar data may associate Mother's Day and Father's Day, respectively, with those contacts. Similarly, if the user is married with children the calendar service may associate his\/her spouse with Mother's Day or Father's Day and\/or the user's wedding anniversary.","Once calendar events are scheduled, in one embodiment, the reminder service  automatically generates reminders for upcoming events. For example, if a friend's birthday is approaching, then the reminder service  will notify the user a specified number of days\/weeks ahead of time, so that the user has time to send a card. The specific timing of the reminder notifications may be specified by the end user and stored along with other user preferences within the user database .","In one embodiment, the reminders are generated and displayed within a Web-based GUI when the user logs in to the online stationery\/card service  (see, e.g., ) and\/or may be sent to the user in the form of an email message or mobile text message. If sent in an email, links to the online stationery\/card service website may be embedded within the message to encourage the user to design a new card (see, e.g.,  and associated text).","In one embodiment, the recommendation engine  generates greeting card\/stationery recommendations based on the occasion, the identity of the contact associated with the occasion, and the end user's preferences. For example, if a particular contact's birthday is approaching, the recommendation engine  may recommend certain greeting card styles (e.g., modern, classical, etc.) based on the contact's preferences and\/or the user's preferences. The filtering logic allows the recommendations to be filtered based on specified variables (e.g., theme, color, card format, card size, number of photos, etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0110"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIG. 22"],"b":["206","2301","2305","2310","2315"]},"The browse region  includes a first plurality of selectable hyperlinks  to allow the end user to browse greeting cards based on a specified occasion (e.g., Birthday, Congratulations, Anniversary, Thank You, St. Patrick's Day, etc.) and a second plurality of selectable hyperlinks  to allow the end user to browse greeting cards based on a specified recipient (e.g., For Her, For Him, For Kids). The occasion hyperlinks  are dynamically generated based on the current date and, in one embodiment, the nearest upcoming holiday is placed at the top of the list. As illustrated, the region for recipients  is subdivided into categories identified by an expandable and contractible icon (\u201cFor Him,\u201d \u201cFor Her,\u201d \u201cFor Kids\u201d). Selecting the icon causes a listing of selectable recipients to appear beneath the expandable and contractible icon. For example, selecting the \u201cfor Kids\u201d icon causes a listing of children in the user's contacts database to appear with the user's own children at the top of the list (if the user has children).","In one embodiment, selecting a particular occasion or recipient from the browse region  causes recommendations associated with the selection to appear within the recommendations region . Similarly, in response to selecting a particular event from the reminder\/calendar region  causes recommendations associated with the event to appear within the recommendations region . In one embodiment, when the user initially logs in to the online stationery\/card service  and arrives at the GUI, recommendations are automatically provided for the entry at the top of the user's reminder list .","Additional details associated with the region  for reviewing and managing scheduled orders and previously-sent orders, are provided in . As illustrated, a first tab  is provided to allow the user to view scheduled card orders and a second tab  is provided to allow the end user to view previously-sent orders. Upon selecting one of the tabs, scheduled or sent cards are displayed below the tab. For example, in , the sent tab  has been selected thereby displaying a set of thumbnail images  and associated descriptions  of previously-sent greeting cards. A \u201csee all\u201d link is provided to allow the end user to view all scheduled or previously-sent cards.","Additional details associated with the recommendations region  are provided in . As illustrated, the recommendations region  includes a plurality of selectable drop-down menus - for filtering the recommendations including a recipient menu  (for identifying a particular recipient), an occasion menu  (for identifying a particular occasion), a theme menu  (for selecting a particular theme), and a style menu  (for selecting a particular stationery\/card style). In response to selections from the drop-down menus, the recommendation engine with filtering logic  shown in  responsively filters the set of recommendations displayed for the user. In one embodiment, the recipient menu  is populated with entries from the user's contacts database.","A set of the users \u201cfavorite\u201d stationery\/card designs for a particular selected occasion are provided in a region  directly beneath the drop-down menus -. For example, if the occasion selected in the occasion menu  is \u201cbirthday\u201d then a set of the user's favorite birthday cards is displayed within region .","In one embodiment, the recommendations provided to the end user are categorized into groups -. In the specific example shown in , the groups include a photo card group  (displaying photo cards only), a group of designs which do not require personalization  (i.e., which can simply be selected and mailed to the end user), and new designs  provided by the online stationery service.
