{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/118,604, filed on Nov. 29, 2008. The disclosure of the above application is incorporated herein by reference.","This disclosure relates to implantable medical devices and, more particularly, to implantable medical electrical leads.","The human anatomy includes many types of tissues that can either voluntarily or involuntarily, perform certain functions. After disease, injury, or natural defects, certain tissues may no longer operate within general anatomical norms. For example, after disease, injury, time, or combinations thereof, the heart muscle may begin to experience certain failures or deficiencies. Certain failures or deficiencies can be corrected or treated with implantable medical devices (IMDs), such as implantable pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) devices, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator devices, or combinations thereof.","IMDs detect and deliver therapy for a variety of medical conditions in patients. IMDs include implantable pulse generators (IPGs) or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) that deliver electrical stimuli to tissue of a patient. ICDs typically include, inter alia, a control module, a capacitor, and a battery that are housed in a hermetically sealed container with a lead extending therefrom. It is generally known that the hermetically sealed container can be implanted in a selected portion of the anatomical structure, such as in a chest or abdominal wall, and the lead can be inserted through various venous portions so that the tip portion can be positioned at the selected position near or in the muscle group. When therapy is required by a patient, the control module signals the battery to charge the capacitor, which in turn discharges electrical stimuli to tissue of a patient through via electrodes disposed on the lead, e.g., typically near the distal end of the lead. Typically, a medical electrical lead includes a flexible elongated body with one or more insulated elongated conductors. Each conductor electrically couples a sensing and\/or a stimulation electrode of the lead to the control module through a connector module.","In the context of implantable defibrillators, most systems include large surface area implantable electrodes to be mounted in or adjacent the heart. One common approach of providing a large surface area electrode is to employ an elongated exposed coil of biocompatible metal. In the context of an endocardial lead, this is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,161,942 issued to Kinney. In the context of an epicardial lead, this is disclosed in the context of U.S. Pat. No. 4,817,634 issued to Holleman et al.","An elongated coil serving as the electrode is typically mounted around the exterior of an insulative lead body. It is believed desirable in this context to stabilize the electrode coil with respect to the lead body, both to provide mechanical integrity and to prevent fibrous ingrowth around the individual coils of the electrode coil. In the above cited Kinney et al. patent and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,934,049, issued to Keikhafer et al., this is accomplished by sliding the coil over the lead body and backfilling the spaces between the electrode coil with a plastic material. In prior U.S. Pat. No. 5,042,143 issued to Holleman, et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,344,708 issued to Bischoff, et al. alternative methods of producing a lead structure similar to that produced in the Keikhafer patent are disclosed. In these patents a plastic tube is stretched. An electrode coil having a inner is then slid over the stretched tube, after which the tube, after which the tube is released, allowing it to return to its previous length. Thereafter, a mandrel is inserted into the tubing, compressing the tubing between the mandrel and the conductor coil. The assembly is thereafter heated, allowing the tubing to flow into spaces between the electrode coil to a desired depth.","U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/549,284 filed Oct. 13, 2006 by Boser also discloses mechanisms for producing leads employing such electrode","The present disclosure relates to medical electrical leads that include a lead body and at least one tubular electrode sub-assembly positioned over and attached to the external surface of the lead body.

The one or more selected attachment sites may occupy only a portion of the inner surface of the tubular liner.","The present disclosure also relates to methods of manufacturing medical electrical leads that include manufacturing a tubular electrode sub-assembly by positioning an electrode over an outer liner surface of a tubular liner, wherein the tubular liner is located on a mandrel and includes a continuous, uninterrupted inner liner surface facing the mandrel, delivering a flowable interstitial liner material including a hardenable organic polymer onto the electrode and tubular liner such that the interstitial liner material fills interstices of the electrode and forms an outer liner surface proximate an outer surface of the electrode, hardening the flowable interstitial liner material to form hardened interstitial liner material within the interstices of the electrode, removing the mandrel from the tubular liner after hardening the interstitial liner material, wherein the tubular liner, the interstitial liner material and the electrode form the tubular electrode sub-assembly.","The methods of manufacture may further include positioning the tubular electrode sub-assembly over an external surface of a lead body after manufacturing the tubular electrode sub-assembly such that the inner liner surface faces the external surface of the lead body, wherein the lead body defines a longitudinal axis extending between a proximal end and a distal end of the lead body, and wherein the longitudinal axis extends through the tubular electrode sub-assembly; attaching the tubular electrode sub-assembly to the external surface of the lead body at one or more selected attachment sites, wherein the one or more selected attachment sites occupy only a portion of an inner liner surface; and electrically connecting a conductive element located within an interior of the lead body to the electrode of the tubular electrode sub-assembly.","The principles described herein are applicable to all types of medical electrical leads. For example, the disclosure applies to cardiovascular leads (e.g. high voltage leads, low voltage leads etc.), neurological leads, or other suitable applications.

The tubular electrode sub-assembly  includes a tubular liner  and electrode  embedded in the outer surface  of the tubular liner . The electrode  is preferably embedded in the outer surface  of the tubular liner  to a depth that is sufficient to mechanically couple the electrode  to the tubular liner .

The tubular liner  may be located between the electrode  and the underlying structure of the lead body  over a majority of the inner surface  of the tubular liner . Exceptions to this may occur where, for example, the electrode is connected to a conductive element extending through the lead body . That electrical connection may be made by a variety of techniques, with at least some potentially suitable connection techniques being described in US Patent Application Publication Nos. US 2005\/0240252 (Boser et al.); US 2005\/0113898 (Honeck et al.); etc. The tubular liner  may alternatively be characterized as preventing contact between the inner surface of the electrode and the underlying structure of the lead body  (except where electrical connections may need to be made as described above).","In yet another manner of characterizing the relationship between the tubular liner  and the electrode  in some embodiments, the tubular liner  can be described as optionally having a liner thickness measured radially from the longitudinal axis  between the inner surface  and the outer surface  of the tubular liner . The electrode  can be described as having an electrode thickness that is measured radially from the longitudinal axis . Further, the liner thickness may be greater than the electrode thickness in some embodiments (as depicted, e.g., in ).

For example, using a silicone medical adhesive to attach the inner surface of the liner  to the underlying structure of the lead body  may provide sufficient compliance to provide enhanced flexibility in the lead such that the attachment agent (e.g., silicone adhesive, etc.) may occupy more than about 50% of the surface are occupied by the tubular electrode sub-assembly . In some embodiments, the attachment agent may be provided over substantially all of the interface between the inner surface of the liner  and the underlying structure of the lead body .","As discussed herein, the coiled electrode  is embedded within a tubular liner  that includes an inner liner and interstitial liner material located in the interstices between adjacent coils of the coiled electrode. One potential method for manufacturing a tubular electrode sub-assembly having such a construction is depicted and will be described in connection with , which are sectional views taken during different stages of the manufacturing process.","The process begins with an electrode  that is located over the outer surface of an inner liner  that is, in one embodiment, located over a mandrel .","The inner liner  may be formed directly on the mandrel  or it may be preformed and then placed over the mandrel . The inner liner is formed from a hardenable organic polymeric material (e.g., thermoplastic or thermoset) that has a relatively low modulus (i.e., low stiffness, low durometer) for good flexibility of the final assembly, and has a relatively low viscosity for good mold-filling properties. The inner liner may, in some embodiments, have a thickness of about 0.001\u2033 to about 0.0015\u2033 on the mandrel , although in other embodiments, the inner liner  may be thicker, e.g., in the range of 0.006\u2033 or more.","In one embodiment, the inner liner  may be formed directly on the mandrel  by dip-coating or otherwise applying a thinned silicone solution (where the thinning is performed using a solvent, e.g., heptane, etc.). Other methods of manufacturing may also be used to form the inner liner , e.g., spray coating, coextrusion, extrusion, etc. The electrode  may be preformed into a coiled helix or other shape such that the mandrel  is inserted into the electrode . In some embodiments, the electrode may be formed into a desired shape directly on the inner liner  on the mandrel by, e.g., winding an element to form a coiled electrode directly on the inner liner  on the mandrel  or using any other forming process needed to create an electrode with the desired shape.","With the electrode  in position on the inner liner , flowable interstitial liner material  is delivered onto the assembly of , resulting in the assembly depicted in . Delivery of the flowable interstitial liner material  may be accomplished by any suitable technique or combination of techniques, e.g., the assembly of  may be rolled in the material , the material  may be extruded, sprayed, spread, brushed, dispensed, molded or otherwise delivered onto the electrode  and inner liner .","With the material  located on the electrode  and the inner liner , the excess material  may be removed such that the material  remains only in the interstices of the coiled electrode . In one embodiment, the removal may be performed before the flowable interstitial material  is hardened (e.g., cured, cooled, or dried). The removal may also involve clearing the material  from the outer surface  of the coiled electrode  such that the outer surface  is exposed. Alternatively, the the removal may be accomplished after hardening by any suitable technique or combination of techniques, e.g., wiping, scraping, buffing, abrading, laser ablation, etc.","After the removal process, a portion of the flowable interstitial material  remains in the interstices of the electrode . The remaining material  is then hardened. After hardening, the electrode  is located on the inner liner  with the interstitial spaces of the electrode  being occupied by the interstitial liner material . As a result, the liner  (see, e.g., ) is constructed as a composite of both the inner liner  and the interstitial liner material . The composition of the inner liner  and the interstitial liner material  may be the same or different, although in some embodiments the materials used for both components may adhere or bond to each other such that separation of the interstitial liner material  from the underlying outer surface of the inner liner  is difficult, if not impossible.","After the interstitial liner material  has been removed and hardened, the mandrel  may be removed from within the inner liner . The mandrel removal may be accomplished by a variety of techniques that may include, e.g., deformation, dissolution, etc. If the mandrel  is, e.g., a structure that necks down when elongated along the axis , then the removal process may involve stretching the mandrel  along the axis  such that it necks down. The mandrel  may be made of material that releases cleanly from the inner liner . For example, the mandrel  may be manufactured of a metal, such as annealed copper or silver-plated copper wire, coated with an organic polymer to facilitate release from the liner. Such coating materials include PTFE-based coatings, polyimide, or other polymeric coatings such as \u201cPD Slick\u201d coating materials. In some embodiments, the mandrel  may be provided in the form of a hollow polymeric tube made of, e.g., ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), or fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP). The mandrel may be provided in the form of hollow tube, solid tube, etc.","After the mandrel  is removed from the electrode  and the composite liner, the finished tubular electrode sub-assembly  is obtained as depicted in . Any further processing may be performed to place the tubular electrode sub-assembly  in condition to be placed over a lead body as depicted in  and attached thereto in one or more selected attachment sites as described herein. Such processing to prepare the tubular electrode sub-assembly  for attachment to a lead body  may include, trimming the tubular electrode sub-assembly  to a selected length, preparing the ends or other portions of the coiled electrode for attachment to a conductive element within the lead body , etc.","Attachment of the tubular electrode sub-assembly  to a lead body  may be accomplished using any suitable technique or combination of techniques. In some embodiments, the tubular electrode sub-assembly  may be attached to the lead body  by welding or otherwise fusing the material of the liner  to the lead body . Such welding may be performed using any suitable technique or combination of techniques, e.g., ultrasonically, thermally, chemically (using, e.g., solvents), etc.","Another potential technique for providing the selected attachment sites between the tubular electrode sub-assembly  and the lead body  may be through the use of adhesive. Exemplary adhesive may include silicones, urethanes, fluoropolymers, etc. The adhesives could include those activated via thermal, UV light, chemical, moisture, and solvent-based methods.","The inner liner  provided on the mandrel  may be formed of any suitable hardenable organic polymeric material that has a relatively low modulus (i.e., low stiffness, low durometer) for good flexibility of the final assembly, and has a relatively low viscosity (e.g., \u201cpre-cure\u201d viscosity) for good mold-filling properties. The inner liner may be formed of a thermoset or a thermoplastic material that can be extruded or processed into a tube. Examples include silicones, polyimides, epoxies, polyurethanes, polyurethanes with surface-modifying end groups (SME), polyurethane silicone block copolymers (e.g., a thermoplastic silicone polyether urethane available under the designation PurSil), fluoropolymers and fluoroelastomers (e.g., ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF), Dyneon's THV (a polymer of tetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene and vinylidene fluoride), Daikin's T-530 fluoroelastomer, and other fluoropolymers and fluoroelastomers), polyethylenes, and polyesters.","In some embodiments, a thermoset material, such as low consistency silicones (e.g., those available under the trade designations MED-4719 or MED-4755 from NuSil), liquid silicone rubber (LSR) (such as Dow Coming's Q7-4850 or NuSil's MED-4850), and \u201cSI polyimide\u201d as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,850 and U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2005\/0004643 (para 17), can be used for the inner liner. In some embodiments, a thermoplastic material, such as polyurethane silicone block copolymers (such as PurSil silicone polyether urethane, a polyurethane, a polyurethane with surface-modifying end groups, and ETFE), can be used for the inner liner.","The flowable interstitial liner materials used in the tubular electrode sub-assemblies of the present disclosure may be selected from a wide variety of materials. Such materials may be the same or different than the materials used for the inner liner described above. Using one material for both the inner liner and the interstitial liner may be easier and more desirable in terms of number of manufacturing steps required; however, it may be desirable to have one material for increased flexibility, mechanical strength and fatigue resistance, dielectric strength, to facilitate bonding to lead body, etc., and a different material more suitable for direct tissue contact.","Fabrication of an electrode sub-assembly using a thermosetting (i.e., thermoset) material typically involves the application of thermal energy to cure the material after the application of pressure or reduced pressure to cause the material to flow and fill the interstitial spaces. Fabrication of an electrode assembly and using a thermoplastic material typically involves the simultaneous application of heat and pressure to cause the material to flow and fill the interstitial spaces. The conditions needed (e.g., time, temperature, pressure), depend on the selection of the material and can be readily determined. Note that some materials can be hardened or cured (e.g., crosslinked) without application of heat. These include, e.g., silicone medical adhesive or other room temperature vulcanized (RTV) silicone systems, and e-beam irradiated ETFE or other fluoropolymers and fluoroelastomers.","The electrodes used in the tubular electrode sub-assemblies may be selected from a wide variety of electrically conductive biocompatible materials (including, but not limited to, titanium, stainless steel, tantalum, platinum, etc. and combinations thereof (e.g., platinum-iridium clad tantalum, etc.)) that can be formed to take on any selected shape, e.g., a coiled helical shape. Examples of some potentially suitable materials may include, e.g., round wire coils (with a diameter of, e.g., 0.005\u2033) and\/or flat wire coils (with dimensions of, e.g., 0.003\u2033 by 0.007\u2033).","The words \u201cpreferred\u201d and \u201cpreferably\u201d refer to embodiments that may afford certain benefits, under certain circumstances. However, other embodiments may also be preferred, under the same or other circumstances.
