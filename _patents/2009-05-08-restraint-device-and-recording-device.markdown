{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT","DESCRIPTION OF REFERENCE NUMERALS AND SIGNS"],"p":["The present invention relates to a restraint device which applies a restraining force, applied to a support surface, to a recording medium supported to the support surface and a recording device having the restraint device.","Generally, as a recording device which performs a recording process on a recording sheet as a recording medium, there is known a recording device which transports a recording sheet placed on an endless transport belt in a predetermined transport direction and attaches ink to the recording sheet so as to record an image thereon during a transport operation thereof. After the recording sheet subjected to such a recording process is further transported to a downstream side in the transport direction, a drying process is carried out so as to compulsorily dry the ink attached thereto during the recording process.","Incidentally, a restraint device for restraining the recording sheet to the transport belt is provided on the opposite side of a transport surface of the transport belt having the recording sheet placed thereon. The restraint device includes a platen as a support member capable of supporting the recording sheet via the transport belt. The platen is provided with a plurality of suction holes opened to the support surface (that is, a surface facing the transport belt). In addition, inside the platen, a plurality of negative pressure chambers (called as \u201csuction chambers\u201d) is defined in the transport direction, and the negative pressure chambers communicate with the outside via a plurality of suction holes. Further, the transport belt is provided with a plurality of communication holes provided so as to correspond to the plurality of suction holes provided in the platen.","In addition, the restraint device is provided with a pressure adjusting section capable of individually adjusting the negative pressure inside each of the negative pressure chambers. Then, in the case where the recording sheet is transported by the transport belt, the pressure adjusting section is driven so as to generate a negative pressure inside the negative pressure chamber located at the same position as that of the transported recording sheet in the transport direction. When the negative pressure is generated inside the negative pressure chambers by the driving operation of the pressure adjusting section, the negative pressure inside the negative pressure chambers is applied to the recording sheet disposed on the transport belt via the suction holes of the platen and the communication holes of the transport belt. Then, the negative pressure inside the negative pressure chamber serves as a restraining force which pushes downward the recording sheet against the transport belt. As a result, the recording sheet is restrained to the surface of the transport belt in the uniform surface state (for example, see Patent Document 1).","As an example, an effect when the restraint device is disposed on the downstream side of a recording member, used for attaching ink to the recording sheet, in the transport direction will be described. In the case where a recording process is performed on the recording sheet by means of the ink, a wood fiber (mainly including cellulose) as a main component of the recording sheet absorbs moisture of the ink to cause the swelling. As a result, the recording sheet absorbing the moisture of the ink may be deformed in an expanding manner by the swelled wood fibers pushing each other. That is, wrinkles may be formed in the recording sheet. When the restraining force, applied to the support surface, is applied to the recording sheet having the wrinkles formed therein, the recording sheet is restrained in a flat surface state, and the ink is naturally dried to be evaporated, thereby suppressing the wrinkles from being fixed to the recording sheet.","Patent Document 1 JP-A-H05-107969","Incidentally, a negative pressure required for restraining the recording sheet to the transport belt is generated inside the negative pressure chambers of the platen when all the suction holes for allowing the inside of the negative pressure chambers to communicate with the outside thereof are shielded. However, the arrangement type or size of the recording sheet transported by the transport belt does not limit the operation in which all the suction holes provided for one negative pressure chamber are shielded by the recording sheet or the transport belt. That is, in the case where the suction holes (hereinafter, referred to as \u201cnon-shielded suction holes\u201d) not shielded by the recording sheet or the transport belt exist among the suction holes provided for one negative pressure chamber, the outside air flows into the negative pressure chambers via the non-shield suction holes. For this reason, a problem arises in that a desired negative pressure cannot be generated inside the negative pressure chambers and a restraining force required for restraining the recording sheet to the transport belt cannot be applied to at least a part of the recording sheet.","Accordingly, in the recording device having a function of suppressing the wrinkles or cockles from being fixed to the recording sheet by applying the restraining force, applied to the support surface, to the recording sheet having the ink attached thereto, a problem arises in that a desired restraining force cannot be applied to at least a part (particularly, the edge portion) of the recording sheet and the wrinkles are fixed to the recoding sheet.","The present invention is contrived in consideration of such circumstances, and an object of the invention is to provide a recording device and a restraint device capable of uniformly applying a restraining force, applied to a support surface for supporting a recording medium, to the entire surface of the recording medium.","In order to achieve the above-described object, there is provided a restraint device including: a support member which includes a support surface capable of supporting a recording medium and a suction hole opened to the support surface and generating a negative pressure therein, the support member being capable of sucking the recording medium supported to the support surface toward the support surface on the basis of the negative pressure generated inside the suction hole; a shield member which is disposed to face the support surface having the recording medium disposed thereon and is capable of shielding the opening of the suction hole together with a supported portion of the recording medium supported to the support surface upon being sucked toward the support surface on the basis of the negative pressure generated inside the suction hole; and a suction member which is disposed on the opposite side of the support member about the shield member and applies a suction force to the shield member on the basis of the negative pressure generated inside the suction hole, the suction force being smaller than that applied from the support member.","With such a configuration, in the case where the recording medium is restrained to the support surface of the support member, since the shield member and the supported portion of the recording medium supported to the support surface are sucked to the support surface, the opening of the suction hole formed in the support surface is shielded by the shield member and the supported portion of the recording medium. Further, in the case where at least a portion of the recording medium is located on the support surface even when the recording medium moves on the support surface, the opening of the suction hole is shielded by the recording medium and the shield member. As a result, gas is not sucked into the suction hole via the opening, and the suction force is uniformly applied to the entire supported portion of the recording medium. Accordingly, it is possible to uniformly apply the restraining force, applied to the support surface for supporting the recording medium, to the entire surface of the supported portion of the recording medium.","Additionally, in a portion of the shield member corresponding to a position of the recording medium, since the supported portion of the recording medium is interposed between the support surface and the portion thereof, the suction force applied to the support surface is not applied thereto. As a result, a portion of the shield member corresponding to a position of the recording medium displaces in a direction moving away from the recording medium by the suction force generated from the suction member. For this reason, a surface of the recording medium facing the shield member is suppressed from contacting with the shield member.","The restraint device according to the aspect further includes a tension applying member which applies a tension to the shield member, and the shield member is a film member.","With such a configuration, when the negative pressure is generated inside the suction hole, the opening of the suction hole in the support surface is promptly shielded by the supported portion of the recording medium and the thin-film-shaped shield member. For this reason, it is possible to promptly apply the restraining force to the entire supported portion of the recording medium. In addition, since a tension is applied to the shield member, it is possible to suppress the shield member from being loosened.","The restraint device according to the aspect further includes a transporter which is capable of moving the recording medium placed thereon between the support surface and the shield member, and the transporter is provided with a communication portion capable of communicating with the suction hole.","With such a configuration, the restraining force, applied to the support surface, is appropriately applied to the entire supported portion of the recording medium transported by the transporter. For this reason, it is possible to restrain the supported portion of the recording medium to the transporter.","According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a recording device including: a recording member which performs a recording process on the recording medium; and the restraint device.","With such a configuration, it is possible to appropriately apply the restraining force applied to the support surface to the entire supported portion of the recording medium not subjected to the recording process or the recording medium subjected to the recording process.","Hereinafter, a detailed embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to . In addition, in the below description of the specification, \u201cthe front and back direction\u201d, \u201cthe left and right direction\u201d, and \u201cthe up and down direction\u201d respectively indicate the front and back direction, the left and right direction, and the up and down direction which are depicted by the arrows in .","As shown in , an ink jet printer  as a recording device includes a transport mechanism  for transport a recording sheet  as a recording medium. The transport mechanism  is provided with a first transport section  which transports the recording sheet , fed from a sheet feeding tray  located on an upstream side (left side) in a predetermined transport direction (left and right direction), to a downstream side (right side) and a second transport section  which further transports the recording sheet , transported by the first transport section , to the downstream side so as to be discharged to a sheet discharging tray .","The transport sections  and  are rotatably driven by a driving force of a motor (not shown), and respectively includes first and second driving pulleys  and  of which the axes thereof are parallel to each other and first and second driven pulleys  and  which are rotatable about axes parallel to the axes of the driving pulleys  and . In addition, a first endless transport belt  is suspended between the first driving pulley  and the first driven pulley . In addition, a second endless transport belt  as a transporter is suspended between the second driving pulley  and the second driven pulley .","As shown in , the transport belts  and  are provided with a plurality of communication hole rows which are spaced from each other in a transport direction so as to have the same interval therebetween, where the communication hole rows are formed by communication holes  which are a plurality of (twenty in ) communication portions spaced from each other in the front and back direction so as to have the same interval therebetween. In addition, as shown in , the transport belts  and  are respectively circulated by the rotational driving operations of the corresponding driving pulleys  and . As a result, the recording sheet  fed from the sheet feeding tray  is transported from the first transport section  toward the second transport section  while being placed on the first transport belt , and is further transported toward the sheet discharging tray  while being placed on the second transport belt .","In addition, a recording head  is disposed at a position which is the upside of the first transport belt  of the first transport section , where the recording head is a recording member for ejecting ink as liquid toward the surface (upper surface) of the recording sheet  being transported while being placed on the first transport belt . The recording head  ejects, for example, moisture containing ink such as dyes ink. When the ink is attached to the surface of the recording sheet , an image is recorded on a recording process region (a region surrounded by the dashed line in ) of the surface of the recording sheet .","That is, a nozzle formation surface which is the lower surface of the recording head  is provided with a plurality of nozzle rows (not shown) which is formed in a width direction (front and back direction) of the recording sheet  and is arranged in series in the transport direction so as to have the same interval therebetween. In addition, the recording head  performs a printing (recording process) on the recording sheet  in such a manner that the ink is ejected to the recording process region of the recording sheet  in accordance with the recording sheet  passing through a position below the recording head . From this point, the recording head  according to the embodiment is a so-called full-line-type line head which forms an entire shape corresponding to a total width of the recording sheet  in a direction intersecting the transport direction of the recording sheet .","In addition, a first substantially rectangular parallelepiped support member  (called as \u201ca platen\u201d) capable of supporting the recording sheet  via the first transport belt  is provided at a position corresponding to the recording head  in the transport direction, that is, a position right below the recording head . Then, in the case where the first transport belt  is circulated, a rear surface (lower surface) of a portion of the first transport belt  having the recording sheet  placed thereon is configured to come into contact with a support surface (upper surface) of the first support member . In addition, the first support member  is provided with suction holes (not shown) which are formed by means of the perforation in the up and down direction so as to be capable of respectively communicating with the communication holes  of the first transport belt .","A first suction fan  capable of sucking gas from the suction holes of the first support ember  is provided below the first support member . Then, when the first suction fan  is driven, the recording sheet  placed on the first transport belt  is sucked to the first support member  via the communication holes  of the first transport belt  and the suction holes corresponding to the communication holes .","A heating mechanism  is disposed at a position which is the upside of the second transport belt  and on the left end of the second transport section , where the heating mechanism is capable of heating the recording sheet  transported from the first transport belt  to the second transport belt  so as to dry the recording sheet. The heating mechanism  includes an infrared heater which radiates an infrared ray to the recording sheet . In addition, the heating mechanism  heats the surface of the recording sheet , having the ink ejected from the recording head  and attached thereto to permeate therein, in a non-contact state.","In addition, a restraint device  is provided at a position on the downstream side of the heating mechanism  of the second transport section  so as to apply the same restraining force to the entire recording sheet .","Next, the restraint device  according to the embodiment will be described with reference to .","As shown in , the restraint device  includes a second substantially rectangular parallelepiped support member  (called as \u201ca platen\u201d) capable of supporting the recording sheet  via the second transport belt . A support surface (upper surface) of the second support member  is configured to come into contact with a rear surface (lower surface) of a portion of the second transport belt  having the recording sheet  placed thereon. In addition, a plurality of (three in the embodiment) negative pressure chambers , , and are defined in the second transport member  in the transport direction. In addition, the upper wall portion of the second support member  is provided with a plurality of suction holes  which perforates the upper wall portion in the up and down direction, and the negative pressure chambers to communicate with the outside via the plurality of suction holes .","In detail, the upper wall portion of the second support member  is provided with a plurality of suction hole rows which is formed by the plurality of (twenty in ) suction holes  spaced from each other in the front and back direction so as to have the same interval therebetween and is spaced from each other in the transport direction so as to have the same interval therebetween. The interval between the suction hole rows adjacent to each other in the transport direction is about three times wider than that between the communication hole rows adjacent to each other in the transport direction. In addition, each of the suction holes  includes a long groove portion which forms a suction opening on the support surface of the second support member  and extends in the transport direction of the recording sheet  and a small hole portion which is formed to be continuous to the bottom surface of the long groove portion . In addition, each small hole portion is located at the center portion in a longitudinal direction of the long groove portion ","In addition, the lower wall portion of the second support member  is provided with an exhaust hole  which is provided for each of the negative pressure chambers to by means of the perforation in the up and down direction. The negative pressure chambers to communicate with the outside via the exhaust hole .","A pressure generating mechanism  is provided below the second support member  so as to adjust a pressure inside the negative pressure chambers to via the exhaust hole . The pressure generating mechanism  is provided with a second suction fan  capable of sucking gas inside the negative pressure chambers to . Then, when the second suction fan  is driven, gas is sucked from the negative pressure chambers to to the second suction fan  via the exhaust hole . That is, in the case where the corresponding suction holes  are closed, a negative pressure is generated inside the negative pressure chambers to in accordance with a driving amount of the second suction fan .","A shield assisting device  is provided above the second support member  so as to shield the suction holes  of the second support member . The shield assisting device  is provided with third and fourth driven pulleys  and  which are disposed above the second transport belt  so that the axes thereof are parallel to each other. Then, the third driven pulley  is disposed on the left side of the second support member  and the fourth driven pulley  is disposed on the right side of the second support member . In addition, a tension pulley  as a tension applying member is provided at the substantially center position between the pulleys  and  and above the pulleys  and .","In addition, in the shield assisting device , an endless shield belt  is wound on the pulleys  to  in a suspended manner. The shield belt  is formed by a flexible film member. In addition, the shield belt  is suppressed from being loosened in such a manner that an urging force is always applied to the upside (a direction indicated by the dashed arrow in ) of the tension pulley . In addition, the shield belt  is formed such that a length in the width direction (front and back direction) is substantially equal to a length of the second transport belt .","In addition, the shield assisting device  is provided with a third suction fan  as a suction member which is disposed between the tension pulley  and a facing portion of the shield belt  facing the second transport belt . In addition, a defining portion  having a plurality of suction holes  formed by means of the perforation in the up and down direction is provided between the third suction fan  and the facing portion of the shield belt . The third suction fan  is driven so as to apply a suction force smaller than a suction force based on the negative pressure generated inside the negative pressure chambers to to the facing portion of the shield belt  by the driving operation of the second suction fan .","That is, as shown in , in the case where both suction fans  and  are driven, the facing portion of the shield belt  is sucked, that is, displaced toward the second support member  so as to shield all suction holes  of the second support member  together with the second transport belt . Meanwhile, in the case where the suction force is not applied from the second suction fan  to the facing portion of the shield belt , the facing portion is spaced from the second transport belt  so as to be adsorbed to the defining portion  as shown by the dashed line in . In addition, in the case where the facing portion of the shield belt  is adsorbed to the defining portion , a gap having an interval which allows the recording sheet  to pass therethrough so as not to contact with the shield belt  is formed between the facing portion and the second transport belt .","In addition, as shown in , the defining portion  is configured such that a suction force is applied from the third suction fan  to even a portion of the facing portion of the shield belt  disposed on the upstream side (left side) of the second support member  in the transport direction.","Next, a series of operations until the recording sheet  is discharged to the sheet discharging tray  after a recording process is performed on the recording sheet  fed from the sheet feeding tray  will be described with reference to the operational views shown in , , and . In addition, in , for the convenience of description in the specification, the pressure generating mechanism  (the second suction fan ) and the communication holes  of the second transport belt  are omitted.","Incidentally, when a printing command is received by a host computer (not shown), the transport sections  and  and the suction fans , , and  start to be driven. Then, the facing portion of the shield belt  is sucked toward the second support member  by the suction force acting via the suction holes . As a result, the facing portion of the shield belt  is sucked to a portion of the second transport belt  facing the facing portion of the shield belt . At this time, the shield belt  is circulated in a manner following the circulation movement of the second transport belt . That is, the facing portion of the shield belt  sucked to the transport belt  sequentially changes by the circulation movement of the second transport belt . However, a position of the facing portion with respect to the second support member  does not change.","Then, by means of the ink ejected from the recording head , a desired image is recorded in the recording process region of the surface of the recording sheet  fed to a position right below the recording head  by the driving operation of the first transport section . Then, the recording sheet  having been subjected to the recording process is transported to the downstream side in the transport direction in a non-heated state and a non-restrained state. For this reason, the ink attached to the recording sheet  gradually permeates and diffuses in the inside of the recording sheet  during the transport operation. Then, the ink attached to the recording sheet  deforms the recording process region of the recording sheet  so as in an expanding manner. In addition, the recording process region of the recording sheet  according to the embodiment becomes a rectangular region in which the ink is attached so as to be diffused to the entire surface, where the vicinity of the region is surrounded by a non-recording process region (called as \u201ca blank\u201d) in which the ink is not attached. The non-recording process region indicates a region in which fibers (structures) of the recording sheet  are maintained to be coupled to each other so that the ink is not supplied to the surface and the ink does not permeate therein.","Herein, the recording sheet  according to the embodiment is a porous liquid absorbing material in which pulp fibers (mainly including cellulose and referred to as \u201cfiber\u201d hereinafter) formed of wood are piled so as to overlap with each other in a mesh structure. For this reason, when the ink is attached to the recording sheet , the hydrophile fibers absorb an ink solvent (an organic solvent such as moisture or alcohol) of the ink so as to cause the swelling. That is, a volume of the recording process region increases. In addition, the ink not absorbed to the fibers permeates a gap between the fibers of the recording sheet  so as to disconnect a hydrogen bond between the fibers. Then, the fibers in the recording process region become a relatively movable state. For this reason, the recording process region is deformed in an expanding manner by the swelled fibers pushing each other. As a result, the recording sheet  having the recording process region formed thereon is deformed to be spaced from the surface of the first transport belt  with the permeation and diffusion of the ink, and hence a phenomenon occurs in which wrinkles are formed along the transport belt  (a so-called cockling phenomenon).","The recording sheet  having the wrinkles formed thereon is transported to a position right below the heating mechanism  by the transport sections  and . Then, by means of an infrared ray radiated from the heating mechanism , evaporation of the ink supplied to the recording sheet  is promoted. For this reason, the recording process region of the recording sheet  becomes a half-dried state by means of the evaporation of the ink. In addition, the expansion degree of the recording process region of the recording sheet  is suppressed since the volume increase caused by the permeation and diffusion of the ink occurring so far stops.","In addition, at this time, the recording sheet  is heated by the heating mechanism  in a non-restrained state since the support members  and  are not disposed at a position right below the heating mechanism . Accordingly, since a restraining force is not applied to the recording process region deformed in an expanding manner in a direction of reducing the expansion degree thereof, cockles are not formed in the recording sheet .","Then, the recording sheet  heated by the heating mechanism  is transported onto the second support member  by the second transport section  after one second or so. At this time, the recording sheet  is transported onto the second support member  in a half-dried state. Then, as shown in , the right end portion of the recording sheet  is transported up to a position corresponding to the second transport member  in the transport direction, and the recording sheet  advances to a gap between the second transport belt  and the shield belt  located at a position above the second transport belt . For this reason, a suction force based on the driving operation of the second suction fan  is not applied to a portion of the facing portion of the shield belt  corresponding to the recording sheet  in the transport direction by means of the recording sheet . Then, a portion of the facing portion of the shield belt  corresponding to the recording sheet  in the transport direction displaces upward by means of an upward suction force based on a driving operation of the third suction fan  and is spaced from the transport belt . That is, the surface of the recording sheet  is suppressed from contacting with the shield belt .","Meanwhile, a suction force based on the driving operation of the second suction fan , that is, the degree of the negative pressure inside the negative pressure chamber located on the most upstream side in the transport direction among the negative pressure chambers to is applied to the right end portion of the recording sheet . At this time, a portion of the suction holes  provided for the negative pressure chamber is shielded by the right end portion of the recording sheet . In addition, the rest of the suction holes  are shielded by the facing portion of the shield belt  and the second transport belt . For this reason, the right end portion of the recording sheet  is supported to the support surface of the second support member  via the second transport belt  in the uniform surface state. In addition, a restraining force of the support surface of the second support member  is uniformly applied to the entire right end portion of the recording sheet . That is, in the state shown in , the right end portion of the recording sheet  serves as a supported portion, and the entire right end portion is restrained by the second transport belt .","When the transportation of the recording sheet  is further continued, as shown in , the entire recording sheet  is supported to the second support member  via the second transport belt  in the uniform surface state. At this time, since a suction force based on the driving operation of the second suction fan  is not applied to a portion of the facing portion of the shield belt  corresponding to a position in the transport direction and the width direction of the recording sheet , the portion is adsorbed to the defining portion  by an upward suction force based on the driving operation of the third suction fan .","Meanwhile, since a suction force based on the driving operation of the second suction fan  larger than a suction force based on the driving operation of the third suction fan  is applied to a portion of the facing portion of the shield belt  not corresponding to a position in the transport direction and the width direction of the recording sheet , the portion is adsorbed to the second transport belt . Then, the openings of all the suction holes  formed in the second support member  are shielded by the recording sheet , the second transport belt , and the shield belt . As a result, a restraining force applied to the support surface in accordance with the degree of the negative pressure generated inside the negative pressure chambers to is uniformly applied to the entire recording sheet  supported to the support surface of the second support member  via the second transport belt . That is, the uniform restraining force is applied to the entire recording sheet  as the supported portion. Accordingly, the restraining force applied to the support surface of the second support member  is applied to the edge portion of the recording sheet .","Then, the entire recording sheet  in a half-dried state is naturally dried in the uniform surface state on the second support member . For this reason, the cockling phenomenon caused by the expansion deformation of the recording process region of the recording sheet  vanishes. That is, the cockling phenomenon occurring in both left and right edge portions and both front and back edge portions as well as the center portion of the recording process region vanishes. The recording sheet , in which the cockling phenomenon vanishes in this manner, is discharged to the sheet discharging tray  by means of the driving operation of the second transport section .","Accordingly, in the embodiment, the following advantages can be obtained.","(1) In the case where the recording sheet  transported from the upstream side (left side) to the downstream side (right side) in the transport direction is restrained by the support surface of the second support member , a portion of the facing portion of the shield belt  and the supported portion of the recording sheet  supported to the support surface during the transport operation are sucked toward the support surface . As a result, all the openings of the suction holes  formed in the support surface are shielded by the recording sheet , the facing portion of the shield belt , and the second transport belt . Further, even when the recording sheet  moves on the support surface toward the downstream side in the transport direction, it is possible to apply the uniform restraining force applied to the support surface to the entire supported portion of the recording sheet  supported to the support surface since the openings of the suction holes  are shielded.","(2) A suction force applied to the support surface is not applied to a portion of the facing portion of the shield belt  corresponding to a position of the recording sheet  since the recording sheet  is interposed between the portion and the support surface . As a result, a portion of the facing portion of the shield belt  corresponding to a position of the recording sheet  displaces by the suction force generated from the third suction fan  in a direction of spacing from the recording sheet , that is, the up direction. For this reason, it is possible to suppress the shield belt  from contacting with the surface of the recording sheet . Accordingly, since it is possible to prevent the ink supplied to the recording process region of the recording sheet  from being attached to the shield belt , it is possible to suppress the deterioration of the image recorded on the recording sheet .","(3) The second transport belt  is provided with the communication holes  capable of communicating with the suction holes  formed in the second support member . For this reason, a suction force applied to the second support member  is applied to the entire recording sheet , transported onto the second support member , via the suction holes  and the communication holes . Accordingly, it is possible to restrain the entire recording sheet  transported onto the second support member  to the second transport belt  at the same restraining force.","(4) The shield belt  is formed by a film member. For this reason, compared with the case where the shield belt is formed of a material having a comparatively thick film thickness, it is possible to obtain the fast responsibility in the case where the application state of the suction force applied to the facing portion of the shield belt  changes. As a result, even when the recording sheet  moves on the support surface of the second support member  toward the downstream side in the transport direction, the suction holes  which cannot be shielded by the recording sheet  in accordance with the movement can be shielded by means of a prompt displacement. In addition, a portion of the facing portion of the shield belt  shielding the suction holes  which can be shielded by the recording sheet  can be promptly moved, that is, displaced in the up direction.","(5) In addition, a tension is always applied from the tension pulley  to the shield belt  so as to suppress the shield belt  from being bent. For this reason, differently from the configuration in which the shield belt  may be loosened, it is possible to regulate a portion of the shield belt  so as not to contact with the recording process region of the recording sheet .","(6) In general, when the ink is supplied to the recording process region of the recording sheet , the recording process region absorbs the ink to be deformed in an expanding manner. When the recording process region is dried in this state, wrinkles deformed in an expanding manner are fixed in the recording sheet . From this point, according to the embodiment, the same restraining force applied to the support surface of the second support member  is uniformly applied to the entire recording process region . When the ink supplied to the recording sheet  naturally evaporates in this state, the recording contents are fixed to the recording sheet  in the state where the wrinkles or cockles are not formed therein. Accordingly, the image quality of the image recorded in the recording sheet  can be improved.","(7) Further, in the case of the known restraint device without the shield assisting device , that is, the shield belt , each of the negative pressure chambers to are required to be provided with a mechanism for generating the negative pressure. That is, the pressure generating mechanism  is required to be provided with a suction fan individually corresponding to each of the negative pressure chambers to or a mechanism for selectively generating a negative pressure inside the negative pressure chambers to . For this reason, in the case where a plurality of negative pressure chambers is provided in the second support member  in order to reliably apply the same restraining force to the edge portion of the recording sheet , the pressure generating mechanism  increases in size and becomes complicated. From this point, in the embodiment, the shield belt  is provided so as to shield the suction holes  which cannot be shielded by the recording sheet  or the second transport belt  among the suction holes  of the second support member . For this reason, compared with the known device, it is possible to decrease the size of the pressure generating mechanism  and to simplify the pressure generating mechanism.","(8) Further, in the case where a portion of the shield belt  is adsorbed to the second transport belt , the portion circulates in a manner following the circulation movement of the second transport belt . For this reason, compared with the configuration in which the shield belt  cannot circulate together with the second transport belt , it is possible to reduce a driving force for driving the second transport belt . Accordingly, a consumed power of the entire device can be suppressed.","In addition, the above-described embodiment may be modified into other embodiments as below.","In the above-described embodiment, the heating mechanism  may have a configuration in which a wind (warm wind) is supplied from a position above the recording sheet  toward the surface of the recording sheet . In addition, the heating mechanism  may have a configuration in which the ink supplied to the recording sheet  is compulsorily dried by radiant heat.","In the above-described embodiment, the tension applying member may have an arbitrary configuration so long as the facing portion of the shield belt  is prevented from being loosened. For example, the tension applying member may have a configuration in which an urging force is applied to the shield belt  in the left and right direction.","In addition, in the case where the shield belt , having a configuration in which the shield belt  does not contact with the second transport belt  or the recording sheet  placed on the second transport belt  even when the shield belt  is loosened, is used, the tension applying member may be omitted.","In the above-described embodiment, as shown in , the shield assisting device  may have a configuration in which a plurality of shield belts  having a length in the front and back direction shorter than that of the shield belt  according to the above-described embodiment is disposed in parallel in the front and back direction. In this case, the shield belts  constitute a transporter.","In addition, the shield belt  may be formed by other members except for the film member if the facing portion thereof becomes flexible by the driving operations of the second suction fan  and the third suction fan .","Further, the shield member may be a shield member which is transported by the transport belts  and  together with the recording sheet  and is disposed so as to surround the recording sheet . With such a configuration, it is possible to obtain the same advantage as that of the above-described embodiment. Additionally, in this case, the third suction fan  may not be provided.","Furthermore, the transporter may have a configuration in which one or plural lines are suspended between the second driving pulley  and the second driven pulley  in a folded manner. In this case, a gap between the lines serves as a communication portion.","Moreover, the transporter may be a transport plate formed in a plate shape.","In the above-described embodiment, the ink jet printer  may have a configuration in which the recording sheet  having been subjected to the recording process is transported toward the restraining device  by the driving operations of other transport devices different from the transport sections  and .","In the above-described embodiment, an elongate continuous-form sheet wound around a winding shaft in a roll shape may be used as a recording medium. In this case, the transport belts  and  may be omitted. With such a configuration, ink is ejected to a portion of the continuous-form sheet located at a position right below the recording head  among the continuous-form sheet continuously transported from the upstream side to the downstream side in the transport direction. In addition, the same restraint force applied to the support surface of the second support member  based on the negative pressure generated inside the negative pressure chambers to is uniformly applied to the entire supported portion of the continuous-form sheet located on the second support member  among the continuously transported continuous-form sheet.","In the above-described embodiment, in the case where the restraint device  is disposed on the upstream side of the recording head  in the transport direction, the restraint device  may have a configuration in which the third suction fan  is omitted. That is, since a restraining force is applied to the recording sheet  to which the ink is not attached, even when the shield belt  contacts with the surface of the recording sheet , the image quality of the image recorded on the recording sheet  does not deteriorate. In addition, when the restraint device  is disposed on the upstream side of the recording head  in the transport direction, the relative movement of the recording sheet  placed on the first transport bet  relative to the first transport belt  is suppressed. For this reason, it is possible to record the image at the appropriate position of the recording sheet .","Further, the recording device with such a configuration may include a recording member (for example, a dot-impact recording head) capable of performing a recording process on the recording sheet  without using liquid such as ink.","In the above-described embodiment, the support surface may be formed in a cylindrical shape if the second support member  can supports the recording sheet  in the uniform surface state.","In addition, the second support member  may have a configuration in which only one negative pressure chamber is provided therein.","Further, the second support member  may have a configuration in which the negative pressure chambers to are not provided and the plurality of suction holes  is provided by means of the perforation in the up and down direction. In this case, it is desirable that the pressure generating mechanism  be configured to generate a negative pressure inside all suction holes .","Furthermore, the second support member  may be provided with only one suction hole  if a restraining force applied to the support surface can be applied to the entire supported portion of the recording sheet  supported to the second support member . In this case, it is desirable that the support surface have a configuration in which the openings of the suction holes  are formed in the entire support surface ","In the above-described embodiment, the pressure generating mechanism  may be configured to generate a negative pressure for each of the negative pressure chambers to ","In the above-described embodiment, the ink may be attached to the surface of the recording sheet  by other printing processes such as a stencil instead of the method of ejecting the ink from the recording head .","The recording member may have a configuration in which a so-called serial-type recording head capable of supplying the ink while moving in the width direction of the recording sheet  is provided.","In the above-described embodiment, as a material forming the recording medium, a hydrophile cellulose-based sample absorbing water to cause the swelling may be used. For example, the recording medium can be deformed in such a manner that liquid including a polar solvent (for example, ethanol) is attached to the recording mediums such as cotton, hemp, polynosic, and lyocell.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0001","num":"0086"},"b":"11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0002","num":"0087"},"b":"12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0003","num":"0088"},"b":["22","23"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0004","num":"0089"},"b":"24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0005","num":"0090"},"b":"25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0006","num":"0091"},"b":["26","31"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0007","num":"0092"},"b":"30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0008","num":"0093"},"b":"31","i":"a"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0009","num":"0094"},"b":"33"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0010","num":"0095"},"b":"40"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0011","num":"0096"},"b":["41","50"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0012","num":"0097"},"b":"42"}]}}}}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
