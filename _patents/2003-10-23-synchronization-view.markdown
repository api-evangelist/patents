title: Synchronization view
abstract: Systems and methods are disclosed for synchronizing data stored in remote stores. Data stored in locations such as computer applications, consumer electronic devices and Internet websites is synchronized with a central database within a computer device. The computer device may also store constraints that limit the type of data that may be synchronized with individual stores. A graphical user interface may use different formats or icons to distinguish between data stored in a store and data included within the central database.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Aspects of the present invention relate to synchronization systems and graphical user interfaces. More specifically, aspects of the present invention provide synchronization systems and graphical user interfaces that allow users to synchronize data and determine which elements of a group of elements are synchronized with a given store.","Computer devices are increasingly being used to store contact data. It is not uncommon for a user to store contact data in devices and locations such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), laptop computers and servers connected to the Internet. Synchronization applications have been developed to help users synchronize contact data stored in different locations. For example, after updating a phone number stored in a mobile telephone, a particular synchronization application may be used to synchronize the updated phone number with contact data stored in an application such as Microsoft\u00ae Outlook\u00ae.","There are several drawbacks associated with the prior art systems and methods for synchronizing contact data. Each device typically requires a unique synchronization application in order to synchronize data with another device and location. A mobile telephone might require a first synchronization application to synchronize data with Microsoft\u00ae Outlook\u00ae, a second synchronization application to synchronize data with a PDA and may be incapable of synchronizing data with a server connected to the Internet. As a result, users are typically forced to implement inconvenient and ad hoc procedures for updating contact information stored in different devices and locations. These procedures can be burdensome and frequently result in the synchronization of less than all of a user's contact data.","Therefore, there is a need in the art for synchronization systems and methods that allow users to conveniently and accurately synchronize contact and other data stored in different devices and locations.","Aspects of the present invention address one or more of the issues mentioned above, thereby providing systems and methods that allow for the convenient and accurate synchronization of data. Stores are synchronized with publisher records that may be included within the operating system of a computer device. The data in publisher records may be aggregated and synchronized with composite records that may also be included within the operating system. A graphical user interface may use different formats or icons to distinguish between data included within a publisher record and data included only within the composite record.","Exemplary Operating Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","120","130","110","130","120","140","150"]},"A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the computer , such as during start-up, is stored in the ROM . The computer  also includes a hard disk drive  for reading from and writing to a hard disk (not shown), a magnetic disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable optical disk , such as a CD ROM or other optical media. The hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  are connected to the system bus  by a hard disk drive interface , a magnetic disk drive interface , and an optical disk drive interface , respectively. The drives and their associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the personal computer . It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media that can store data that is accessible by a computer, such as magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video disks, Bernoulli cartridges, random access memories (RAMs), read only memories (ROMs), and the like, may also be used in the example operating environment.","A number of program modules can be stored on the hard disk drive , magnetic disk , optical disk , ROM  or RAM , including an operating system , one or more application programs , other program modules , and program data . A user can enter commands and information into the computer  through input devices such as a keyboard  and pointing device . Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a serial port interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interfaces, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB). Further still, these devices may be coupled directly to the system bus  via an appropriate interface (not shown). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor, personal computers typically include other peripheral output devices (not shown), such as speakers and printers.","The computer  can operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  can be a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) . Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer  is connected to the local network  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, the personal computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing a communications over the wide area network , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, is connected to the system bus  via the serial port interface . In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the personal computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device.","It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are illustrative and other techniques for establishing a communications link between the computers can be used. The existence of any of various well-known protocols such as TCP\/IP, Ethernet, FTP, HTTP, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11x and the like is presumed, and the system can be operated in a client-server configuration to permit a user to retrieve web pages from a web-based server. Any of various conventional web browsers can be used to display and manipulate data on web pages.","Description of Illustrative Embodiments",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","202","204","206","208","210","202","204","206","212","208","210","212","214","212","216","216"]},"Computer device  includes a contact database  for storing contact information. Contact information may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, instant messenger identifications, etc. In alternative embodiments of the invention, contact database  may also store other data, such as digital certificates, passwords, playlists, data files or any other data that a user wishes to synchronize with a store. Moreover, the function of the single database  may be performed with two or more databases. For example, a first database may store contact data and a second database may store playlists.","A plurality of synchronization adapters -are used to synchronize data stored in contact database  and stores , , ,  and . One skilled in the art will appreciate that structure of any particular synchronization adapter may be a function of the type of store and an application programming interface (API) that is used to access data stored in contact database . One or more stores may be configured to not allow a user to manage data stored in that store. Active Directory , for example, allows users to read data, but not to write data. Active Directory  may be connected to computer device  via an important adapter . Important adapter  is used to transfer data from Active Directory  to contact database .","A synchronization mapping record  may include rules, constraints or other information that governs the synchronization of data. For example, if mobile phone  only allows a user to store two phone numbers per name, a constraint in synchronization mapping record  may prevent more than two phone numbers per name from attempting to be synchronized with the data stored in mobile phone .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["302","212","302","304","306","308","310","312","306","310","314","316","306","310","314","316","218"]},"In an illustrative implementation, PDA publisher record , mobile phone publisher record  and composite record  may each include contact data for John Smith. A user may update John Smith's contact information stored in PDA . Synchronizing with computer device  causes PDA publisher record  to include the updated contact information. The updated contact information is then synchronized with composite record . Composite record  may then be synchronized with mobile phone publisher record . The next time that mobile phone  is synchronized with computer device , the data stored in mobile phone  is synchronized with mobile phone publisher record . Of course, composite record  may be synchronized with a plurality of additional publisher records, which will lead to the synchronization of data stored in additional stores.","In the embodiment shown in , records , ,  and  are shown located within operating system . One of the advantages of locating the records within an operating system is that the number of APIs required to update data stored in several different stores can be minimized. In one embodiment of the invention, a single API is used to manage the data stored within publisher records, such as PDA publisher record  and mobile phone publisher record . This is in contrast to prior art systems in which a given store might be required to use one API for synchronizing data with data stored in a first application, a second API for synchronizing data with data stored in a second application, and so on.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["402","404","406","500","500","502","504","506","510","512","514"]},"Step  includes displaying, in a second format in the graphical user interface, data included in the composite record and not included in the publisher record. Field  is included in the composite record and not in the publisher record and is accordingly displayed in a faded format. The fields included in the composite record that are not included in a publisher record may be a function of the corresponding store. The mobile phone referred to in field , for example, may be configured to only store three phone numbers per person. A variety of other formats may be used to indicate which fields are included within a composite record and not a publisher record. In one alternative embodiment, one or more icons may be used to distinguish the relevant fields.","An edit command to edit data included in a composite record is received in step . The edit command may be received at a computer operating system.  illustrates a graphical user interface  that includes a dialogue box  that may be used to edit a composite record. In response to receiving the edit command, in step , the edit is made to the composite record. After an edit is performed to a composite record, edits may need to be performed to one or more publisher records. A table may identify publisher records that are linked to a composite record. In step  is it determined whether the edit command violates any constraint in a synchronization mapping record. An edit command may include adding an additional phone number and a synchronization mapping record may include a constraint that limits the number of phone numbers that may be included in a publisher record and a corresponding store.","When a constraint would be violated, synchronization mapping records for other publisher records may be checked in step . For example, after determining that a mobile phone synchronization mapping record prevents the addition of another phone number, the system may then analyze a PDA synchronization mapping record to determine if the number may be added to a PDA publisher record. This process may be repeated for every publisher record.","When a constraint would not be violated, the publisher record is edited in step . After step , control may transfer to step  and the edit information may be transferred to a store in step . Edit information may include an entire new record. For example, when the third phone number in a record is changed, the edit information transferred to a store may include an entire new record that includes modifications to the third phone number. Edit information may alternatively only include the information that is necessary to make the change. With reference to the example given above, edit information may include the identification of the third phone number and the necessary changes, such as information indicating that the last digit in the third phone number should be changed to \u201c4.\u201d One skilled in the art will appreciate that edit information may take a variety of different forms.","The present invention has been described in terms of preferred and exemplary embodiments thereof. Numerous other embodiments, modifications and variations within the scope and spirit of the appended claims will occur to persons of ordinary skill in the art from a review of this disclosure. For example, one or more of the disclosed methods may be wholly or partially implemented with computer-executable instructions recorded on at least one computer-readable medium."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Aspects of the present invention are described with respect to the accompanying figures, in which like reference numerals identify like elements, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
