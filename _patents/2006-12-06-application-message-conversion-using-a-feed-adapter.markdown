Field of the Invention","The field of the invention is data processing, or, more specifically, methods, apparatus, and products for application message conversion using a feed adapter.","2. Description of Related Art","Messaging environments are generally available to provide data communication between message sending devices and message receiving devices using application messages. An application message is a quantity of data organized into one or more data fields and is passed from a message producer installed on a message sending device to a message consumer installed on a message receiving device. An application message is a form of message recognized by application software operating in the application layer of a data communication protocol stack\u2014as contrasted for example with a transport message or network message which are forms of messages recognized in the transport layer and the network layer respectively. An application message may represent, for example, numeric or textual information, images, encrypted information, and computer program instructions. In a financial market data environment, an application message is commonly referred to as a \u2018tick\u2019 and includes financial market data such as, for example, financial quotes or financial news. Financial quotes include bid and ask prices for any given financial security. A \u2018bid\u2019 refers to the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a security. An \u2018ask\u2019 refers to the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for a security.","Often in messaging environments, message formats recognized by message sending devices are not recognized by message receiving devices. Such messaging environments typically include feed adapters that are capable of application message conversion. The basic task of the feed adapter is to receive an application message having an input message format from a message sending device, convert the application message having the input format to an application message having an output format, and transmit the application message having the output format to a message receiving device. In addition, feed adapters typically process information requests regarding data contained in the converted application messages from message receiving devices.","In current messaging environments, software architects typically configure feed adapters to perform application message conversion between only a fixed set of application message formats. This fixed set of application message formats is often hard-coded into a conversion module on the feed adapter. Any changes made to the application message formats or the configuration of a feed adapter typically require extensive recoding of the conversion module and subsequence recompilation of the new computer code. In fact, even slight modifications to current feed adapters often involve substantial financial and human resources. Readers will, therefore, appreciate that room for improvement exists for application message conversion using feed adapters.","Embodiments of the inventive subject matter generally include a method. The method includes receiving, at a feed adapter, an indication of a configuration policy of a plurality of configuration policies. The configuration policy of the plurality of configuration policies is selected based, at least in part, on said receiving the indication of the configuration policy of the plurality of configuration policies. The configuration policy of the plurality of configuration policies specifies a conversion rule from an input message format to an output message format using at least one conversion function of a plurality of conversion functions. The conversion rule specifies types of arguments that the at least one conversion function receives and returns. An application message having the input message format is received in the feed adapter. The application message having the input message format is converted by the feed adapter to an application message having the output message format according to the conversion rule specified by the configuration policy of the plurality of configuration policies.","Exemplary methods, apparatus, and products for application message conversion using a feed adapter according to embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to the accompanying drawings, beginning with .  sets forth a network and block diagram illustrating an exemplary computer data processing system for application message conversion using a feed adapter according to embodiments of the present invention. The system of  operates generally for application message conversion using a feed adapter according to embodiments of the present invention as follows: A feed adapter () capable of application message conversion is provided. The feed adapter () includes a plurality of conversion functions. Each conversion function is capable of converting data from one format to another format. A configuration policy () is established on the feed adapter (). The configuration policy () specifies a conversion rule from an input message format to an output message format using at least one of the conversion functions. The feed adapter () receives an application message () having the input message format. The feed adapter () converts the application message () having the input message format to an application message () having the output message format according to the conversion rule of the configuration policy (). The feed adapter () may also transmit the application message () having the output message format to a message receiving device on a message stream (). In the example of , the message receiving device () is implemented as a subscribing client device.","The high speed, low latency data communications environment () illustrated in  includes a high speed, low latency data communications network (). The network () includes a feed adapter (), a stream administration server (), and a subscribing client device (), as well as the infrastructure for connecting such devices (, , ) together for data communications. The network () of  is termed \u2018high speed, low latency\u2019 because the application messages sent between devices connected to the network () on message streams administered by the stream administration server () bypass the stream administration server (). For example, the application messages on the message stream () from the feed adapter () to the subscribing client device () bypass the stream administration server (). Although such messages are not delayed for processing in the stream administration server (), the stream administration server () retains administration of the stream () between devices connected to the high speed, low latency data communications network ().","Further contributing to the \u2018high speed, low latency\u2019 nature of network (), readers will note that the network () does not include a router, that is a computer networking device whose primary function is to forward data packets across a network toward their destinations. Rather, each device (, , ) provides its own routing functionality for data communication through a direct connection with the other devices connected to the network (). Because the network () does not include a computer networking device dedicated to routing data packets, the network () of  may be referred to as a \u2018minimally routed network.\u2019 Although the exemplary network () illustrated in  does not include a router, such a minimally routed network is for explanation only. In fact, some high speed, low latency networks useful in application message conversion using a feed adapter according to embodiments of the present invention may include a router.","The high speed, low latency data communications environment () depicted in  includes a message stream (). A message stream is a data communication channel between a communications endpoint of a sending device and a communications endpoint of at least one receiving device. A communications endpoint is composed of a network address and a port for a sending device, such as a feed adapter, or a receiving device, such as a subscribing client device. A message stream may be implemented as a multicast data communication channel. In a multicast data communication channel, a one-to-many relationship exists between a destination address for a message and the communication endpoints of receiving devices. That is, each destination address identifies a set of communication endpoints for receiving devices to which each message of the stream is replicated. A multicast data communication channel may be implemented using, for example, the User Datagram Protocol (\u2018UDP\u2019) and the Internet Protocol (\u2018IP\u2019). In addition to a multicast data communication channel, the message stream may be implemented as a unicast data communication channel. In a unicast data communication channel, a one-to-one relationship exists between a destination address for a message and a communication endpoint of a receiving device. That is, each destination address uniquely identifies a single communication endpoint of single receiving device. A unicast data communication channel may be implemented using, for example, the Transmission Control Protocol (\u2018TCP\u2019) and IP.","The exemplary system of  includes a stream administration server () connected to the high speed, low latency data communications network () through a wireline connection (). The stream administration server () of  is a computer device having installed upon it a stream administration module (), an authentication module (), an authorization module (), and an authorization policy (). A stream administration module () is a software component that includes a set of computer program instructions configured for application message conversion using a feed adapter according to embodiments of the present invention. The stream administration module () operates generally for application message conversion using a feed adapter according to embodiments of the present invention by brokering establishment of a message stream () from the feed adapter () to the message receiving device (). In addition, the stream administration module () administers the message stream by providing security services such as authenticating the subscribing client device () and authorizing the subscribing client device () to receive application messages from the feed adapter () on the message stream ().","The authentication module () of  is a set of computer program instructions capable of providing authentication security services to the stream administration module () through an exposed authentication application programming interface (\u2018API\u2019) (). Authentication is a process of verifying the identity of an entity. In the exemplary system of , the authentication module () verifies the identity of the subscribing client device (). The authentication module () may provide authentication security services using a variety of security infrastructures such as, for example, shared-secret key infrastructure or a public key infrastructure.","The authorization module () of  is a set of computer program instructions capable of providing authorization security services to the stream administration module () through an exposed authorization API (). Authorization is a process of only allowing resources to be used by resource consumers that have been granted authority to use the resources. In the example of , the authorization module () identifies the application messages that the subscribing client device () is authorized to receive on the message stream (). The authorization module () of  provides authorization security services using an authorization policy (). The authorization policy () is a set of rules governing the privileges of authenticated entities to send or receive application messages on a message stream. In a financial market data environment, for example, an authenticated entity may be authorized to receive application messages that include financial quotes for some financial securities but not other securities. The authorization policy () may grant privileges on the basis of an individual entity or an entity's membership in a group.","In the exemplary system of , feed adapter () is connected to the high speed, low latency data communications network () through a wireline connection (). The feed adapter () is a computer device having the capabilities of converting application messages () on a feed adapter input stream () having an input message format to application messages () on a feed adapter output stream () having an output message format and transmitting the application messages on the feed adapter output stream () to subscribing client devices. The feed adapter input stream () is a message stream from a feed source to the feed adapter (). The feed adapter output stream () is a message stream administered by the stream administration server () from the feed adapter () to the subscribing client device ().","In the example of , the feed adapter () receives application messages () having an input message format on the feed adapter input stream () from a feed source (). The feed source () is a computer device capable of aggregating data into application messages and transmitting the messages to a feed adapter. In a financial market data environment, for example, a feed source () may be implemented as a feed source controlled by the Options Price Reporting Authority (\u2018OPRA\u2019). OPRA is the securities information processor for financial market information generated by the trading of securities options in the United States. The core information that OPRA disseminates is last sale reports and quotations. Other examples of feed sources in financial market data environment may include feed sources controlled by the Consolidated Tape Association (\u2018CTA\u2019) or The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. The CTA oversees the dissemination of real-time trade and quote information in New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange listed securities. The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. operates the NASDAQ Market Center which is an electronic screen-based equity securities market in the United States. In a financial market data environment, a feed adapter input stream is referred to as a \u2018financial market data feed.\u2019","The feed adapter () of  has installed upon it a conversion module (), a custom conversion library (), a configuration policy (), conversion function libraries (), a message library (), a message model (), messaging middleware (), and a transport engine (). The conversion module () is a software component that includes a set of computer program instructions for providing basic feed adapter operation. The conversion module () of  initializes the feed adapter, loads common conversion function libraries, and loads the custom conversion library (). The common conversion function libraries contain conversion functions that the feed adapter typically utilizes regardless of the feed sources providing application messages.","The custom conversion library () of  is a software component that includes computer program instructions for extending feed adapter functionality to utilize a particular feed source such as, for example, the feed source (). The conversion module () utilizes the custom conversion library () through API () exposed by the custom conversion library (). The custom conversion library () provides access the feed source (), administers the feed adapter input stream () from the feed source (), and performs application message conversion according to embodiments of the present invention. The custom conversion library () operates generally for application message conversion according to embodiments of the present invention by converting an application message () having the input message format to an application message () having the output message format according to the conversion rule of the configuration policy (). To perform application message conversion, the custom conversion library () typically loads conversion functions libraries () specified in the configuration policy () and utilizes the conversion functions contained in those loaded libraries.","In the example of , the custom conversion library () may be implemented as a dynamically linked library available to the conversion module () at runtime, dynamically loaded Java classes, or any other implementation as will occur to those of skill in the art. Although the description above indicates that the functionality provided by the custom conversion library () is contained in a software module distinct from the conversion model (), readers will note that features of both the conversion module () and the custom conversion library () may overlap or be combined into a single software module.","The configuration policy () of  is a data structure that specifies a conversion rule from an input message format to an output message format using at least one of the conversion functions of the conversion function libraries (). A conversion rule is a data structure that contains a set of instructions for converting an application message from one format to another format. The custom conversion library () may perform the set of instructions contain in a conversion rule when conditions specified in the conversion rule are satisfied. Utilizing multiple conversion rules in a configuration policy (), the custom conversion library () may convert messages from a variety of input formats to a variety of output formats. In the example of , the configuration policy () specifies a conversion rule for converting the application message () received from the feed adapter input stream () having an input format to application messages () having an output format for transmission to subscribing client devices on the feed adapter output stream ().","In the example of , the configuration policy () is typically established on the feed adapter () by a system administrator. The configuration policy () may, however, be established on the feed adapter () by the stream administration server () when the message stream () is brokered, or be established on the feed adapter () by any other entity as will occur to those of skill in the art. The configuration policy () of  may be implemented using a structured document such as, for example, an eXtensible Markup Language (\u2018XML\u2019) document. However, the custom conversion library () typically converts a configuration policy to a binary table for optimal runtime performance.","The conversion function libraries () of  are loadable software modules that each contain one or more conversion functions capable of converting data in an application message from one format to another format or converting values of data fields from one value to another value. The conversion functions contained in the conversion function libraries may, for example, convert a 16-bit integer to a 32-bit integer, convert a number stored in a string field to a 64-bit double floating point value, increase the value of one data field by one, or any other conversion as will occur to those of skill in the art. The custom conversion library () accesses the conversion functions through a set of conversion function APIs () exposed by the conversion functions of the conversion function libraries (). In the example of , the conversion function libraries () may be implemented as dynamically linked libraries available to the custom conversion library () at runtime, dynamically loaded Java classes, or any other implementation as will occur to those of skill in the art.","In the exemplary system of , each conversion function in each of the conversion function libraries () has an argument signature. An argument signature specifies the order, number, and type of arguments that a particular conversion functions receives and returns. The argument signature of each function is stored in a table in the conversion function library () that contains the function.","The argument signatures are used by the custom conversion library () to determine whether the types of the arguments specified by a conversion rule for a particular conversion function match the argument signature of the particular conversion function. If the types of the arguments specified by a conversion rule for a particular conversion function do not match the argument signature of the particular conversion function, the custom conversion library () converts the types of the arguments specified by the conversion rule for the conversion function to match the argument signature of the conversion function.","In the example of , the application messages () have a format specified in the message model (). The message model () is metadata that defines the structure and the format used to create, access, and manipulate the application messages () converted from the application messages () received from the feed source (). Typically the same message model () is established on the feed adapter () and the subscribing client device () by the stream administration server () when the stream administration server () brokers the message stream () to the subscribing client device (). A message model may be implemented using a structured document, such as, for example, an XML document, a Java object, C++ object, or any other implementation as will occur to those of skill in the art.","In the example of , the conversion module (), the custom conversion library (), and the conversion functions of the conversion function libraries () process the data contained in the application messages () using the message library (). The message library () is a software module that includes a set of functions for creating, accessing, and manipulating messages () according to the message model (). The message library () is accessible to the conversion module (), the custom conversion library (), and the conversion functions of the conversion function libraries () through a message API () exposed by the message library ().","Before the custom conversion library () of  performs data processing on the application messages, the custom conversion library () receives application messages () having an input message format from the feed source (). The custom conversion library () of  may receive the source stream messages through a receiving transport engine (not shown) of the feed adapter (). The receiving transport engine is a software module that operates in the transport layer of the network stack and may be implemented according to the TCP\/IP protocols, UDP\/IP protocols, or any other data communication protocol as will occur to those of skill in the art. The receiving transport engine may provide the received application messages () directly to the custom conversion library () or to the messaging middleware (), which in turn, provides the source stream messages to the custom conversion library ().","The messaging middleware () of  is a software component that provides high availability services between the feed adapter (), any backup feed adapter that may exist, the subscribing client device (), and the feed source (). After the custom conversion library () of  performs data processing on the application messages () received from the feed source (), the messaging middleware () receives the application messages () having an output message format from the custom conversion library (). The messaging middleware () then provides the received application messages () having the output message format to the transport engine () for transmission to a subscribing client device () on the message stream (). The custom conversion library () interacts with the messaging middleware () through a messaging middleware API () exposed by the messaging middleware ().","The transport engine () of  is a software component operating in the transport and network layers of the OSI protocol stack promulgated by the International Organization for Standardization. The transport engine () provides data communications services between network-connected devices. The transport engine may be implemented according to the UDP\/IP protocols, TCP\/IP protocols, or any other data communications protocols as will occur to those of skill in the art. The transport engine () is a software module that includes a set of computer program instructions for application message conversion according to embodiments of the present invention. The transport engine () operates generally for application message conversion according to embodiments of the present invention by transmitting application messages () having an output message format to a message receiving device () on the message stream (). The messaging middleware () operates the transport engine () through a transport API () exposed by the transport engine (). The transport engine () transmits the application messages () by encapsulating the application messages provided by the messaging middleware () into packets and transmitting the packets through the message stream () to the subscribing client device ().","The subscribing client device () in exemplary system of  connects to the high speed, low latency data communications network () through a wireline connection (). The subscribing client device () of  is a computer device capable of subscribing to the message streams transmitted by various feed adapters. In a financial market data environment, for example, a subscribing client device may subscribe to a tick to receive the bid and ask prices for a particular security on a message stream provided by a feed adapter controlled by a financial securities broker.","In the example of , the subscribing client device () has installed upon it an application (), a message library (), a message model (), messaging middleware (), a stream administration library (), and a transport engine (). The application () is a software component that processes data contained in the application messages () received from the feed adapter (). The application () may process the data for utilization by the subscribing client device () itself, for contributing the data to another feed adapter, or for contributing the data to some other device. In a financial market data environment, the application installed on the subscribing client device may be a program trading application that buys or sells financial securities based on the quoted prices contained in ticks. The application may also be a value-adding application that contributes information to a tick such as, for example, the best bid and ask prices for a particular security, that is not typically included in the ticks provided by the feed source (). The subscribing client device may then transmit the ticks to a feed adapter for resale to other subscribing client devices.","The application () processes the data contained in the application messages () using the message library (). The message library () is software module that includes a set of functions for creating, accessing, and manipulating messages () according to a message model (). The message library () is accessible to the application () through a message API () exposed by the message library (). Similar to the message library () installed on the feed adapter (), the message library () of  interprets the received application messages () using the message model (). As mentioned above, the message model () is metadata that specifies the structure and the format for interpreting the application messages () received on the message stream ().","The communications between the subscribing client device () and the stream administration server () may be implemented using a stream administration library (). The stream administration library () is a set of functions contained in dynamically linked libraries, statically linked libraries, or dynamically loaded Java classes available to the application () through a stream administration library API (). Through the stream administration library (), the application () of the subscribing client device () may request to subscribe to messages from a feed adapter, modify an existing message subscription, or cancel a subscription. Functions of the stream administration library () used by the application () may communicate with the stream administration server () through network () by calling member methods of a CORBA object, calling member methods of remote objects using the Java Remote Method Invocation (\u2018RMI\u2019) API, using web services, or any other communication implementation as will occur to those of skill in the art.","\u2018CORBA\u2019 refers to the Common Object Request Broker Architecture, a computer industry specifications for interoperable enterprise applications produced by the Object Management Group (\u2018OMG\u2019). CORBA is a standard for remote procedure invocation first published by the OMG in 1991. CORBA can be considered a kind of object-oriented way of making remote procedure calls, although CORBA supports features that do not exist in conventional RPC. CORBA uses a declarative language, the Interface Definition Language (\u201cIDL\u201d), to describe an object's interface.","Interface descriptions in IDL are compiled to generate \u2018stubs\u2019 for the client side and \u2018skeletons\u2019 on the server side. Using this generated code, remote method invocations effected in object-oriented programming languages, such as C++ or Java, look like invocations of local member methods in local objects.","The Java\u2122 Remote Method Invocation API is a Java application programming interface for performing remote procedural calls published by Sun Microsystems\u2122. The Java\u2122 RMI API is an object-oriented way of making remote procedure calls between Java objects existing in separate Java\u2122 Virtual Machines that typically run on separate computers. The Java\u2122 RMI API uses a remote procedure object interface to describe remote objects that reside on the server. Remote procedure object interfaces are published in an RMI registry where Java clients can obtain a reference to the remote interface of a remote Java object. Using compiled \u2018stubs\u2019 for the client side and \u2018skeletons\u2019 on the server side to provide the network connection operations, the Java\u2122 RMI allows a Java client to access a remote Java object just like any other local Java object.","Before the application () processes the data contained in the messages (), the application () receives the messages () from the messaging middleware (), which, in turn, receives the application messages () from the feed adapter () through the transport engine (). The messaging middleware () is a software component that provides high availability services between the subscribing client device (), the feed adapter (), any backup feed adapters, and the stream administration module (). In addition, the messaging middleware () provides message administration services for the stream administration server (). Such message administration services may include restricting the ability of the application () to send and receive messages on a message stream to messages that satisfy certain constraints. The application () and the stream administration library () interact with the messaging middleware () through a messaging middleware API ().","The transport engine () of  is a software component operating in the transport and network layers of the OSI protocol stack promulgated by the International Organization for Standardization.
