{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/382,254, filed Sep. 13, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference.","This application is generally related to a method of fabricating a stimulation lead for delivery of electrical pulses to tissue of a patient for neuromodulation.","Neurostimulation systems are devices that generate electrical pulses and deliver the pulses to nerve tissue to treat a variety of disorders. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is the most common type of neurostimulation. In SCS, electrical pulses are delivered to nerve tissue in the spine typically for the purpose of chronic pain control. While a precise understanding of the interaction between the applied electrical energy and the nervous tissue is not fully appreciated, it is known that application of an electrical field to spinal nervous tissue can effectively mask certain types of pain transmitted from regions of the body associated with the stimulated nerve tissue. Specifically, applying electrical energy to the spinal cord associated with regions of the body afflicted with chronic pain can induce \u201cparesthesia\u201d (a subjective sensation of numbness or tingling) in the afflicted bodily regions. Thereby, paresthesia can effectively mask the transmission of non-acute pain sensations to the brain.","SCS systems generally include a pulse generator and one or more leads. A stimulation lead includes a lead body of insulative material that encloses wire conductors. The distal end of the stimulation lead includes multiple electrodes that are electrically coupled to the wire conductors. The proximal end of the lead body includes multiple terminals, which are also electrically coupled to the wire conductors, that are adapted to receive electrical pulses. The distal end of a respective stimulation lead is implanted within the epidural space to deliver the electrical pulses to the appropriate nerve tissue within the spinal cord that corresponds to the dermatome(s) in which the patient experiences chronic pain. The stimulation leads are then tunneled to another location within the patient's body to be electrically connected with a pulse generator or, alternatively, to an \u201cextension.\u201d","The pulse generator is typically implanted within a subcutaneous pocket created during the implantation procedure. In SCS, the subcutaneous pocket is typically disposed in a lower back region, although subclavicular implantations and lower abdominal implantations are commonly employed for other types of neuromodulation therapies.","The pulse generator is typically implemented using a metallic housing that encloses circuitry for generating the electrical pulses, control circuitry, communication circuitry, a rechargeable battery, etc. The pulse generating circuitry is coupled to one or more stimulation leads through electrical connections provided in a \u201cheader\u201d of the pulse generator. Specifically, feedthrough wires typically exit the metallic housing and enter into a header structure of a moldable material. Within the header structure, the feedthrough wires are electrically coupled to annular electrical connectors. The header structure holds the annular connectors in a fixed arrangement that corresponds to the arrangement of terminals on a stimulation lead.","In one embodiment, a method of fabricating stimulation leads, the method comprises: providing a spool of polymer film; providing a plurality of payout carriers of wires; drawing the polymer film from the spool and the wires from the plurality of payout carriers over a rotating drum, wherein the drum comprises a plurality of grooves over the circumference of the drum for directing the wires from the plurality of payout carriers, wherein a distance of each groove from an edge of the drum is varied about an outer circumferential surface of the drum; bonding the wires to the polymer film while performing the drawing to form an intermediate assembly comprising the polymer film as a carrier with the bonded wires in a repeating pattern along a length of the intermediate assembly; forming respective segments from the intermediate assembly; forming respective stimulation portions from the respective segments, the stimulation portions comprising electrodes electrically coupled to the wires of the segments of the intermediate assembly; and forming stimulation leads including the stimulation portions with the wires of the segments electrically coupled to wires of respective lead bodies.","The foregoing has outlined rather broadly certain features and\/or technical advantages in order that the detailed description that follows may be better understood. Additional features and\/or advantages will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the conception and specific embodiment disclosed may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or designing other structures for carrying out the same purposes. It should also be realized by those skilled in the art that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the appended claims. The novel features, both as to organization and method of operation, together with further objects and advantages will be better understood from the following description when considered in connection with the accompanying figures. It is to be expressly understood, however, that each of the figures is provided for the purpose of illustration and description only and is not intended as a definition of the limits of the appended claims.","Some representative embodiments are directed to fabrication processes for creating stimulation leads for application of electrical pulses to tissue of a patient. In some embodiments, the stimulation leads are paddle leads or cuff leads as known in the art. In some embodiments, a largely automated process is employed to layout wires in a defined pattern on a polymer film to form a portion of the paddle or cuff portion of the stimulation lead.","In one embodiment, a continuous polymer film is fabricated for the purpose of receiving micro-wires of the stimulation lead during subsequent processing. The polymer film may be initially extruded using a polymer extrusion device (which are commercially available).  depicts a distal end of such an extrusion device . In operation, polymer resin material or pellets are provided to the device through a pellet hopper or similar structure (not shown) and melted within a barrel structure (not shown) of extrusion device . An extruder screw (not shown) may be employed to subject the polymer material to pressure to obtain and maintain the molten state of the polymer material and to transport the material through device  for extrusion.","As shown in , during the extrusion process, working material  is drawn through extrusion tip (sometimes referred to as die insert)  and taken up on a suitable spool (not shown in ) after the extrusion. Working material  may be a metallic wire (e.g., of stainless steel) with a suitable outer diameter. An appropriate coating (e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)) may be applied to the metallic wire to facilitate subsequent separation of the extruded polymer material from working material . The outer diameter of working material  is selected to approximately correspond to the inner diameter of the cuff or the width of the paddle to be fabricated (e.g., within the range of 5 mm-15 mm). The pressure applied to the polymer material  within device  causes polymer material  to be forced out between extursion tip  and die plates  thereby coating working material .","After extrusion of the polymer material  over working material , polymer material  is slit and removed from working material  as shown in . As shown in , a suitable blade or other tool with a sharpened distal end is placed into contact with polymer material  over working material  thereby splitting polymer material .  depicts separation of polymer material  from working material .  depicts a set of motorized spools  and drum roller  for implementing the removal of the polymer material. As shown in , working material  with polymer material  is initially wound about spool . Working material  after removal of polymer material  is taken up by spool . Polymer material  proceeds through pinch rollers  and is taken up about drum roller .","After placement of the polymer film on drum roller , micro-wires are applied to the polymer film in a continuous or substantially continuous basis for eventual fabrication of multiple stimulation leads.","In some representative embodiments, micro-wires are fed into grooves of a drum structure. The drum structure is rotated thereby providing the micro-wires to the polymer film according to a pattern defined by the grooves of the drum structure. The pattern of the applied micro-wires corresponds to the design electrical paths through the cuff or paddle portion of the stimulation leads being fabricated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A"],"b":["400","400","401","401","400","401","401","402","402","402","402","403","403","402","402","403","403","401","401"],"i":["a","d ","a","d ","a","d ","a","d ","a","d ","a","d ","a","d ","a","d "]},"While stranded bundles of stainless steel, MP35N, platinum, platinum-iridium alloy, drawn-brazed silver (DBS) or the like can be used, one embodiment of micro-wires utilizes wires formed of multi-strands of drawn-filled tubes (DFT). Each strand is formed of a low resistance material (e.g., a silver core) and is encased in a high strength material (preferably, MP35N). A selected number of strands (seven, for example) are wound and possibly coated with an insulative material (e.g., perfluoroalkoxy (PFA)). Also, multiple micro-wires  may be applied within an individual groove  (if deemed appropriate for a specific stimulation lead design) when a suitable insulative material is applied to each individual wire to maintain the electrical isolation of the respective wires.","In one embodiment, the stimulation leads being fabricated will possess eight independent electrodes. Accordingly, eight micro-wires are provided to permit subsequent inclusion of the eight electrodes.  depict drum  adapted to such an embodiment where eight grooves are included.  depict views of drum  from opposite sides of drum . The lateral spacing or layout of grooves  is varied about the outer circumference of drum  to control the application of micro-wires  to the polymer film. The distance of each groove from its respective side or edge of drum varies about the circumference of drum . At respective portions, each groove has a slope directed outward and toward a respective edge of drum . At other portions, each groove has a slope directed inward and away from the respective edge of drum .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","500","402","500","303","103"]},"In operation, drum , payout carriers , payout roller , and collector spool  are driven by respective motors (not shown). Wires  are drawn into the grooves of drum  and follow the pattern of the grooves presented by rotation of drum . Polymer film material  is also drawn over the outer circumference of drum . Optionally, further rollers  may be employed to facilitate the application of the various elements to the exterior of drum .","As shown in , polymer film material  comes into contact with wires  on drum. Thermal bonding applicator  is employed to apply energy to heat polymer film material  upon coming into contact with wires . Upon subsequent cooling, wires  fuses with, adheres to, or otherwise becomes bonded to the outer surface of polymer film material . The polymer film material  then functions as a substrate or carrier for wires . Any suitable technology may be employed for applicator . Suitable examples include commercially available ultrasonic welding devices and laser systems. Alternatively, an opposing roller may apply pressure to press polymer film material  again the wires in the grooves on drum . The opposing roller may be heated to facilitate the bonding. In yet another embodiment, an adhesive or suitable chemical application may be applied to achieve the bonding of wires  to polymer film material . By bonding wires  to polymer film material  in the manner shown in , wires  will be retained on polymer film material  in the pattern defined by the grooves of drum . Polymer film material  with the bonded wires  are collected about spool .","In some embodiments, an additional layer of polymer film material  is provided to enclose wires  on both sides. The provision of the additional layer of polymer film material  need not necessarily include thermally bonding wires  to the additional layer of polymer film material .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","600","303","103","600","303","600","600","303","600","600","600"]},"Assembly  is then processed to create individual segments of wires  and polymer material . Assembly  is intended to be integrated at the stimulation portion of a stimulation lead (i.e., the portion of the stimulation where the electrodes are located). A suitable laser system may be employed to cut out respective segments from assembly . For example,  depicts segment  intended for fabrication of a paddle-type stimulation lead. One portion of segment  is adapted for subsequent coupling to wires of a lead body (e.g., at a proximal end where the wires are closely spaced) as defined by the repeating pattern created by drum . Another portion of segment  is adapted for sequent coupling to electrodes as defined by the repeating pattern created by drum . As shown in , this portion disposes the wires  in separate groups on each side of segment . In the embodiment of , segment  is intended to support a paddle lead with two columns of electrodes. Any suitable number of groups may be provided depending upon the desired number of columns of electrodes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["303","303","700"]},"In one embodiment, wires  of a pre-fabricated lead body  are electrically coupled directly or indirectly to wires  of a given segment of polymer film material  (see ). Distal portions of wires  with pre-fabricated lead body  may be released from the insulative material of lead body  using suitable mechanical operations. Also, any further insulative material about wires  may be removed (e.g., via laser ablation) to permit direct electrical contact between wires  and wires . Any suitable welding technique may be employed to connect wires  with wires . Also, the lead body may be fabricated using any known or later developed processes. Examples of various lead body fabrication processes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,216,045, U.S. Pat. No. 7,287,366, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20050027340A1, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20070282411A1, which are incorporated herein by reference.","In some embodiments, paddle structure  (as shown in ) is created about the given segment  with the attached lead body . For example, a suitable molding technique (e.g., injection molding) is applied to create paddle structure  with the various components (wires  and polymer film material ) internalized within the molded polymer material. Paddle structure  may be substantially flat or possess a curved or other suitably varied cross-sectional profile. The over-molding process may also be employed to provide additional material at the junction between paddle structure  and lead body .","In one embodiment, electrodes  (see ) are electrically coupled to wires  before the molding process occurs and the provided insulative material is removed to expose the upper surface of each electrode  after the molding is completed. In another embodiment, the mold employed for the injection molding process may define recesses (not shown) for subsequent placement of electrodes. As shown in , the pattern of electrodes  on the paddle structure  is preferably related to the pattern of wires  within paddle structure. That is, each given electrode  is located relative to one of the wires  to permit electrical coupling of the respective elements. The electrode pattern shown in  is by way of example only. Any suitable pattern and\/or numbers of electrodes  may be employed according to other embodiments.","In one embodiment, a suitable laser device is employed to create a small aperture through the polymer material of paddle structure  and to remove the insulative material about an individual wire . A respective electrode  is then coupled to the exposed wire. A jumper wire (not shown) may be employed to facilitate the coupling. Alternatively, a portion of the individual wire  may be pulled up through the polymer material to directly connect to the respective electrode .

Specifically, machine vision techniques may be employed to locate the appropriate locations of the electrodes  relative to wires . Also, robotic placement of electrodes  may occur. Also, the application of laser energy to remove polymer material and to perform welding operations may occur using machine vision techniques and suitable electronic and\/or computer controls.","After electrodes  are provided, additional polymer material may be provided and\/or the polymer material of paddle structure  may be heated to reflow. The reflow and\/or injected polymer material may enter through gaps in electrodes  to secure electrodes  within paddle structure .

Also, selected steps may be performed simultaneously. Also, selected steps may be performed in parallel. All such variations are contemplated as being within the spirit and scope of the application.","Similar techniques may be employed to create a cuff-type stimulation lead. For example,  depicts segment  intended to fabrication of a cuff-type stimulation lead. Segment  is shown in a curved form where the polymer film material  is permitted to return to its original shaped obtained from the mandrel from the extrusion process. That is, segment  is biased to assume the curved profile when placed in a relaxed state (e.g., without the application of exterior forces to cause segment  to be planar). In other embodiments, segment  may be disposed in a planar form in selected processing steps and subsequently provided with a curved cross-sectional shape upon final disposition in the cuff structure of the stimulation lead.","In lieu of a paddle structure, molding or other suitable technique may be employed to provide a thicker substrate for the cuff structure (if deem appropriate) having the desired cuff-shape. The material characteristics of the substrate (e.g., durometer) may be selected according to accommodate placement of the cuff about a peripheral nerve. Suitable electrodes may be provided at appropriate locations relative to segment . Also, wires of a lead body are preferably coupled to respective wires of segment  to form the stimulation lead.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1150","1150","1150"]},"System  includes implantable pulse generator  that is adapted to generate electrical pulses for application to tissue of a patient.
