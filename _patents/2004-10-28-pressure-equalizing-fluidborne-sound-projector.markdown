title: Pressure equalizing fluidborne sound projector
abstract: A solid metallic piston of a fluidborne sound projector is provided with a plurality of parallel spaced fluid passages extending between opposite axial end faces of the piston so as to equalize fluid pressures exerted thereon within a chamber enclosed within an end portion of a conduit having an end wall attached thereto through which a solid piston rod extends from the piston to an acoustical power source from which acoustical energy is mechanically transmitted as displacing forces applied to one of the axial end faces of the piston. Displacement of the piston within the chamber is limited in one axial direction by abutment of the rear end face thereof with the conduit end wall and in the other axial direction by abutment of a larger diameter section of the piston with a forward stop on an annular seal fixed to the conduit end portion, through which a smaller diameter section of the piston extends from the larger diameter section.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention relates to self-equalization of pressures within a fluidborne sound projector.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","Fluidborne projectors for delivery of sound to fluid filled piping systems is already well known in the art as disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,320,821 to Goldring et al. Such fluidborne sound projectors make use of an electro-mechanical shaker as a source of sound applied to one axial end of a piston within a conduit chamber through a piston rod connected to the piston to excite fluid within a piping system to which the conduit is connected. A series of pressure equalization tanks were heretofore associated with such a fluidborne sound projector to maintain the piston in a neutral position within the conduit chamber by means of pressurized air supplied thereto through top openings in the chamber conduit. Reliance on such use of pressurized air tanks and the expenses associated therewith resulted in relatively high costs. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to reduce costs by eliminating use of such pressure equalization tanks and the complexities associated therewith.","Pursuant to the present invention, a fluidborne sound projector is associated with an electro-mechanical shaker from which acoustic sound forces are applied through a solid piston rod extending from one axial end of a piston within a fluid chamber. The solid piston rod extends through a bushing seal in a back-stop end wall of the chamber attached to an axial end portion of an elongated conduit of a piping system to which acoustical energy is to be translated. An annular seal stop is fixedly positioned within the chamber in axially spaced relation to the chamber end wall for engagement by an annular abutment surface formed between large and small diameter sections of the piston to limit axial displacement of the piston in one direction opposite to the direction in which piston displacement is limited by abutment of the the large diameter piston section with the conduit end wall. A plurality of pressure equalizing fluid passage holes are formed in the piston extending between rear and forward end faces of the piston respectively formed on the large and small diameter end sections thereof. High fluid pressures within the conduit chamber are thereby internally neutralized.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrates a fluidborne noise generating acoustic projector  formed within an axial end portion  of an elongated conduit  associated with a piping system into which acoustical sound energy is to be translated from an external sound source, such as an electro-mechanical shaker . One end of the conduit  is closed by an end wall  from which a solid piston rod  of the fluidborne projector  extends for engagement by the shaker  to impart displacement thereof along an axis  of the fluidborne projector .","As shown in , the solid piston rod  extends through a seal bushing  in the end wall  of the conduit  into a cylindrical chamber  enclosed within the axial end portion  of the conduit . A forward stop  projects radially inwardly from an annular seal  internally fixed to the conduit end portion  in axially spaced relation to the end wall . The solid piston rod , made from metal for example, is formed integral with a cylindrical piston , having a larger diameter section  and a smaller diameter section . The piston rod  extends from an end face  of the larger diameter section  of the piston . A smaller diameter section  of the piston  extends axially from the larger diameter section  to an opposite end face  as shown in . An annular abutment surface  is thereby established on the piston  between the larger and smaller piston diameter sections  and  thereof for engagement with the seal stop  to limit axial displacement of the piston  under axial forces applied thereto in one axial direction. Axial displacement of the piston  in the opposite axial direction is limited by abutment of the piston end face  with the end wall .","As shown in , fluid pressure within the chamber  applied to the opposite end faces  and  of the piston  are equalized during axial piston displacement by fluid flow through a plurality of hole passages  extending in parallel spaced relation to each other through the piston  between the rear and forward end faces  and . Pressure equalization is accordingly achieved pursuant to the present invention by use of the passage holes  in the foregoing described arrangement of the acoustic projector  with use of a solid piston rod , a diametrically sectioned piston  and a seal mounted stop  limiting piston displacement in one axial direction.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING FIGURES","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIGS. 4 and 5","FIG. 3"],"b":["4","4","5","5"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
