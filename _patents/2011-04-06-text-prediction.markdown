title: Text prediction
abstract: One or more techniques and/or systems are provided for suggesting a word and/or phrase to a user based at least upon a prefix of one or more characters that the user has inputted. Words in a database are respectively assigned a unique identifier. Generally, the unique identifiers are assigned sequentially and contiguously, beginning with a first word alphabetically and ending with a last word alphabetically. When a user inputted prefix is received, a range of unique identifiers corresponding to words respectively having a prefix that matches the user inputted prefix are identified. Typically, the range of unique identifiers corresponds to substantially all of the words that begin with the given prefix and does not correspond to words that do not begin with the given prefix. The unique identifiers may then be compared to a probability database to identify which words have a higher probability of being selected by the user.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Auto-complete or text prediction techniques are used to predict a word or phrase that a user is inputting based upon one or more characters that the user has already inputted. Today, such techniques are used by a wide array of applications to increase the speed and efficiency, or accuracy, with which users input data. For example, such auto-complete techniques are commonly used in conjunction with SMS applications (e.g., text messaging applications) and\/or email applications on mobile devices because the user input aspect of mobiles devices (e.g., the qwerty keyboards, the touchscreens, etc.) are generally small and hamper a user's ability to quickly input text. Moreover, in other applications, such as in search applications, auto-complete techniques are used to assist the user in quickly generating a string of one or more search terms and\/or promoting the correct spelling of words. In this way, the search results may better reflect the intent of the user, for example. Still, in other applications, other benefits may be derived from the use of auto-complete or text prediction techniques.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Among other things, one or more systems and\/or techniques for looking up and\/or identifying words based upon a given text string of one or more characters are provided. For example, in one embodiment, a text string, also referred to herein as a character set, of one or more characters that are inputted by a user are received. Based upon this input, one or more words in a lexicon (e.g., a database of words) having a prefix that matches the first character set are identified.","Respective words in the lexicon are respectively associated with a unique identifier (e.g., a number). Generally, the words are arranged alphabetically and respective words are assigned a unique identifier sequentially and contiguously. Thus, for example, the word \u201cparent\u201d may be assigned the number 1,000,000 and the word \u201cparents\u201d may be assigned the number 1,000,001 because the word \u201cparents\u201d follows the word \u201cparent\u201d alphabetically, for example. It will be appreciated that because the respective words are uniquely identified sequentially, given a text string (e.g., a word prefix), a range of unique identifiers that are associated with words having the given word prefix may be identified. For example, if the prefix \u201cpar\u201d were inputted by a user, unique identifiers 1,000,000 through 1,000,050 may be identified if the words associated with the unique identifiers of 1,000,000 to 1,000,050 begin with the prefix \u201cpar.\u201d","Once a range of one or more unique identifiers of words having a prefix that corresponds to (e.g., matches) the inputted text string has been identified, the range can be compared to a probability database to determine which word(s) within the range is more likely to be the word the user is intending to input (relative to the other words associated with unique identifiers within the range), and the more likely word(s) can be presented to the user for incorporation into the field that the user is inputting characters into, for example. In this way, text predictions can be made given a word sequence without having to index letter-based representations of the word (e.g., which can be time consuming and\/or computationally intensive), for example.","In another embodiment, as will be described below, the text prediction can be further improved by predicting a word and\/or phrase based upon a chain of one or more previously inputted\/selected words and one or more inputted characters that comprise the word the user is presently inputting. For example, given the phrase \u201cthe ca,\u201d a prediction may be made that the word beginning with the letter \u201cca\u201d is a noun (e.g., because nouns typically follow the phrase \u201cthe\u201d), and thus words that begin with \u201cca\u201d but are not nouns may be excluded from the prediction (e.g., and may not appear as potential words to the user).","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","Autocomplete features, such as those commonly found in text messaging applications, search engine applications, etc. predict a word and\/or phrase a user is inputting based upon a set of one or more characters that the user has previously inputted. The more characters that the user inputs, the narrower the field of possible words\/phrases, and generally, the better the prediction can be.","Presently, predictions are made by computing the respective probability of respective words\/phrases that have a prefix that matches the character\/characters inputted\/selected by the user. For example, suppose a user were to merely entered the character \u201cc,\u201d respective words that begin with the letter \u201cc\u201d would be identified in a prefix tree (e.g., with a root node being with the letter \u201cc\u201d) and a probability for respective words within the root node \u201cc\u201d would be computed. The  or so words that are more probable would then be identified and presented to the user as the possible words, for example.","It will be appreciated that the conventional prediction techniques are slow and computationally intensive. For example, there may be tens of thousands of words that begin with the letter \u201cc.\u201d Thus, tens of thousands of operations or computations may have to be performed to identify respective words and their respective probabilities. Such operations, even if individually performed rapidly, may consume a substantial amount of time and\/or resources when viewed in the aggregate.","As described herein, systems and\/or techniques for predicting words based upon user input are provided herein. Respective words in a lexicon (e.g., a dictionary of words) are assigned a unique identifier. For example, respective words may be assigned a number. The unique identifiers are generally assigned such that words sharing a prefix (e.g., \u201cpar\u201d) have contiguous identifiers. N-grams may be encoded using these word identifiers, for example. In this way, given a prefix, a resulting n-gram can be quickly indexed without indexing letter based representations. That is, stated differently, based upon a user inputted character set of one or more characters, which define a prefix, a range of unique identifiers corresponding to words comprising the defined prefix may be identified. A database comprising respective unique identifiers and the probabilities of respective words corresponding to respective unique identifiers may be reviewed to determine which word(s) has a higher probability of being input by a user. One or more words having a higher probability (e.g., relative to the words associated with the remaining unique identifiers within the identified range) may be then presented to the user for incorporation into a field that is receiving user input, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104"]},"The example method  also comprises identifying one or more words having a prefix that matches the first character set at . That is, a lexicon (e.g., a database) comprising one or more words is searched to identify a set of one or more words that correspond to (e.g., have a prefix that matches) the first character set that was received at . For example, if a user were to input the characters \u201cpa,\u201d words beginning with the prefix \u201cpa\u201d would be identified. It will be appreciated that as described further below, fewer than all of the words beginning with the prefix \u201cpa\u201d may be identified. For example, in one embodiment, merely the first word alphabetically that begins with \u201cpa\u201d and the last word alphabetically that begins with \u201cpa\u201d may be identified. Thus, the identification of one or more words having a prefix that matches the first character set may comprise identifying fewer than all of the words having a prefix that matches the first character set (e.g., because as will be discussed later, the unique identifiers for words that fall alphabetically between the first word alphabetically having a given prefix and the last word alphabetically having the given prefix can be identified merely based upon the unique identifiers for the first word alphabetically and the last word alphabetically).","Respective words in the lexicon are associated with a unique identifier, such as a unique number. For example, respective entries in a database may comprise one word and one unique identifier. Generally, unique identifiers are assigned to the words sequentially and contiguously, such that the lower the word is in the alphabet, the lower the unique identifier and the higher the word is in the alphabet, the higher the unique identifier or vice versa, for example. Typically, no two words in the lexicon are associated with a same unique identifier. Thus, in one example, if the word \u201cparent\u201d is assigned the unique identifier 750,000, the word \u201cparents\u201d may be assigned the unique identifier 750,001 if the word \u201cparents\u201d immediately follows the word \u201cparent\u201d alphabetically in the lexicon. It will be appreciated that while the unique identifiers described herein are numbers, other forms of unique identifiers are also contemplated.","At  in the example method , a first range of one or more unique identifiers respectively corresponding to the identified words is identified. Stated differently, the unique identifiers respectively associated with a word having a prefix that matches the received character set are identified. It will be appreciated that because the unique identifiers are assigned to the words sequentially, words comprising a given prefix may be within a contiguous range of identifiers. For example, words that have the prefix \u201cpa\u201d may be within the range of unique identifiers beginning at 750,000 and ending at 768,000. Every word within this range begins with \u201cpa\u201d and no words outside this range (e.g., that are comprised in the lexicon) begin with \u201cpa.\u201d That is, by identifying the first word in the alphabet that begins with the characters \u201cpa\u201d and its respective unique identifier and by identifying the last word in the alphabet that begins with the characters \u201cpa\u201d and its respective unique identifier, a range of one or more unique identifiers corresponding to the first character set of one or more characters can be identified (e.g., where the range begins with the unique identifier corresponding to the first word in the alphabet that begins with the characters \u201cpa\u201d and ends with the unique identifier corresponding to the last word in the alphabet that begins with the characters \u201cpa\u201d). Thus, as described above, by merely identifying the first word and the last word having a given prefix (e.g., a prefix that matches the first character set) at , a range of unique identifiers corresponding to the words in the lexicon beginning with the given prefix can be identified. Conversely, substantially all of the words having a prefix that matches the first character set can be identified at , and a range of unique identifiers can be identified at  based upon the identification of substantially all the words at .","In one embodiment, based upon the identified first range, probabilities of words respectively associated with a unique identifier within the range can be computed and\/or determined, and words that are more likely to be a word the user is intending to input based upon the received first character set can be identified. For example, the first range of one or more unique identifiers can be compared with a database respectively comprising predetermined probabilities for respective words (e.g., and thus for respective unique identifiers). Within the given first range, unique identifiers (e.g., and thus words corresponding to those unique identifiers) associated with a higher probability can be determined or identified. In this way, words that are more likely to match the word the user is intending to input can be determined or predicted, for example.","Words associated with, or corresponding to, a unique identifier within the identified range that have a probability that exceeds a predetermined probability threshold (e.g., the five words that have the highest probability, words that have a probability that exceeds 0.85, etc.) may be displayed or presented to the user for selection and\/or incorporation into the field in which the user is inputting characters, for example. In this way, a user is presented with one or more words that have a prefix matching the characters the user has already input and with words that have a higher probability of being selected by the user (e.g., relative to other words in the lexicon that have the same prefix), for example.","It will be appreciated that number of possible words, and thus the range of the unique identifiers may be reduced if additional characters are received (e.g., which increases the size of the first character set). For example, if one or more characters are received that increases the size of the first character set, the number of possible words, and the range of unique identifiers may be reduced or narrowed. That is, returning to the example above, when the characters \u201cpa\u201d were received, a range of unique identifiers of 750,000 to 768,000 was identified. If another character was subsequently inputted by the user, for example, if the user were to enter \u201cpat,\u201d the range of possible words, and thus the range of unique identifier may be narrowed, or reduced to a range of between 760,000 and 760,100, for example. Moreover, probabilities for words merely corresponding to unique identifiers within the range of 760,000 and 760,100 would be determined (e.g., significantly reducing the number of possible words). It will be appreciated that the second range of between 760,000 and 760,100 is comprised within the first range of 750,000 to 768,000 because the letters \u201cpa\u201d were not altered. Thus, so long as characters are merely added to a character set, and the previously entered character set is not altered, the subsequent ranges (e.g., resulting from the added characters) will be comprised within the first range. However, if one or more of the initially entered and\/or initially received characters is altered (e.g., the user backspaces and changes the \u201cpa\u201d to a \u201cpi\u201d), a new range of unique identifiers that may not overlap and\/or may not be comprised within the first range of unique identifiers may be identified","At , the example method  ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","204","200","200","200"]},"As illustrated, respective words  are associated with a unique identifier . Generally, no two words in the lexicon  are associated with the same unique identifier, and, in one embodiment, the words  are ordered alphabetically, and are assigned a unique identifier sequentially and contiguously. That is, for example, the words are stored in a prefix tree and are respectively assigned increasing integers (e.g., if the unique identifiers are integers). For example, as illustrated, the word \u201cthe\u201d is assigned the unique identifier 1,250,000 and the word \u201ctheir\u201d is assigned the unique identifier 1,250,001 because the word \u201ctheir\u201d immediately follows the word \u201cthe\u201d alphabetically in the lexicon. Similarly, the word \u201cthem\u201d would be assigned the unique identifier 1,250,002 if the word \u201cthem\u201d immediately follows the word \u201ctheir\u201d alphabetically in the lexicon , for example. It will be appreciated that while the unique identifiers  illustrated herein follow a standard numbering scheme, other types of unique identifiers are contemplated herein. For example, in other embodiment, the unique identifiers  are Roman numerals. In yet another embodiment, the unique identifiers  are characters other than numeral characters, for example.","If a user were to input the characters \u201cthe\u201d (e.g., and thus a character set comprising the characters \u201cthe\u201d was received), words  in the lexicon  having a prefix that begin with the letters \u201cthe\u201d may be identified and so too may corresponding unique identifiers. For example, as illustrated herein, the words  \u201cthe,\u201d \u201ctheir,\u201d \u201cthem,\u201d \u201cthere,\u201d and \u201cthese\u201d (e.g., among others) and their respective unique identifiers  1,250,000 through 1,250,004 may be identified. Presuming this is all of the words that have the prefix \u201cthe,\u201d a first range of unique identifiers (e.g., 1,250,000-1,250,004) may thus be identified\/determined based upon the received character set. That is, stated differently, given a word prefix, a sub-tree of the prefix tree is defined, where the sub-tree is associated with a set of words and their unique identifiers respectively.","It will be appreciated that while reference is made to identifying respective words in the lexicon  that begin with the given prefix \u201cthe,\u201d in another embodiment, merely that first word in the alphabet that has the prefix \u201cthe\u201d and the last word in the alphabet that has the prefix \u201cthe,\u201d and their corresponding unique identifiers, may be identified to determine a range of unique identifiers corresponding to words that have a prefix that matches the inputted character set. For example, by merely identifying the first word, \u201cthe,\u201d and the last word, \u201cthese,\u201d a range of unique identifiers (e.g., 1,250,000-1,250,004) corresponding to words having the given prefix can be identified (e.g., so long as the unique identifiers are ordered sequentially and are contiguous).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","304","302","300","302","202","200","304","302"]},"In one embodiment, one or more words corresponding to the unique identifiers with a higher probability within a specified range of unique identifiers (e.g., within a range corresponding to the received character set) may be identified and presented to a user as possible words that user is attempting to input. It will be appreciated that the number of words that are identified and\/or presented to the user may vary depending upon, among other things, the screen size upon which the words will be displayed, a predetermined probability threshold, etc. For example, in the illustrated example, if the two words having the highest probability within the given range were displayed, the words \u201cthere\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d would be presented to the user because their corresponding unique identifiers , 1,250,003 and 1,250,000, respectively, have the two highest probabilities (e.g., 0.82 and 0.8, respectively) within the specified range of 1,250,000 to 1,250,004 in the lookup table , for example.","It will be appreciated that additional information, besides the prefix of a word, can be taken into consideration when determining the probability of a word (e.g., when determining which words to display to a user). For example,  illustrates an example method  for predicting a word based upon a prefix of the word and an immediately preceding word. The example method  begins at , and a first word (e.g., followed by a character indicating a space) is received at . Stated differently, a first set one or more characters is received at , where the last character of the first set of characters may be space (e.g., to delineate the set of characters as a word as opposed to merely a prefix).","At  in the example method a unique identifier corresponding to the received first word is identified. For example, returning to , if the first word was \u201cthe,\u201d the unique identifier 1,250,000 may be identified. It will be appreciated that in one embodiment, the word (e.g. \u201cthe\u201d) is merely treated as a prefix and thus a plurality of words (e.g., and\/or unique identifiers corresponding to respective words) that have the prefix \u201cthe\u201d may be identified (e.g., the unique identifiers 1,250,000-1,250,004 may be identified). In such an embodiment, because the first set of characters comprises a space, the lowest unique identifier, for example, may be identified as corresponding to the first word because the lowest unique identifier corresponds to the first word in the alphabet having the received prefix. Thus, even if the range of unique identifiers 1,250,000-1,250,004 were initially identified, in one embodiment, the first word is identified as being associated with the unique identifier 1,250,000 at  because that unique identifier is associated with the first word in the alphabet having the prefix \u201cthe.\u201d","At  in the example method , a character set of one or more characters proceeding the first word (e.g., following the character designating the space) is received. For example, if the user were to input the characters \u201cthe ca,\u201d the characters \u201cthe\u201d would be broken off as a first set of one or more characters (e.g., as a first word) and the \u201cca\u201d would be considered a second character set of one or more characters proceeding the word \u201cthe.\u201d Thus, a string characters may be broken into two or more character sets if the string comprises a character indicative of a space, for example.","At  in the example method , one or more words having a prefix that matches the second character set is identified. That is, in the example where the character set comprises the characters \u201cca,\u201d one or more words having the prefix \u201cca\u201d may be identified in a lexicon (e.g.  in ) in a manner similar to that described with respect to , for example. It will be appreciated that, as described above, fewer than all of the words in the lexicon having the prefix \u201cca\u201d may be identified. For example, in one embodiment, merely the first word alphabetically that begins with the characters \u201cca\u201d and the last word alphabetically that beings with the characters \u201cca\u201d may be identified. Thus, while reference is made to identifying words having a prefix that matches the second character set, it will be appreciated that such identification is not intended to be limited to identifying all the words that have a prefix that matches that second character set. In some embodiments, fewer than all of the words having the given prefix may be identified (e.g., merely first and last words alphabetically).","At  in the example method , a range of one or more unique identifiers corresponding to words having a prefix that matches the second character set are identified as described with respect to . Thus, in the given example, unique identifiers for words having a prefix that corresponds to \u201cca\u201d are identified. As described above, such a range may be identified based upon the unique identifier corresponding to the first word in the alphabet that begins with \u201cca\u201d and the last words in the alphabet that begins with \u201cca.\u201d That is, for example, unique identifiers ranging from 300,000 to 315,000 may be identified (e.g., where the unique identifiers in the range of 300,000 to 315,000 respectively correspond to a word that begins with \u201cca\u201d). It will be appreciated that generally no words outside of the identified range of unique identifiers begin with \u201cca\u201d and no words within the range begin with characters other than \u201cca.\u201d","At  in the example method , one or more phrases comprising two or more words are identified using the unique identifier corresponding to the first word and the range of one or more unique identifiers respectively corresponding to words having a prefix that matches the second character set. Stated differently, probabilities for the second word are determined based upon the unique identifier for the first word (e.g. \u201cthe\u201d) and the range of unique identifiers respectively corresponding to a word that has the prefix \u201cca,\u201d to identify a phrase (e.g., such as \u201cthe cat,\u201d \u201cthe car,\u201d etc.). For example, in one embodiment, bi-grams are generated using techniques known to those skilled in the art to determine which word(s) is more likely to follow the word \u201cthe\u201d that begins with the prefix \u201cca.\u201d It will be appreciated that the use of a word preceding a prefix to assist in determining which word(s) are more probable given the prefix \u201cca,\u201d may improve the accuracy of the prediction (e.g., improving the chances that a word that is presented to the user is a word the user selects) relative to merely determining probabilities based upon the prefix alone, for example.","Moreover, it will be appreciated that while reference is made to merely identifying a phrase based upon a single word and a subsequent prefix, in another embodiment, a phrase may be identified based upon two or more preceding words and a subsequent prefix. In such an embodiment, a unique identifier for respective preceding words may be identified along with the range of unique identifiers corresponding to words having a prefix that matches the subsequent prefix, and these may be used in conjunction with one another to identify phrases that more likely correspond with (e.g., match) a phrase the user is inputting, for example.","The example method  ends at .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","414","400","502","504","506"]},"Returning to the example described with respect to , suppose the user has input the characters \u201cthe ca.\u201d As described above, the word \u201cthe\u201d may be associated with the unique identifier 1,250,000. Thus, as illustrated, the unique identifier for \u201cthe\u201d in the first column (e.g., 1,250,000) is expanded to reveal unique identifiers corresponding to words that proceed the word \u201cthe.\u201d It will be appreciated that merely a consolidated list of the unique identifiers of words that commonly proceed the term \u201cthe\u201d is illustrated in , and the actual list of unique identifiers may be greater than illustrated herein (e.g., the number of unique identifiers between 1,250,000 and 1,250,001 may be substantially greater than what is actually illustrated).","Further, as described above, the prefix \u201cca\u201d may be associated with words corresponding to unique identifiers in the range  of 300,000 to 315,000. Thus words (e.g., and unique identifiers) outside the identified range may be excluded from being considered. For example, in the second column, the unique identifiers 299,999 and 316,186 may be excluded from the group of possible words and\/or phrases because those unique identifiers do not fall within the identified range of 300,000 to 315,000.","It will be appreciated that some words that begin with the prefix \u201cca\u201d may not typically follow \u201cthe,\u201d and thus would have a probability of substantially zero. For example, while many nouns can follow the word \u201cthe,\u201d few, if any, verbs follow such a word. Thus, verbs that begin with the prefix \u201cca\u201d and have unique identifiers within the range of 300,000 to 315,000 would have a probability of substantially zero when following the word \u201cthe.\u201d It will be appreciated that to reduce the amount of data, for example, unique identifiers that correspond with words that typically do not follow the word \u201cthe\u201d(e.g., having a probability of substantially zero) may be excluded from the second column  (e.g., because the second column merely illustrates unique identifiers corresponding to words that may follow the word \u201cthe\u201d in a phrase).","Within the range , the probabilities listed in the third column  of respective phrases are compared to identify which phrase(s) have a higher probability of being the phrase that the user is intending to input (e.g., or which word has a higher probability of following the word \u201cthe\u201d). For example, in the illustrated example, the phrase comprising words corresponding to unique identifiers 1,250,000 (e.g., \u201cthe\u201d) and 311,983 (e.g., \u201ccar,\u201d for example) would be a more probable phrase. Thus, the phrase \u201cthe car,\u201d and possibly one or more other phrases (e.g., \u201cthe cat\u201d) having a higher probability (e.g., relative to the probability of other phrases within the range ) may be presented to the user for selection\/incorporation into the text the user is inputting, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"600"},"The example system  comprises a character receiving component  configured to receive input and\/or a selection of characters from a user .

It will be appreciated that such text may herein be referred to as a received character set of one or more characters because the text generally comprises at least one character.","The character receiving component  is operable coupled to a lookup component  and is configured to transmit the received character set of one or more characters to the lookup component . The lookup component  is configured to receive the character set and to identify a range of one or more unique identifiers respectively corresponding to one or more words that comprise a prefix that matches, or otherwise corresponds to, the received character set of one or more characters.","As described above, the words are generally ordered alphabetically and unique identifiers are generally assigned to the words sequentially and\/or contiguously. Thus, for example, the word \u201cparent\u201d may be assigned a first unique identifier (e.g., a first integer) and the word \u201cparents\u201d may be assigned a second unique identifier (e.g., a second integer) that immediately proceeds the first unique identifier in a sequence. That is, for example, if the word \u201cparent\u201d is assigned the unique identifier 1,250,000, the word \u201cparents\u201d may be assigned the unique identifier 1,250,001 because the integer 1,250,001 immediately proceeds the integer 1,250,000. It will be appreciated that generally no two words in a lexicon are associated with the same unique identifier. That is, a unique identifier is unique to merely one word in the lexicon.","In one embodiment, the lookup component  is operably coupled to a database  comprising a lexicon of one or more words. Respective words are associated with a respective unique identifier (e.g., as illustrated in ). The lookup component  is configured to search the database , or more specifically the lexicon, to identify one or more words and corresponding unique identifiers comprising a prefix that matches the received character set of one or more characters (e.g., which may referred to as a given prefix). For example, in one embodiment, the lookup component  searches for substantially all of the words in the lexicon that comprise the given prefix, and based upon the identification of words, can identify unique identifiers for respective words having prefixes that match the given prefix. In another embodiment, the lookup component  merely searches for a first word alphabetically in the lexicon that begins with the given prefix and a last word alphabetically in the lexicon that begins with the given prefix. If the unique identifiers are assigned to the words sequentially and\/or contiguously, it will be appreciated that words that fall between the first word and the last word that begin with the given prefix will have a unique identifier that falls (e.g., numerically) between a unique identifier corresponding to the first word and a unique identifier corresponding to the last word. Thus, a range of unique identifiers corresponding to words with the given prefix can be determined by the lookup component  by identifying substantially all of the words that have the given prefix (e.g., and recording their respective unique identifiers) and\/or by merely identifying the first and last word alphabetically that have the given prefix (e.g., and identifying a range of unique identifiers beginning with a unique identifier corresponding to the first word alphabetically that has the given prefix and ending with a unique identifier corresponding to the last word alphabetically that has the given prefix).","It will be appreciated that the character receiving component  may continue to receive additional input from the user  after the initial first set of one or more characters are transmitted to the lookup component , and, in one embodiment, the character receiving component is configured to transmit the additional input (e.g., or replacement input) to the lookup component . In this way, the lookup component , for example, can redo and\/or update the search to identify a range that corresponds to words in light of the replacement and\/or additional characters (e.g., in real-time). For example, if the initial character set merely comprised the characters \u201cpa,\u201d the lookup component  may identify a range of unique identifiers corresponding to words that begin with the prefix \u201cpa\u201d (e.g. a range of 1,000,000 to 1,130,000, for example). If an additional character is subsequently received (e.g., the user inputted text is modified to \u201cpat\u201d), the range of unique identifiers may be updated (e.g., to a range of 1,080,000 to 1,089,000), for example. It will be appreciated that as long as characters are merely added to the initial character set (e.g., and the initial character set is not changed), the updated range will generally fall within the initial range, but may be a narrow or small portion of the initial range. However, if one of the characters comprised in the initial character set is modified and\/or deleted, the updated range may be outside of the initial range, for example.","Once a range of unique identifiers has been identified, the lookup component is configured to search a probability database  comprising a probability table, for example, (e.g., as illustrated in ). The probability table provides for, among other things, probability information with respect to word usage. Stated differently, the probability database provides information on how likely or unlikely it is that a user is inputting a given word (e.g., based upon historical data of word usage). In one embodiment, the probability table comprises a column listing respective unique identifiers and a second column listing the probability for respective words associated with respective unique identifiers (e.g., and\/or possibly other data, such as bi-grams, as illustrated in ). The lookup component , is thus configured to search the probability database  to determine which unique identifiers (e.g., and thus which words and\/or phrases) within the identified range of unique identifiers have a higher probability (e.g., relative to the probability of other unique identifiers within the identified range of unique identifiers).","In the example system , the lookup component  is further configured to present the words that have the higher probability to the user  via a display , for example. In this way, a group of words that have a higher probability of being the word the user  is intending to input may be displayed to the user for selection and\/or incorporation into a field in which the user  is inputting data.","It will be appreciated that the example system  is merely intended to illustrate one example system and is not intended to limit the scope of the instant application, including the claims. For example, the database  comprising the lexicon and the database  comprising the probabilities may be a single database or one or more interrelated databases. Moreover, the components may provide additional features from those herein described. For example, in one embodiment, the lookup component  is further configured to identify one or more phrases (e.g., using the techniques described with respect to ) based upon at least two unique identifiers, a first unique identifier associated with a prefix of a first word (e.g., \u201cthe\u201d) and a second unique identifier, or range of identifiers, associated with a prefix of a second word (e.g., \u201cca\u201d), for example. In such an embodiment, one or more of the databases ,  may comprise probability information similar to that described with respect to .","Moreover, it will be appreciated that the components of the example system  herein described may be part of a single device (e.g., such as a mobile device and\/or a personal computer), or may spread out across a plurality of devices. For example, in one embodiment, the display  may be part of a personal computer (e.g., a client device), and the character receiving component , lookup component , and\/or databases ,  may be components of a server, where the personal computer is operably coupled to the server via a network, for example. In such an embodiment, the characters may be input by the user  on a client device and may be transmitted to the character receiving component  via the network. Moreover, after the lookup component  has identified words that have a higher probability of being the word the user  is intending to input, the words may be transmitted to the client device (e.g., and the display ) via the lookup component , for example.","Still another embodiment involves a computer-readable medium comprising processor-executable instructions configured to implement one or more of the techniques presented herein. An exemplary computer-readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in , wherein the implementation  comprises a computer-readable medium  (e.g., a CD-R, DVD-R, or a platter of a hard disk drive), on which is encoded computer-readable data .
