title: User-created metadata for managing interface resources on a user interface
abstract: A computer-implementable method enables a user to customize navigation of User Interface (UI) resources that are displayed on a computer User Interface (UI). A computer receives, from a user, an input of user-created metadata. This user-created metadata is associated with one or more UI resources that are depicted on a UI. In response to a user inputting specific metadata, the computer retrieves one or more UI resources that are associated with the specific metadata that has been input by the user. These retrieved one or more UI resources are displayed on the UI.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present disclosure relates in general to the field of computers and other data processing systems, including hardware, software and processes. More particularly, the present disclosure pertains to tailoring the way interface resources are managed on a User Interface (UI).","A computer-implementable method enables a user to customize the management and navigation of interface resources that are displayed on a computer User Interface (UI). A computer receives, from a user, an input of user-created metadata. This user-created metadata is associated with one or more User Interface (UI) resources that are depicted on a UI. In response to a user subsequently inputting specific metadata, the computer retrieves one or more UI resources that are associated with the specific metadata that has been input by the user. These retrieved one or more UI resources are then displayed on the UI. These user-created metadata provide for user-specified selection criteria, which may be persisted, for particular UI resources that are needed by the user.","The above, as well as additional purposes, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed written description.","Many User Interfaces (UIs), such as Web-based administration consoles, contain a variety of user interface resources. A User Interface (UI) resource is defined as a resource that is available to a user through a UI, and includes, but is not limited to, user-fillable forms and other types of data-input widgets, wizards (for guiding a user through a process such as software maintenance, hardware maintenance, etc.), property notebooks (e.g., tabbed widgets), portlets (e.g., a UI component that provides access to a portlet application, such as a type of website, e-mail, etc., and can be used across multiple different websites), portal pages (i.e., webpages that have been specially designed to provide access to a pre-defined set of webpages), and Web pages. Generally, the user interfaces include some form of navigation mechanism, such as a navigation tree, so that the user can find the UI resources needed to achieve certain goals.","As the quantity of UI resources, locating a UI resource becomes increasingly difficult, thus making it increasingly difficult for a user to perform specific tasks or to achieve specific goals. This is particularly difficult with regards to UI resources that a user utilizes infrequently. The problem becomes exacerbated if search tools, names of files\/resources\/tasks, and search metadata are not intuitive to a user. For example, a navigation tree may display files that are named and assigned metadata according to criteria established by the programmer that may not be sensible or memorable to a user.","Thus, presently presented are a method, system and computer-readable medium that are used to allow a user to define user-created metadata to be associated with particular UI resources, or alternatively to particular UI-based tasks, such that these UI resources and\/or tasks are easily managed in a customized manner.","With reference now to the figures, and in particular to , a User Interface (UI)  for a metadata customization program is depicted. UI  includes a navigation tree pane , which shows, in expandable and collapsible form, various User Interface (UI) resources that are available for a server (\u201cServer \u201d).","UI  also includes a pane , which displays a metadata input widget . As suggested by the instructions  depicted in pane , a user can enter user-created metadata (e.g., \u201cStop server wizard\u201d, \u201cStart server wizard\u201d, \u201cWeekly maintenance wizard\u201d, \u201cWeb page for upgrades\u201d) to be associated with the UI resource \u201cManage server\u201d for \u201cServer \u201d. These entered user-created metadata describe, in a manner that is logical and memorable to the user who created the user-created metadata, different UI resources that are part of the main UI resource \u201cManage server.\u201d That is, the user-created metadata describe some or all of the UI resources that are available to an end-user if an end-user were to click the field \u201cManage server\u201d in navigation tree pane . As will be described later, clicking such a field from a navigation tree pane in a customized view display UI (e.g., UI  shown below in ) pulls up some or all UI resources that make up the main UI resource that has been retrieved and clicked.","Note that field was auto-populated with the term \u201cManage Server\u201d when a user clicked \u201cManage server\u201d in the navigation tree pane , thus providing the user with an addition indicator for which UI resource is being customized with new user-created metadata.","As depicted and described in , the user has now input her unique metadata for a particular UI resource. Since this user-created metadata makes logical sense to that user, the task of future retrieval, management and execution of certain types of UI resources and\/or tasks to complete a project will be easy.","As illustrated in , the user can similarly input user-created UI resource metadata for \u201cSystem Maintenance\u201d of Server . In the example shown, the user has created the UI resource metadata \u201cBackup server configuration form\u201d, \u201cReplicate to secondary database wizard\u201d, and \u201cWeekly maintenance wizard\u201d, and has input these user-created metadata into metadata input widget . Note also that active field was auto-populated with the term \u201cSystem Maintenance\u201d when the user clicked \u201cSystem Maintenance\u201d in navigation tree pane .","Similarly, as illustrated in , the user can input user-created metadata for the UI resource \u201cDisk and CPU management\u201d for Server . In the example shown, the user has created and input the user-created metadata \u201cCapacity management portlet\u201d and \u201cWeekly maintenance wizard\u201d into metadata input widget . As in the examples shown above in , this user-created metadata describes two UI resources that can be found in the UI resource \u201cDisk and CPU management.\u201d Note also that active field was auto-populated with the term \u201cDisk and CPU management\u201d when the user clicked \u201cDisk and CPU management\u201d in navigation tree pane .","Referring now to , a logical relationship among different metadata and UI resources is shown. The user-created metadata , such as the metadata that was input into input widgets -in , is associated with (e.g., mapped to, aligned with, logically related to, included in a header of the UI resource, etc.) one or more specific UI resources in UI resources . In a similar manner, predefined metadata  is also associated with one or more of the UI resources depicted by UI resources . These predefined metadata  may or may not be sensible or memorable for a specific user, who is thus able to create her user-created metadata as described above. Note that while the UI resources are UI resources as defined above, in an alternate embodiment each UI resource may be for a particular task, such as \u201cTurn on computer,\u201d \u201cBoot program,\u201d \u201cSweep memory for viruses,\u201d etc.","Note that UI resources, or alternatively tasks, may be consolidated into groups. If so, then such groups may also be assigned user-created group metadata , which is associated with specific UI resources found in UI resources . Alternatively, such user-created group metadata may be associated with user-defined metadata  and\/or predefined metadata , such that the association between the user-created group metadata  and UI resources in UI resources  is indirect.","As shown in , the user-defined metadata can be displayed in a personal preference pane , as shown in UI . That is, some or all user-defined metadata  can be displayed in a manner that allows a user to quickly locate and access UI resources associated with the user-defined metadata . Alternatively, these user-defined metadata  can be shared with other users. That is, the user who created the user-defined metadata  can export the user-defined metadata  to another user (e.g., a member of the user's team), such that the other user can also access the UI resources using the newly-created user-created metadata .","With reference now to , a UI  for a UI resource selection program is shown. At this point, it is understood that a user may have defined her unique user-created metadata. Pane  includes instructions  for entering user-created metadata into input widget . In the example shown, the user has entered \u201cWeekly maintenance.\u201d In the example shown in , this metadata tag was associated with three developer-named UI resources, \u201cManage server,\u201d \u201cSystem Maintenance,\u201d and \u201cDisk and CPU management.\u201d As shown in , entering \u201cWeekly maintenance wizard\u201d in input widget  has resulted in the display of a UI  for a customized view display. This customized view shows only the UI resources \u201cManage server,\u201d \u201cSystem Maintenance,\u201d and \u201cDisk and CPU management\u201d in the navigation tree pane , such that all other UI resources (e.g., for \u201cServer \u201d) that are not associated with the user-created metadata \u201cWeekly maintenance wizard\u201d have been filtered out of the display. Initially, pane  is empty. However, as shown in , clicking a particular task (i.e., \u201cManage server\u201d) results in pane  displaying, in field , all resources and tasks associated with the task \u201cManage server.\u201d Note the following about the display shown in field .","First, UI resources, which make up the main UI resource that is presented, may have been renamed to comport with the user-created metadata. That is, the task \u201cStop Server wizard\u201d may have been originally named \u201cDeactivate computer wizard.\u201d However, this task has been renamed to be more sensible to the user. Second, more UI resources than those described by the user (\u201cUpgrade webpage\u201d) may be shown in field . The user can still click these UI resources if she so desires. Third, each UI resource may be linked to a specific file, webpage or other resource. In the example shown, the UI resource \u201cWeekly maintenance wizard\u201d has been associated with a URL \u201chttp:\/\/maintenance webpage.net\u201d, which is shown in pop-up window . Pop-up window  appears when a user hovers a cursor over the active area, in field , for \u201cWeekly maintenance.\u201d By clicking this hyperlink, the user is taken directly to a webpage that supports the process of weekly maintenance of Server . Alternatively, a link to an executable file may be popped-up by hovering a cursor over the subtask name \u201cWeekly maintenance.\u201d For example, assume that such a link\/file is named \u201cweekly_maint_wizard.exe\u201d. By clicking this link, the file \u201cweekly_maint_wizard.exe\u201d is auto-run to perform a series of maintenance routines on Server . This UI resource, as well as other UI resources (including text instructions, links, portlets, etc.), which are logically depicted in , can \u201cpop up\u201d in pane , another window in UI , or another UI (e.g., a displayed webpage) when the UI resource \u201cWeekly maintenance wizard\u201d is clicked.","With reference now to , a high-level flow-chart of exemplary steps taken to allow a user to create user-created metadata is presented. After initiator block , a computer receives a user input selecting one or more UI resources from a user interface. The computer then receives the user-created metadata for the selected one or more UI resources (block ), and associates this user-created task metadata with the selected UI resources (block ), thus ending this iteration of the process (terminator block ).","The user can subsequently use her user-created metadata to manage particular UI resources. Thus, as shown in , after initiator block , the computer receives one or more user-created metadata (block ). Using this user-created metadata, the UI resources are retrieved (block ). Preferably, only the retrieved UI resources are displayed (block ) on a UI, either as originally named, or newly named to be in conformance with the user-created metadata. The process ends in this iteration at terminator block .","As described above, UI resources are defined above as resources that are available to a user through a UI, such as user-fillable forms and other types of data-input widgets, wizards, property notebooks, portlets, etc. However, the above described method for incorporating user-defined metadata to a UI resource can also be implemented to associate user-defined task metadata to particular tasks that are associated with UI resources. Furthermore, such UI resources and\/or tasks can be consolidated into groups, such that each group is assigned its own user-created group metadata. Thus, with reference now to , groups of tasks can be managed through the use of consolidation input using previously created user-created metadata (i.e., user-created task metadata) and\/or predefined task metadata. As shown in UI  for a metadata customization program, various tasks (\u201cManage server,\u201d \u201cSystem Maintenance,\u201d \u201cDisk and CPU management\u201d) that can be performed on Server  are shown in navigation tree pane . Various features (resources that enable the accomplishment of some or all of each task) are also shown. As shown in pane , a user can also select groups of tasks for consolidation into a task group. For example, the user can consolidate the various resource features (now named to reflect the user-created task metadata) \u201cStart server\u201d (from \u201cManage server\u201d task), \u201cBackup server configuration\u201d (from the \u201cSystem Maintenance\u201d task), and \u201cCapacity management\u201d (from the Disk and CPU management task) by inputting these resources into data input widget . This causes these resources to be consolidated into a single task group named \u201cCatharine's Monday Job,\u201d which has been input into data input widget . As shown in data input widget , this task group has been given multiple user-created group metadata by the user. These user-created group metadata include \u201cMonday,\u201d \u201cCatharine\u201d, and \u201cServer.\u201d Returning to , note that the user-created group metadata  may be associated with (e.g., mapped to) either user-created task metadata (in user-created metadata ) and the predefined metadata , or group metadata  can be directly associated with UI resources (e.g., tasks).","As shown in , these new group metadata can be used to pull up a task group. As shown in UI  for a task group selection program, a pane  includes an input widget  for one or more of the group metadata (e.g., \u201cCatharine\u201d) associated with a task group, and input widget  can receive the user-created task name itself (i.e., \u201cCatharine's Monday Job\u201d). By entering any of the user-created group metadata or the name of the task group itself, the task group and its associated task resources will be pulled up, as shown in .","Referring now to , UI  shows the result of entering either \u201cCatharine\u201d or \u201cCatharine's Monday Job\u201d user-created group metadata, as depicted in . Entering such user-created group metadata results in the tasks  (\u201cManage server,\u201d System Maintenance,\u201d and \u201cDisk and CPU management\u201d) being displayed in navigation page . In the example shown, the task \u201cManage server\u201d has been clicked, resulting in the display of window  in pane . Note that window  must display all resources that are needed to perform the task \u201cManage server.\u201d However, in accordance with the entries into data input widget  shown in , the resource \u201cStart server\u201d is highlighted, thus giving the user a visual cue regarding which resource from the task \u201cManage server\u201d actually needs to be utilized. Alternatively, the custom name for the selected group of tasks (entered into data input widget  shown in ) may be named \u201cCatharine's Monday Job includes the resources \u2018Start server,\u2019 \u2018Backup server configuration,\u2019and \u2018Capacity management.\u2019\u201d. This lengthy name provides the user with information needed to select the appropriate resources used to perform a particular task that is displayed.","The process described for managing task groups is depicted in the high-level flow charts shown in . After initiator block , a computer receives a user input selecting one or more tasks (preferably from a navigation tree pane) that are to be consolidated into a task group (block ). As described above, in a preferred embodiment, these tasks are selected from names of tasks that correlate with (e.g., are identical to) user-created task metadata. The selected tasks are consolidated into a task group (block ). The metadata for tasks in the newly formed task group is then associated with a user-created task group metadata, predefined metadata and related task resources (block ), such that the task group can be identified and retrieved using the user-created task group metadata. The process ends in this iteration at terminator block .","The task group can now be filtered, retrieved and otherwise managed using the user-created task group metadata. As shown in , after initiator block , a computer receives a user input of one or more user-created task group metadata (block ). Each inputted user-created task group metadata describes one or more task groups. Alternatively, the computer can receive a user-created name for a particular single task group. In either case, the computer then retrieves relevant task groups (block ) while filtering out any task groups that do not have the requisite user-created task group metadata (or user-created task group name), and presents the relevant task group, as well as associated task resources (or at least links such resources), to the user (block ). The process ends the iteration at terminator block .","Note that in one embodiment, in which UI resources are directly associated with specific tasks, UI resources that are associated with the specific tasks are automatically displayed on a UI whenever the user that created the user-created metadata logs onto her computer.","With reference now to , there is depicted a block diagram of an exemplary client computer , in which the present invention may be utilized. Client computer  includes a processor unit  that is coupled to a system bus . A video adapter , which drives\/supports a display , on which UI's described herein are displayed, is also coupled to system bus . System bus  is coupled via a bus bridge  to an Input\/Output (I\/O) bus . An I\/O interface  is coupled to I\/O bus . I\/O interface  affords communication with various I\/O devices, including a keyboard , a mouse , a Compact Disk-Read Only Memory (CD-ROM) drive , a floppy disk drive , and a flash drive memory . The format of the ports connected to I\/O interface  may be any known to those skilled in the art of computer architecture, including but not limited to Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports.","Client computer  is able to communicate with a service provider server  via a network  using a network interface , which is coupled to system bus . Network  may be an external network such as the Internet, or an internal network such as an Ethernet or a Virtual Private Network (VPN).","A hard drive interface  is also coupled to system bus . Hard drive interface  interfaces with a hard drive . In a preferred embodiment, hard drive  populates a system memory , which is also coupled to system bus . System memory is defined as a lowest level of volatile memory in client computer . This volatile memory may include additional higher levels of volatile memory (not shown), including but not limited to cache memory, registers, and buffers. Data that populates system memory  includes client computer 's operating system (OS)  and application programs .","OS  includes a shell , for providing transparent user access to resources such as application programs . Generally, shell  is a program that provides an interpreter and an interface between the user and the operating system. More specifically, shell  executes commands that are entered into a command line user interface or from a file. Thus, shell  (as it is called in UNIX\u00ae), also called a command processor in Windows\u00ae, is generally the highest level of the operating system software hierarchy and serves as a command interpreter. The shell provides a system prompt, interprets commands entered by keyboard, mouse, or other user input media, and sends the interpreted command(s) to the appropriate lower levels of the operating system (e.g., a kernel ) for processing. Note that while shell  is a text-based, line-oriented user interface, the present invention will equally well support other user interface modes, such as graphical, voice, gestural, etc.","As depicted, OS  also includes kernel , which includes lower levels of functionality for OS , including providing essential services required by other parts of OS  and application programs , including memory management, process and task management, disk management, and mouse and keyboard management.","Application programs  include a browser . Browser  includes program modules and instructions enabling a World Wide Web (WWW) client (i.e., client computer ) to send and receive network messages to the Internet using HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) messaging, thus enabling communication with service provider server .","Application programs  in client computer 's system memory also include a User Interface Resource Management Program (UIRMP) , which includes code for implementing the processes and User Interfaces (UIs) described in . Such processes include, but are not limited to, maintaining the data and resources relationships described in detail in .","In one embodiment, client computer  is able to download UIRMP  from service provider server , preferably in an \u201con demand\u201d basis.","Note that the hardware architecture for service provider server  may be substantially similar to that shown for client computer . Similarly, servers found in server farm  may utilize a substantially similar architecture to that found in client computer .","Server farm  includes servers that may provide resources such as the UI resources described above. Alternatively, such UI resources and\/or task descriptors may be maintained within disk drive  and\/or system memory  of client computer  or service provider server .","The hardware elements depicted in client computer  are not intended to be exhaustive, but rather are representative to highlight essential components required by the present invention. For instance, client computer  may include alternate memory storage devices such as magnetic cassettes, Digital Versatile Disks (DVDs), Bernoulli cartridges, and the like. These and other variations are intended to be within the spirit and scope of the present invention.","Note further that, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, service provider server  performs all of the functions associated with the present invention (including execution of UIRMP ), thus freeing client computer  from using its own resources.","It should be understood that at least some aspects of the present invention may alternatively be implemented in a computer-useable medium that contains a program product. Programs defining functions of the present invention can be delivered to a data storage system or a computer system via a variety of signal-bearing media, which include, without limitation, non-writable storage media (e.g., CD-ROM), writable storage media (e.g., hard disk drive, read\/write CD ROM, optical media), and communication media, such as computer and telephone networks including Ethernet, the Internet, wireless networks, and like network systems. It should be understood, therefore, that such signal-bearing media when carrying or encoding computer readable instructions that direct method functions in the present invention, represent alternative embodiments of the present invention. Further, it is understood that the present invention may be implemented by a system having means in the form of hardware, software, or a combination of software and hardware as described herein or their equivalent.","Software Deployment","As described above, in one embodiment, the processes described by the present invention, including the functions of UIRMP , are performed by service provider server . Alternatively, UIRMP  can be deployed as software from service provider server  to client computer . This deployment may be performed in an \u201con demand\u201d basis manner, in which UIRMP  is only deployed when needed by client computer . In another embodiment, process software for the method so described may be deployed to service provider server  by another service provider server (not shown).","As described above in an exemplary embodiment, presently presented are a method and system that provides a user with the ability to organize User Interface (UI) elements in a manner that eases finding specific UI resources and\/or tasks. This is achieved by providing User Interface (UI) capabilities to annotate UI elements with specific metadata that makes sense to the particular user. The metadata could be used either to make searches possible using terminology that is natural to the user, or to enable multiple ways of filtering navigation content (e.g., to show a user only the specific set of control elements he finds relevant for the his task at hand) or other control elements (such as a portlet, a Web page, or a form). Since the metadata is expressed in terms provided by a particular user, that user is freed from having to remember vendor-specific terms for performing searches. The herein described method and system also allows the user to group together sets of control elements that he uses together to perform a personal task, or that he uses on different days of the week, or whatever organization approach is most natural to him. Thus, the user can shape the navigation of a large-scale user interface to match his personal vocabulary and work style, without creating yet another object, such as a bookmark file, that has to be maintained. The presently disclosed method and system also allows the user to have multiple organizational levels, such that tasks that are not appropriate for a particular time of day or type of task may be filtered out during a search of tasks (or resources).","In one embodiment, a user defines or assigns metadata or keywords to pages, navigation elements (for example, nodes and leaves in a navigation tree), and other interface control elements while using an application or viewing information (for example, a Web page). Since created by the user, the user can later locate a UI resource using his own terminology rather than having to learn the application vendor's or content provider's vocabulary.","One embodiment of the present invention also includes a mechanism for the user to make personal notations (add, view, modify, delete notations individually and collectively) and a mechanism to filter, sort, or search on vendor-supplied, user-supplied, or both types of keywords. These user-specified annotations or metadata may be included in any search, sort, or filter action to locate matches.","As a further convenience, a mechanism to categorize the individual or group (node and leaves) annotated navigational entries, pages\/panels, and content into user-created categories can be provided. It is further noted that the user-created task metadata and\/or user-created group metadata is comprised of anything that the user finds helpful to locate a user interface resource, including but not limited to timeframe references, system data, user data, activity related data, or any other data that has particular meaning to the user.","Note that the method steps described herein may be implemented in a computer system, and may further be executed by instructions that are stored in a computer-readable medium.","In another embodiment, in which the methods described herein are performed by software that is stored on a computer-readable medium, the computer-readable medium is a component of a remote server, and the computer executable instructions are deployable to a client computer and\/or a supervisory computer from the remote server. This deployment may be provided by a service provider to a customer computer (e.g., the client computer and\/or the supervisory computer) on an on-demand basis.","Note that while the creation and use of user-created metadata is described for exemplary purposes as being used by the user who created the user-created metadata, such user-created metadata can be shared with other users for their use.","While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Furthermore, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the term \u201ccomputer\u201d or \u201csystem\u201d or \u201ccomputer system\u201d or \u201ccomputing device\u201d includes any data processing system including, but not limited to, personal computers, servers, workstations, network computers, main frame computers, routers, switches, Personal Digital Assistants (PDA's), telephones, and any other system capable of processing, transmitting, receiving, capturing and\/or storing data."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The novel features believed characteristic of the invention are set forth in the appended claims.
