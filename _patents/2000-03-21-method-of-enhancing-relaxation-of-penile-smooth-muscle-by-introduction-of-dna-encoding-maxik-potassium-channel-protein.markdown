CONCLUSION"],"p":["This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 08\/799,144, filed Feb. 13, 1997, and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,150,338 on Nov. 21, 2000, and a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/135,849, filed Aug. 18, 1998, now abandoned, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.","There are many physiological dysfunctions or disorders which are caused by the deregulation of smooth muscle tone. Included among these dysfunctions and disorders are: asthma; benign hyperplasia of the prostate gland (BHP); coronary artery disease (infused during angiography); erectile dysfunction; genitourinary dysfunctions of the bladder, endopelvic fascia, prostate gland, ureter, urethra, urinary tract, and vas deferens; irritable bowel syndrome; migraine headaches; premature labor; Raynaud's syndrome; and thromboangitis obliterans.","Erectile dysfunction is a common illness that is estimated to affect 10 to 30 million men in the United States (Feldman, et al., 47(5):457\u201367, 1994; and Anonymous, 5(4):181\u2013284, 1993). Among the primary disease-related causes of erectile dysfunction are aging, atherosclerosis, chronic renal disease, diabetes, hypertension and antihypertensive medication, pelvic surgery and radiation therapy, and psychological anxiety (Feldman, et al., 47(5):457\u201367, 1994). Direct cures for the vascular ravages of these manifold and multifaceted disease states are unlikely to occur in the near future.","The last decade has witnessed the development of several treatment modalities to directly restore diminished erectile capacity. However, all currently-available therapies are either nonspecific (e.g., hormonal therapy), of limited overall success (e.g., vacuum erection devices), invasive (e.g., intracorporal injection therapy), or non-reversible and expensive (e.g., penile prosthetic implant surgery). Despite these therapeutic limitations, the FDA's approval of CAVERJECT\u00ae (Jul. 6, 1995) for intracavernous treatment of erectile dysfunction, of MUSE\u00ae (Nov. 19, 1996) for intra-urethral drug administration in the treatment of erectile dysfunction, and of Viagra\u00ae (Mar. 27, 1998) as an oral therapeutic agent for treatment of erectile dysfunction, represent major steps forward. In essence, these acts of the Federal Government have resulted in the formal recognition of the medical nature of the problem of erectile dysfunction, and, furthermore, have legitimized its clinical treatment.","Recent changes in contemporary cultural patterns in the United States have allowed for a free and more open public discussion of sex and sexual dysfunction. This cultural trend has highlighted the magnitude of the problem of erectile dysfunction, and has simultaneously emphasized the need for improved clinical treatment of the condition. The recent deluge of advertising and media activity related to the discussion and treatment of erectile dysfunction has made men, and their sexual partners, more aware that erectile dysfunction is a common problem, with legitimate (i.e., federally-approved) clinical treatments available. This combination of events will continue to prompt even larger numbers of men, over the next decade, to seek treatment for impotence.","The magnitude of the problem of erectile dysfunction, and the desire for more effective therapies, are highlighted by the nearly 2 million prescriptions written for VIAGRA since April 1998. Thus, there is now a well-recognized need for a better understanding of the impact of age and disease on human erection; this understanding can be gained, in part, by studying the function of corporal and arterial smooth muscle at the whole-tissue, cellular, and, most recently, subcellular levels. Also needed is a research strategy that will permit the direct translation of the results of laboratory work to the clinical environment, ensuring that new treatments for organic erectile dysfunction will be more cost effective, of greater efficacy, and of longer duration, and will be accompanied by fewer side effects.","Studies have documented that altered corporal smooth muscle tone, resulting in either heightened contractility or impaired relaxation, is a proximal cause of erectile dysfunction in a large proportion of impotent men. These studies have further indicated that complete relaxation of corporal smooth muscle is both a necessary and sufficient condition to restoring erectile potency, unless severe arterial disease or congenital structural abnormalities exist; the latter is true in only a minority of patients. The efficacy of recently-approved therapies for treating erectile dysfunction, which involve agents for directly or indirectly bringing about smooth-muscle relaxation\u2014including GE(CAVERJECT\u00ae, EDEX\u00ae, and MUSE\u00ae) and Sildenafil (VIAGRA\u00ae)\u2014verifies the validity of this supposition.","As described above, the critical role in erectile function played by corporal smooth muscle cells makes them an excellent target for molecular intervention in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Previous efforts have focused on techniques for gene transfer into vascular smooth muscle cells as a basis for the potential therapy of several cardiovascular diseases. Among these are atherosclerosis, vasculitis, and restenosis after balloon angioplasty. These initial studies have provided important information on the efficiency and persistence of gene-transfer methods in smooth muscle cells (Finkel, et al., 9:843\u201351, 1995).","Because erectile dysfunction is largely caused by altered smooth muscle tone, a method of gene therapy which targets the genes involved in the alteration of smooth muscle tone is extremely desirable. Of critical importance with respect to all in vivo gene-therapy approaches are the percentage of target cells that must be affected in order to see a physiologically-relevant therapeutic effect, and the relative efficiency of affecting only the desired cell type(s). Accordingly, there is a need for a method of gene therapy wherein only a small number of cells need to be genetically modified in order to effect global changes in tissue function. A successful method of gene therapy for alleviating erectile dysfunction is in great demand, as it would be a preferred alternative to currently-used methods.","Abnormal bladder function is another common problem which significantly affects the quality of life of millions of men and women in the United States. Many common diseases (e.g., BHP, diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, and stroke) alter normal bladder function. Significant untoward changes in bladder function are also a normal result of advancing age.","There are two principal clinical manifestations of altered bladder physiology: the atonic bladder and the hyperreflexic bladder. The atonic bladder has diminished capacity to empty its urine contents because of ineffective contractility of the detrusor smooth muscle (the outer smooth muscle of the bladder wall). In the atonic state, diminished smooth muscle contractility is implicated in the etiology of bladder dysfunction. Thus, it is not surprising that pharmacological modulation of smooth muscle tone is insufficient to correct the underlying problem. In fact, the prevailing method for treating this condition uses clean intermittent catheterization; this is a successful means of preventing chronic urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, and eventual renal failure. As such, treatment of the atonic bladder ameliorates the symptoms of disease, but does not correct the underlying cause.","Conversely, the hyperreflexic, or uninhibited, bladder contracts spontaneously; this may result in urge incontinence, where the individual is unable to control the passage of urine. The hyperreflexic bladder is a more difficult problem to treat. Medications that have been used to treat this condition are usually only partially effective, and have severe side effects that limit the patient's use and enthusiasm. The currently-accepted treatment options (e.g., oxybutynin and tolteradine) are largely nonspecific, and most frequently involve blockade of the muscarinic-receptor pathways and\/or the calcium channels on the bladder myocytes. Given the central importance of these two pathways in the cellular functioning of many organ systems in the body, such therapeutic strategies are not only crude methods for modulating bladder smooth muscle tone; rather, because of their very mechanism(s) of action, they are also virtually guaranteed to have significant and undesirable systemic effects. Accordingly, there is a great need for improved treatment options for bladder dysfunction.","With life expectancy still increasing, the incidence of bladder dysfunction will only continue to rise. Based on the extensive evidence already accumulated in another urogenital smooth-muscle-cell type, namely, the corporal smooth muscle cell, the inventors strongly believe that specific end-organ modulation of bladder myocyte tone is the best strategy for correcting bladder dysfunction.","There are some physiologically-relevant parallels between penile physiology and bladder physiology which bear comparison. For example, the tone of the detrusor smooth muscle plays a role in the etiology of bladder dysfunction that is similar to the well-characterized role of corporal smooth muscle tone in erectile dysfunction. In particular, the hyperreflexic bladder is characterized by heightened contractility, while the atonic bladder is characterized by impaired contractility. Pharmacological therapy for treating bladder hyperreflexia typically involves frequent intravesical instillations, a treatment that patients often find inconvenient or otherwise undesirable. In short, frequent intravesical instillations to restore bladder myocyte function are undesirable, and systemic medications still lack tolerable specificity. Nevertheless, the critical role in bladder function played by the detrusor smooth muscle cells, and their accessibility across the urothelium through intravesical instillations, make them excellent targets for molecular intervention in the treatment of bladder dysfunction.","Because erectile dysfunction and bladder dysfunction are largely caused by altered smooth muscle tone, a method of gene therapy which targets the genes involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone is extremely desirable, for it would provide a new means of alleviating bladder dysfunction and erectile dysfunction. Similarly, a method of gene therapy which targets the genes involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone would be extremely useful as a means of alleviating other smooth muscle dysfunctions, including, but not limited to, asthma; benign hyperplasia of the prostate gland (BHP); coronary artery disease (infused during angiography); genitourinary dysfunctions of the endopelvic fascia, prostate gland, ureter, urethra, urinary tract, and vas deferens; irritable bowel syndrome; migraine headaches; premature labor; Raynaud's syndrome; and thromboangitis obliterans.","Current methods of gene therapy use retroviral-based or adenoviral-based recombinant vectors to infect a target cell. Such vectors, however, present certain problems which have not been resolved to date. For instance, retroviral- and adenoviral-based vectors most often elicit an immune response from the subject being treated. Because of this immune response, the vectors cannot be maintained in the cells, and the DNA is not transcribed from the vectors. Furthermore, in order for a global change to occur in the cells surrounding an infected cell, each cell must be infected individually by the recombinant vector. Thus, this method of gene therapy relies upon the efficiency of transfection. Other side effects resulting from the use of retroviral- or adenoviral-based vectors include insertional mutagenesis. Accordingly, there is clearly a need for a method of gene therapy which does not use retroviral- or adenoviral-based vectors, which does not rely upon the efficiency of transfection of a vector, but which is still able to effect global changes in a tissue by modification of only a fraction of the cells.","The present invention is directed towards a method of gene therapy for regulating smooth muscle tone in a subject. The method comprises introducing into the smooth muscle cells of the subject a DNA sequence encoding a protein involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone, such that the DNA sequence is expressed in a sufficient number of smooth muscle cells of the subject to alter smooth muscle tone in the subject.","The present invention further provides methods of gene therapy, wherein the DNA sequence which encodes a protein involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone encodes a protein which modulates contraction of smooth muscle. Such a protein will enhance smooth muscle contraction, thereby restoring smooth muscle tone.","The present invention also provides methods of gene therapy, wherein the DNA sequence which encodes a protein involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone encodes a protein which modulates relaxation of smooth muscle. Such a protein will enhance smooth-muscle relaxation, thereby restoring smooth muscle tone.","In a specific embodiment of the invention, the methods of gene therapy described herein are used to alleviate erectile dysfunction. In another embodiment of the invention, the described methods of gene therapy are used to alleviate bladder dysfunction. In other embodiments of the invention, the methods of gene therapy are used to alleviate dysfunctions of the blood vessel walls, bowel, bronchi of the lungs, endopelvic fascia, prostate gland, ureter, urethra, urinary tract, uterus, and vas deferens. Specifically, the methods of gene therapy are used to treat smooth muscle dysfunctions, including, but not limited to, asthma; benign hyperplasia of the prostate gland (BHP); coronary artery disease (infused during angiography); genitourinary dysfunctions of the endopelvic fascia, prostate gland, ureter, urethra, urinary tract, and vas deferens; irritable bowel syndrome; migraine headaches; premature labor; Raynaud's syndrome; and thromboangitis obliterans. When used to treat asthma, the present method of gene therapy may be delivered to a subject through an aerosol carrier.","The present invention further provides viral and non-viral recombinant vectors, comprising a nucleic-acid sequence encoding a protein involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone.","The present invention additionally provides for a smooth muscle cell that expresses a DNA sequence encoding a protein involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone.","Additional objects of the invention will be apparent from the description which follows.","The present invention provides a method of gene therapy for treating physiological dysfunctions of smooth muscle through the delivery into, and expression in, a smooth muscle cell of a DNA sequence encoding a protein involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone. As used herein, \u201cregulation\u201d is the modulation of relaxation or the modulation of contraction.","Examples of smooth muscle cells for which the present method of gene therapy may be used include, but are not limited to, visceral smooth muscle cells of the bladder, bowel, bronchi of the lungs, penis (corpus cavernosum), prostate gland, ureter, urethra (corpus spongiosum), urinary tract, and vas deferens, as well as the smooth and\/or skeletal muscle cells of the endopelvic fascia. Specifically, the claimed method of gene therapy may be used in bladder smooth muscle cells, colonic smooth muscle cells, corporal smooth muscle cells, gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells, prostatic smooth muscle, and urethral smooth muscle. Given the many gross histological and physiological similarities in the factors that regulate the tone of smooth muscle tissue and of other vascular tissue, it follows naturally that similar principles would permit the application of the present method of gene therapy to the arterial smooth muscle cells of the bladder, bowel, bronchi of the lungs, penis (corpus cavernosum), prostate gland, ureter, urethra (corpus spongiosum), urinary tract, and vas deferens.","The DNA sequence of interest may be introduced into a smooth muscle cell by a number of procedures known to one skilled in the art, such as electroporation, DEAE Dextran, monocationic liposome fusion, polycationic liposome fusion, protoplast fusion, DNA-coated microprojectile bombardment, creation of an in vivo electrical field, injection with recombinant replication-defective viruses, homologous recombination, and naked DNA transfer by, for example, intravesical instillation. It is to be appreciated by one skilled in the art that any of the above methods of DNA transfer may be combined.","In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the DNA is transferred into the smooth muscle cells by naked DNA transfer, using a mammalian vector. \u201cNaked DNA\u201d is herein defined as DNA contained in a non-viral vector. The DNA sequence may be combined with a sterile aqueous solution, which is preferably isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Such a solution may be prepared by suspending the DNA in water containing physiologically-compatible substances (such as sodium chloride, glycine, and the like), maintaining a buffered pH compatible with physiological conditions, and rendering the solution sterile. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the DNA is combined with a 20\u201325% sucrose-in-saline solution, in preparation for introduction into a smooth muscle cell.","Where the DNA is transferred into smooth muscle cells of the bladder, it is introduced into the bladder by intravesical instillation, which is a well-established therapy for the treatment of bladder tumors. The DNA solution is then voluntarily withheld by the patient, within the bladder, for a prescribed duration of time. In another embodiment, the DNA is introduced into the endopelvic fascia, prostate, ureter, urethra, upper urinary tract, or vas deferens by instillation or injection therapy, and the ureter, urethra, or upper urinary tract is obstructed so that the DNA solution remains in contact with the internal epithelial layer for a prescribed period of time. The DNA sequence for expression may also be incorporated into cationic liposomes and directly injected into the smooth muscle cells of the subject.","The present invention specifically provides a method of gene therapy wherein the protein involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone modulates relaxation of smooth muscle. Representative proteins which modulate relaxation include, for example, connexin 43, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), guanylate cyclase, adenylate cyclase, protein kinase G, protein kinase A, potassium channels (particularly the Kand maxi-K subtypes), calcium channels, and any combination thereof. These proteins will enhance relaxation of smooth muscle, and will also decrease smooth muscle tone. In particular, where vasorelaxation is enhanced in penile smooth muscle, an erection will be more easily attained.","Similarly, where smooth muscle tone is decreased in the bladder, bladder capacity will be increased. In this embodiment of the invention, the gene therapy method is particularly useful for treating individuals with bladder hyperrefiexia. As used herein, a \u201chyperreflexic bladder\u201d is one which contracts spontaneously so that an individual is unable to control the passage of urine. This urinary disorder is more commonly called urge incontinence, and may include urge incontinence combined with stress incontinence.","Further provided by the present invention is a method of gene therapy wherein the protein involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone modulates contraction of smooth muscle. Representative proteins which modulate contraction include, for example, connexin 43, the alpha-1 receptor or the endothelin-1 receptor, phospholipase C, diacylglycerol, protein kinase C, myosin light-chain kinase, calmodulin, potassium channels, calcium channels, and any combination thereof. Specific examples of potassium-channel proteins which may be employed are the Kand maxi-K subtypes. These proteins can be altered to increase smooth muscle tone. Increased smooth muscle tone will, for example, increase a person's capacity to empty the urine contents from an atonic bladder. As used herein, an \u201catonic bladder\u201d is one which has diminished capacity to empty its urine contents because of ineffective detrusor contractility.","It is to be understood that the method of gene therapy described by the present invention may involve the transfer into a smooth muscle cell, whose function is involved in contraction and\/or relaxation, of more than one nucleic acid sequence encoding a protein. For example, the method of gene therapy may involve the transfer of a nucleic acid encoding protein kinase C, and the previous, simultaneous, or subsequent transfer of a nucleic acid encoding connexin 43. Connexin 43 is a gap-junction protein, found in bladder smooth muscle cells, corporal smooth muscle cells, and many other smooth muscle cell types, which facilitates the interactions between smooth muscle cells. Thus, the addition of nucleic acid encoding connexin 43 will facilitate intercellular interactions so that a greater percentage of cells will be affected by the gene therapy.","Also contemplated for use in the method of the present invention is a DNA sequence that encodes a protein that acts to inhibit a protein that modulates contraction of smooth muscle. A representative protein that modulates contraction of corporal smooth muscle, for example, is protein kinase C. Proteins which inhibit those proteins that are involved in the contraction of smooth muscle will ultimately cause enhanced smooth-muscle relaxation. This relaxation will, for example, result in a decreased capacity to empty the bladder of its urine contents, or in a more easily-attained erection.","Further contemplated is a DNA sequence that encodes a protein that acts to inhibit a protein that modulates relaxation of smooth muscle. An example of a protein that modulates relaxation of smooth muscle is protein kinase A. Proteins which inhibit those proteins that are involved in the relaxation of smooth muscle will ultimately cause enhanced smooth-muscle contraction; this will, for example, increase a person's capacity to empty the contents of an atonic bladder.","Additionally, the present invention specifically provides a method of regulating penile smooth muscle tone in a subject, comprising the introduction, into penile smooth muscle cells of the subject, of a DNA sequence encoding a protein involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone, and expression in a sufficient number of penile smooth muscle cells of the subject to induce penile erection in the subject. In this embodiment, the method of the present invention is used to alleviate erectile dysfunction. The erectile dysfunction may result from a variety of disorders, including neurogenic, arteriogenic, and veno-occlusive dysfunctions, as well as other conditions which cause incomplete relaxation of the smooth muscle. The subject may be animal or human, is preferably human.","Furthermore, the present invention specifically provides a method of regulating bladder smooth muscle tone in a subject, comprising the introduction, into bladder smooth muscle cells of the subject, of a DNA sequence encoding a protein involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone, and expression in a sufficient number of bladder smooth muscle cells of the subject to enhance bladder relaxation in the subject. In this embodiment, the method of the present invention is used to alleviate a hyperreflexic bladder. A hyperreflexic bladder may result from a variety of disorders, including neurogenic and arteriogenic dysfunctions, as well as other conditions which cause incomplete relaxation or heightened contractility of the smooth muscle of the bladder. The subject may be animal or human, and is preferably human.","Additionally, the present invention specifically provides a method of regulating bladder smooth muscle tone in a subject, comprising the introduction into smooth muscle cells of the subject of a DNA sequence encoding a protein involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone, and expression in a sufficient number of smooth muscle cells of the subject to induce bladder contraction in the subject. In this embodiment, the method of the present invention is used to alleviate an atonic bladder. An atonic bladder may result from a variety of disorders, including neurogenic and arteriogenic dysfunctions, as well as other conditions which cause incomplete contraction of the smooth muscle of the bladder. A neurogenic bladder dysfunction may manifest itself as partial or complete urinary retention or overflow incontinence. Examples of neurogenic dysfunctions of the bladder include a hypotonic, or flaccid, bladder, and a spastic, or contracted, bladder. These dysfunctions may result from an abnormality, injury, or disease process of the brain, spinal cord, or local nerve supply to the bladder and its outlet. Disease processes that result in neurogenic bladder dysfunction include benign hyperplasia of the prostate gland (BHP); cerebrovascular accidents; demyelinating or degenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; diabetes mellitus; a ruptured intervertebral disk; syphilis; and brain or spinal cord tumors. Again, the subject may be animal or human, and is preferably human.","In a further embodiment, the method of the present invention is used to prevent hypertrophy of the bladder smooth muscle of a subject, as caused by BHP, by introducing into the prostate of the subject a DNA sequence encoding a protein involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone. BHP is thought to be associated with increased tone of the smooth muscle in the prostate stoma. Eventually, BHP results in bladder-outlet obstruction, and hypertrophy of the bladder.","In another embodiment, the method of the present invention is used to induce contraction of the endopelvic fascia of a subject. The endopelvic fascia contributes to the support of the uterus and vagina. Frequently, women who experience a multiple of childbirths become incontinent due to stress damage between the endopelvic fascia and the muscles of the urethra.","In addition, the present invention provides for a method of reducing inflammation and irritation of smooth muscle in a subject, comprising the introduction, into the smooth muscle cells of the subject, of a DNA sequence encoding a protein involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone, and expression in a sufficient number of smooth muscle cells of the subject to reduce the effects of inflammation and irritation. For example, the method provided by the present invention may be used to reduce the symptoms of interstitial cystitis of the bladder. Interstitial cystitis is a condition of the bladder that has clinical manifestations of inflammation and irritation. The interstitial cystitis may be caused, for example, by an allergic reaction, an autoimmune disease, or a collagen disease. Furthermore, the method of gene therapy provided herein may be used, for example, to reduce inflammation and irritation of the ureter, urethra, or urinary tract of a subject, which may be caused by a bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infection.","Also contemplated by the present invention is a method of inducing smooth muscle tone in a subject who has undergone reanastomosis of the vas deferens, comprising the introduction, into the smooth muscle cells of the subject, of a DNA sequence encoding a protein involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone, and expression in a sufficient number of smooth muscle cells of the subject to alter smooth muscle tone in the vas deferens of the subject and ensure propulsion of the contents of the vas deferens.","In other embodiments of the invention, the method of gene therapy described herein is used to treat other dysfunctions relating to the performance of smooth muscle, including, but not limited to, asthma; coronary artery disease (infused during angiography); genitourinary dysfunctions of the ureter, urethra, urinary tract, and vas deferens; irritable bowel syndrome; migraine headaches; premature labor; Raynaud's syndrome; and thromboangitis obliterans. When used to treat asthma, the present method of gene therapy may be administered to a subject by way of aerosol delivery using any method known in the art.","The present invention also provides viral and non-viral recombinant vectors. A viral-based vector comprises: (1) nucleic acid of, or corresponding to at least a portion of, the genome of a virus, which portion is capable of directing the expression of a DNA sequence; and (2) a DNA sequence encoding a protein involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone, operably linked to the viral nucleic acid and capable of being expressed as a functional gene product in the target cell. The recombinant viral vectors of the present invention may be derived from a variety of viral nucleic acids known to one skilled in the art, e.g., the genomes of adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, HSV, Semiliki Forest virus, vaccinia virus, and other viruses, including RNA and DNA viruses.","The recombinant vectors of the present invention may also contain a nucleotide sequence encoding suitable regulatory elements, so as to effect expression of the vector construct in a suitable host cell. As used herein, \u201cexpression\u201d refers to the ability of the vector to transcribe the inserted DNA sequence into mRNA so that synthesis of the protein encoded by the inserted nucleic acid can occur. Those skilled in the art will appreciate the following: (1) that a variety of enhancers and promoters are suitable for use in the constructs of the invention; and (2) that the constructs will contain the necessary start, termination, and control sequences for proper transcription and processing of the DNA sequence encoding a protein involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone, upon introduction of the recombinant vector construct into a host cell.","The non-viral vectors provided by the present invention, for the expression in a smooth muscle cell of the DNA sequence encoding a protein involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone, may comprise all or a portion of any of the following vectors known to one skilled in the art: pCMV\u03b2 (Invitrogen), pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), pET-3d (Novagen), pProEx-1 (Life Technologies), pFastBac 1 (Life Technologies), pSFV (Life Technologies), pcDNA2 (Invitrogen), pSL301 (Invitrogen), pSE280 (Invitrogen), pSE380 (Invitrogen), pSE420 (Invitrogen), pTrcHis A,B,C (Invitrogen), pRSET A,B,C (Invitrogen), pYES2 (Invitrogen), pAC360 (Invitrogen), pVL1392 and pVl1392 (Invitrogen), pCDM8 (Invitrogen), pcDNA I (Invitrogen), pcDNA I(amp) (Invitrogen), pZeoSV (Invitrogen), pRc\/CMV (Invitrogen), pRc\/RSV (Invitrogen), pREP4 (Invitrogen), pREP7 (Invitrogen), pREP8 (Invitrogen), pREP9 (Invitrogen), pREP10 (Invitrogen), pCEP4 (Invitrogen), pEBVHis (Invitrogen), and \u03bbPop6. Other vectors would be apparent to one skilled in the art.","Promoters suitable for the present invention include, but are not limited to, constitutive promoters, tissue-specific promoters, and inducible promoters. In one embodiment of the invention, expression of the DNA sequence encoding a protein involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone is controlled and affected by the particular vector into which the DNA sequence has been introduced. Some eukaryotic vectors have been engineered so that they are capable of expressing inserted nucleic acids to high levels within the host cell. Such vectors utilize one of a number of powerful promoters to direct the high level of expression. Eukaryotic vectors use promoter-enhancer sequences of viral genes, especially those of tumor viruses. This particular embodiment of the invention provides for regulation of expression of the DNA sequence encoding the protein, through the use of inducible promoters. Non-limiting examples of inducible promoters include metallothionine promoters and mouse mammary tumor virus promoters. Depending on the vector, expression of the DNA sequence in the smooth muscle cell would be induced by the addition of a specific compound at a certain point in the growth cycle of the cell. Other examples of promoters and enhancers effective for use in the recombinant vectors of the present invention include, but are not limited to, CMV (cytomegalovirus), SV40 (simian virus 40), HSV (herpes simplex virus), EBV (Epstein-Barr virus), retrovirus, adenoviral promoters and enhancers, and smooth-muscle-specific promoters and enhancers. An example of a smooth-muscle-specific promoter is SM22\u03b1.","The present invention further provides a smooth muscle cell which expresses an exogenous DNA sequence encoding a protein involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone. As used herein, \u201cexogenous\u201d means any DNA that is introduced into an organism or cell. The introduction into the smooth muscle cell of a recombinant vector containing the exogenous DNA sequence may be effected by methods known to one skilled in the art, such as electroporation, DEAE Dextran, cationic liposome fusion, protoplast fusion, DNA-coated microprojectile bombardment, injection with recombinant replication-defective viruses, homologous recombination, and naked DNA transfer by, for example, intravesical instillation. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that any of these methods of DNA transfer may be combined.","Alterations in ion-channel activity are suspected in the etiology of human smooth-muscle-related disorders as diverse as asthma, bladder dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, and hypertension. In all of these tissues, myocyte potassium channels play a central role in mediating the effects on smooth muscle tone of diverse endogenous substances. While many K channels are present in human smooth muscle cells, the K(or maxi-K) channel subtype plays a pivotal role in modulating contraction and relaxation responses; thus, it also plays a role in determining the degree of smooth muscle tone. For example, it is suspected that K channels participate in the disease process of incontinence, a condition related to bladder over-activity (i.e., increased detrusor contractility) that affects the quality of life of millions of Americans (Brading, A. F., 58(2):120P\u2013127P, 1992; Andersson, K.-E., 50:74\u201384, 1997; and Fry, et al., 84:161\u201369, 1999).","Potassium channels are important in the regulation of human smooth muscle tone. Genes for more than thirty K channels, many of which are expressed in smooth muscle, have been identified (Lawson, K., 91:651\u201363, 1996; Lawson, K., 70(1):39\u201363, 1996; and Ashcroft, F. M., ed., , New York: Academic Press, 2000). As one might imagine, the existence of such a diverse repertoire of K channels has potentially-important implications for the modulation of electrical activity in human smooth muscle cells, including corporal myocytes. Despite the plethora of known K-channel subtypes, experimental and clinical data in human corporal smooth muscle provide evidence for the presence and physiological relevance of only two: (1) the metabolically-gated K channel (i.e., K), and (2) the large-conductance, calcium-sensitive K channel (i.e., the Kor maxi-K channel) (Dorschner, et al., 55(6):1060\u201366, 1999; Lee, et al., 11:179\u201388, 1999; and Benevides, et al., 161:212 (Abstract), 1999.","There is substantial evidence from many tissues, including smooth muscle, that the Kchannel is a heteromultimer, composed of an inward rectifier K-channel subunit (Kir), which is a tetramer of homologous subunits, and a sulfonylurea receptor subunit (SUR), which is the putative target of orally-active sulfonylurea compounds such as glibenclamide. The SUR subunits exist in a 1:1 stoichiometry with the Kir subunits (Aguilar-Bryan, et al., 78:227\u201345, 1998; Seino, 61:337\u201362, 1999; and Dorschner, et al., 55:1060\u201366, 1999). The tetrameric Kir assembly represents the pore-forming region of the Kchannel; however, importantly, it is not known to form a functional channel in the absence of the SUR subunit.","The Kir gene family has been divided into six subfamilies, based on sequence identity of the cloned channel cDNAs. Major subfamilies of 1.0, 2.0, and 6.0 have been identified. The Kir2.x and Kir6.x are arguably the most relevant to the Kchannels found in smooth muscle, and, thus far, only Kir6.2 is known to be present in human corporal smooth muscle (Day, et al., 11:A328, 1997). With respect to the SUR subunit, two SUR genes have been identified, SUR1 and SUR2. Splice variants of SUR2 provide for SUR2A, SUR2B, and SUR2C subtypes. There are currently no data available concerning the disposition of the SUR subunit(s) in human corporal myocytes, but such studies are ongoing. Nevertheless, recombination of the Kir6.2 subtype with the SUR2B isoforms yields a K-like channel which has pharmacological and electrophysiological characteristics similar to those observed for the putative Kchannel that is present in human corpus cavernosum smooth muscle (i.e., Kir6.2) (Lee, et al., 11:189\u201399, 1999).","From a pharmacological standpoint, several K-channel activators (e.g., pinacidil, cromakalim, lemakalim, and nicorandil) have been shown to relax precontracted corporal tissue strips from both animals and humans; moreover, these activators have been shown to elicit an erection in monkeys and humans when injected intracavernosally (Andersson, 70:244\u201354, 1992; and Benevides, et al., 161:212(Abstract), 1999). Furthermore, with respect to pinacidil and levcromakalim, relaxation of precontracted human corporal tissue strips was shown to be glibenclamide-sensitive (Day, et al., 11:A328, 1997). Consistent with such observations, electrophysiological studies (i.e., patch clamp) conducted on freshly-isolated individual human corporal myocytes have identified two ATP-inhibited, glibenclamide-sensitive unitary currents, of approximately 20 and 60 pS (Lee, et al., 11:189\u201399, 1999). In addition, a pinacidil-induced, glibenclamide-sensitive whole-cell outward current has been demonstrated on both cultured (Christ, et al., 14:319\u201328, 1993) and freshly-isolated (Lee, et al., 11:189\u201399, 1999) human corporal myocytes. The extant evidence, then, is consistent with the notion that the Kchannel subtype is an important modulator of human corporal smooth muscle tone.","Of critical importance with respect to all in vivo gene therapy approaches are the percentage of target cells that must be affected in order to see a physiologically-relevant therapeutic effect, and the relative efficiency of affecting only the desired cell type(s). In this regard, it is suspected that gene therapy may be inherently more successful in alleviating erectile dysfunction and bladder dysfunction than in treating more systemic, cardiovascular disorders. In particular, the method of gene therapy provided by the present invention meets the need for a method which produces global changes in a tissue by genetically modifying only a fraction of the cells. For example, the inventors have demonstrated the effectiveness of naked DNA transfer in the penis and in the bladder. The inventors have also shown that the physiological functions of a smooth muscle cell enable the intercellular transfer and continuous propagation, in only a fraction of the total cellular population, of the effects of incorporation of naked DNA sequences encoding proteins involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone. This effect is brought about through the operation of gap-junction proteins.","It is a well-documented fact that corporal and arterial smooth muscle cells are interconnected, both in vivo and in vitro, by a ubiquitously-distributed population of intercellular channels, known as gap-junction proteins, (Christ, et al., 49(24):PL195\u2013200, 1991; Christ, et al., 5(2):77\u201396, 1993; Christ, et al., & 266(2):1054\u201365, 1993; Christ, et al., 67(3):1335\u201344, 1994; Christ, G. J., 22(4):727\u201345, 1995; Christ, et al., 79:631\u201346, 1996; Christ, G. J., 15:36\u201344, 1997; and Christ and Melman, 1:45\u201354, 1997). The mechanisms for these channels in corporal smooth muscle cells are depicted in . Additionally, as illustrated in , gap-junction channels are critical to corporal tissue function and, ultimately, the success of gene therapy for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.","In the corpora, for example, smooth-muscle contraction (i.e., elevation in intracellular calcium levels) might be accomplished following activation of the \u03b1-adrenergic receptor by norepinephrine, or by endothelin-1 (ET-1) activation of the ETreceptor. In both cases, receptor activation leads to Ca mobilization. Specifically, activation of these receptors by norepinephrine or ET-1 leads to activation of phospholipase C, which cleaves membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol (PIP) into IPand diacylglycerol (DAG). As illustrated in , increases in DAG and IPultimately exert their effects, at least in part, via increases in intracellular Ca levels. Conversely, any physiological event resulting in a diminution of transmembrane Ca flux, or sequestration of intracellular Ca (e.g., membrane hyperpolarization), will result in smooth-muscle relaxation. For example, prostaglandin E(PGE) activates the PGEreceptor to stimulate the adenylate cyclase enzyme, which then catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP. Increased cAMP then stimulates protein kinase A (PKA). Alternately, smooth-muscle relaxation can be achieved by nitric oxide, released from endothelial or neuronal sources. Nitric oxide diffuses into smooth muscle cells to activate soluble guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of GTP to cGMP. Elevated cGMP levels activate protein kinase G (PKG).","The effects of PKA, PKG, and PKC on gap junctions, K channels, and Ca channels are thought to be mediated through phosphorylation of specific amino acid residues on these target proteins.  illustrates the result of their putative actions, where (+) means a stimulatory, positive, or increasing effect, and (\u2212) means an inhibitory or negative effect. This simplified model demonstrates how the interactions of these important second-messenger systems might impact on gap-junction, K, and Ca channels, thereby modulating smooth muscle tone in vitro and in vivo.","K-ion flux in smooth muscle cells is controlled by three main effector pathways. The first two are the cAMP\/PKA (protein kinase A) and cGMP\/PKG (protein kinase G) pathways, which are activated by PGEand nitric oxide (NO), respectively. These pathways clearly modulate the activity of the maxi-K channel; however, their effects on the Kchannel have not yet been documented. The third pathway involves the K-channel modulators, which modulate the activity of the Kchannel. Because of the disposition of these ions in the intracellular and extracellular spaces, the opening of Ca channels leads to the influx of Ca, down its electrochemical gradient, and subsequent intracellular depolarization; the opening of K channels leads to efflux of K, down its electrochemical gradient, and subsequent intracellular hyperpolarization. The effects of these reciprocal pathways on membrane potential and the level of smooth muscle tone are exerted, at least in part, through modulation of the intracellular calcium concentration, where increases in intracellular calcium are associated with contraction, and decreases in intracellular calcium are associated with relaxation.","Connexin 43 is the predominant gap-junction protein isoform expressed in the human and rat penis and bladder. The presence of connexin 43 in human bladder smooth muscle has been documented only by the inventors. Connexin 43 intercellular channels provide partial cytoplasmic continuity between adjacent smooth muscle cells, allowing the intercellular exchange of physiologically-relevant ions (K and Ca) and second-messenger molecules (IP, CAMP, and cGMP). This is extremely important, given the relatively sparse autonomic innervation of the corporal parenchyma and the parenchyma of other visceral organs.","As demonstrated by both molecular biological and electrophysiological techniques, gap junctions provide the anatomic substrate required for the rapid and syncytial contraction and relaxation responses required of the corporal smooth muscle cells for normal penile erection, as well as detumescence. Moreover, gap junctions provide an additional anatomic substrate for the rapid and syncytial contraction and relaxation responses required of bladder smooth muscle cells in order to achieve normal bladder function. While bladder myocytes are clearly capable of regenerative electrical events, the presence of gap junctions is relevant, not only to provide a \u201csafety factor\u201d for the maintenance and propagation of regenerative electrical events (as shown in the heart), but also for ensuring tissue plasticity. Viewed in terms of the recently-advanced \u201csyncytial tissue triad\u201d concept (see Christ, G. J., 15:36\u201344, 1997, herein incorporated by reference), gap junctions are thought to endow the bladder musculature with the ability to function syncytially under a very wide range of physiological conditions, thereby mitigating the sparsity of direct innervations of bladder smooth muscle cells by the autonomic nervous system. Nevertheless, the electrical excitability of the bladder myocyte has been traditionally viewed as a priori evidence for the lack of importance of demonstrable gap junctions between bladder myocytes (using light and electron microscopy).","Perhaps more importantly, however, is the possibility that these gap junctions may provide a mechanistic basis for the efficacy of gene therapy in the treatment of penile dysfunction and bladder dysfunction. In particular, the network of gap junctions permits smooth muscle cells, not directly activated by a relevant neuronal\/pharmacological signal, to be rapidly, albeit indirectly, recruited into the contraction or relaxation response by way of this prominent intercellular pathway. The experimental and clinical evidence verifying the validity of this supposition has been outlined in recent publications (Christ, et al., 79:631\u201346, 1996; and Christ, G. J., 15:36\u201344, 1997), and a mathematical model has been constructed that accounts for this behavior (Christ, et al., 155:620A (Abstract), 1996; and Ramanan, et al., 193(1):69\u201384, 1998).","Thus, as the inventors have demonstrated for the penis and the bladder, the major implication is that the presence of these gap-junction channels makes it likely that only a small fraction of the smooth muscle cells need to be genetically modified in order to effect rather global changes in penile or bladder smooth muscle tone. The inventors have already demonstrated that the gap-junction protein connexin 43, as well as two prominent K-channel subtypes (i.e., the maxi-K and Kchannels), are present in rat and human penis and bladder smooth muscle. Accordingly, both the penis and bladder are amenable to the gene-therapy protocols proposed in this application, and are the first logical targets for evaluating the efficacy of genetic modulation of smooth muscle tone.","Smooth muscle cells constitute a heterogeneous collection of effector cells. By virtue of their presence in, and regulation of, blood vessels, they ultimately affect the function of all organs. Moreover, they are the parenchymal cells in most hollow organs, including the viscera of the urogenital tract (i.e., bladder, ureter, and prostate). Everywhere, including the entire genitourinary system, coordination of activity among the smooth muscle cells is an important component of normal tissue function and, therefore, organ function. While the autonomic nervous system supplies neural input to all peripheral organs, the density, distribution, and roles of nerve fibers vary. In a given tissue, the level of activity of smooth muscle cells, and the cellular mechanisms involved, can differ dramatically from those of other smooth muscle phenotypes.","It is becoming increasingly clear that the role of the autonomic nervous system in particular organs is uniquely correlated with the physiological phenotype of the constituent smooth muscle cells. Membrane excitability, signal transduction processes, and the extent of cell-to-cell communication between smooth muscle cells all vary among different tissues. Thus, the components of an effector process are integrated together to yield the characteristic action of an organ. Furthermore, the components occur in different combinations to provide a rich diversity of organ function. Understanding the principles of initiation and spread of stimuli in the smooth muscle tissues is clearly necessary for understanding organ physiology, and, as discussed below, provides the key to the success of gene therapy.","It is of particular relevance that the functional diversity of smooth muscle correlates with the functional diversity of peripheral organ systems. This diversity is expressed at every level of tissue organization within an organ, from the pattern of autonomic neuronal innervation, to the phenotype of the parenchymal cell. Much of the diversity in smooth muscle function is due to the effector systems that transduce the results of receptor activation into intracellular second-messenger events throughout the tissue. Clearly, such diversity of smooth muscle regulation\/function has important implications for smooth-muscle-specific therapeutic options. However, it is necessary also to consider the mechanism(s) by which signals are integrated among the parenchymal cells. In particular, the success of the method of gene therapy described in this application depends on the more recent evidence documenting the distribution and function of gap junctions between smooth muscle cells in organ systems throughout the body. This evidence points to a major role for intercellular communication in coordinating smooth muscle responses in the various tissues of the different organs.","The principles outlined above suggest that the use of gene therapy to treat disorders of the urogenital system will overcome one of the significant barriers to clinical success that arises when gene therapy is used to treat many other diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disease. In particular, when used to treat cancer and cardiovascular disease, gene therapy explicitly depends on high-efficiency transfection rates in selected cells, following systemic administration. As such, then, the use of gene therapy in the treatment of cancer or cardiovascular disease stands in stark contrast to the use of gene therapy to treat impotence or incontinence, where the isolated, easily-accessible conditions of the penis and bladder confer distinct advantages to the selective administration of genetic material.","For example, it appears that gene therapy is an attractive possibility for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in the human penis because the presence of pharmacologically-induced erections in many impotent men indicates that the veno-occlusive mechanism is properly functioning in these patients. In such patients, then, an erection could be pharmacologically induced by conventional intracavernous agents, while the gene(s) of interest are simultaneously injected. The injected gene(s) would be expected to be restricted largely to the corporal parenchyma, because the venous outflow during a normal erection is very small (Lue, et al., 137:829, 1987; Carrier, et al., 42(4):468\u201381, 1993; Lerner, et al., 149(5.2):1246\u201355, 1993; and Andersson, et al., 75(1):191\u2013236, 1995). In this scenario, there would be little risk of systemic vascular side effects.","Similarly, the anatomical location of the human bladder makes gene therapy an attractive possibility because, as with the human penis, the bladder is a relatively \u201cisolated\u201d organ system that should be quite amenable to genetic modification, in the absence of effects on other organs\/tissues. The bladder is an internal organ into which external substances can be easily introduced through a urethral catheter. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy for bladder cancer is already a well-recognized use of this technique. The instillation of a gene product in an aqueous solution, which can be voluntarily retained by the patient within the bladder for a prescribed duration of time, would presumably restrict the gene product largely to the bladder musculature. The data described in the Experimental Details Section document that this is, indeed, the case. Again, in this scenario, there is clearly little risk of systemic side effects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIGS. 14\u201318"},"As proposed herein, the goal of gene therapy in the urogenital system is to achieve the lowest transfection rate possible that is correlated with the desired physiological changes. Taken together, it is clear that less aggressive and less invasive genetic strategies, such as a single injection of naked DNA, are attractive options for the effective treatment of urogenital diseases. Previous physiological studies in the rat penis (Rehman, et al., 41:H1960\u201371, 1997) have confirmed this supposition, and, therefore, have assisted in establishing the boundary conditions for the maintenance of normal integrative tissue responses.","Moreover, the parameters\/conditions for normal tissue behavior, which the inventors have identified thus far, have been recently encapsulated in a mathematical construct (Ramanan, et al., 193(1):69\u201384, 1998). The resulting mathematical model can be used to generate experimentally-testable and clinically-testable hypotheses concerning the predicted behaviors of tissues under a diverse range of physiologically-relevant conditions. The model will assist, for example, in determining the lower limit of transfection efficiency required to achieve restoration of normal tissue function in a urogenital organ compromised by disease. It will also assist in identifying the best probes\/genes for the transfection.","The inventors anticipate that gene therapy alone (i.e., the proposed genetic alteration of the smooth muscle cells' response to their environment), will work in all patients in whom there is enough neuronal innervation remaining to coordinate a normal syncytial tissue response. However, in those patients in whom sufficient neuronal innervation is not available to guarantee the success of gene therapy per se, the inventors have proposed a secondary strategy. The secondary strategy involves the concomitant administration of either orally-active agents, or locally-administered drugs (e.g., the MUSE intraurethral suppository), that will augment the underlying effects of gene therapy (in particular, penile erection or bladder function).","For example, one could transfect the penile or bladder smooth muscle cells with a K channel, as proposed herein, and then deliver to the patient a drug which selectively activates that channel. There are many possible combinations of custom-designed drugs and\/or genetically-engineered K channels that could produce a similar desired effect. Another example of such a secondary, or combined genetic\/pharmacologic, therapy would be the transfection of the penis or bladder with a maxi-K or Kchannel subtype\/isoform\/chimera, followed by administration to the patient of a selective\/synthetic activator of that channel. The foregoing two examples represent merely the most obvious of a plethora of potential therapeutic possibilities.","In summary, the method of gene therapy provided by the present invention is designed to take advantage of the generally-accepted physiological principle that relatively subtle alterations in the balance between contracting and relaxing stimuli can result in profound alterations in smooth muscle physiology, and, therefore, smooth muscle function (Christ, et al., 101(2):375\u201381, 1990; Azadzoi, et al., 148(5):1587\u201391, 1992; Lerner, et al., 149(5.2):1246\u201355, 1993; Taub, et al., 42:698, 1993; and Christ, G. J., 22(4):727\u201345, 1995). When using the method of gene therapy described herein, the goal is to restore a more normal balance between contracting and relaxing stimuli following expression of exogenous genes that code for physiologically-relevant proteins in smooth muscle. As indicated in regard to the rat model, expression of these exogenous genes can be maintained for a period of weeks to months. This would permit the patient to obtain a \u201cnormal\u201d erection, or \u201cnormal\u201d bladder function, in the absence of any other exogenous manipulation, during this time period. Clearly, this is a major advance over all currently-available therapies. Indeed, the accessibility of the urogenital organs, the documented presence of gap junctions among smooth muscle cells throughout the urogenital tract, and the fact that subtle alterations in the tone of smooth muscle are responsible for many aspects of human urogenital disease, all provide clear advantages to the use of gene therapy for treating urogenital disorders.","The present invention is described in the following Experimental Details Section. That section is set forth to aid in the understanding of the invention, and should not be construed to limit in any way the invention as defined in the claims which follow thereafter.","Materials and Methods","I. Erectile Dysfunction Gene Therapy Experiments","The discussion which follows outlines two specific strategies for gene therapy of erectile dysfunction. In the first case, the \u201csensitivity\u201d of the smooth muscle cells was nominally enhanced to the endogenous neuronal stimulus by transfecting the cells with the human maxi-K cDNA. In the second case, the neuronal \u201cdriving force\u201d for erection was increased by transfecting corporal smooth muscle cells with a constitutively-expressed nitric oxide synthase (NOS) cDNA, bNOS. Clearly, this strategy for gene therapy is explicitly dependent on both the efficacy and stability of the proposed transfection. Evidence for both is presented below. Additionally, in order to examine the potential utility of gene therapy involving the Kchannel in treating erectile dysfunction and bladder incontinence, the inventors examined the ability of a single intracavernous injection of 100 g of Kir6.2\/pVax1 to restore the compromised erectile capacity normally associated with aging in the Sprague-Dawley male retired breeder.","a) Gene Transfer of Maxi-K Using a Recombinant Vector","1. Plasmids and Genes","The pCMV\u03b2 and pcDNA3 plasmids were purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, Calif.). The human cDNA of hSlo, the \u03b1- or pore-forming subunit of maxi-K, was obtained from Dr. Salkoff (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Mo.) (McCobb, et al., 269:H767\u2013H777, 1995). The nucleotide sequence of the hSlo cDNA is also available at Genbank Accession No. U23767. The neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) cDNA was obtained from Dr. S. Snyder (Johns Hopkins University) and Dr. D. Bredt (Univ. Calif. San Francisco) (Bredt, et al., 351:714\u201318, 1991). The nucleotide sequence of the neuronal NOS is also available at Genbank Accession No. X59949. The human maxi-K channel cDNA (approximately 3,900 nucleotides, or 3.9 kb, long) (McCobb, et al., 269:H767\u2013H777, 1995) or the neuronal NOS cDNA (Bredt\/Snyder 91287795) (Bredt, et al., 351:714\u201318, 1991) was inserted into the XhoI-XbaI cloning sites of the pcDNA3 vector, where expression is driven off the cytomegalovirus CMV\u03b2 promoter (Invitrogen). One hundred \u03bcg of plasmid DNA was suspended in 200 \u03bcl of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 20% sucrose, then injected into the corpus cavernosum (CC) of anesthetized rats.","2.

To determine the efficacy of these techniques for in vivo intracorporal cavernosal gene transfer, the plasmid pCMV\u03b2 was injected into the CC tissue of nine rats, in the forms of naked DNA (n=3), an incorporation of cationic liposomes (n=3), and a recombinant adenovirus containing the LacZ cDNA coding for \u03b2-galactosidase (n=3) (see Table 1). All three techniques of gene transfer produced positive results; however, adenoviral-mediated gene transfer was the most effective, as evidenced on the whole-tissue level by the conversion of the chromogenic substrate, X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-D-galactoside), into its blue breakdown product, as a result of \u03b2-galactosidase activity.","Naked DNA.

The corporal tissue was obtained from groups of three animals at each of the four time points, ranging from 2\u201311 weeks post-injection (see Table 1 for details). An equivalent number of uninjected control animals, at each time point post-injection, was run in parallel.

Injection of cDNA Coding for Neuronal NOS or Maxi-K Channel Protein\u2014Groups C and D","Either the human maxi-K channel cDNA (hSlo) or the neuronal NOS cDNA was inserted into the XhoI-XbaI cloning sites of the pcDNA3 vector. One hundred \u03bcg of each plasmid (either pcDNA\/maxi-K or pcDNA\/NOS), in 200 \u03bcl of phosphate-buffered saline (containing 20% sucrose), were injected into the CCs of anesthetized 9-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Control rats were either sham-operated, sham-operated with an intracorporal injection of 200 \u03bcl of PBS (containing 20% sucrose), or sham-operated with an intracorporal injection of 200 \u03bcl of PBS containing 20% sucrose and 100 \u03bcg of pcDNA-vector DNA. Basal and nerve-stimulated intracorporal pressures (ICPs) were measured between 2 weeks and 4 months after intracavernous injection. No significant differences were observed in ICPs within the time frame examined, and results from all animals within each group were pooled. Similarly, no significant differences were observed among the various controls, and all control data were pooled.","The data depicted in  and Table 2 indicate that the injection of either the NOS or maxi-K cDNA significantly increased both basal and nerve-stimulated ICPs. The mean basal fractional change in ICP increased from a control level of \u22488 (cm of HO) to \u224814 in NOS-injected rats, and to \u224813 in maxi-K-injected rats. In a similar manner, the nerve-stimulated fractional change in ICP was approximately 30% higher in both NOS- and maxi-K-injected rats, over a range of 2\u201310 mA stimulation.","The age-matched control animals were considered to represent a homogeneous population, since statistical analysis revealed that there were no significant differences among these animals, 1\u20134 months after injection, with respect to the mean amplitude of the ICPs measured in response to all levels of current stimulation used in these studies. In addition, four retired breeders received an injection with pcDNA\/hSlo DNA, as described below. Two months after this injection, the animals were sacrificed, and the corporal tissue was quickly excised and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for RT-PCR and Northern analyses (without the performance of any physiological experiments in vivo). Five age-matched control animals, which were run in parallel, received injections of vehicle only.","7. Preparation of Animals for In Vivo Erectile Studies","Induction of anesthesia. The rats were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection (35 mg\/kg) of sodium pentobarbital (Anpro Pharmaceuticals). Anesthesia was maintained during the course of the experimental protocol (2\u20133 hrs) by subsequent injection of pentobarbital (5\u201310 mg\/kg) every 45\u201360 minutes, as required.","Surgical preparation and placement of pressure-monitoring cannulas.  illustrates the entire experimental procedure. Animals were anaesthetized, and placed in the supine position. The bladder and prostate were exposed through a midline abdominal incision. The arterial line in the left carotid artery was connected to a MacLab data acquisition board via a transducer and transducer amplifier, for continuous monitoring of blood pressure. A right external jugular venous line was utilized for intravenous fluid transfusion or blood sampling. The prostate was exposed by a lower midline incision. The cavernous nerve was seen on the posterolateral surface of the prostate, arising from the pelvic ganglion that is formed by the joining of the hypogastric and pelvic nerves. The two corpora were exposed by inguinoscrotal incisions on both sides, combined with degloving of the penis. A line was inserted into the right corpora for continuous monitoring of intracorporal pressure via the MacLab instrumentation. Yet another line was inserted into the left corpora, for intracavernous drug injection. Lastly, the nerve-stimulator probe was placed around the cavernous nerve for current stimulation. The inferior hypogastric plexus (i.e., the pelvic plexus or major pelvic ganglion), the pelvic nerve, and the cavernous nerve were identified posterolateral to the prostate, on both sides, and the stainless-steel bipolar wire electrodes were placed around these structures for electrical stimulation. Both crura of the penis were exposed by removing part of the overlying ischiocavernous muscle. In order to monitor intracorporal pressure (ICP), a 23-gauge cannula was filled with 250 U\/ml of heparin solution, connected to PE-50 tubing (Intramedic, Becton Dickinson), and inserted into the right corpus cavernosum. The tubing was then fixed to the tunica with a 7-0 Dermalon suture, to ensure stability during measurement of ICP. Another 23-gauge cannula was connected to a 1-ml syringe, and inserted into the left corpus cavernosum for intracavernous drug injection. Systemic arterial blood pressure (BP) was monitored via a 25-gauge cannula placed into the carotid artery.","Both pressure lines, BP and ICP, were connected to a pressure transducer, which was, in turn, connected via a transducer amplifier (ETH 400 CB Sciences, Inc.) to a data acquisition board (MacLab\/8e, ADI Instruments, MA). Real-time display and recording of pressure measurements were performed on a Macintosh computer (MacLab software v3.4). The pressure transducers and data acquisition board were calibrated in cm of HO.","Neurostimulation of cavernous nerve and recording of intracorporal pressure. Direct electrostimulation of the cavernous nerve was performed with a delicate stainless-steel bipolar hook electrode attached to the multijointed clamp. Each probe was 0.2 mm in diameter; the two poles were separated by 1 mm. Monophasic rectangular pulses were delivered by a signal generator (custom-made, with built-in constant current amplifier). Stimulation parameters were as follows: frequency, 20 Hz; pulse width, 0.22 msec; duration, 1 min. The current protocol involved the application of increasing current at the following intervals: 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mA. The changes in intracorporal pressure and systemic blood pressure were recorded at each level of neurostimulation.","8. Tissue Procurement, Fixation, and Immunohistochemistry Analysis","Tissue retrieval. Following completion of the neurostimulation experiments, the penises of both the gene therapy and age-matched control animals were harvested, and the distal end of each penis was marked with methylene blue to ensure the proper later identification of the distal and proximal ends. All penile tissue was immediately transferred to 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for fixation for 4 hours at 20\u00b0 C.; it was later cryoprotected in cold 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4), at 4\u00b0 C. (overnight or longer), for immunostaining. Part of the penis of each animal was also frozen in liquid nitrogen and preserved at 80\u00b0 C. for molecular biological studies. The penile tissue was sectioned on a cryostat at 14 \u03bcM; the sections were dried onto slides and paraffin-embedded. The slides were stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until they were stained\u2014usually within 2\u20134 weeks.","Histology. Histological examination of the sections was performed to confirm the identification of nerves and smooth muscles. Serial slide-mounted sections were fixed in 10% formalin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. All slide-preparation specimens were viewed with a Zeiss microscope.","Nitric oxide synthase immunohistochemistry. Slide-mounted tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene, rehydrated in graded alcohols, and blocked for endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Nonspecific binding of antibodies to the specimens was blocked by incubation with 1.5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 minutes at room temperature. The slides were then drained and incubated with primary antibody, at room temperature, for one hour. The antibody was a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against brain NOS (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, Ky.). An antibody concentration of 1.0 \u03bcg\/ml was found to be optimal for immunostaining. Antigen binding was detected by the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method, using the VectaStain Elite ABC kit. The color reaction was developed with diaminobenzidine that was activated with hydrogen peroxide (diaminobenzidine as the chromogen), and then counterstained with hematoxylin solution. Staining was not evident in the negative control, which substituted PBS for primary antibody, thereby providing support for the specificity of primary antibody used in the experiment.","Statistical analyses. All statistical analyses were performed using the Stat-View 4.5 software (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, Calif.). Either a Two-Way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc multiple comparisons (Tukey), or a two-tailed student-t test for unrelated samples, was utilized, as appropriate, for comparison of group means for parameters of interest among gene therapy (i.e., maxi-K transfected) rats, age-matched control rats, and young control rats. All differences were considered significant at p<0.05. Unless otherwise stated, all data will be expressed as the mean (\u00b1S.E.M.).","Construction of stimulus-response curves. Stimulus-response curves were generated to illustrate the effects of neurostimulation on intracorporal pressure by expressing the change in intracorporal pressure as a fraction of the mean systemic blood pressure (expressed in ICP\/BP), then plotting this fraction as a function of the magnitude of neurostimulation (for 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mA). All data were plotted using Sigma Plot software for Macintosh computers (Sigma Plot Mac v5.0, Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, Calif.).","9. Detecting Expression of Recombinant K","RNA preparation. Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissue using the TRIzol method. Briefly, tissue was homogenized in TRIzol reagent by a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkman, NY) for about 30 seconds. The tissue lysate was then transferred to a polypropylene, 10\u00d71.8 cm, round-bottom tube (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, NJ), and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. Chloroform was then added, and the solution was centrifuged at 12,000\u00d7g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. RNA in the aqueous phase was extracted from the TRIzol-and-chloroform mixture, and was then precipitated from the aqueous phase by mixing with isopropyl alcohol and centrifuging at 12,000\u00d7g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. RNA was stored in 0.08 M sodium acetate and 70% ethanol.","Northern blot analysis. Twenty fig of total RNA from each tissue sample was electrophoresed in 1% agarose containing 2.2 M formaldehyde, then transferred onto nylon membranes by capillary transblotting. The positions of 28s and 18s ribosomal RNA bands on the ethidium-stained gels were observed under ultraviolet illumination before transblotting. RNA was fixed to the filter by heating for 2 hours at 80\u00b0 C. The hSlo cDNA was cut from the XhoI and XbaI sites of pcDNA, purified on an agarose gel, labeled with random primer biotin using the NEBlot Phototype Kit (New England Biolabs), then used as cDNA probes for Northern blots. Hybridization was carried out in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ind.) at 68\u00b0 C. for 2 hours. Filters were washed two times in 2.5\u00d7SSC and 0.1% SDS, at room temperatures then washed two times in 1\u00d7SSC at 68\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes, and three times in 0.1% SDS at 68\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes. Following the washings, the membranes underwent detection steps using streptavidin and biotin alkaline phosphatase with CDP-Star substrate, according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). After incubation with CDP-Star substrate, the membranes were removed and exposed to the Hyperfilm (Amersham), in an intensifying screen, for at least 15 minutes. The film was developed with time adjustments, and the bands were analyzed.","RT-PCR. To further confirm and detect expression of the recombinant K, two distinct PCR strategies were used: (1) with primers specific to the plasmid sequences (T7 and SP6 promoters); and (2) with primers specific for the 5\u2032-untranslated region (see below). With respect to the latter strategy, oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification of the 5\u2032-untranslated region (approximately 0.14 kb) were 5\u2032-GCCGCCACCATTTGCCAT-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:1) (a 3\u2032 primer, coding for the first six amino acids of K) and 5\u2032-CCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:2) (a 5\u2032 primer, specific to the T7 promoter). With respect to the former strategy, oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification of the full Kinsert (approximately 4.2 kb) were the T7 promoter region (see above) and the SP6 promoter region (5\u2032-CTAGCATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO:3). The primers for an endogenous Kregion (bases 909\u20131074; 5\u2032-GCTCTCCATATTTATCAGCAC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:4) and 5\u2032-AACATCCCCATAACCAAC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:5)) were used as controls.","The RT-PCR was performed using the Superscript One-Step RT-PCR System (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, N.Y.) with a final volume of 50 \u03bcl. The RT-PCR mixture included a buffer containing 1 \u03bcg of total RNA, 1 \u03bcM of the sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers, 0.4 mM of each dNTP Superscript II RT\/Taq Mix, 80 units of RNOUT recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor (Gibco BRL), and an optimized concentration of MgSO, as per manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA was performed at 45\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes, and denatured at 94\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes. The PCR was performed with a cycle of annealing at 45\u00b0 C. for 1 minute, extension at 72\u00b0 C. for 1.5 minutes, and denaturing at 94\u00b0 C. for 1 minute, for a total of 35 cycles with a final 10-minute extension step. For amplification of the full insert, one \u03bcl of eLONGase was added to the reaction mixture at 68\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes of extension.","b) Gene Transfer of KThrough a Single Intracavernous Injection","1. Cloning of the Kir6.2 Channel (Genbank Accession No. 50582) into the pVAX1 Vector.","Total RNA was purified from corporal smooth muscle tissue by TRIzol reagent (Gibco) with glycogen as the carrier. The purified total RNA was subject to RT-PCR, according to the procedure described above. The primer set used for this RT-PCR was 5\u2032-ggctcaagcttctgaggctggtattaagaagtg-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:6) (forward) and 5\u2032-gcgcatctagatcctaaattgggttgggagg-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:7) (reverse). After RT-PCR, the cDNA fragment was TA cloned into pCRII, and then digested with Hind III and XbaI. The pVAX1 (Invitrogen), a 3.0-kb plasmid vector, was used as the expression vector. The pVAX1 was constructed by modifying the pcDNA3.1 vector to use kanamycin instead of ampicillin for selection, so as to avoid the potential pitfall of sensitivity to penicillin when injecting in humans. The unnecessary sequences for replication in , or for expression of the recombinant protein, were also removed. In addition, the pVAX1 was digested by Hind III and XbaI, then treated with alkaline phosphatase to reduce the background. The Kir6.2 cDNA was then ligated into the pVAX1. The Kir6.2 cDNA insert was oriented to follow the pCMV\u03b2 promoter. The cDNA insert was also sequenced to confirm the DNA sequences. The pVAX1\/Kir6.2 construct was subsequently amplified and purified with the Giga prep (Qiagen), as before (Day, et al., 11:A328, 1997).","2. In Vivo Methods","For these experiments, retired breeder Sprague-Dawley rats (all 500 g) were transfected with Kir6.2\/pcDNA naked DNA through a single intracavernous injection of 100 \u03bcg of Kir6.2\/pcDNA in 200 \u03bcl of PBS, using procedures similar to those described above.","II. Bladder Dysfunction Gene Therapy Experiments","a) Injection of LacZ DNA","LacZ DNA was prepared as described above. Briefly, transfer of LacZ DNA (coding for \u03b2-galactosidase) into rat bladder smooth muscle was accomplished by injecting the plasmid pCMV\u03b2, as naked DNA, into the bladder. An abdominal incision was made in the pentobarbital-anesthetized rat (sodium pentobarbital, 35 mg\/kg), and the bladder was exposed. Sixty-five \u03bcg of LacZ DNA, in 1 ml of buffer solution, were injected into the bladder using an insulin syringe. The needle opening was cauterized, the abdominal musculature was closed with sutures, and the skin was closed with surgical staples. Four days after injection, the animal was sacrificed by lethal injection. The bladder was quickly excised, placed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution (for 4 hours), then transferred to the chromogenic solution (as described above). The bladder was then immediately placed in an incubator at 37\u00b0 C. Fourteen hours later, the bladder tissue was removed from the incubator and photographed.","b) Gene Transfer of Maxi-K Using a Recombinant Vector","In the following experiments, 100 mg of hSlo\/pcDNA was administered to female Sprague-Dawley rats in an effort to investigate the ability of maxi-K to ameliorate the bladder hyperactivity associated with 6 weeks of partial urethral obstruction (PUO) in the rats.","1. The Rat Model of Bladder Instability\/Incontinence","Bladder instability in the rat is reliably produced by narrowing the diameter of the urethra in the female rat, thereby creating an outflow obstruction. It has been documented that 6 weeks of such an obstruction will produce the optimal level of bladder instability, i.e., increased detrusor contractility in the absence of bladder decompensation and other systemic signs of morbidity and mortality (Malmgren, et al., 137:1291\u201394, 1987).","2. Surgical Procedures to Produce Partial Urethral Obstruction and Bladder Outflow Obstruction","Female rats (Sprague-Dawley, 200\u2013250 g) were utilized in these bladder experiments. The method used for producing the requisite urethral restriction was identical to that previously described (Malmgren, et al., 137:1291\u201394, 1987). Briefly, anesthesia was induced by the intraperitoneal injection (35 mg\/kg) of sodium pentobarbital (Anpro Pharmaceuticals). Anesthesia was maintained during the course of the experimental protocol (<1 hr) as necessary, as judged by the presence of the toe-pinch reflex or the occurrence of appropriate alterations in respiratory rate. Following the course of the experimental protocol, anesthesia was maintained by subsequent injection of pentobarbital (5\u201310 mg\/kg) every 45\u201360 minutes, as required.","Method of partial urethral obstruction. After anesthetic induction through intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (35 mg\/kg), the ventral abdominal wall and perineum of the rat were shaved with an electric shaver and cleaned with betadine. A lower midline abdominal incision was made, and the bladder and the proximal urethra were identified. A plastic rod with a 1-mm outer diameter was placed below the urethra, and a silk ligature was tied\/placed around the urethra. After the ligature was secured, the externally-dwelling plastic rod was removed, and the animals were allowed to recover through the usage of systemic analgesic buprenorphine (0.0.2 mg\/kg) and a warm lamp.","Method of catheterization. A second surgical procedure was performed on rats 6 weeks after the first surgery. The method utilized was again identical to that previously described (Malmgren, et al., 142:1134\u201338, 1989). The animal was anesthetized, as described for all other surgical procedures. The ventral abdominal wall and perineum were shaved with an electric shaver, and cleaned with betadine. A lower midline incision was made through the perineum, and the bladder and the proximal urethra were identified. A small incision was made in the bladder wall, and a PE catheter with a cuff was inserted into the bladder, with a top suture around the catheter. The bladder incision was closed with the suture. This chronic indwelling catheter was then tunneled in the subcutaneous space, and exited through an orifice made in the back of the animal. In order to prevent infections, the rats received subcutaneous injections of sulfadoxin (24 mg\/kg) and trimethoprim (4.8 mg\/kg), as previously described (Malmgren, et al., 142:1134\u201338, 1989). The abdominal incision was then sutured closed, and the free end of the catheter was sealed. Cystometrical analyses were performed two days after the surgery, as this has been shown to be an optimal period for recovery and investigation. At the conclusion of the experiment, all series-1 animals were sacrificed via deep intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital.","3. In Vivo Cystometric Analyses","Cystometric evaluation of bladder function was performed according to a previously-published procedure (Malmgren et al., 1989). Briefly, the bladder catheter was connected to a two-way valve that was, in turn, connected to a pressure transducer as well as an infusion pump. The pressure transducer was then connected via a transducer amplifier (ETH 400 CB Sciences, Inc.) to a data acquisition board (MacLab\/8e, ADI instruments, MA). Real-time display and recording of pressure measurements was performed on a Macintosh computer (MacLab software v3.4, ADI instruments, MA). The pressure transducers and data acquisition board were calibrated in cm of HO, prior to each experiment.","Essentially, the cystometry evaluated the micturition reflex in control and hypertrophic animals, and in gene-therapy animals, at various time points, post-urethral-restriction. The rate of infusion was set on a programmable Harvard Infusion pump (model PHD 2000), and was based on previously-published work. This was found to be sufficient for the inventors' purposes. In order to obtain an approximately-equal number of micturitions in the control and hypertrophic groups (both treated and untreated with gene therapy) during the cystometry period, the rate of infusion was 10 and 20 ml\/hr, respectively. The saline infusion was started, and, following the first micturition, three additional reproducible micturition cycles, each corresponding to a 20-minute period, were recorded on each animal prior to sacrifice. All experiments were performed in a metabolic cage, to allow determination of the micturition volume.","At the conclusion of the experiment, all animals were sacrificed using deep intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital. Bladder function was then evaluated according to the following urodynamic criteria:\n\n","Evidence that alterations in potassium-channel function can increase \u201csensitivity\u201d to relaxation. Recent studies by the inventors have indicated that hyperpolarization of corporal smooth muscle cells via activation of K channels represents an important mechanism for controlling corporal smooth muscle tone (Holmquist, et al., 144:146, 1990; Christ, et al., 14(5):319\u201328, 1993; Fan, et al., 153:818, 1995; and Christ, G. J., 22(4):727\u201345, 1995). This observation reflects the fact that sustained contraction of human corporal smooth muscle, which is characteristic of flaccidity (the condition which is prevalent in the vast majority of cases), is largely dependent on continuous transmembrane Ca flux through voltage-gated Ca channels.","The activity of the voltage-dependent Ca channels in corporal smooth muscle cells is, in turn, closely modulated by hyperpolarizing currents, initiated and carried mainly by prostaglandin E(PGE). Among the subtypes of K channels, the \u2248180 pS Ca-sensitive (maxi-K) channel is one of the most prominent in corporal smooth muscle cells (Fan, et al., 153:818, 1995). Membrane hyperpolarization of corporal smooth muscle cells, following activation of K channels, can be accomplished by both receptor-mediated (e.g., PGE or NO) and nonreceptor-mediated (e.g., NO or cGMP) stimuli, derived from neuronal as well as endothelial sources. These data are summarized in Table 4.","The putative mechanism of action is described as follows: release of an endogenous corporal vasorelaxant(s) (e.g., NO) is thought to either directly activate the K channel, or regulate K-channel activity following a series of events involving activation of soluble guanylate cyclase, an increase in intracellular cGMP levels, activation of protein kinase G, and phosphorylation of cellular proteins, including nonfunctional ion channels such as K+ and Ca channels. Increased kinase activity (either A or G) has opposite effects on Ca and K channels, causing decreased activity in the former and increased activity in the latter. Thus, an elevation in intracellular NO and\/or cGMP levels can result in both activation of K channels and inhibition of Ca channels. The algebraic sum of these two opposing effects significantly diminishes transmembrane Ca flux, resulting in diminished corporal smooth muscle tone, and, therefore, corporal smooth-muscle relaxation.","Since the activity of the maxi-K channel appears to be modulated by all of the physiologically-relevant endogenous regulators of corporal smooth muscle tone (), including PGE (Zhao, et al., 154:1571\u201379, 1995; Zhang, et al., 155:678A, 1996; and Zhao, et al., 155:678A, 1996) and NO, the maxi-K channel is clearly an important final common mediator of the degree of corporal smooth muscle tone. The inventors have preliminary evidence, consistent with this hypothesis, suggesting that altered regulation\/function of this channel may represent an important feature of organic erectile dysfunction per se in human corporal smooth muscle (Fan, et al., 153:818, 1995; Christ, G. J., 22(4):727\u201345, 1995; and Christ, et al., 155:620A, 1996). For all of these reasons, the inventors feel that the relatively-stable transfection of corporal smooth muscle cells with the human smooth muscle maxi-K channel cDNA represents an important and attractive strategy for modulating erectile capacity.","Evidence that increases in the amount of nitric oxide can increase the \u201cdriving force\u201d for relaxation of corporal smooth muscle. An abundance of recent experimental evidence documents the important role played by NO in arterial and corporal smooth-muscle relaxation and, consequently, in penile erection (Burnett, et al., 257(5068):401\u2013403, 1992; Trigo-Rocha, et al., 264(2):H419\u201322, 1993; Argiolas, et al., 33(11):1339\u201344, 1994; and Burnett, et al., 52(3):485\u201389, 1995). For example, electrical stimulation of both human (Saenz de Tejada, et al., 320(16):1025\u201330, 1989) and rabbit (Ignarro, et al., 170:843\u201350, 1990) corporal cavernosal muscle strips results in smooth-muscle relaxation. These responses are thought to be mediated by release of NO. Consistent with this supposition, these relaxation responses can be inhibited by nitroglycerine-substituted analogues of L-arginine, which block NO formation (Ignarro, et al., 170:843\u2013850, 1990; Holmquist, et al., 141:441\u201342, 1991; and Kim, et al., 88:112\u201318, 1991). Furthermore, the relaxation of both human and rabbit corporal smooth muscle can be induced through compounds that release NO (Ignarro, et al., 170:843\u201350, 1990; Rajfer, et al., 326:90\u201394, 1992; and Christ, et al., 22(4):727\u201345, 1995). The importance of the NO-dependent pathway for relaxation of human corporal smooth muscle has also been documented (Bush, et al., 147:1650\u201355, 1992; Trigo-Rocha, et al., & 13(1):71\u201380, 1994; and Christ, et al., 73:714\u201326, 1995).","Nitric oxide is produced by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS), as a product of the enzymatic conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline. Nitric oxide is produced in endothelial cells, upon cholinergic stimulation or by neuronal sources (e.g., released from NANC nerve terminals). With respect to the latter, NO is a novel neurotransmitter in that it is not stored in synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals, but is synthesized on demand. Biochemical and histochemical evidence in rabbit and rat penis suggests that the NOS isozyme which functions in penile erection belongs to the cNOS type (Burnett, et al., 257(5068):401\u2013403, 1992). A neural source for NOS in the rat penis was demonstrated by J. R. Keast (143:69\u201373, 1992), where NOS was localized to the autonomic nerves of rat and human penis by immunohistochemistry with rat cNOS antibody, and by NADPH diaphorase histochemistry (Burnett, et al., 257(5068):401\u2013403, 1992; and Burnett, et al., 150(1):73\u201376, 1993). The mechanism of action of NO is thought to be as follows: after production, NO (a highly lipophilic substance) quickly diffuses in three dimensions. (Christ, et al., 67:1335\u201344, 1994) into corporal smooth muscle cells, where it results in activation of soluble guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of GTP to cGMP. The increase in cGMP activates protein kinase G (PKG), which, as illustrated in , leads to decreases in intracellular Ca, producing corporal smooth-muscle relaxation (Moncada, S., 145:201\u201327, 1992). As mentioned above, there is also recent evidence that, in at least some vascular smooth muscle cells, NO may directly interact with K channels to elicit hyperpolarization and smooth-muscle relaxation.","In the flaccid state, NOS activity is thought to be minimal (Ignarro, et al., 170:843\u201350, 1990; Rajfer, et al., 326:90\u201394, 1992; Azadozi, et al., 147(1):220\u201325, 1992; Brock, et al., 42(3):412\u201317, 1993; Hellstrom, et al., 151(6):1723\u201327, 1994; Pickard, et al., 75(4):516\u201322, 1995; Carrier, et al., 153(5):1722\u201327, 1995; Garban, et al., 467\u2013H475, 1995; and Burnett, et al., 52(3):485\u201389, 1995). The intensity of the histochemical detection of NADPH diaphorase in cavernosal tissue has been shown to decrease in patients with cavernosal nerve injury, implying decreased NOS activity (Brock, et al., 42(3):412\u201317, 1993). Furthermore, it has been suggested that the impaired relaxation responses to electric field stimulation, elicited by the cavernosal nerves of diabetic men, may also be due to decreased NOS production (Saenz de Tejada, I., 320(16):1025\u201330, 1989; Taub, et al., 42:698, 1993; Christ, G. J., Urologic Clinics of North America, 22(4):727\u201345, 1995; and Vernet, et al., 136:5709\u201317, 1995). Thus, the introduction of a constitutively-expressed cDNA for NOS might be expected to result in corporal smooth-muscle relaxation and greater resting and nerve-stimulated pressure responses. As described below, the cDNA for neuronal NOS has been inserted into the corpora cavernosa of rats, and a statistically-significant and physiologically-relevant alteration was observed in the intracorporal pressure response to electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve (see Table 2 below).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0143","num":"0150"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"441pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Intracorporal pressure (ICP) response"},{"entry":"following nerve stimulation in NOS group and control group"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"392pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"Cavernous Nerve Stimulation*"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"ICP","ICP","ICP","ICP","ICP","ICP","ICP"]},{"entry":[{},"BCP ","0.5 mA","1 mA","2 mA","4 mA","6 mA","8 mA","10 mA"]},{"entry":[{},"(Basal)","M \u00b1 SEM ","M \u00b1 SEM","M \u00b1 SEM","M \u00b1 SEM","M \u00b1 SEM","M \u00b1 SEM","M \u00b1 SEM"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["NOS gene","14.62 \u00b1 .64","60.02 \u00b1 5.9\u2002","102.50 \u00b1 3.89","110.49 \u00b1 4.65","113.93 \u00b1 2.17","117.72 \u00b1 2.80","121.26 \u00b1 3.26","129.03 \u00b1 5.4"]},{"entry":"therapy"},{"entry":"(n = 12)"},{"entry":["Age-Matched","\u20038.1 \u00b1 .37","45.81 \u00b1 3.63","75.242 \u00b1 3.59","\u200283.93 \u00b1 3.23","\u200283.59 \u00b1 4.52","\u200285.67 \u00b1 3.75","\u200287.94 \u00b1 4.45","\u200292.23 \u00b1 3.62"]},{"entry":"Control"},{"entry":"(received"},{"entry":"vehicle only)"},{"entry":"(n = 8)"},{"entry":["P value",".0001",".0085",".0001",".0001",".0001",".0001",".0001",".0003"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"*cavernous-nerve stimulation performed on both sides (observation = 2 \u00d7 the # of rats)"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"left","id":"FOO-00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00003","he":"2.12mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US07030096-20060418-P00003.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},"sub":"2"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"left","id":"FOO-00003"},"sup":"\u2666","sub":"2"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"left","id":"FOO-00004"},"sup":"\u2665"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"left","id":"FOO-00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00004","he":"2.46mm","wi":"3.56mm","file":"US07030096-20060418-P00004.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"Evidence that K channels modulate corporal smooth-muscle relaxation. Evidence from both cellular and isolated-tissue studies documents the important role of the maxi-K channel in mediating NTG- and PGE-induced relaxation responses in the human corpora.","NTG and maxi-K. In addition to the aforementioned effects on PE-induced contractile responses, selective blockade of the maxi-K channel with 1 mM tetraethylammonium (TEA) also results in significant attenuation of the NTG-induced relaxation response (100 nM), as illustrated by the representative example in . Studies on five other corporal tissue strips revealed that the mean\u00b1S.E.M. percent relaxation response elicited by 100 nM nitroglycerine (NTG) was 20.3%\u00b13.2%. This value can be compared with the expected value of 50.1%, as determined in another recent publication. This more recent finding documents that activation of the maxi-K channel is also likely to be an important component of the NTG-induced relaxation response. Consistent with this hypothesis, preliminary patch-clamp studies (i.e., attached patch recording mode) on cultured corporal smooth muscle cells, albeit with much greater NTG concentrations (100 \u03bcM), demonstrated an NTG-induced increase in maxi-K channel activity in cultured corporal smooth muscle.","PGEand maxi-K. Recent electrophysiological studies utilizing all four recording modes documented that prostaglandin E(PGE) causes a concentration-dependent increase in the activity of the maxi-K channel over the same concentration range as the inventors observed in cultured cells, and relaxation of precontracted isolated human corporal smooth muscle strips (Zhang, et al., 155:678A, 1996). In addition, this increase in maxi-K channel activity is correlated with significant alterations in the induced intracellular calcium transient seen in fura-2-loaded cultured corporal smooth muscle cells. Specifically, preincubation of cultured human corporal smooth muscle cells with 500 nM PGEresulted in a significant (\u224840%) decrease in the peak amplitude of the ET-1-induced (50 nM) calcium transient above baseline (i.e., \u224870 nM) from a control value of 161.5\u00b119.5 nM to 102.6\u00b19.5 nM (Zhao, et al., 155:678A, 1996). This decrease is indistinguishable from the decrease seen in the absence of extracellular Ca (in 2 mM EGTA), or when cells are preincubated with either nifedipine (Zhao and Christ, 154:1571\u201379, 1995) or verapamil, both of which are blockers of the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel.","Finally, it is shown (Table 3) that transfection of cultured human corporal smooth muscle cells with human smooth muscle maxi-K cDNA (hSlo) results in a significant decrease (\u224825%) in the mean resting intracellular calcium levels, as well as a decrease (\u224845%) in the peak amplitude of the ET-1-induced intracellular calcium transient. While the physiological significance of the former observation is uncertain, the effects of transfection on the ET-1-induced intracellular calcium transient (Table 5) are remarkably similar to those seen in the presence of PGE, nifedipine, and verapamil, and in the absence of extracellular calcium.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0148","num":"0155"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"315pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Summary of documented in vitro effects of the maxi-K channel"},{"entry":"on the physiology of corporal smooth muscle"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Resting","Resting",{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"corporal","intracellular"]},{"entry":["PE-induced","smooth","calcium","ET-1-induced","Relaxation","Channel"]},{"entry":["contraction","muscle tone","levels","calcium response","response","activity"]},{"entry":["increased","increased","decreased","decreased","decreased","increased"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["YES","YES","YES","YES","YES","YES"]},{"entry":["(1 mM TEA)","(10\u2013100","transfection","transfection with","(1 mM TEA)","100 \u03bcM NTG"]},{"entry":[{},"mM TEA)","with","hSlo cDNA or",{},"or 30 nM\u2013"]},{"entry":[{},{},"(hSlo cDNA)","preincubation",{},"30 \u03bcM PGE"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"with PGE(500 nM)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Calcium flux and maxi-K channels. Taken together, the preceding data are totally consistent with the hypothesis that increased maxi-K channel activity, either following an increase in the number of maxi-K channels (presumably resulting from the transfection, although this has not yet been unequivocally established), or following cellular activation with, for example, PGE, is associated with cellular hyperpolarization, decreased transmembrane Ca flux through L-type voltage-dependent Ca channels, and a corresponding decrease in the peak amplitude of the ET-1-induced calcium transient. Moreover, the peak amplitude of the intracellular calcium transient, as measured in cultured corporal smooth muscle cells, accurately tracks the magnitude of the steady-state contractile response measured on isolated corporal tissue strips (Christ, et al., 153:1998\u20132003, 1995). This provides compelling evidence that increased activity of the maxi-K channel modulates the magnitude of the corporal smooth muscle contractile response, at least in part, by altering transmembrane Ca flux. The maxi-K channel plays a dual role in modulating the magnitude of both contraction and relaxation. This dual role arises because maxi-K-induced inhibition of transmembrane Ca flux can occur following agonist (PE or ET-1)-induced increases in intracellular CA, or following PGE(presumably PKA)-induced or NTG (presumably PKG)-induced increases in phosphorylation of the maxi-K channel. Indeed, this is consistent with the literature in other vascular smooth muscle cell types (see Table 4).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0150","num":"0157"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

It appears that incorporation of naked DNA is sustained, over this time period, in this tissue. Similarly, prolonged incorporation of gene transfer products has been reported in other vascular tissues.","Injection of hSlo naked DNA into rat corpora in vivo. As a first test of the potential utility of modulating K channel activity to treat erectile dysfunction, preliminary studies were conducted on a rat model in vivo. Briefly, it was found that injection into the rat corpora of naked cDNA encoding the human smooth muscle maxi-K channel (hSlo, obtained from Dr. Salkoff, Washington University) resulted in significant uptake and gene expression. This was documented by the fact that the nerve-stimulated intracorporal-pressure increases observed on 9-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats injected with maxi-K cDNA were significantly greater than the ICP responses seen in age-matched control, sham-operated animals (see  and Table 6). Moreover, the incorporation of hSlo (again, as judged by the significant elevation of ICP relative to control animals) remained stable for more than 3 months. These in vivo studies are entirely consistent with all of the in vitro observations made by the inventors, and, thus, further document the importance of K channels in modulating corporal smooth muscle tone. Moreover, while it is recognized that there may be other subunits of the human smooth muscle maxi-K channel in human corporal tissue, these studies represent a reasonable starting point for evaluating the role of the maxi-K channel in erectile physiology.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0155","num":"0162"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"357pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 6"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Mean intracorporal pressure (ICP) and"},{"entry":"blood pressure (BP) measurements made during cavernous nerve stimulation"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"Maxi-K-injected (N = 17)","Age-Matched Control (N = 12)","Young Control (N = 5)"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Neurostim-","ICP","BP","ICP",{},"ICP","BP"]},{"entry":["ulation (mA)","(cm HO)","(cm HO)","(cm HO)","BP (cm HO)","(cm HO)","(cm HO)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["0.5","111 \u00b1 7","198 \u00b1 6","\u200243 \u00b1 11","\u2002178 \u00b1 12","102 \u00b1 16","183 \u00b1 16"]},{"entry":[{},"(n = 6)\u2002",{},"(n = 5)",{},"(n = 5)"]},{"entry":["1.0","107 \u00b1 7","192 \u00b1 5","55 \u00b1 5","178 \u00b1 6","132 \u00b1 10","180 \u00b1 10"]},{"entry":[{},"(n = 16)",{},"\u2002(n = 12)",{},"(n = 5)"]},{"entry":["2.0","\u2002114 \u00b1 11","198 \u00b1 5","63 \u00b1 5","177 \u00b1 7","133 \u00b1 10","180 \u00b1 10"]},{"entry":[{},"(n = 16)",{},"\u2002(n = 12)",{},"(n = 5)"]},{"entry":["4.0","121 \u00b1 7","196 \u00b1 5","57 \u00b1 5","177 \u00b1 7","133 \u00b1 10","186 \u00b1 10"]},{"entry":[{},"(n = 15)",{},"\u2002(n = 12)",{},"(n = 5)"]},{"entry":["6.0","124 \u00b1 5","190 \u00b1 6","53 \u00b1 6","180 \u00b1 9","131 \u00b1 13","181 \u00b1 10"]},{"entry":[{},"(n = 11)",{},"(n = 9)",{},"(n = 3)"]},{"entry":["8.0","129 \u00b1 5","191 \u00b1 5","59 \u00b1 7","181 \u00b1 9","133 \u00b1 11","184 \u00b1 11"]},{"entry":[{},"(n = 8)\u2002",{},"(n = 9)",{},"(n = 4)"]},{"entry":["10.0","142 \u00b1 6","195 \u00b1 5","\u200256 \u00b1 13","191 \u00b1 7","132 \u00b1 11","180 \u00b1 11"]},{"entry":[{},"(n = 7)\u2002",{},"(n = 4)",{},"(n = 4)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Resting and neurostimulation-induced ICP responses in maxi-K-transfected and sham-operated control rats. A One-Way (ANOVA) analysis of variance revealed that there was a significant difference in the resting ICPs of rats transfected with the pcDNA\/hSlo DNA; however, there was no detectable difference in the mean resting ICP or mean arterial pressure values among the three treatment groups (p>0.07). The mean\u00b1S.E.M. values for ICP and BP, respectively, for the pcDNA\/hSlo-transfected rats (N=17) were 22.7\u00b11.9 and 177.4\u00b14.3 cmHO. These values were 14.9\u00b13.3 and 177\u00b14.5 cmHO, respectively, for the age-matched control animals (N=12), and 19.8\u00b13.3 and 168.6\u00b17.4 cmHO, respectively, for the young control animals (N=5).","The effects on the ICP response in rats in vivo of current stimulation of the cavernous nerve were utilized to evaluate the potential physiological relevance of over-expression of the maxi-K channel following intracavernous injection of the pcDNA\/hSlo DNA (see Materials and Methods). For these studies, the rats were divided into distinct treatment groups. All animals were examined using identical neurostimulation protocols, with the magnitude of current stimulation ranging from 0.5 mA to 10.0 mA. Representative responses to 2 mA-current stimulation in pcDNA\/hSlo-transfected animals, age-matched control animals, and young control animals are illustrated in .","For statistical comparison of treatment effects, the mean amplitude of the ICP response at each level of current stimulation was expressed as a fraction of the mean arterial blood pressure (ICP\/BP) during current stimulation. A Two-Way (ANOVA) analysis of variance revealed that there was a significant effect of treatment (p<0.001) on the mean ICP\/BP, but no effect of current stimulation (p>0.13), and no treatment-current stimulation interaction (p=0.26). The mean response for all animals in each treatment group is graphically represented in , and the data are summarized in Table 6. Although post-hoc analysis documented a significant difference in the mean amplitude of the ICP response to all levels of current stimulation between the young control group and the maxi-K-transfected group (p<0.05), both groups had ICP responses that were significantly elevated over those of the age-matched control animals (p<0.05).","In addition, the pcDNA\/hSlo-transfected animals were further subdivided based on whether the in vivo studies were conducted 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, or 4 months post-transfection, with age-matched control animals run in parallel. Consistent with the overall trend for the entire animal population (see ), Two-Way analysis of variance revealed that intracorporal injection of the pcDNA\/hSlo DNA was associated with significantly-elevated intracorporal pressures at all levels of current stimulation for both the 1-month () and 2-month () post-injection time points. Statistically-meaningful conclusions could not be drawn from the small number of observations at the 3-month and 4-month post-injection time points. However,  does suggest that qualitatively-similar results were obtained.","Incorporation of recombinant human K(hSlo) into rat corporal smooth muscle. The gene expression level of recombinant human K(hSlo) in transfected rat corporal smooth muscle was examined by both RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses. Total RNA from pcDNA\/K-transfected tissue and pcDNA-transfected control tissue was RT-PCR-amplified with primers, as described in the Materials and Methods section, and as displayed in . Amplification of the 5\u2032 untranslated region () resulted in a significant cDNA band from the pcDNA\/K-transfected tissue (molecular size is approximately 4.2 kb), but not from the pcDNA-transfected control (). The quality of the RNA from all tissues was further examined with primers that amplified the endogenous K. As indicated, the endogenous Kwas amplified to a comparable level in all tissues (). The presence of the recombinant human Kexpression was further examined by Northern blotting with an hSlo insert as a probe (). Once again, RNA from the pcDNA\/K-transfected tissue, but not from the pcDNA-transfected or control tissue, expressed a detectable level of recombinant human K. The recombinant human Kband was detected between the 18s and 28s RNA bands, with an approximate molecular size of 4.2 kb. In view of the high stringency conditions used in this assay (see Materials and Methods), it is not surprising that the endogenous Kwas not detected.","b) Gene Transfer of KThrough a Single Intracavernous Injection","For these studies, retired breeders were injected with 100 \u03bcg of Kir6.2\/pVAX1 (n=5) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution (age-matched control animals; n=6). Five days later, the nerve-stimulated intracorporal pressure (ICP) response was examined in all animals. As illustrated in , the animals that received the Kir6.2\/pVAX1 injection had significantly greater cavernous-nerve-stimulated ICP responses than did age-matched control animals. These observations are remarkably similar to those made in relation to the experiments involving injection of a similar quantity of hSlo\/pcDNA, and provide compelling evidence that Kir6.2 gene therapy may also be an attractive therapeutic option for the treatment of human erectile dysfunction.","Surprisingly, in contrast to the observations made in connection with hSlo, the Kir6.2 subunit is not known to form a functional channel by itself. In fact, while hSlo has been shown to form a functional channel in the absence of the \u03b2-subunit, the inventors are not aware of any demonstration that the Kir6.2 subunit (the pore-forming region of the Kchannel) forms a functional channel in the absence of a corresponding SUR subunit. Presumably, the overexpressed recombinant Kir6.2 subunit, in vivo, combines with endogenous SUR(s) to form a functional channel.","II. Bladder Dysfunction Gene Therapy Experiments","For these experiments, 22 female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to partial urethral obstruction (PUO) for 6 weeks. Ten of these rats also received a single intravesical injection of naked pcDNA\/hSlo cDNA (100 \u03bcg in 200 \u03bcl final volume) during ligature removal. Another 17 sham-operated rats were run in parallel. After 6 weeks, the urethral ligature was removed, and a catheter was inserted in the dome of the bladder, tunneled through the subcutaneous space, and exited between the shoulder blades. Two days later, rats were infused with saline for measurement of the micturition reflex (10 ml\/hr-control; 20 ml\/hr \u2014PUO). In particular, the following parameters were measured: bladder capacity (BC), micturition volume (MV), residual volume (RV), threshold pressure (TP), micturition pressure (MP), and basal pressure (BP).","According to the results of these experiments, 6 weeks of PUO were associated with the presence of bladder hyperactivity (contractions between micturitions), as well as significant increases in all parameters measured, except for BP. Importantly, as illustrated in Table 7 and , the maxi-K-treated animals, relative to the untreated PUO rats, exhibited a nearly-complete ablation of hyperactivity in the absence of any detectable effect on other parameters of bladder function. Thus, this study documents the important role of K-mediated hyperpolarizing currents in modulating bladder myocyte function, and indicates that gene therapy may be an effective therapeutic modality for the treatment of urinary incontinence (i.e., bladder hyperactivity).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0165","num":"0172"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00007","num":"00007"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"441pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 7"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Micturition reflex parameters in age-matched control and six-week-obstructed rats."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"WT",{},{},{},{},{},{},"IP"]},{"entry":[{},"(mg)","MP","THP","BP","BC","MV","RV","(MIP-BP)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Control:","\u2003\u2009171 \u00b1 15.0","\u200373.9 \u00b1 4.99","22.3 \u00b1 2.1","\u200212.6 \u00b1 1.09","\u20021.2 \u00b1 0.1","\u20021.13 \u00b1 0.10","1.13 \u00b1 0.04","3.49 \u00b1 0.79"]},{"entry":"unobstructed"},{"entry":"(n = 17)"},{"entry":[{"sup":"a"},"*547.6 \u00b1 55.4","*128.9 \u00b1 16.1","*36.3 \u00b1 4.30","*22.1 \u00b1 43.9","*3.44 \u00b1 0.41","*3.22 \u00b1 0.39","*,**0.33 \u00b1 0.10\u2003\u2002\u2009","**5.59 \u00b1 1.05\u2003"]},{"entry":"hSlo-injected"},{"entry":"(n = 12)"},{"entry":["Obstructed:","*473.1 \u00b1 56.6","*132.7 \u00b1 17.9","*39.3 \u00b1 3.6\u2002","*18.8 \u00b1 1.9\u2002","*2.91 \u00b1 0.62","*2.94 \u00b1 0.65","0.09 \u00b1 0.05","9.37 \u00b1 1.79"]},{"entry":"untreated"},{"entry":"(n = 10)"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"left","id":"FOO-00010"},"sup":"a"}},{"entry":"Control: sham-operated, unobstructed, age-matched control animals; WT: bladder weight (mg); MP: micturition pressure; THP: threshold pressure; BP: basal pressure; BC: bladder capacity; MV: micturition volume; RV: residual volume; IP: intermicturition pressure (the mean pressure over the entire intermicturition interval minus the basal pressure on the same animal)"},{"entry":"*significantly different from sham-operated; p < 0.05"},{"entry":"**significantly different from control (obstructed but not treated); p < 0.05, One-Way ANOVA, with Newmand Keuls post-hoc pairwise comparisions"}]}}]}}},"Many recent advances have been made in the application of gene therapy to the treatment of human diseases. In particular, techniques for gene transfer into vascular smooth muscle cells have been developed in an effort to provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of several cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, vasculitis, and restenosis after balloon angioplasty. Such studies have provided important information on the efficiency and persistence of gene-transfer methods in smooth muscle cells.","In light of these seminal observations, the initial and explicit aim of these studies was to begin to evaluate the feasibility of somatic gene transfer into corporal smooth muscle as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. The rationale for this approach was related to the fact that the tone of corporal smooth muscle in the specialized vascular tissue of the penis plays a critical role in modulating the flow of blood to and from the penis, thereby determining erectile capacity. In view of this role, corporal smooth muscle cells are a logical target for molecular intervention in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Given the central role of the maxi-K channel in modulating human corporal smooth muscle tone, the inventors examined the physiological impact of transfection of penile and bladder smooth muscle with hSlo cDNA in a rat model in vivo. The effects of Kon penile smooth muscle were also examined. The major findings are summarized as follows.","Firstly, after a single intracorporal injection of naked pCMV\u03b2\/LacZ DNA (see Materials and Methods), expression of \u03b2-galactosidase activity was sustained for at least 75 days. This clearly demonstrated that, in the rat corpora in vivo, it is feasible to achieve relatively prolonged expression of extrachromosomal genes that encode physiologically-detectable protein products (see ). Consistent with these observations, the mean amplitude of the nerve-stimulated ICP response was significantly augmented over a similar time course in rats in vivo, following a single intracavernous injection of naked pcDNA\/hSlo DNA (see ). Moreover, both RT-PCR techniques and Northern blots revealed that, at least for the two-month time point, the observed augmentation in the nerve-stimulated ICP response was correlated with increased expression of the hSlo mRNA (). Presumably, the same holds true for the longer time points (i.e., 3\u20134 months), although this was not directly evaluated in this series of experiments. There was no detectable effect of either vector alone or sham surgery (see Materials and Methods) on the nerve-stimulated ICP responses at any time point examined in these initial studies (see ). Taken together, these data provide compelling evidence that the enhancement in the nerve-stimulated ICP responses observed in the maxi-K-transfected animals, relative to the age-matched control animals, is most certainly related to the extrachromosomal expression of the hSlo cDNA, and a nominally-corresponding increase in expression of the maxi-K channel protein.","In order to better judge the physiological meaning of the increase in ICP in the maxi-K-transfected animals, a second group of young control (2- or 3-month-old) animals was also studied. As illustrated in , the increase in the mean amplitude of the nerve-stimulated ICP\/BP ratio in the 10\u201313-month-old, maxi-K-transfected animals approximated, but did not exceed, the response observed in the adolescent rats. This would suggest that the putative increased expression of the maxi-K channel in the \u201colder\u201d animals was associated with a nerve-stimulated ICP response that was nominally equivalent to the best response expected under \u201cnormal\u201d physiological conditions in younger animals.","With respect to the mechanistic basis for the inventors' observations, it is clear that the injected hSlo cDNA was likely taken up into all cell types present in the rat corpora. In this regard, it cannot be unequivocally stated that the uptake of hSlo cDNA in the endothelial cells plays a role in mediating the observed increases in nerve-stimulated ICP. Nevertheless, the present discussion is confined to putative effects resulting from uptake and expression in corporal smooth muscle cells. This seems reasonable in view of the fact that corporal smooth muscle cells make up the vast majority of the corporal parenchyma; moreover, in the penis, relaxation of the corporal smooth muscle is both necessary and sufficient for erection. A more precise analysis of the cellular disposition of the hSlo cDNA, the resulting expression of the \u03b1-subunit of the maxi-K channel, and the relative percentage of cells thus affected, will necessarily be the province of future investigations.","While a cause-effect relationship was not established in the present investigation, it can be presumed that the mechanistic basis for the increased maxi-K channel activity would be related to the commensurate augmentation in the hyperpolarizing ability of the corporal smooth muscle cells. Moreover, given the exquisite dependence of sustained corporal smooth-muscle contraction on continuous transmembrane Ca flux, it is reasonable to suggest that the increase in hyperpolarization is associated with a decreased transmembrane Ca flux through L-type voltage-dependent Ca channels, with a corresponding decrease in the free intracellular Ca concentration, so as to ultimately promote greater corporal smooth-muscle relaxation. Accordingly, an increase in the expression of the maxi-K channel would logically suggest a resultant increase in the sensitivity of the smooth muscle cells, up to the same level of neural stimulation.","As with all other in vivo gene-therapy approaches, the potential utility of the present genetic technique in treating human erectile dysfunction and bladder dysfunction depends on two considerations: (1) the likelihood of affecting only the desired cell type(s); and (2) the percentage of target cells which must be affected in order to see a physiologically-relevant therapeutic effect. In light of such considerations, there are two main reasons for suspecting that gene therapy for erectile or bladder dysfunction may be inherently more successful than its proposed uses in other, more systemic, cardiovascular disorders, such as atherosclerosis, vasculitis, and restenosis after balloon angioplasty.","Firstly, it is a well-documented fact that corporal smooth muscle cells, as well as bladder smooth muscle cells, are interconnected by a ubiquitously-distributed population of intercellular channels known as gap-junction proteins, with connexin 43 as the predominant isoform expressed in the human penis and bladder. These intercellular channels provide partial cytoplasmic continuity between adjacent smooth muscle cells, allowing the intercellular exchange of physiologically-relevant ions (K and Ca) and second-messenger molecules (IP, cAMP, and cGMP). As such, the presence of gap junctions in the rat and human provides an important anatomic substrate for coordinating the syncytial contraction and relaxation responses that are a prerequisite to normal penile erection and detumescence, and normal bladder function. In particular, intercellular communication among the smooth muscle cells permits cells that are not directly activated by a relevant neuronal\/hormonal signal to be rapidly, albeit indirectly, recruited into the contraction or relaxation response.","To summarize, gap junctions are implicated in the gene therapy of erectile and bladder dysfunction because their presence ensures that only a fraction of the smooth muscle cells need to be genetically modified in order to effect rather global changes in smooth muscle tone. This is crucially important because it minimizes the need to use more aggressive gene-incorporation strategies (e.g., adenoviral or retroviral incorporation) which have a concomitantly greater number of side effects and concerns (e.g., insertional mutagenesis or immunological reactions).","Secondly, the method of gene therapy proposed herein is designed to take advantage of the fact that relatively subtle alterations in the balance between contracting and relaxing stimuli can result in profound alterations in erectile or bladder physiology and function. The goal of gene therapy is, therefore, to restore a more normal balance between contracting and relaxing stimuli following expression of (an) exogenous gene(s) that code(s) for physiologically-relevant proteins in smooth muscle (e.g., the maxi-K channel or K). In light of the multifactorial nature of erectile and bladder dysfunctions in humans, there may, in fact, be many distinct genetic therapy strategies that will be effective in the restoration of erectile potency. For example, it is worth noting that qualitatively similar effects on ICP were observed following the intracavemous injection of an inducible form of NOS in the rat model. Thus, if expression of these or other extrachromosomal genes can be maintained in humans for a period of weeks to months (as the preliminary data herein indicates), it is conceivable that a patient could obtain \u201cnormal\u201d erections, or \u201cnormal\u201d bladder function, in the absence of any other exogenous manipulation, during this time period. Clearly, this would be a major advance over all other currently-available therapies.","Taken together, the foregoing data are consistent with the supposition that increased maxi-K channel activity, following a single intracorporal injection of naked hSlo DNA, results from the presence of a greater number of maxi-K channels in some fraction of corporal smooth muscle cells. In turn, this results in a greater hyperpolarization for any given level of neural stimulus, presumably altering intracellular calcium mobilization\/homeostasis, and thereby promoting greater corporal smooth-muscle relaxation. In conclusion, it seems reasonable to assume that the relatively-stable transfection of smooth muscle cells with the human smooth muscle maxi-K channel cDNA represents an important and physiologically-relevant strategy for the novel molecular manipulation of smooth muscle tone in the treatment of organic erectile dysfunction and bladder dysfunction."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"i":"American Journal of Physiology, ","sub":"1\/2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"sub":["3","1","1","2"],"sup":"2+"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"sup":["2+","+","2+","2+"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIGS. 10A","FIGS. 10A\u201310C","FIG. 10A","FIG. 10B","FIG. 10C","FIG. 10A"],"b":["10","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIGS. 11A","FIGS. 11A\u201311C","FIG. 11A","FIG. 11A","FIG. 11C","FIG. 11C","FIG. 11B","FIGS. 11A and 11C","FIG. 11B","FIG. 11A"],"b":["11","11"],"sub":["Ca ","Ca ","Ca","Ca","Ca","Ca","Ca ","Ca"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 12"],"sub":["Ca ","Ca","Ca ","Ca ","Ca ","Ca "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIGS. 14A and 14B","FIGS. 14A and 14B","FIG. 14A","FIG. 14B","FIG. 14A"],"sub":["j","j","j ","j","j","j ","j","j "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 15"],"sub":["j","j ","j ","j ","j ","j ","j "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIGS. 16A","FIGS. 16A\u201316C","FIG. 16A","FIG. 16B","FIG. 16C"],"b":["16","16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIGS. 17A and 17B","FIG. 17A","FIGS. 16A\u201316C","FIG. 17B"],"sub":"j "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIGS. 18A","FIG. 18A","FIGS. 16A\u201316C","FIG. 18B","FIG. 18A","FIG. 18C","FIG. 18A"],"b":["18","18"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 19"],"sup":"+"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 20"],"sub":"ATP "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIGS. 21A and 21B","FIGS. 21A and 21B","FIG. 21A","FIG. 21B"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
