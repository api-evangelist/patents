title: Explosive water jet with precursor bubble
abstract: A water jet assembly and method of use is provided comprising a tank with cutting fluid, fuel and oxidizer lines, and a tank discharge lines. In operation, the tank is filled with oxidizer; the oxidizer line is closed and cutting fluid is supplied compressing the oxidizer. When the fluid reaches a level, the fluid line is closed and fuel is injected. A spark generator ignites the fuel/oxidizer mixture thereby raising the tank pressure. As the pressure rises, a low pressure valve simultaneously closes at a prescribed level. The vent line and a discharge to a nozzle are opened thereby, forming a gas bubble. When the bubble reaches a desired size and pressure drops below a level, the vent closes, allowing combustion expansion to force fluid through the nozzle to form a cutting jet.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/963,201 filed on Jul. 20, 2007 and entitled \u201cExplosive Water Jet with Precursor Bubble\u201d by the inventor, Thomas J. Gieseke.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","None.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an assembly and a method of use for producing a high velocity water jet in a deep-water environment where depth pressure would typically inhibit the formation of a supercavitation bubble.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","High velocity jets are commonly used in industrial systems for cutting operations. For example: pressures of 380 Mpa (50,000 pounds per square inch), generated with specialized hydraulic pumps, are used to produce small diameter fluid jets with velocities approaching 800 meters per second. These systems are designed for precision and continuous cutting. As such, diameters of the fluid jets are typically very small (no greater than one millimeter).","Jet pulses of this size can only penetrate a short distance (typically one meter) in the water. Power consumption for significantly larger jets becomes prohibitive if sustained operation is required.","The water jet system described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,868,790 (Gieseke et al.) is designed to overcome the jet formation inhibiting effects of water as a surrounding medium. The system and method of use of the cited reference utilizes a supercavity formed by an impulsively-created jet as a jet front propagates through the medium. At a significant depth (greater than one hundred meters) and under a high ambient pressure at the depth, the cavitation bubble, that would otherwise form at the jet front, is suppressed. For use in deep water drilling applications, a need therefore exists for forming the cavitation bubble that overcomes the jet formation inhibiting effects of water as a surrounding medium.","Accordingly, it is a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide an assembly and method of use for drilling in deep water applications.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an assembly and method of use for creating a gas bubble at the water jet discharge nozzle through which high velocity water is expelled as a cutting system that overcomes the jet formation inhibiting effects of water as a surrounding medium.","To attain the objects described above, the present invention features an assembly and method of use for producing a pulsed jet. The assembly generally comprises a tank, feed lines for water an oxidizer line, a fuel line, a spark generator, discharge lines and control valves.","In operation, the tank is purged using a gaseous oxidizer. Any residual combustion gas and liquid is forced out of the tank through discharge valves and a nozzle. The discharge valves are then closed and the tank is filled with oxidizer. The oxidizer control valve is then closed and water or other cutting fluid is injected into the tank, thereby compressing the oxidizer within the tank.","When the cutting fluid attains a desired level in the tank, the control valve is closed and fuel is injected into the compressed oxidizer trapped above the cutting fluid. A spark generator ignites the fuel\/air mixture; thereby, raising the pressure in the tank. As the pressure rises in the tank, a low-pressure control valve closes at a prescribed level. Simultaneously, a gas vent line is opened, as is a high-pressure discharge valve. Combustion gas is then free to discharge into the water medium through the discharge nozzle, thereby, forming a gas bubble at the nozzle exit.","When the gas bubble reaches a desired size and the pressure in the tank drops below a desired level, the gas vent line is closed, and the high pressure discharge valve opens to allow expansion of the combination gas. The gas forces the cutting fluid through the discharge nozzle.","The discharged cutting fluid forms a cutting jet. The presence of the gas bubble allows the jet to retain coherence as the water jet traverses the space between the nozzle and a cutting surface. After the cutting fluid has been expended, the remaining gas discharges through the nozzle, completing the cutting cycle.","Generally, the proposed water jet assembly and method of use overcomes difficulties with traditionally-used steady cutting jets and the pulsed difficulties of the jet described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,868,790 (incorporated herein by reference) by venting combustion gases immediately prior to the water jet in order to eliminate water resistance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 8"],"b":["10","12","14","16","18","20","22","30","32","34","36","38","40"]},"In operation, the tank  is purged by the oxidizer line  using a gaseous oxidizer\u2014such as air. As shown in , any residual combustion gas and liquid is forced out of the tank  in direction \u201cA\u201d through the discharge valves ,  and a nozzle  by using the oxidizer supplied by the oxidizer line  (See Table 1 for valve sequencing).","The control valves ,  are then closed and the tank  is filled with oxidizer (See ). The control valve  is then closed and water by the water feed line  (or other cutting fluid) is supplied in direction \u201cB\u201d into the tank  by the opening of control valve , thereby compressing the oxidizer within the tank (See ).","When the cutting fluid attains a desired level  in the tank  (Direction \u201cC\u201d), the control valve  is closed and the control valve  in the fuel line  is opened and fuel is injected in Direction \u201cD\u201d to the compressed oxidizer trapped above the cutting fluid (See ).","The spark generator  ignites the fuel\/oxidizer mixture for an explosive ignition , thereby, raising the pressure in the tank  (See ). As the pressure rises in the tank , the control valve  closes at a prescribed level (approximately 50 pounds per square inch over ambient pressure). Simultaneously, the control valve  of the gas vent line  is opened, as is the high-pressure discharge control valve . Combustion gas is then free to discharge into the water medium through the discharge nozzle , forming a gas bubble  at the nozzle exit (See ).","When the gas bubble  reaches a desired size and the pressure in the tank  drops below a desired level, the control valve  closes, and the control valve  remains open to allow expansion of the combination gas (See ). The expanding gas forces the cutting fluid  out of the tank  in Direction \u201cE\u201d through the discharge nozzle .","The discharged cutting fluid  forms a cutting jet . The presence of the gas bubble  allows the cutting jet  to retain coherence as the water of the cutting jet traverses a space between the nozzle  and a cutting surface. After the cutting fluid  has been expended, the remaining combustion gas discharges through the nozzle , completing the cycle (See ). To produce a pulsed cutting jet, the cycle is repeated in succession.","Pressures realized in the tank  over time during the cycle are shown in .
