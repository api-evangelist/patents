{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The instant application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/337,609, now, U.S. Pat. No. 7,593,915 B2, entitled \u201cCUSTOMIZED MEDIA SERVICES\u201d filed Jan. 7, 2003, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by this reference.","Technology and equipment for capturing life's every-day experiences have out-paced the services and mechanisms by which those experiences can be enjoyed at a later date. Digital cameras and portable video cassette recorders now enable consumers to capture more and more information, yet, the volume of the images and video that these devices now capture makes it increasingly more difficult to review any of the experiences they capture. Photographs are often stuffed away. The video tapes that are recorded by camcorders is often tossed aside, seldom, if ever, reviewed.","A problem with the ever-increasing amount of video and photographs that are taken every year is that reviewing them is often very time-consuming and cumbersome. Although video and photographs are captured sequentially over time, they are rarely cataloged or organized in any fashion by which their retrieval is possible, let alone enjoyable.","A method for organizing content embodied as photographs, graphics, video and\/or music for presentation would be an improvement over the prior art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"12"},"A \u201ccontent file\u201d is any kind of file embodying content. Examples of \u201ccontent file\u201d include, but are not limited to: a graphic file such as a JPEG file; an MP3 audio file, an MPEG or other video-format file. Content files are preferably embodied in computer data files using an storage appropriate medium and is preferably indexed by information by which a content file can be selected for inclusion into a presentation and consistent with a particular theme.","Content files can be indexed by their being related to or compliant with a subject or a theme. A content file can be considered to be related to or compliant with a theme based on what is in a content file. A content file can also be considered to be related to or compliant with a theme based on what is not in a content file.","Content files can be indexed by the date and\/or time at which they were created; who or what is depicted, shown or mentioned in the content. Content files can also be indexed by a background, venue, organization, institution or product depicted in a content file. Additional examples of content index attributes include, but are not limited to, a time or time period to which the content file relates or was captured, a setting or subject depicted in the content file; the individuals or subject matter depicted in or captured by the content file; an event, events, or occasions memorialized in or by the content file, aesthetic and stylistic characteristics of the contents of the file. Each content file that will become part of a presentation, is indexed using any appropriate indicators by which a content file can be identified.","Indexing a content file can be performed manually by a person's inspection or review of the content of a content file, whether the content is embodied in a photograph, computer graphic, an audio file or a video. Manually indexing usually requires that the content file be appended with or identified with a data that identifies the content shown or depicted in the content file. By way of example, a photograph embodied as JPEG file can be associated with, linked to, or edited to include data that identifies the date and\/or time that the photograph was taken; who or what is depicted or shown in the photograph; a setting, background or venue depicted in the photograph; a product or service, an event or other occasion shown in the photograph. In an alternate embodiment content file indexing is performed by a computer which scans or sorts through a data structure or list of content identifiers that specify any identifying information about content in a content file can be used to index a content file for use in a thematic presentation.","Those of skill in the art will recognize that both a manual indexing and an automatic indexing can be performed by a third-party service provider. In embodiments where the indexing is performed by a third-party service provider, the service provider can add additional content to a set or collection of content files from which a thematic presentation can be prepared. Alternatively, a commercial indexing service can supply it's own stock content files for inclusion into a thematic presentation, perhaps as advertising of the service provider's goods or services or as advertising for the goods and\/or services of other entities that might pay or be paid for the inclusion of their advertising material into a thematic presentation. An example of a third-party-supplied content file would include a photographic or videographic depiction of a hotel supplied by the hotel owner or operator; a photograph or video of a vacation resort that is supplied by the resort owner or operator; airline accommodations depicted in pictures or video that is supplied by an airline, food, or restaurants that are related to the subject matter of the thematic presentation, the thematic content of which is supplied by the purveyor. Alternatively, the third-party supplied content file could include at least portions of at least one previously-broadcast television program or previously-released motion picture that are related to the subject matter of the thematic presentation.","Those of skill in the art will recognize that both a manual indexing and an automatic indexing can be performed by a third-party service provider.

A thematic presentation is \u201cordered\u201d by arranging the multi-media files according to some criteria, such as the time and\/or date on which a content file was created, subjects depicted or not depicted in a file. A thematic presentation can be \u201cordered\u201d temporally such that multi-media files are selected and arranged on the basis of an event, location, product or service that is depicted or not depicted in the multi-media content files. A thematic presentation can be \u201cordered\u201d by arranging thematically related content files randomly.","A \u201ctheme\u201d should be considered to be any sort of message or idea that is conveyed by, depicted in or associated with the content files. A \u201cthematic presentation\u201d is a presentation of multi-media according to, or consistent with, a theme, which is identified according to the contents of a template file. A multi-media \u201cpresentation\u201d is thematic if at least some of the multi-media content pertains to or relates to an idea, subject, event, person or persons, a time or era, a product, a service or any other topic or idea. Examples of a thematic presentation would include, but are not limited to, a series of photographs taken during a wedding, a vacation, a graduation ceremony, a conference, a business meeting, a subset of which are subsequently organized in some manner so as to convey the experience to others, perhaps without having to view all of the photographs that might have been taken. A thematic presentation can also include one or more audio files that might include music, narration, or both.","In , a system and method for presenting multi-media in a thematic presentation is shown. The depiction in  is also considered to be a method because much of the functionality of the invention disclosed and claimed herein is by way of software. As such,  depicts functions of software.","A multi-media database  includes electronic files that contain information embodied in media such as still photographs, graphic files, music, or video. The information in the files stored in the data base , can be stored on a mass storage device such as a disk drive, tape, DVD or the like, indexed and retrieved at a later time. The media database  preferably includes for each stored file, indexing information by which certain data or information recorded in each content file can be identified and selectively retrieved from the media database  by an appropriate database search engine or an individual.","In , content files for inclusion into a thematic presentation can also be obtained from alternate sources multi-media sources . Examples of alternate multi-media sources include but are not limited to pictures or graphics available on line such as newspapers, periodicals and the like; multi-media provided by third parties, such as stock footage from a vacation or meeting site for inclusion into a thematic presentation, assuming of course that the multi-media available from such sources  is indexed such that the indexes can be scanned or tested for conformance to the presentation template.","The presentation manager  is preferably embodied as a computer program running on a computer, which has access to or is coupled to one or more of the aforementioned databases  and . The presentation manager  scans, sorts or tests the content file indexes, testing the indexes against specifications of content files to include in a thematic presentation, which are in a presentation template  and using mapping rules  to identify records from the media database  or from the alternate multi-media sources  as appropriate for inclusion into a thematic presentation. Content files in the media database  or from the alternate multi-media sources  are identified by the presentation manager's scanning or searching indexes in the database  and\/or multi-media sources  and identifying indexes that identify content files that conform to a specification or template for a thematic presentation. The presentation template  and the mapping rules  determine what sort of content goes into a thematic presentation as well as the identity of the content files stored in the database  and therefore determine the theme or message of a thematic presentation by specifying content files and therefore content to include. Stated alternatively, the presentation manager uses a thematic template as a sort of database selection criteria, although the thematic template can include multiple selection criteria.","In a preferred embodiment, a presentation template  is a multi-element data structure, the components of which identify content to include in a presentation. Multi-media files in a database  or  that contain content that is consistent with the presentation template  specifications are selected by the presentation manger  or other sorting program to be merged or included as part of a presentation. When a content file is selected from a database, it is displayed on one or more display devices via one or more display channels according to specifications in the presentation template . By way of example, pictures, movies, or sound tracks that were recorded during a certain time period and which depict a child can be displayed on one screen while pictures, movies or sound tracks that were recorded during the same time period but which depict other family members or friends can be displayed on another screen so as to create a presentation where a subject is displayed on one device while a related subject is displayed on a different screen. The presentation of two related subjects during the same time period on two different screens can be considered a thematic presentation.","In a preferred embodiment, a presentation template  is a multi-element data structure. the components of which identify content to include in a presentation. Multi-media files in a database  or  that contain content that is consistent with the presentation template  specifications are selected by the presentation manager  or other sorting program to be merged or included as part of a presentation. When a content file is selected from a database, it is displayed on one or more display devices via one or more display channels according to specifications in the presentation template . By way of example, pictures, movies, or sound tracks that were recorded during a certain time period and which depict a child can be displayed on one screen while pictures, movies or sound tracks that were recorded during the same time period but which depict other family members or friends can be displayed on another screen so as to create a presentation where a subject is displayed on one device while a related subject is displayed on a different screen. The presentation of two related subjects during the same time period on two different screens can be considered a thematic presentation.","Content files are selected from a media database  or from alternate media sources  in order to make a multi-media presentation that is consistent with, or which delivers a multi-media experience that is consistent with a particular theme. An example of a presentation template  is disclosed in  and identified therein by reference numeral .","In , the presentation template  (also referred to as a \u201cthematic presentation template\u201d) specifies the content to be included in a presentation of a child's birthday party. The thematic presentation template  is used as a guideline or specification to select and organize content files such as photographs, graphics, audio and video into a combined or merged presentation of all of the individual content files that satisfy the criteria specified in the presentation template . The presentation template  is analogous to a database selection criteria, although multiple criteria can be employed to select multi-media for inclusion. In at least one embodiment, a multi-media file that satisfies a single criteria can be selected for inclusion, however, other embodiments can require selected multi-media content files to be selected only if they meet two or more selection criteria specified in the presentation template . When the content files are selected, they can be read from the database  and\/or  and presented on one or more output devices as a merged presentation.","In , the thematic presentation specified by the presentation template  is designed to have content files depict an arrival segment , a play segment , a \u201cbirthday cake\u201d segment , a segment depicting the opening of gifts  and a conclusion segment . With respect to the arrival segment , content files are selected or read from a database  and\/or  by any appropriate index that identifies a content file as depicting events that occurred early in the day on which the birthday party was celebrated. The presentation manager  depicted in  sorts through the multi-media records in the database , examining the indexing of each multi-media file to identify multi-media content files such as still photographs, music, and\/or video taken early in the day. Selected content files might have or include or depict the location of the birthday party (e.g., the Exploratorium Building), greetings between guests such as the perfunctory handshakes or embraces between family members and friends as they arrive at a party. The content files for use in the arrival segment  might also be identified according to the guest or client depicted in the content files as indicated by the index information associated with the content files that are selected.","The presentation template  can also specify output channels to which files should be sent for display. In addition, the presentation template  can specify that pictures or videos that depict the arrival segment  should have a background or foreground music accompaniment. A light piano jazz for example, can be blended with a timed and sequenced display of photographs.","In at least one embodiment, the presentation template  can be modified by a user, using an editor for example, such that the content files that are selected by the presentation manager can be modified in real-time. By editing the presentation template interactively, the thematic presentation can be modified interactively as well.","In a thematic presentation, content files such as photographs, are typically concatenated either by time of capture, subjects shown or other criteria, such that they can be shown in sequence, one after the other. The presentation order of files, pictures or video requires an appropriate playback mechanism (i.e., broadcast channel) as would the presentation of music files require audio equipment by which a music file could be reproduced.","In , channel mapping rules  are used by the presentation manager to select and organize content files in order to establish a particular presentation effect. An example of a channel mapping rule  is the sequencing of the arrival segment  with respect to the play segment  and the \u201cbirthday cake\u201d segment  in that depictions or representations of the bulk of the play segment should come after the demonstration of the arrival segment. Stated alternatively, a thematic presentation of a child's birthday party is often best appreciated when the actual party during which the birthday cake is enjoyed and gifts are opened, is presented after the viewer of the thematic presentation witnesses the arrival of certain guests and events leading up to the birthday cake and gift opening such as children's play beforehand.","Channel mapping rules can also specify how multi-media files are to be played back or presented. For instance, a thematic presentation of a child's birthday party might require that pictures of the guest of honor be shown on one screen while pictures of party attendees be shown on other screens, with or without music accompaniment.","The presentation template  of  includes a play time segment . Content files selected for this play segment can be selected based upon key words in the content file indexes that indicate that the subject matter depicted in a particular content file is associated with children playing during the birthday party and after the guests started arriving.","In at least one embodiment of the invention disclosed and claimed herein, a thematic presentation can be prepared by a third party. In such an embodiment, the content files selected for presentation can be blended with or merged into a thematic presentation along with stock footage or photographs of the third party service provider. Examples of such a presentation would include photographs and\/or video of the organization or venue whereat a party was had. The inclusion of commercial subject matter or advertising into a thematic presentation can enable a commercial entity to effectively advertise its goods or services in context and setting whereby the commercial message can controlled and effectively presented.","In , stock photographs, videos, or graphics  might be added to or included with or merged into the other content files and become part of a thematic presentation.","Segment  of the presentation template  is constructed from content files that depict or show the birthday cake . The birthday cake segment  of a thematic presentation can include the depiction of certain individuals or guests  as well as stock graphics, pictures or video of the bakery or other entity that prepared or created or perhaps delivered the birthday cake, depicted in other content files of the birthday cake segment .","In segment , content files can be selected from the media database according to events depicted in those content files that are related to the opening of birthday gifts by the party celebrant. Except for the bulk, content files from the database  might also be selected by guests or other individuals or subjects depicted in the content files created.","In segment , the conclusion of the birthday party is presented in a thematic presentation by selecting content files that depict guests leaving or saying their good-byes. Stock footage of the venue where the party was held might be included showing some favorable aspect or characteristic of the venue for commercial purposes.","Throughout the thematic presentation , pictures, graphics and\/or video can be accompanied by the aforementioned music , the files of which can be selected according to criteria pertinent to each segment of the thematic presentation.","By using the specifications in the presentation template , the presentation manager  can select files from a database  or , read the appropriate files from the database  or  and direct the files to a physical environment for display or playback. The output of the presentation manager  can therefore be considered to be the file or files that are to be viewed or played on an appropriate device in a physical environment .","In , output of the presentation manager  is provided to a physical environment  in which a thematic presentation is presented. For purposes of claim construction, the physical environment  includes the medium in which the thematic presentation is published for consumption by an observer. \u201cPublishing\u201d means playing, viewing, listening to, storing, or sending the multi-media files that make up a thematic presentation. Publishing a thematic presentation occurs by any mechanism by which the content of the content files are displayed or played back. Examples of publishing a presentation can be via a video display device such as a television receiver or computer monitor; broadcasting audio files in the presentation; displaying all or part of a thematic presentation on multiple monitor or televisions, with or without an audio channel. Publishing can also occur by storing the thematic presentation (which is really a collection of multi-media files) as well as transmitting the thematic presentation to a third party, such as by way of an e-mail message or web download.","In , the physical environment  in which a thematic presentation can be published includes one or more channels  such as one or more video displays (a television, for instance). In at least one embodiment, multiple display devices such as several television receivers or several computer monitors can be used to share the experience of a multi-media thematic presentation. Other channels would include the aforementioned electronic transfer or playback of video or audio files as well.","The channel(s)  on which different components of a thematic presentation are played are specified in a presentation template . By way of example, the presentation template  can specify that pictures or video related to a certain person or topic be played out of a particular channel - while pictures or video related to the person or topic played out of channel - are instead displayed out of channel - and\/or -.","A user interface  in one embodiment as provided by a keyboard, monitor or mouse by which content files can be selected for inclusion into a presentation, the presentation can be retrieved and stored and played, or a presentation can be terminated. Examples of a user interface  include a keyboard, mouse, voice-recognition control. The user interface  can enable a user, which is any person publishing a thematic presentation, to interact with the thematic presentation, including interactively modifying the thematic template so as to alter the selection criteria of content files.","By altering content file selection criteria in a template, it is possible to create a multi-media thematic presentation of a theme, albeit of a different time period, different subject matter or any other different topic about which a thematic presentation can be made. By altering template specifications in real time, a thematic presentation can be modified interactively such that content that is published can be changed interactively in real time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["16","19","16","30","32","34","16","19","36","38","40"]},"As set forth above, a presentation template  is embodied as one or more data files or one or more data structures, the contents and organization of which specifies content files to include in a thematic presentation and the channels or playback devices and environments in which to play back a thematic presentation.","The computer  will of course be provided with software by which the content files can be formatted and delivered to the output devices on which the content files are to be displayed. As shown in , the content files output from the computer  are delivered to the output devices , ,  et al. over \u201cchannels\u201d which can be embodied as serial or parallel communications ports such as a USB port, an RS-232 serial port and others. Such software and communications ports is known to those of ordinary skill in the art.","When acting under the control of the presentation manager , the computer  will receive the thematic template information , such as that depicted in , in embodiment of a data file or data structure by which certain files of the sources , , and  can be automatically selected. The computer  will include software which scans records in the database of files and, upon detecting files that have criteria that match the thematic template , the computer  will assemble the content files by copying them into another file or data structure which can be played back through an appropriate output device such as the television , a printer  or perhaps a plasma display (not shown). Still another embodiment whereby the thematic presentation can be broadcast would include transmitting the output file of content files via a data network to a remote location, such as by way of an e-mail attachment, the technology of which is well-known in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","304"]},"At step , the presentation template is considered or input, which is important because the presentation template specifies characteristics or attributes of content to be included in a presentation as well as the order in which they are presented and any special effects, music or media in which the completed presentation is to be displayed.","At step , a first content file index is considered. Content file indexes can be stored in the database  such that a computer or other processor can scan the index to identify content files with certain attributes, which would be indicated in the content file's index.","At step , a decision is made whether or not the content file read in step  is consistent or compliant with the presentation template that was read in step . The decision of step  is made using information in a content file index.","In step , if the content file is consistent with or compliant with the template (as indicated by data in the content file's index) the content file is marked or flagged such that the content file will be designated as part of the thematic presentation in step . If it is determined at step  that a content file is determined to not be compliant or consistent with the presentation template, the content file is ignored or discarded at step .","The process of organizing multi-media content files for a presentation continues in . A test is performed in step  as to whether all of the content file indexes have been considered or read. If it is determined in step  that other content file indexes remain to be considered for inclusion of the corresponding content files in the presentation, program control proceeds to step  for the next content file is retrieved. The program control leads back to step  for the next-selected content file is tested for its compliance with the presentation template.","In step , the medium (audio, video, multi-screen, etc.) in which the presentation will be presented is selected from the template . A medium in which a presentation can be played back can include a video or graphic display device such as a television receiver on which pictures or photographs can be sequentially displayed one at a time with each photograph being held in position on the television screen for a pre-determined time. An audio file might be played in the background such that photographs are presented sequentially, maintained on screen for some time duration accompanied by some appropriate thematic music.","In step , the medium (audio, video, multi-screen, etc.) in which the presentation will be presented is selected from the template . A medium in which a presentation can be played back can include a video or graphic display device such as a television receiver on which pictures or photographs can be sequentially displayed one at a time with each photograph being held in position on the television screed for a pre-determined time. An audio file might be played in the background such that photographs are presented sequentially, maintained on screen for some time duration accompanied by some appropriate thematic music.","In step , the content files for use on the selected medium are formatted. By way of example, photographs for presentation on a television receiver will need to be converted into video signals so that the television receiver can reproduce the still frame images using video signals. Alternatively, the photographs might be formatted as print files for printing from a printer . Similarly, video files from which a thematic presentation might be made, might be concatenated (linked together in a stream) and stored on a magnetic tape  for playback on a device such as a VCR.","At step , the presentation and the content that it is comprised of can be published. The term \u201cpublished\u201d should be construed to mean distribution or playback of the presentation including each of the files that was selected and combined or merged so as to create the thematic presentation.","At step , a decision can be made to link another presentation. Linking a presentation can be accomplished by including the optional inclusion into the first template . By organizing and presenting a first set of content files according to a first thematic template and including in the first thematic template a link to another thematic template, it is possible to view one or more content files and if desired, view a different set of files that are only referenced in or related by the first thematic template. At step , the new thematic presentation is viewed using steps depicted in ,  and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":"70"},"In , a first presentation manager  \u201creads\u201d a first presentation template  (shown in  and , but not shown in  for clarity) that is accessed or part of the computer on which the first presentation manager  runs. The first presentation template and rules are not shown in  for clarity.","Specifications in the presentation template  are used by the first presentation manger  to select certain files stored in a database  or available from alternate media sources  such as on-line databases. The files selected from the databases  and  (i.e., the selected \u201ccontent files) conform to specifications in the first presentation template .","After content files are selected or identified, they are copied or output by the first presentation manager or other appropriate controller to a first physical environment  where the selected files can be viewed or listened to by way of appropriate play-back devices that comprise a channel  in the physical environment. By way of example, if the first presentation template  specifies the presentation of a photograph of a certain individual at a certain time period and\/or at a certain location, upon finding such a photograph in the database  or , (as determined by information in the indexes) the first presentation managers will copy the selected file and cause the file to be output to a channel in the physical environment where the photograph can be viewed. In  for instance, photographs of a child, at a particular time period or at a particular location, could be directed by the presentation manager  to be displayed on channel - in the first environment . The channel - could be directed to a large, wall-mounted plasma display on which the child's photograph would be made to appear. In addition, the presentation manager could direct a photograph of the child at a different time period but at the same location to be displayed on channel -, which could be directed to a television or computer monitor or a second, wall-mounted plasma display. As such, the child's picture at the same location but at two different times would be displayed on two different monitors.","In the embodiment shown in , the first presentation manager  can be operatively coupled  to a second presentation manager  such that content files selected from the databases  and  can be delivered from the first presentation manager  to a second presentation manager . Files delivered to the second presentation manager  can be presented to a second physical environment  for display\/playback on devices in the second physical environment  using corresponding channels .","In addition to receiving the multi-media files of a first thematic presentation prepared by the first presentation manager , the second presentation manager  can access a media database  as well as alternate databases  and obtain additional content files from those other databases. When the second presentation manager  is provided with it's own presentation template, i.e., a second presentation template , the second presentation manager  can prepare a second thematic presentation from content stored in the databases  and  that comply with the second presentation template . In so doing, the second presentation manager  can publish the second thematic presentation to the second physical environment  as described above, or publish the second thematic presentation in the first physical environment  via the first presentation manager . In either case, a thematic presentation can be published (presented) to two or more people substantially simultaneously and provide for both, a social interaction with each other through the multi-media presentation.","In addition to the systems and methods shown in ,  and , all of which provide customized multi-media service,  shows another embodiment of a system and method for providing a custom multi-media service. The system and method depicted in  also enable social interaction between two or more people at two or more different locations.","In , a single presentation manager  has access to first and second multi-media databases  and  and from which indexed multi-media content files can be obtained, if they comply with a presentation template  and rules used by the presentation manager . In addition to multi-media files in the two multi-media databases  and , the presentation manager  can obtain content for inclusion into a thematic presentation from alternate media sources .","Using files (and content therein) from the databases ,  and , the presentation manager  can send the thematic presentation to either one or both of two (or more) physical environments  and  for publication. In the first physical environment , the thematic presentation is displayed or played back on devices that are coupled to three different channels ---. In the second physical environment, the thematic presentation is played back on four different channels ---. In both environments  and , the channels on which a thematic presentation are played should be specified in the presentation template.","In the embodiments shown in , a user interface is provided by a keyboard, monitor or mouse. The user interface enables commands to be entered to the presentation managers by which a presentation template can be altered so as to select different content files from the associated databases for inclusion into a presentation. The user interface  can enable a user, which is any person publishing a thematic presentation, to interact with the thematic presentation, including interactively modifying the thematic template so as to alter the selection criteria of content files.","By altering content file selection criteria in a template, it is possible to create a multi-media thematic presentation of a theme, albeit of a different time period, different subject matter or any other different topic about which a thematic presentation can be made. By altering template specifications in real time, a thematic presentation can be modified interactively such that content that is published can be changed interactively in real time.","It should be appreciated that by selectively retrieving certain files that comport with a specification in the template and blending or merging content files, commonly-related subject matter can be combined into one cohesive presentation in which an idea or an experience can be better-appreciated. By permitting the inclusion of advertising material or other additional content that is related to the thematic presentation, third-party services can provide the indexing and content file assembly services and obtain new and more effective advertising opportunities by including appropriate thematic advertising material into a thematic presentation. A thematic presentation that is composed of photographs, and\/or video and\/or audio, each of which can be routed to one or more display\/playback devices can provide a unique multi-media experience using the custom multi-media service. Service providers who index and\/or compile content files into a thematic presentation could include video segments, html pages, pictures or audio files by which their services or goods might be favorably depicted and associated with a pleasant experience memorialized in the content files and presented in a seamless, thematic presentation."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
