{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The quality of a photograph or film often depends on accurate settings for a camera's exposure-related parameters, such as aperture settings and\/or exposure times. Any settings related to exposure parameters for photographs or films will hereinafter be referred to as exposure settings. Also, the terms \u201cphotograph\u201d, \u201cphotographer\u201d, \u201cphotography\u201d, and the like will be used generically hereinafter to refer to concepts related to photography and\/or cinematography.","To determine the appropriate exposure settings for a photograph, the lighting conditions under which the photograph is taken might need to be determined. A photographer might use one of two different types of light meters, a reflected light meter or an incident light meter, to measure the light level. A reflected light meter is typically built in to a camera and can measure the amount of light reflected from a subject and arriving at the camera. An incident light meter is typically a stand-alone device that can measure the amount of light falling on a subject.","In most cases, a measurement by a reflected light meter is adequate for determining the appropriate exposure settings. However, when a scene is particularly bright or particularly dark, the use of a reflected light meter can result in a photograph that is underexposed or overexposed. An incident light meter might provide better results under exceptionally bright or dark conditions. A photographer can place an incident light meter near the subject to be photographed to measure the amount of light actually incident on the subject. This light measurement might then be used to determine exposure settings that are more appropriate than those that would be obtained through the use of a reflected light meter.","It can be seen that reflected light meters and incident light meters each have advantages and disadvantages. A reflected light meter can be built in to a camera, thus freeing the photographer from the need to carry an additional piece of equipment. A camera with a built-in reflected light meter can use the light level measurements made by the reflected light meter to make an automated determination of the appropriate exposure settings. However, the light level measurements made by a reflected light meter might not always lead to the most appropriate exposure settings under all circumstances.","An incident light meter, on the other hand, can take light level measurements that result in exposure settings that are correct under a broader range of lighting conditions. However, a photographer using an incident light meter typically needs to carry an additional piece of equipment and may need to manually determine the exposure settings based on the measurements made by the incident light meter.","Digital cameras are sometimes included in multi-function devices such as telephones, smart phones, personal digital assistants, handheld, tablet, or laptop computers, and similar portable devices that have wireless telecommunications capabilities. Any such device will hereinafter be referred to as a mobile telecommunications device or simply as a mobile device.","It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative examples of one or more implementations of the present disclosure are provided below, the disclosed systems and\/or methods may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations, drawings, and techniques illustrated below, including the exemplary designs and implementations illustrated and described herein, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.","Implementations of the present disclosure allow a mobile telecommunications device with a light sensor to function as an incident light meter. The light level measurements made by the light sensor can then be used to compute exposure settings. Using a mobile device in this manner can eliminate the need for photographers to carry a separate device to take light level readings.","Many mobile devices are equipped with light sensors in order to measure the ambient light level. A mobile device might use the measurements made by such a sensor to adjust the brightness of its display screen and\/or the backlighting of its keypad as appropriate for the illumination in its surroundings. Implementations of the present disclosure use light level measurements from the light sensor on a mobile device to generate a light level value that can be used for photography purposes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","110","100","110","100","110","120","100","110","160","100","110"]},"In an implementation, the light level measurements made by the light sensor  are used as inputs into a calculation component  on the mobile device . While the calculation component  is depicted on the surface of the mobile device , it should be understood that the calculation component  would typically be an internal component of the mobile device  and could be any combination of hardware or software components capable of performing the actions described herein. After receiving an input from the light sensor , the calculation component  can generate a photography-related output.","In some implementations, the photography-related output generated by the calculation component  is a light level value that the calculation component  provides for display on a portion  of the display screen  of the mobile device . That is, the calculation component  converts the light level measurements made by the light sensor  into units, such as lux, that are typically used in photography. A light level value in the appropriate units is then displayed in the portion  of the display screen . A photographer could use a reading shown in the portion  of the display screen  to adjust the exposure settings for another camera. Alternatively, the calculation component  could automatically calculate one or more exposure setting values based on the measured light level, and the exposure setting values could be displayed on the portion  of the display screen  instead of or in addition to a light level value.","To cause a light level value and\/or an exposure setting value to appear in the portion  of the display screen , the photographer might press a photography-related virtual button  on the display screen , might press a key on the keypad , might select a menu item that appears on the display screen , or might provide some other input that causes the light level value and\/or exposure setting value to appear. In the implementations where a light level value and\/or an exposure setting value appears in the portion  of the display screen , the mobile device  can function similarly to a traditional incident light meter. That is, the photographer can hold the mobile device  near a subject, take an incident light level measurement, observe the displayed light level value and\/or exposure setting value, and use the displayed value to adjust the exposure settings on another device.","In other implementations, the photography-related output generated by the calculation component  is an automated adjustment of an exposure setting for a camera on the mobile device . That is, light level measurements from the light sensor  are provided to the calculation component , and the calculation component  uses the light level measurements to determine appropriate exposure settings for a photograph to be taken by the mobile device . The calculation component  might then initiate an automated adjustment of the exposure parameters for the photograph. A light level value and\/or exposure setting value is not necessarily displayed on the display screen  of the mobile device  when an automated exposure setting adjustment is made on the mobile device  based on the light level measurements from the light sensor .","In still other implementations, a light level value displayed in the portion  of the display screen  might be used by a photographer to manually set the exposure parameters for a photograph that is to be taken by the mobile device . Alternatively, a light level value or exposure setting value might appear in the portion  of the display screen  for information purposes even when the exposure settings for the mobile device  are automatically adjusted.","Exposure setting adjustments on the mobile device  that are based on incident light level measurements could be performed instead of or in combination with automated adjustments that are made based on a reflected light meter built in to the mobile device . For instance, a photographer might use an incident light level value or exposure setting value shown in the portion  of the display screen  to manually fine tune an exposure setting automatically determined by the mobile device's reflected light meter. Alternatively, a photographer might override the exposure settings that were automatically set based on the reflected light meter measurements and might instead use an incident light level value or exposure setting value shown in the portion  of the display screen  to establish new exposure parameter settings for the mobile device .","In an implementation, the Java level application programming interface (API) LightSensorGetLastKnownAdcReading can be used to retrieve light level measurements from the light sensor . In other implementations, the measurements could be retrieved in other ways. These measurements can then be used as inputs into the calculation component  to calculate a light level and\/or an exposure setting.","In an implementation, settings for one or more other variables can be manually entered into the mobile device  by the photographer and used together with the automatically generated light level measurements from the light sensor  to calculate an exposure setting. The other user input variables might be similar to the user input variables that are typically entered into traditional incident light meters. One such variable might be the number of frames per second that the camera is set to expose. Another such variable might be the sensitivity level of the film, typically referred to as ISO. Yet another such variable might be the shutter angle in degrees. Still another such variable might be the lighting type.","In an implementation, the lighting type variable takes one of three values: daylight, tungsten, or fluorescent. The lighting type might need to be manually specified because the photoptic response accuracy (ft value) of the light sensor  on the mobile device  might be different from that of traditional incident light meters. Specification of the type of lighting the light sensor is exposed to might compensate for this difference. In an implementation, the user selects the type of lighting and manually enters the selection into the mobile device . A correction to the automatically generated exposure settings can then be made based on the lighting type, since the error associated with a particular lighting type tends to be constant.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","210","220"]},"Light meter applications that currently exist for mobile devices are different from the implementations disclosed herein in that the existing applications do not use a light sensor on the device. Instead, they use information provided by the camera lens. Some advanced mobile devices are equipped with auto-exposure and auto-focus cameras, wherein a half-click of the shutter button initiates a measurement of the amount of light hitting the camera lens and an exposure setting is automatically calculated. This calculation, however, determines an average illumination for the scene, which is what a reflected light meter does. Therefore, such devices do not function as incident light meters as do the mobile devices described herein.","In other words, a mobile device equipped with a camera with an automated exposure feature might include a light sensor or some other type of light detection component that is separate from the light sensor  described above. This separate light sensor can provide the camera with at least a portion of the functionality of a reflected light meter but does not generate an output that can provide the camera with the functionality of an incident light meter.","The components described above might include or be implemented by a processing component that is capable of executing instructions related to the actions described above.  illustrates an example of a system  that includes a processing component  suitable for one or more of the implementations disclosed herein. In addition to the processor  (which may be referred to as a central processor unit or CPU), the system  might include network connectivity devices , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , secondary storage , and input\/output (I\/O) devices . These components might communicate with one another via a bus . In some cases, some of these components may not be present or may be combined in various combinations with one another or with other components not shown. These components might be located in a single physical entity or in more than one physical entity. Any actions described herein as being taken by the processor  might be taken by the processor  alone or by the processor  in conjunction with one or more components shown or not shown in the drawing, such as a digital signal processor (DSP) . Although the DSP  is shown as a separate component, the DSP  might be incorporated into the processor .","The processor  executes instructions, codes, computer programs, or scripts that it might access from the network connectivity devices , RAM , ROM , or secondary storage  (which might include various disk-based systems such as hard disk, floppy disk, or optical disk). While only one CPU  is shown, multiple processors may be present. Thus, while instructions may be discussed as being executed by a processor, the instructions may be executed simultaneously, serially, or otherwise by one or multiple processors. The processor  may be implemented as one or more CPU chips.","The network connectivity devices  may take the form of modems, modem banks, Ethernet devices, universal serial bus (USB) interface devices, serial interfaces, token ring devices, fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) devices, wireless local area network (WLAN) devices, radio transceiver devices such as code division multiple access (CDMA) devices, global system for mobile communications (GSM) radio transceiver devices, worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) devices, digital subscriber line (xDSL) devices, data over cable service interface specification (DOCSIS) modems, and\/or other well-known devices for connecting to networks. These network connectivity devices  may enable the processor  to communicate with the Internet or one or more telecommunications networks or other networks from which the processor  might receive information or to which the processor  might output information.","The network connectivity devices  might also include one or more transceiver components  capable of transmitting and\/or receiving data wirelessly in the form of electromagnetic waves, such as radio frequency signals or microwave frequency signals. Alternatively, the data may propagate in or on the surface of electrical conductors, in coaxial cables, in waveguides, in optical media such as optical fiber, or in other media. The transceiver component  might include separate receiving and transmitting units or a single transceiver. Information transmitted or received by the transceiver component  may include data that has been processed by the processor  or instructions that are to be executed by processor . The data may be ordered according to different sequences as may be desirable for either processing or generating the data or transmitting or receiving the data.","The RAM  might be used to store volatile data and perhaps to store instructions that are executed by the processor . The ROM  is a non-volatile memory device that typically has a smaller memory capacity than the memory capacity of the secondary storage . ROM  might be used to store instructions and perhaps data that are read during execution of the instructions. Access to both RAM  and ROM  is typically faster than to secondary storage . The secondary storage  is typically comprised of one or more disk drives or tape drives and might be used for non-volatile storage of data or as an over-flow data storage device if RAM  is not large enough to hold all working data. Secondary storage  may be used to store programs that are loaded into RAM  when such programs are selected for execution.","The I\/O devices  may include liquid crystal displays (LCDs), touch screen displays, keyboards, keypads, switches, dials, mice, track balls, voice recognizers, card readers, paper tape readers, printers, video monitors, or other well-known input\/output devices. Also, the transceiver  might be considered to be a component of the I\/O devices  instead of or in addition to being a component of the network connectivity devices .","In an implementation, a mobile telecommunications device is provided. The mobile telecommunications device comprises a light sensor and a calculation component. Adjustments to at least one of the brightness of a display screen on the mobile telecommunications device and the backlighting of a keypad on the mobile telecommunications device are based on light sensed by the light sensor. The calculation component is configured to receive a light level measurement from the light sensor and generate a photography-related output based on the light level measurement.","In another implementation, a method is provided. The method comprises a mobile device making a light level measurement via a light sensor and the mobile device simulating an incident light meter by generating a photography-related output based on the light level measurement.","While several implementations have been provided in the present disclosure, it should be understood that the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented in many other specific forms without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure. The present examples are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive, and the intention is not to be limited to the details given herein. For example, the various elements or components may be combined or integrated in another system or certain features may be omitted, or not implemented.","Also, techniques, systems, subsystems and methods described and illustrated in the various implementations as discrete or separate may be combined or integrated with other systems, modules, techniques, or methods without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Other items shown or discussed as coupled or directly coupled or communicating with each other may be indirectly coupled or communicating through some interface, device, or intermediate component, whether electrically, mechanically, or otherwise. Other examples of changes, substitutions, and alterations are ascertainable by one skilled in the art and could be made without departing from the spirit and scope disclosed herein."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a more complete understanding of this disclosure, reference is now made to the following brief description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings and detailed description, wherein like reference numerals represent like parts.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
