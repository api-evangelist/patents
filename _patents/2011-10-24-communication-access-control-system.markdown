title: Communication access control system
abstract: A communication access control system includes a messaging service facility and a computing system. The computing system has a permanent memory and hosts a plurality of access control cells (each having an input and an output address); a messaging service to send messages between at least some of the access control cells; and a control service to define a link. The link is selected from a C-link, an F-link, and a Q-link. The C-link connects the output address of a first read-write cell of the access control cells to the input address of a second read-write cell of the access control cells. The F-link connects a forwarder address to the input address of at least one of the access control cells. The Q-link connects the output address of at least one of the access control cells to a queue address.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to a communication access control system.","Distributive computing is a method of computing in which tasks are divided into relatively smaller sub-tasks, which are then distributed across a network of computing devices for simultaneous processing of each sub-task. Distributive computing has been found in a myriad of applications and systems such as, for example, social networking, online digital mapping, video-sharing websites, and advanced collaboration software. However, there is generally a lack of built-in security mechanisms that are implemented when operating these applications.","Access Control Lists (ACL) have been used to provide group security management. An access control list provides a list of authorized entities as well as every object in the system. An access control monitor may look to the list and determine what entities can or cannot access, share or destroy any certain object. Use of this type of group security management requires a reasonable level of expertise, and thus does not offer a simple method to realize messaging control. Furthermore, before consulting the Access Control List (ACL), the access control monitor may need to verify the claimed identity of the entity that sent the access request. This may add additional complexity to the tasks performed by the access control monitor and may increase the amount of effort that needs to be set forth by the access control monitor.","The communication access control system disclosed herein is a cryptographic system that utilizes a set of access control primitives for realizing secure, cryptographic, and capability-based naming, access, and protection. Examples of the system include a trusted central facility which is the security micro-kernel for a distributed message passing system between many clients. The trusted central facility offers a messaging service and a control service that are decentralized so that clients can create and manage groups and group communications without interference from the trusted central facility. The central facility may possess a secret cryptography key which may be stored and used within, for example, a piece of trusted hardware that is connected to the Internet via a suitable server. With this cryptography key, a user may securely pass messages with many other users in real time.","The central facility includes a number of cells which are dynamically created when needed based on a number of cryptographic rules. These cells include an input address IA and an output address OA, both of which are randomized cryptographic numbers. The cell represents a communication capability described by the tuple (IA, OA) such that the output address cannot be computed knowing the input address, and visa versa, without the possession of the secret cryptography key mentioned above. Users or entities in possession of the input address IA can send or write messages to the cell, and entities in possession of the output address OA can receive or read messages from the cell. However, entities in possession of the input address IA without the output address OA cannot receive or read messages from the cell, and entities in possession of the output address OA without the input address IA cannot send or write messages to the cell. In this way, the central facility provides assurances to the users that messages sent to random cells will be dropped without ever being read.","Each cell is a virtual switchboard that users of the central facility may use to virtually connect or disconnect their computing devices. A variety of links may be formed, directly or indirectly, between the cells, thus enabling the formation of groups that contain different users, and in some instances, different devices. Using well defined control messages through the system disclosed herein, one can control the ability of devices to read and\/or write within one or more groups.","Referring now to , a diagram of an example of the communication access control system  is shown. In this example and for purposes of simplicity in illustration, a user\/client  may gain access to the trusted central facility, referred to herein as the messaging service (MS) facility , through a network  using a computing device . As an example, the MS facility  and the computing device  may communicate using XMPP protocol over a secure one-way authenticated channel. In this example, the MS facility has a certified public key that the user\/client trusts. However, the principles set forth herein extend equally to any alternative configurations in which the computing device  may obtain access to the MS facility . In an example, the computing device  may include the MS facility  and thereby allow the user  to directly access the MS facility  through the computing device  without going through the network .","While a single user  and a single computing device  are shown in , it is to be understood that many other users and\/or devices may also gain access to the MS facility  through similar methods. In the group examples disclosed herein (see, e.g., ), at least two users and\/or computing devices gain access to the MS facility  in order to securely read and\/or write messages to the group.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["12","14","14","40","42"]},"The computing device  may be any device that achieves the desired functionality of, at least, sending data to and receiving data from the MS facility . Examples of the computing device  include desktop computers, laptop computers, cell\/smart phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), as well as other computing devices capable of being connected to the network . To achieve its desired functionality, the computing device  includes various hardware components. Such hardware components may include, for example, a processor , a data storage device , peripheral device adapters , a network adapter , an output device , and an input device . These hardware components may be interconnected through the use of a number of busses and\/or network connections. In an example, the processor , data storage device , peripheral device adapters , and network adapter  may be in communication via bus .","The processor  may include the hardware architecture for retrieving executable code (i.e., computer readable instructions) from the data storage device  and executing the executable code. The executable code may, when executed by the processor , cause the processor  to implement at least the functionality of sending data to and receiving data from the MS facility . In the course of executing code, the processor  may receive input from and provide output to a number of the remaining hardware units.","In an example, the computing device , and specifically the processor  may send a query to the MS facility  to obtain an access control cell  (or \u2032 or \u2033 described in reference to , respectively) or to discover link(s) within the system , and when applicable, may share an input address, an output address, or both with other users of the system . The processor  may also receive messages from an access control cell , \u2032, \u2033 or a queue  after the access control cell , \u2032, \u2033 or the queue  has received a message from another user and mechanically computed and forwarded the message to the user .","The data storage device  may store data, such as an access control cell , \u2032, \u2033.  depicts the access control cell , \u2032, \u2033 as being part of the MS facility , but it is to be understood that the access control cell , \u2032, \u2033 may also be stored on the data storage device  of each of the users' computing devices . The data storage device  may store a number of access control cells , \u2032, \u2033. In an example, the data storage device  saves the cells in the form of a database for easy retrieval when the access control cell , \u2032, \u2033 is accessed by the user .","The data storage device  may include various types of memory modules, including volatile and nonvolatile memory. As an example, the data storage device  may include Random Access Memory (RAM), Read Only Memory (ROM), and Hard Disk Drive (HDD) memory. It is believed that other types of memory may also be used. In some instances, different types of memory in the data storage device  may be used for different data storage needs. For example, the processor  may boot from Read Only Memory (ROM), maintain nonvolatile storage in the Hard Disk Drive (HDD) memory, and execute program code stored in Random Access Memory (RAM).","Generally, the data storage device  may be a non-transitory, tangible computer readable storage medium. For example, the data storage device  may be an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, or device, or any suitable combination thereof. More specific examples of the computer readable storage medium may include, for example, the following: a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), an optical storage device, a magnetic storage device, or any suitable combination thereof.","A messaging client application programming interface may be stored on the data storage device . This interface allows the user to access the various services offered through the MS facility  (including access control cell management, group management, access control cell transferability, and user public key management). The interface may include drop menus, drag and drop icons, or other pictorial representations so that users  can easily create groups using the MS facility .","The peripheral device adapter  may provide an interface to the input  and output  devices to create a user interface and\/or access external sources of memory storage. An input device  (e.g., keyboard or keypad, mouse, touchscreen, etc.) may be provided to allow a user to interact with the MS facility . The peripheral device adapter  may also create an interface between the processor  and a printer, a display device, or another output device.","The network adapter  may provide an interface to the network , thereby enabling the transmission of data to and receipt of data from the MS facility . Specifically, the network adapter  may enable the transmission of an access control cell , \u2032, \u2033 or different addresses between the computing device  and the MS facility .","The MS facility  may include a processor  and a data storage device  similar to the processor  and data storage device  within the computing device  previously described. As will be discussed further hereinbelow, the processor  may be used to compute an input address and an output address when appropriate, a forwarder address when appropriate, a queue address when appropriate, and run queries when appropriate. Additionally, the data storage device  may be used to store both a cryptographic key  (also referred to as the system master key K and described further in reference to FIGS.  and A-C) and access control cell(s) , \u2032, \u2033.","The MS facility  also includes a messaging service  and a control service . The messaging service  allows clients  to send messages to one or more other clients. The control service  allows clients  to perform communication control (e.g., read control and\/or write control). These services may be embodied on a single server of the facility  or multiple servers of the facility .","The messaging service  includes at least a forwarder  and a queue , and a set of queries for writing to the forwarder  and reading from the queue . The forwarder  includes computer readable instructions (embedded on a non-transitory, tangible computer readable medium) that copy message(s) received at the forwarder , and transmit the copied message(s) to multiple cells , \u2032, \u2033 that are linked to the forwarder . The forwarder  enables a user  to generate a single message and have it sent to multiple different cells , \u2032, \u2033. The forwarder  is associated with a forwarder address that can be attached to the input address of one or more cells , \u2032, \u2033 of the same or different type. In an example, the forwarder address is a cryptographic number which may be 256-bits long. It is to be understood that the forwarder address may be any sized number, and that larger numbers tend to provide more security. The forwarder  and how it may be used in messaging will be described further hereinbelow.","The queue  includes computer readable instructions (embedded on a non-transitory, tangible computer readable medium) that retrieve messages sent to a cell , \u2032, \u2033 associated with the queue  from one or more cells , \u2032, \u2033 of the same or different type. The queue  enables a user  to retrieve all of his\/her messages that have been sent from multiple different cells , \u2032, \u2033. The queue  involves a push model of messaging, where any connected computing device  linked to the queue  receives incoming messages without having to poll the MS facility . If the linked computing device  is not connected when messages are received, the queue  is programmed to store the messages (e.g., in the data storage device  of the MS facility ). The queue  is associated with a queue address that can be attached to the output address of one or more cells , \u2032, \u2033 of the same or different type. In an example, the queue address is a cryptographic number which may be 256-bits long. It is to be understood that the queue address may be any sized number, and that larger numbers tend to provide more security. The queue  and how it may be used in messaging will be described further hereinbelow.","It is to be understood that the messaging service  does not acknowledge message delivery, but rather may be programmed to send an acknowledgement that the message has been accepted into the system . Whether the message is delivered and to whom is determined by the communication control policies set by the user  and\/or manager of a group using the control service . The control service  defines the links between the cells , \u2032, \u2033, queues , and forwarders , as well as the set of queries for adding, removing and discovering these links.","As indicated in , the access control cell , \u2032, \u2033 is an intricate component of the system .  is a diagram of an example of the access control cell , \u2032, \u2033. In general, the access control cell , \u2032, \u2033 receives an input address from and provides an output address to various users of the system . More specifically, with the input address, a user may have the authority to write messages to the cells  and \u2033, and with the output address, a user may have the authority to read messages written to the cells  and \u2032. In order to allow for interaction with other users, the input address alone or output address alone may be provided to the other users. The interaction among users will be described in more detail in connection with .","The input address and output address may be cryptographic numbers which may be 256-bits long. In an example, the input address and output address are related by a secure permutation such as that defined by a symmetric key encryption algorithm under the effect of the system master key  (see ). In one example, the output address (OA) may be defined by the following equation:\n\nOA=ENC(IA)\u2003\u2003eq. (1)\n","In this equation (eq. (1)), the input address, denoted by the term \u201cIA,\u201d is drawn from a cryptographically secure PseudoRandom Bit Generator (PRBG) and ENC is a symmetric encryption method such as, for example, AES. As such, in some instances, the access control cell  represents a communication capability described by the tuple (IA, OA) such that OA cannot be computed knowing IA and visa versa without the possession of the system master key  denoted in the above formula by the term \u201cK.\u201d As a result, those users alone that possess the input address can send or write messages to the access control cell  and those users alone that possess the output address can receive or read messages from the access control cell .","In other examples, instead of a secret cryptography key, the user  may send a public key (denoted by the letter \u201cY\u201d). With the public key Y, the MS facility  may compute an output address OA or an input address IA using a hash function based on the public key Y. Therefore, the user  may share the public key instead of a cell address, with those users with whom the user  may wish to interact.","Referring now to , different scenarios of the user  obtaining input and\/or output addresses IA, OA for the respective cells , \u2032, \u2033 using the MS facility  are depicted. As will be discussed further in reference to , the access control cells , \u2032, \u2033 may be implemented in a variety of applications to enable group communications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["34","12","14","12","14","12","14","14","34","14","38"],"sub":"256","sup":"13"},"The cell  associated with the randomly generated input and output addresses IA, OA are read-write cells, and thus the user  may use the input address IA to control who may send messages to the cell  and may use the output address OA to control who may read messages sent to the cell .","Once the user  has obtain the randomized input address IA and output address OA, the user  may send the input address IA to another system user. This scenario is not depicted in . With the knowledge of the input address IA, the other user, through an appropriate computing device may send a message containing the input address IA to the access control cell . The access control cell  may then know, through the attached input address IA, that the sender of the message is authorized to have the message sent to the user . As the other user sends the message to the access control cell  along with the input address IA, the MS facility  mechanically computes the output address OA by encrypting the attached input address IA using the system master key K, , i.e. OA=ENC_K(IA). After the MS facility  has converted the input address IA to the output address OA using the system master key K, , the access control cell  may then allow the message to be forwarded onto the user . Therefore, the user  listening for a message containing the specific output address OA will receive and be able to read the message sent by the other user. Indeed, in this way, the user , by sharing the input address IA with those who he or she wishes to receive messages from, may receive those messages in a secure manner.","Once the user  has obtain the randomized input address IA and output address OA, the user  may send the output address OA to another system user.

The access control cell  may then know, through the attached input address IA, that the receiver of the message is authorized to have the message forwarded to them by the user . As the other user receives the message from the access control cell  along with the input address IA, the MS facility  mechanically computes the output address OA by encrypting the attached input address IA using the system master key K, , i.e. OA=ENC_K(IA). Therefore, the system master key K,  is kept secret by the MS facility . After the MS facility  has converted the input address IA to the output address OA using the system master key K, , the access control cell  may then allow the message to be forwarded onto the other user. Therefore, the other user listening for a message containing the specific output address OA will receive and be able to read the message sent by the user . Indeed, in this way, the user , by sharing the output address OA with only those who he or she wishes to send messages to, may send those messages in a secure manner.","The user  may additionally be given the ability to revoke the capability to send or receive messages from individuals without affecting the capability of other users. In an example, the user  may direct the system  to stop receiving messages from cells  having a specific output address OA corresponding to the previously shared input address IA. In another example, the user  may direct the system  to stop sending messages to a cell  having a specific input address IA corresponding to the previously shared output address OA.","It is to be understood that any number of access control cells  may be created by the user  sending a get cell query message, where each cell  contains a different input address IA and corresponding output address OA.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B"],"b":["12","34","34","34","34","12","14","12","14","12","10","12","14","12","12","12"]},"In the scenario depicted in , once the get address query message has been sent, an access control cell \u2032 may be generated, and the output address OA will be computed and sent back to the user . The MS facility  (e.g., via processor ) may first calculate the input address IA by applying the public key to a hash function. The hash function may be any hash function, an example of which includes SHA3, which has a 256-bit output. Additional hash functions may be used. Other suitable hash functions are those that output values having an address size of 256-bits or some other desirable number of bits.","After the input address IA is calculated using the hash function and the public key Y, the output address OA may be calculated using the input address and a read cell secret key K\u2032, \u2032. The secret key K\u2032, \u2032 used for a read cell \u2032 is different from the secret key K,  used for a read write cell . For example, output address OA may be generated by encrypting the input address IA using the read cell master key K\u2032, \u2032. This ensures that only users\/entities with knowledge of the read cell master key K\u2032, \u2032 can compute the output address OA for the R-cell \u2032.","For a read cell \u2032, the user  may share his\/her public key Y so that any user\/entity having the public key Y can compute, using his\/her computing device , the input address IA as the output of the hash function, and write to the cell \u2032 using the input address IA. More particularly, the user\/entity wishing to write to the cell \u2032 may use the user's provided public key Y as the input of the hash function to obtain the input address IA. As stated above, however, only users\/entities with knowledge of the read cell master key K\u2032, \u2032 (e.g., the MS facility ) can compute the output OA for the given read cell \u2032, and thus can control the ability to read from the given read cell \u2032.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 3C","FIG. 3C"],"b":["12","34","34","34","34","34","12","14","12","14","12","10","12","14","12","12","12"]},"In the scenario depicted in , once the get address query message has been sent, an access control cell \u2033 may be generated and the input address IA will be computed and sent back to the user .

The secret key K\u2033, \u2033 used for a write cell \u2033 is different from the secret key K,  used for a read write cell  and from the secret key K\u2032, \u2032 used for a read cell \u2032. It is to be understood that each of the secret keys K,  and K\u2032, \u2032, and K\u2033, \u2033 are independently selected. For example, input address IA may be generated by encrypting the output address OA using the write cell master key K\u2033, \u2033. This ensures that only users\/entities with knowledge of the write cell master key K\u2033, \u2033 can compute the input address IA for the write cell \u2033, and thus control the ability to write to the cell \u2033.","For a write cell \u2033, the user  may share his\/her public key Y so that any user\/entity having the public key Y can compute, using his\/her computing device , the output address OA as the output of the hash function, and read from the cell \u2033 using the output address OA.

Each of the add C-link query and the delete C-link query require the output address OAof the sending cell , A and the input address IAof the receiving cell , B. The user  requesting the addition\/deletion also has to prove ownership of the sending cell , A by providing the input address IAof the cell , A in addition to the output address OA. As such, to make or break a C-link, the query includes ((IA, OA), IA). The C-link is a form of forward linking, at least in part because the user  of the sending cell , A controls the link.","The C-links in the system may also be labeled by the user  creating the link.

Example labels include user-defined labels, system-generated unique random labels (e.g., a pseudo-random number generated from the (OA, IA) tuple using a one-way function), or the username of the user  creating the C-link. Each type of label is designed to cater to specific needs of various applications. If a label is attached to a C-Link, then this label may be appended to all messages passing over this link. Thus, receivers (e.g., cell , B) of the message can know the path information. In some instances however, the C-link is not labeled (e.g., anonymous links).

Generally, users  can send messages either to an associated forwarder  or to the input address IA of a cell (i.e., RW cell  or R cell \u2032 or W cell \u2033). The outputs from a sending RW cell  are transferred to other RW cells, \u2032 and\/or to a queue  linked with the sending RW cell \u2032 and associated with a targeted receiving RW cell . The outputs from a sending R cell \u2032 or W cell \u2033 are transferred to a queue  linked with the sending cell \u2032 or \u2033.

In general, when it is desirable to create a managed group, the manager M needs at least the public key Y of any reader to be added to the group, the public key Y of any writer to be added to the group, the manager's own public key Y, and the manager's own private key.","At the outset of group creation, the manager M obtains a challenge from the MS facility . The challenge is computed at the MS facility  from a secret random number and the current timestamp on the processor . The timestamp may be updated at predetermined intervals, e.g., every 5 minutes, which can be set and changed at the MS facility . The timestamp is included in the challenge to ensure that the creation request is fresh (i.e., not outdated). The manager M signs the challenge with his\/her private key, and then sends the following information to the MS facility  as part of the group creation request: the public keys Y of any readers to be added to the group, the public keys Y of any writers to be added to the group, the manager's own public key Y, any desirable group name and\/or description, the challenge, and the manager's signature on the challenge.","To avoid replay attacks, upon receiving the group creation request and the associated information, the MS facility  verifies that the challenge is current by cross-checking the timestamp in the challenge with the timestamp at the MS facility . The MS facility maintains a timestamp (ts) that is updated every T seconds, where T is an implementation parameter and may be any desirable value (e.g., 10 seconds, 60 seconds, 300 seconds, etc.). If the timestamp within the challenge is current (i.e., matches the timestamp (ts) with the MS facility ), the MS facility  accepts the request and performs multiple tasks in accordance with the request. In an example, the MS facility  will accept a group creation request when the timestamp in the request matches the timestamp at the MS facility . In other words, the creator obtains a challenge and responds to the challenge within the time T specified above, otherwise the request will be deemed non-current and will be rejected.","When the group creation request is accepted, the MS facility  (e.g., via processor ) creates a read-write cell  for the group, which will be referred to as the group cell GC. Since the group cell GC is a read-write cell , the MS facility  also generates a randomized input address IAand a randomized output address OAof the group cell GC. It is to be understood that multiple group cells GC may be generated depending upon the requested structure of the group.","The processor  of the MS facility  then generates a read-write cell  for each writer identified in the request by his\/her public key Y, and a read-write cell  for each reader identified in the request by his\/her public key Y. The cell(s)  generated for the writer(s) is\/are referred to as group write cell(s) GWC, and the cell(s)  generated for the reader(s) is\/are referred to as group read cell(s) GRC. Since each group write cell GWC and each group read cell GRC is a read-write cell , the MS facility  also generates respective randomized input addresses IA, IAand respective randomized output addresses OA, OAof the cells GWC, GRC. It is to be understood that multiple group write and\/or read cells GWC, GRC may be generated depending upon the requested structure of the group.","The processor  also generates a read-write cell for the manager M, which is referred to as a manager cell MC. Since the manager cell MC is a read-write cell , the MS facility  also generates a randomized input address IAand a randomized output address OAof the manager cell MC.","Any group write cell GWC may then be connected with the group cell GC via a C-link so that messages sent to each group write cell GWC (from a writer having the input address IA) are sent to the input address IAof the group cell GC. This C-link connects the output address OAof a group write cell GWC with the input address IAof the group cell GC. Any group read cell GRC may then be connected with the group cell GC via a C-link so that messages coming from the group cell GC will be sent to the input address IAof the group read cell GRC. This C-link connects the output address OAof the group cell GC with the input address IAof group read cell GRC.","As shown in , respective sets of information are sent to potential group writers, potential group readers, and the manager via their respective read cells \u2032 as invitations to join the group. These read cells \u2032 had been generated via the method described in reference to , and the input address IA, IA, IAof the respective read cells \u2032 (i.e., the read cells of reader , writer , and manager M in ) may be computed from the public key Y of the reader, the writer, and the manager, respectively. For example, the input address IAof the reader  may be calculated using the hash function and the reader's public key Y. The information in the invitation sent to any reader may include the output address OAof his\/her corresponding group read cell GRC and auxiliary information (i.e., the public key of the manager, the signature of the manager, and the group name and\/or description). The information in the invitation sent to any writer may include the input address IAof his\/her corresponding group write cell GWC and the auxiliary information. The information in the invitation sent to the manager M may include the input address IAof his\/her corresponding manager cell MC and the auxiliary information.","The MS facility  may save all of the input addresses (e.g., IA, IA, IA) and the group cell GC (including its input and output addresses IA, OA) in the data storage device .","It is assumed that potential group members are a priori listening to the output addresses OA, OA, OAof the respective read cells \u2032, and thus receive the respective invitations on their respective read cells \u2032 when sent by the MS facility . It is to be understood that the MS facility  does not verify the manager's signature. Rather, the signature verification may be accomplished by the potential group members upon receiving the invitation to join the group. The potential group members may use the signature to ensure that the invitation is fresh\/current and to ensure that the request indeed originates from the manager M. Each potential group member can then independently decide whether to join the group or not join the group depending, at least in part, upon whether he\/she trusts the manager M.","Readers may join the group by subscribing the output address OAof their group read cell GRC to their existing data queue , or they may request a data queue  as described above and then subscribe the output address OAof their group read cell GRC to their newly acquired data queue . In other words, the readers may request that a Q-link be formed between the received output address OAand their queue.","Writers may join the group by saving the input address IAof their group write cell GWC and using the input address IAto write to the group when it is desirable.","The manager M may use the input address IAof the manager cell MC to edit membership of the group. In some examples disclosed herein, the management cell MC may not be used for routing and\/or messaging, but rather the input address IAis used as a common secret between the MS facility  and the manager M. This allows the manager M to edit the group (i.e., add members, delete members, and\/or destroy the group). The manager M uses the secret input address IAof his\/her manager cell MC to request that a change be made to the group. Upon receiving the edit request, the MS facility  checks that the requesting entity has the correct capability (i.e., the input address IAof his\/her manager cell MC). In order to add member(s) to the group, the manager M first obtains a challenge from the MS facility  (similar to when creating the group) and attach his\/her signature on the add request. This ensures that each added member can independently authenticate the manager M and decide if he\/she wants to join the group. In order to remove member(s) or to destroy the group, no such challenge is required by the MS facility . In some other examples disclosed herein, the management cell MC may also or alternatively be used for routing and\/or messaging.","Referring now to , an example of a managed group formed using the method described in reference to  is depicted. In this example, the group includes a single group cell GC, three writers W, W, and W, and two readers Rand R. While not shown, it is to be understood that each of the writers W, W, and Whas a computing device that enables the writers W, W, and Wto interact with the MS facility  and write to the group cell GC. Also while not shown, it is to be understood that each of the readers Rand Rhas a computing device that enables the readers Rand Rto interact with the MS facility  and read messages from the group cell GC.","Upon accepting his\/her invitation to the group shown in , each of the writers W, W, and Wreceives his\/her respective group write cell input address IA, IA, and IA. As such, the first writer Wmay transmit a message to his\/her group write cell GWC1, and because this group write cell GWC1 has been C-linked to the group cell GC (e.g., by the manager M during group creation), the message will be transmitted to the group cell GC. Similarly, any messages written by the second and third writers W, and Wto his\/her group write cell GWC2 and GWC3 will be transmitted to the group cell GC.","Upon accepting his\/her invitation to the group shown in , each of the readers Rand Rreceives his\/her respective group read cell output address OAand OA. As described above, the readers Rand Rlink their respective queues (e.g., queue Rand queue R) to their respective group read cell output address OAand OA. Since the group read cells GRC1 and GRC2 have been C-linked to the group cell GC (e.g., by the manager M during group creation), the messages received by the group cell GC will be forwarded to the respective read cells GRC1 and GRC2 and the linked queues of Rand R.","In the example shown in , all messages sent by writers W, W, and Ware received by readers Rand R.","It is to be understood that multiple groups may interact with one another. In these instances, different group managers may work together to create the groups and to control the communications within the groups. An example of multiple interacting groups is shown in .","In the example shown in , two overlapping groups (group 1 and group 2) are in communication using the MS facility . There are four group members GM, GM, GM, and GM. Group members GMand GMare part of the first group and are both writers and readers within the first group. Group members GMand GMare part of the second group, where group member GMis a writer and group member GMis a reader of that group. It is to be understood that group member GMis also a reader of the first group by virtue of a group cell that is shared by the groups (i.e., GC). This will be described further hereinbelow.","While not shown in , it is to be understood that each of the group members GM, GM, GM, and GMhas a computing device that respectively enables i) the writers GM, GMto interact with the MS facility  and write to the first group cell GC1, ii) the readers GM, GMto interact with the MS facility  and read from the first group cell GC1, iii) the writer GMto interact with the MS facility  and write to the second group cell GC2, and iv) the reader GMto interact with the MS facility  and read from the second group cell GC2.","Within the first group, upon accepting his\/her invitation to the first group, each of the group members GMand GMreceives his\/her respective group write cell input address IA, IA2, and his\/her respective group read cell output address OA, OA. As such, in an example, the group member GMmay transmit a message to his\/her group write cell GWC1, and because this group write cell GWC1 has been C-linked to the first group cell GC1 (e.g., by a first manager during first group creation), the message will be transmitted to the first group cell GC1. Similarly, any messages written by the second group member GMto his\/her group write cell GWC2 will be transmitted to the first group cell GC1. Furthermore, since the first group read cells GRC1 and GRC2 have been C-linked to the first group cell GC1 (e.g., by the first manager during first group creation), the messages received by the group cell GC1 will be forwarded to the respective read cells GRC1 and GRC2 and the linked queues of group members GMand GM.","In this example, managers of the respective groups may work together to determine how to link the groups in a desirable manner (e.g., who from the second group can read from the first group, etc.). In the example shown in , the groups 1 and 2 are linked by a shared group cell GC, which is respectively C-linked to each of the first group cell GC1 and the second group cell GC2. As such, any messages received by the first group cell GC1 will be forwarded to the shared group cell GCand then forwarded from the shared group cell GCto the second group cell GC2.","Within group 2, upon accepting his\/her invitation to join the second group, the group member GMreceives his\/her group write cell input address IA3. As such, the group member GMmay transmit a message to his\/her group write cell GWC3, and because this group write cell GWC3 has been C-linked to the second group cell GC2 (e.g., by the second manager during second group creation), the message will be transmitted to the second group cell GC2. Also within group 2, upon accepting his\/her invitation to join the second group, the group member GMreceives his\/her group read cell output address OA. As described above, the group member GMmay link his\/her respective queue (e.g., queue GM) to his\/her group read cell output address OA. Since the group read cells GRC4 has been C-linked to the second group cell GC2 (e.g., by the second manager M2 during second group creation), any messages received by the second group cell GC2 will be forwarded to the read cell GRC4 and the linked queue of GM.","In the example shown in , all messages sent by group members GMand GMare received by group members GM, GMand GM, and all messages sent by group member GMare received by group member GM.","The groups shown in , writer(s) are allowed to write messages, reader(s) are allowed to read messages, and manager(s) are allowed to edit the groups.
