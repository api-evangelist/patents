title: Systems and methods for generating document distribution confirmation sheets with multi-destination status and/or multi-service status information
abstract: Confirmation sheets would be more useful if they provided status information for each service, for each destination or recipient and/or images of each page of a multi-service and/or multi-destination job. A confirmation sheet provides the status of multi-destination and/or multi-service document distribution jobs. The services that can be included in a multi-service document distribution job include sending the documents as a facsimile, scanning the documents to a file or to a file repository, e-mailing the documents to an individual or other address, and/or printing the documents. Thumbnail images of one or more pages of the multi-destination and/or multi-service job can also be included on the confirmation sheet. In various exemplary embodiments, when elements of a multi-destination or multi-service job are not completed at the time the confirmation sheet is requested, the confirmation sheet can include various structures or information usable to obtain job status at a later time.

Field of Invention","This invention is directed to the systems and methods for generating document distribution confirmation sheets.","2. Description of Related Art","Confirmation sheets are routinely used to provide status for document distribution jobs. Many existing document distribution systems can distribute documents to multiple destinations and can include multiple services, such as faxing, copying by sending to a printer, scan-to-file and scan-to-repository. Currently, confirmation sheets are presently used that may include an overall general job status. However, the overall job status report does not individually identify which recipients may or may not have received the job if the entire distribution job was not successful.","Present confirmation sheets also contain general job parameters such as submittal time and originating user and\/or device. Job settings and information about the input document\u2014such as file type\u2014or image specifications\u2014such as resolution, contrast and sharpness\u2014are often on current confirmation sheets. Current job information also often includes length or size of the job and whether is two-sided. Some existing confirmation sheets also provide a reduced image of the first page of the job is included.","Currently, typical confirmation sheets include a general job status and a reduced image of the first page of the job. This may be sufficient for a job comprising a single service and a single destination or recipient. The confirmation sheet would be more useful if it provided status information for each service, for each destination or recipient and\/or images of each page of a multi-service and\/or multi-destination job.","This invention provides systems and methods that provide specific status on each destination and\/or recipient of a multiple service and\/or multiple destination job.","This invention separately provides systems and methods that provide specific status on each destination and\/or recipient of mixed destination types.","This invention separately provides systems and methods that provide specific status information on each service of a multiple-service job.","This invention separately provides systems and methods for generating an updated confirmation sheet at a later time.","This invention separately provides systems and methods that generate a network address usable to access updated information for the information contained in the confirmation sheet.","This invention separately provides systems and methods that generate a FLOWPORT glyph usable to access the updated information for the information contained in the confirmation sheet.","This invention separately provides systems and methods that generate a thumbnail image on the confirmation sheet of one or more pages of the job.","In various exemplary embodiments, the systems and methods according to this invention generate a confirmation sheet that provides the status of multi-destination and\/or multi-service document distribution jobs. The services that can be included in a multi-service document distribution job include sending the documents as a facsimile, scanning the documents to a file or to a file repository, e-mailing the documents to an individual or other address, and\/or printing the documents.","In various exemplary embodiments, thumbnail images of one or more pages of the multi-destination and\/or multi-service job are included on the confirmation sheet. In various exemplary embodiments, when elements of a multi-destination or multi-service job are not completed at the time the confirmation sheet is requested, the confirmation sheet can include various means to obtain job status at a later time.","These and other features and advantages of this invention are described in, or are apparent from, the following detailed description of various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention.","The following detailed description of various exemplary embodiments of the confirmation sheets, systems and methods according to this invention describes the confirmation sheets, systems and methods relative to both multi-destination\/multi-service status information and thumbnail images. However, it should be appreciated that the confirmation sheets, systems and methods according to this invention can include or implement only the multi-destination\/multi-service status information, independently of the thumbnail images.","The systems and methods according to this invention generate a confirmation sheet that provides the status of multi-destination and\/or multi-service document distribution jobs. The services that can be included in a multi-service document distribution job include sending the documents as a facsimile, scanning the documents to a file or to a file repository, e-mailing the documents to an individual or other address, and\/or printing the documents. However, it should be appreciated that any other known or later-developed service can be included in the list of implemented services.","Distribution information is organized by service and by the status of the job relative to each intended destination. In general, scan and job information found in current confirmation sheets will be included. However, it should be appreciated that any set or subset of information may be omitted in a particular implementation. In addition to destination and\/or recipient information, various exemplary embodiments of the confirmation sheet can also include thumbnail images of any one or more of the pages in the document distribution job.","In situations where elements of a multi-destination or multi-service job are not completed at the time the confirmation sheet is requested, the confirmation sheet can include various means to obtain updated job status at a later time. Two exemplary embodiments for providing access to an updated confirmation sheet at a later time are providing a network address and providing a FLOWPORT glyph.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1000","1000","1100","1100","1110","1120","1200","1300"]},"A FLOWPORT glyph  is a pattern that is recognized by a scanner and that identifies the document distribution job. By placing the original confirmation sheet in a scanner, a request for an updated confirmation sheet can be automatically generated by scanning, recognizing and acting on the FLOWPORT glyph . A status update address  is a network address at which an update of the information contained in the confirmation sheet can be viewed, and, in various exemplary embodiments, from which an updated confirmation sheet can be downloaded and\/or printed. One exemplary embodiment of this address is a web URL. It should be appreciated that any known or later-developed network addressing system or method can be used when implementing the status update address . It should be appreciated that only one of the FLOWPORT glyph  and the status update address  need be used and then only if one or more of the selected services and\/or destinations or recipients was not completed.","A multi-destination status portion  provides status information for each service, for each destination and\/or for recipient of the document distribution job. It should be appreciated that the multi-destination status portion  may be omitted or reduced if only a single service to a single destination or recipient is used. A thumbnail images portion  provides thumbnail images of one or more requested pages of the document distribution job. It should be appreciated that, if no pages for which thumbnail images are desired are identified, the thumbnail images portion  can be omitted.
