No. 10\/407,385, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,132,188, filed on Apr. 4, 2003, entitled \u201cFuel Cells and Fuel Cell Catalysts\u201d, which in turn claims priority benefits from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/369,992, filed Apr. 4, 2002. This application also claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/519,095, filed on Nov. 12, 2003. The '385, '992 and '095 applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","This invention was made with Government assistance under Department of Energy Grant No. DEGF-02-99ER14993. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates generally to fuel cells and catalysts for fuel cells. In particular, the present invention relates to electrocatalysts for direct fluid feed fuel cells, and especially direct formic acid feed fuel cells.","Fuel cells are electrochemical cells in which a free energy change resulting from a fuel oxidation reaction is converted into electrical energy. Applications for fuel cells include battery replacement, mini- and microelectronics, automotive engines and other transportation power generators, power plants, and many others. One advantage of fuel cells is that they are substantially pollution-free.","In hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen gas is oxidized to form water, with a useful electrical current produced as a byproduct of the oxidation reaction. A solid polymer membrane electrolyte layer can be employed to separate the hydrogen fuel from the oxygen. The anode and cathode are arranged on opposite faces of the membrane. Electron flow along the electrical connection between the anode and the cathode provides electrical power to load(s) interposed in circuit with the electrical connection between the anode and the cathode. Hydrogen fuel cells are impractical for many applications, however, because of difficulties related to storing and handling hydrogen gas.","Organic fuel cells may prove useful in many applications as an alternative to hydrogen fuel cells. In an organic fuel cell, an organic fuel such as methanol is oxidized to carbon dioxide at an anode, while air or oxygen is simultaneously reduced to water at a cathode. One advantage over hydrogen fuel cells is that organic\/air fuel cells can be operated with a liquid organic fuel. This diminishes or eliminates problems associated with hydrogen gas handling and storage. Some organic fuel cells require initial conversion of the organic fuel to hydrogen gas by a reformer. These are referred to as \u201cindirect\u201d fuel cells. The need for a reformer increases cell size, cost, complexity, and start up time. Other types of organic fuel cells, called \u201cdirect,\u201d eliminate these disadvantages by directly oxidizing the organic fuel without conversion to hydrogen gas. To date, fuels employed in direct organic fuel cell development methanol and other alcohols, as well as formic acid and other simple acids.","Conventional direct fuel cells have unresolved problems related to the electro-oxidation reaction promoted by the anode. For example, an intermediate produced during the oxidation\/reduction reaction in the existing fuel cells is poisonous carbon monoxide gas. Hazards are thus presented. Also, CO is known to poison catalysts. especially platinum (Pt) based catalysts and to thereby decrease cell efficiency.","Other metals or metal combinations have been employed as anode catalysts, such as platinum-palladium (PtPd) and platinum-ruthenium (PtRu). These combinations, however, have not solved the problem of CO poisoning the catalysts.","A further problem is that power levels in direct organic fuel cells have not previously been sufficient to run many commonly-used devices.","The present fuel cells, which employ palladium-based electrocatalysts, overcome one or more of these and other problems unresolved in the field.","In one embodiment, a direct organic fuel cell comprises:\n\n","In a preferred embodiment, the fluid fuel comprises at least 3 M formic acid, the electrolyte is an ion exchange membrane, preferably a proton exchange membrane, most preferably a perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer. The electrolyte is preferably selected from the group comprising porous silicon, ruthenium oxide, and acid electrolytes.","In a preferred embodiment, the anode catalyst comprises palladium nanoparticles having at least one of: (a) a diameter of less than about 15 nm, and (b) a radius of curvature less than about 7.5 nm. More preferably, the anode catalyst comprises palladium nanoparticles having at least one of: (a) a diameter of less than about 10 nm, and (b) a radius of curvature less than about 5 nm. Most preferably, the anode catalyst comprises palladium nanoparticles, the nanoparticles having at least one of: (a) a diameter of less than about 6 nm, and (b) a radius of curvature less than about 3 nm.","In a preferred embodiment, the anode catalyst comprises palladium nanoparticles with a surface area of at least about 5 m\/g, more preferably at least about 23 m\/g, and most preferably at least about 40 m\/g.","In a preferred embodiment, the present direct organic fuel cell is capable of generating a power density of at least about 150 mW\/cmwhen operating at about 21\u00b0 C., more preferably, at least about 270 mW\/cm. The present direct organic fuel cell is capable of generating an open circuit voltage of at least about 0.8 V. The present anode catalyst is configured to promote reaction of the formic acid via a direct path that diminishes formation of a CO intermediate.","In another embodiment, an electro-oxidation catalyst for a direct organic acid fuel cell comprises palladium nanoparticles. The catalyst is preferably associated with an anode, and is preferably deposited on the surface of an anode.","The electrocatalyst in a further embodiment of the present direct organic fuel cell consists essentially of palladium nanoparticles.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 5","sub":["2","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 6","sub":["50","50 ","2","4","50","50 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"The schematic of  shows an exemplary direct organic fuel cell generally at . The fuel cell  includes an anode , a solid polymer electrolyte , and a gas diffusion cathode . The anode  is enclosed in an anode enclosure , while the cathode  is enclosed in a cathode enclosure . When an electrical load (not shown) is connected between the anode  and cathode  via an electrical linkage , electro-oxidation of an organic fuel occurs at the anode  and electro-reduction of an oxidant occurs at the cathode . Oxidants can include, but are not limited to, air, oxygen, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen peroxide, and potassium permanganate.","The occurrence of different reactions at the anode  and cathode  gives rise to a voltage difference between the two electrodes. Electrons generated by electro-oxidation at the anode  are conducted through the linkage  and are ultimately captured at the cathode . Hydrogen ions or protons generated at the anode  are transported across the membrane electrolyte  to the cathode . Thus, a flow of current is sustained by a flow of ions through the cell and electrons through the linkage . This current can be exploited to power an electrical device, for instance.","The anode , solid polymer electrolyte , and cathode  are preferably a single multi-layer composite structure commonly referred to as a membrane electrode assembly (\u201cMEA\u201d). Preferably the solid polymer electrolyte  is a proton-conducting cation exchange membrane that contains an anionic sulfate, such as the perfluorinated sulfonic acid polymer membrane commercially available under the registered trademark NAFION from DuPont Chemical Co., Delaware. NAFION is a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and perfluorovinylether sulfonic acid. Other membrane materials can also be employed, with examples including membranes of modified perfluorinated sulfonic acid polymer, polyhydrocarbon sulfonic acid, membranes containing other acidic ligands and composites of two or more kinds of proton exchange membranes.","Each of the anode  and the cathode  includes a catalyst layer with an example being fine palladium particles either supported or unsupported. When employing a preferred unitary MEA, the anode  and cathode  can consist of catalyst layers directly applied to opposite sides of the NAFION membrane. NAFION is available in standard thicknesses that include 0.002 in. and 0.007 in. A unitary MEA can be fabricated by directly applying or painting anode and cathode catalyst inks onto opposing surfaces of the membrane . When the catalyst ink dries, solid catalyst particles adhere to the membrane  to form the anode  and the cathode .","If the catalyst is to be supported, a suitable support includes fine carbon particles or high surface area carbon sheeting that makes electrical contact with the particles of the electrocatalyst. By way of particular example, the anode  can be formed by mixing electrocatalyst materials such as a metal with a binder such as NAFION, and spread on carbon backing paper. The backing paper can then be attached to a surface of the NAFION membrane . The cathode electrocatalyst alloy and the carbon fiber backing may contain TEFLON to provide hydrophobicity to create a three-phase boundary and to achieve efficient removal of water produced by electro-reduction of oxygen. The cathode catalyst backing is attached to the surface of the NAFION electrolyte membrane  opposite of the anode .","Exemplary fuel cell  employs a formic acid solution as the fluid fuel stream, although other organic fuels are contemplated. The formic acid fuel is supplied to the anode enclosure , while an oxidant such as air or higher concentrated Ois supplied to the cathode enclosure . At the anode  the formic acid fuel is oxidized:\n\nHCOOH\u21922H+CO+2\u2003\u2003(Rxn. 1).\n","The COproduct flows out of the chamber via a gas removal port .","The H product of Rxn. 1 passes through the polymer electrolyte layer  to the cathode , and the free electron 2e product flows through the electrical linkage  to the cathode . At the cathode  the reduction reaction occurs:\n\nO+2+2H\u21922HO\u2003\u2003(Rxn. 2).\n","The HO product flows out of the cathode enclosure  via a removal port . Pumps or other means can be provided to drive the flow of the formic acid fuel and of the air\/O.","It has been discovered that use of a formic acid fuel for oxidation at the anode  provides many advantages. Formic acid is a relatively strong electrolyte and thus facilitates good proton transport within the anode enclosure . Formic acid has a relatively low vapor pressure, and remains in liquid state at room temperature. Also, the present formic acid\/oxygen fuel cells have a high theoretical open circuit potential or emf of about 1.45 V.","In another embodiment, anode catalysts for use with direct organic fuel cells include palladium nanoparticles. In this context, palladium nanoparticles are defined as particles that are more than 90% by weight of palladium, on a transition metal basis. In other words, the weight of inert materials, such as a carbon supporting material, would be ignored. Palladium nanoparticles also have at least one of the following attributes: (a) an average diameter of less than 1000 nm, and\/or (b) a surface area greater than 0.1 m\/g. Preferably, the present electro-oxidation catalysts include substantially pure palladium nanoparticles with a surface area of above about 23 m\/g. More preferably, the present electro-oxidation catalysts include substantially pure palladium nanoparticles with a surface area of above about 40 m\/g. Preferably, the palladium nanoparticles have a diameter of less than about 15 nm. More preferably, the palladium nanoparticles have a diameter less than about 10 nm. Most preferably, the palladium nanoparticles have a diameter of about 6 nm.","The present catalysts have been discovered to be particularly advantageous when employed with the present formic acid fuel cells because it is believed the palladium nanoparticle catalyst promotes direct formic acid oxidation and prevents poisoning of the catalyst with carbon monoxide (CO) while providing increased current and voltage efficiency. In the present application, formic acid is defined as including formic acid and its formate derivatives, including, but not limited to, formate salts, formate esters, and other formate compounds.","Formic acid oxidation is believed to occur primarily through two parallel reaction pathways in the presence of a metal catalyst such as palladium or platinum. One is via a dehydration mechanism that forms CO as an intermediate:\n\nHCOOH+M\u2192M-CO+HO\u2003\u2003(Rxn. 3).\n\nHO+M\u2192M-OH+H\u2003\u2003(Rxn. 4).\n\nM-CO+M-OH\u21922M+CO+H\u2003\u2003(Rxn. 5).\n","Formic acid adsorbs onto the metal catalyst surface (M), forming an intermediate adsorbed CO species (Rxn. 3). An adsorbed OH group (formed in Rxn. 4) is then required to further oxidize the adsorbed CO intermediate into gaseous CO(Rxn. 5).","The second pathway is more direct, and follows a dehydrogenation mechanism:\n\nHCOOH+M\u2192CO+M+2H+2\u2003\u2003(Rxn. 6).\n","This reaction path forms the product COdirectly and circumvents the adsorbed CO intermediate poisoning step with the result that substantially no CO intermediate is formed. This direct pathway has the advantage that less of the catalyst is poisoned by CO, so less catalyst is needed in the fuel cell  for high current densities to be obtained.","This direct reaction path also enhances the overall reaction rate, especially at lower anode potentials where surface hydroxide groups are not available on the catalyst.","Finally, in addition to poisoning the catalyst, CO formation is generally undesirable due to its poisonous nature. It is believed that the preferred palladium nanoparticle catalyst promotes Rxn. 6 without promoting Rxn. 3. Thus, use of the preferred palladium nanoparticle catalyst overcomes problems from CO formation associated with prior art fuel cells and catalysts.","A further advantage of the present catalysts is that palladium nanoparticle catalysts exhibit higher catalyst activity and higher voltage efficiency, allowing fuel cells to be made that run at a higher voltage with lower cost. In addition, palladium is less expensive than previously employed catalysts such as platinum, platinum-palladium, or platinum-ruthenium.","In order to best illustrate its various aspects, an embodiment of the present fuel cell was operated using varying fuel concentrations. The performance of this exemplary cell and catalyst is discussed below.","Exemplary Fuel Cell 1","The first exemplary fuel cell is generally consistent with the fuel cell  shown in . Element numbers from that fuel cell will be used where appropriate for convenience. The anode  formulation was a composite containing about 85% by weight palladium anode catalyst and recast NAFION ionomer. An in-house developmental sample of the Pd nanoparticle catalyst, an Alfa-Aesar #00659 Pd nanoparticle catalyst, or an Aldrich #20,583-4 finely comminuted Pd nanoparticle catalyst with a surface area of about 40 m\/g was employed. Where the performance of the new composite material reported here has been compared to that of a commercial PtRu black catalyst, the PtRu black catalyst is obtained from Johnson Matthey, UK. The cathode catalyst employed was an unsupported Pt black catalyst obtained from Johnson Matthey, UK, and is designated Hispec 1000. The exemplary fuel cell's membrane electrode assembly (MEA), including an anode , a NAFION electrolyte membrane , and a cathode  was fabricated using a direct paint technique to apply catalyst layers  and  to NAFION membrane .","A colloid-aided chemical reduction method was employed to make the present exemplary palladium nanoparticle catalyst. The multi-step procedure included (1) forming a silica colloid, (2) adding a reducing agent solution (namely, sodium formate) and a metal precursor solution (namely, palladium nitrate) into the colloid, (3) forming palladium nanoparticles on the nano-scaled silica surface, and (4) etching the silica surface to collect the catalyst particles.","The anode and cathode catalyst inks were prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of catalyst powders with 5% recast NAFION solution (1100OEW, Solution Technology, Inc., USA). Both the anode and cathode inks were applied onto either side of a NAFION 115 membrane, which was fixed on a vacuum table. Ink application was typically performed at 60\u00b0 C., after which the membrane was thermally cured at 80\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes. The resulting multi-layer MEA forms the anode , the electrolyte membrane , and the cathode .","The effective composition of unsupported anode catalyst was 85% by weight of Pd nanoparticles and 15% by weight of recast NAFION. When the present electro-oxidation catalyst is compared to a PtRu anode catalyst, the effective composition is 85% by weight PtRu and 15% by weight recast NAFION. The anode catalysts employed had a loading of about 10 mg\/cm. The geometric surface area of the MEAs employed in this work was 5 cm. The optimized cathode ink formulation was approximately 90% by weight Pt black and 10% by weight NAFION. The cathode catalyst employed had a standard loading of about 8 mg\/cm.","The anode of the MEAs was cleaned by cycling potential between 0.1 and 1.2 V. The MEAs were conditioned in a fuel cell. Once no further change in cell performance and resistance was observed with time, the conditioning was ended.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"As illustrated by , the open circuit voltage for the exemplary formic acid\/air fuel cell was at least 0.8 V, nominally about 0.9 V. At 0.1 A\/cm, the cell voltage was above 0.75 V, which corresponds to a significantly high voltage efficiency of 54%. A maximum power density of about 270 mW\/cmwas observed at 0.4 V. Compared with the performance of fuel cells employing well-accepted Pt\u2014Ru anode catalysts, a palladium nanoparticle catalyst provides much better performance of fuel cells over the entire range of current densities. Direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFC) with a palladium nanoparticle catalyst outperformed the one with a PtRu anode catalyst by more than 237% (or 3.4 times) in the maximum power density, and outperformed the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) with a PtRu anode catalyst by more than 440% (or 5.4 times). Palladium, however, is not a good anode catalyst for methanol oxidation.

The reaction rate constant for the mechanism including the CO intermediate (Rxns. 3, 4, and 5) is clearly temperature dependent as the sluggish CO oxidation has a high activation energy.

Eight days later, the MEA was tested again under the identical conditions. The result was represented by the empty square plot in .

The advantages offered over prior art fuel cells can be of particular utility in mini- or microelectronic device applications. The open cell voltage of a formic acid fuel cell is higher than that of the prior art fuel cells, so power management is easier. The voltage efficiency of the present formic acid fuel cell is also higher than that of prior art fuel cells. The higher open cell voltage and voltage efficiency mean that the present formic acid fuel cells can be employed to power a wider range of devices than the existing organic fuel cells.","The higher open cell voltage and voltage efficiency are possible in part because palladium nanoparticle catalysts selectively employ the direct method of converting formic acid to water, carbon dioxide, and electricity without the production of CO intermediate. This selection of the direct mechanism means less poisoning of the catalyst by CO, and therefore better catalyst performance.","In addition, achieving a higher open cell voltage and voltage efficiency is more cost effective in the present formic acid fuel cell because palladium catalysts are generally less expensive than platinum-containing catalysts.","It will be appreciated that because of the relatively low potential of a single formic acid fuel cell, these and other applications can include a plurality of fuel cells such as the fuel cell  in series.","While particular elements, embodiments and applications of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be understood, of course, that the invention is not limited thereto since modifications can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present disclosure, particularly in light of the foregoing teachings."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
