Embodiment","3. Modifications"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to a technology for transmitting data from an on-vehicle apparatus used for a vehicle.","2. Description of the Background Art","On-vehicle apparatuses, such as car navigation apparatus, used for vehicles to display maps have been conventionally known. There is a case where a driver cannot use a function of the on-vehicle apparatus such as route guidance while a fellow passenger other than the driver of the vehicle is looking at, for example, a map of an area around a current location of the vehicle or a map of an area through which the vehicle will go.","However, given convenience for both the diver and the fellow passenger, it is preferable that the fellow passenger can look at information such as a map without preventing the driver from using a function of the on-vehicle apparatus.","A technology that connects an on-vehicle apparatus to a portable device has been proposed as a technology that solves the problem. Such a technology connects the on-vehicle apparatus to the portable device by near field communication and transmits a map from the on-vehicle apparatus to the portable device if necessary. As a result, the map is displayed on a display of the portable device.","However, when the conventional technology is used, the map displayed on the on-vehicle apparatus is displayed on the portable device in a same style. The map is displayed on the portable device in the style designed to be looked at by a driver who is driving. Therefore, the map is not always preferable for the fellow passenger.","According to one aspect of the invention, an on-vehicle apparatus used in a vehicle includes: a storage part that stores first map data having a simplified content as compared to second map data used for route guidance; an image generator that generates a map image based on the first map data; and a transmitter that transmits the map image to a portable device in response to a demand from the portable device that is a communication partner of the on-vehicle apparatus.","Since the map image based on the first map data having the simplified content as compared to the second map data is transmitted to the portable device, a fellow passenger who carries the portable device can look at a more preferable map for him\/her.","According to another aspect of the invention, the on-vehicle apparatus further includes: a receiver that receives from the portable device destination information specifying a destination of the vehicle; and a guidance part that executes the route guidance leading to the destination specified by the destination information.","The destination of the route guidance executed by the on-vehicle apparatus can be specified from the portable device.","According to another aspect of the invention, the on-vehicle apparatus further includes a data generator that generates the first map data based on the second map data.","Since the first map data is generated based on the second map data, there is no need to prepare the first map data separately from the second map data, and cost of the on-vehicle apparatus can be reduced.","Therefore, the object of this invention is to provide a preferable map for a fellow passenger to a portable device carried by the fellow passenger.","These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Referring to the accompanying drawings, an embodiment of an on-vehicle apparatus related to the invention is explained hereinbelow in detail. Prior to the detailed explanation of the embodiment, an outline of the on-vehicle apparatus is first explained referring to .  illustrates the outline of an on-vehicle apparatus . The on-vehicle apparatus  is used on a vehicle .","As shown in , the on-vehicle apparatus  includes a simplified map database  that stores simplified map data . The simplified map data  is map data generated by omitting a part of element data included in original map data . The on-vehicle apparatus  transmits a map image generated based on the simplified map data , to a portable device  that is a communication partner of the on-vehicle apparatus .","The original map data  is map data (mainly vector data) used to generate the map image designed to be looked at by a driver while driving. The original map data  includes various element data, such as road data, facility data and icons image data, used for generating the map image. The original map data  is prepared on each of various scales. The map images on different scales can be displayed on a display  by using the original map data , and comfortable route guidance can be provided to the driver.","However, the map image displayed on a display  of the on-vehicle apparatus  for the route guidance is not always displayed in a style easy for a fellow passenger to look at. In other words, the fellow passenger does not need, in many cases, a detailed map like a map used for the route guidance, and an easy-to-understand or enjoyable map is preferable for the fellow passenger.","In the on-vehicle apparatus , the simplified map data  of which a content is simplified as compared to the original map data  used for the route guidance is stored beforehand in the simplified map database  (a step ). The on-vehicle apparatus  can provide an easy-to-understand or enjoyable map to the fellow passenger by generating the map image to be provided to the portable device , based on the simplified map data . Moreover, the simplified map data  is generated by omitting a part of the element data included in the original map data  (a step ). Therefore, cost of the on-vehicle apparatus  can be reduced because there is no need to prepare the original map data  and the simplified map data  individually.","Next described are examples of a method for generating the simplified map data . First, from amongst the original map data  prepared on individual scales, the original map data  on a scale preferable to be displayed on the portable device  is selected.","Next, a part of the element data included in the original map data  on the scale selected (hereinafter referred to as \u201cselected map data\u201d) is eliminated. For example, traffic light data included in the road data and POT data included in the facility data are eliminated.","Next, a part of contents of the element data remaining and included in the selected map data is changed. For example, a font type of text data or\/and a language type of the text data included in the selected map data is changed to a different type of the text data. Moreover, for example, a part of various facility icons included in the selected map data are changed to facility icons enjoyable for the fellow passenger. Furthermore, a part of the facility icons unimportant to the fellow passenger are eliminated. The simplified map data  generated in such a manner is registered in the simplified map database .","Thus, the simplified map data  is generated by omitting a part of the element data included in the original map data . Therefore, it is possible to prevent a large increase in cost of the on-vehicle apparatus . Moreover, since the simplified map data  is generated based on the original map data  on one scale, a data volume of the simplified map database  can be significantly reduced as compared to a database including the original map data  on various scales.","Since the simplified map data  is generated by eliminating a part of the element data such as the POI data, when a map based on the simplified map data  is displayed, an amount of information provided to a user can be reduced. Therefore, an easy-to-understand map can be provided to the fellow passenger. Moreover, icons such as the facility icons and the language type and the font type of the text data are changed to be friendlier to the fellow passenger. Therefore, the on-vehicle apparatus  can provide a map more enjoyable for the fellow passenger.","For example, when the fellow passenger is a child, the on-vehicle apparatus  can display a map that shows a same area as a map at which the driver looks and that is indicated with illustrations or the like, for easy understanding even for children, on the portable device  such as a game console carried by the fellow passenger. As a result, the map is easier for the fellow passenger to understand and communication between the driver and the fellow passenger can be promoted. Moreover, in this case, a part of the map (e.g. icons) may be shown in animation.","Moreover, when the mother tongue (a first language) of the driver is different from the mother tongue (a second language) of the fellow passenger, a map having the text data in the second language changed from the first language can be displayed on the portable device  carried by the fellow passenger. As a result, since the map is easier for the fellow passenger to understand, communication between the driver and the fellow passenger can be promoted. For example, when the first language is Japanese and the second language is Chinese, Japanese text data is displayed on the map on the on-vehicle apparatus  at which the driver looks, and Chinese text data is displayed on the map on the portable device  at which the fellow passenger looks.","When the fellow passenger is an elderly person, a map having the text data of which font type has been changed to be easily recognizable (in a large font size, etc.) to the fellow passenger can be displayed on the portable device  carried by the fellow passenger. As a result, since the map is easier for the fellow passenger to understand, communication between the driver and the fellow passenger can be promoted.","The aforementioned are examples of the method for generating the simplified map data . However, out of the element data included in the original map data , element data to be omitted or to be changed may be different from the element data described in the aforementioned examples. As a result, various types of the simplified map data  can be generated.","For example, road data of a road of which width is narrow, 3-D data, etc. may be omitted. Background color data that determines color shade of the map image generated based on the simplified map data , may be changed.","As shown in , the simplified map data  generated is converted to the map image by an image generator  (a step ). The map image is, for example, raster data and compressed in a predetermined compression technology to reduce data volume of the map image. A widely-known technology, such as JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) and PIC, is used for the compression.","In response to a demand from the portable device , the image generator  retrieves the simplified map data  of a necessary area (an area around a location of the vehicle  or an area specified by the portable device ) from the simplified map database , and generates the map image based on the simplified map data  retrieved. The map image is transmitted to the portable device  from the image generator  (a step ) and is displayed on the portable device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1C"],"b":["4","3","7","4","3"]},"The map image () displayed on the portable device  is displayed like an illustration as compared to the map image () used for the route guidance, by changing the icons and a font type. Therefore, the map image () displayed on the portable device  is easier to understand and enjoyable for the fellow passenger. Moreover, since less text data is included in the map image () displayed on the portable device  as compared to the map image () used for the route guidance, complexity of contents of the map can be reduced.","Next described is an embodiment of an on-vehicle apparatus of the invention in detail. Hereinbelow, the embodiment is described by taking as an example an on-vehicle apparatus having a function of generating simplified map data from original map data. However, the on-vehicle apparatus is not limited to the embodiment, and may store the simplified map data beforehand.","A configuration of the on-vehicle apparatus in the embodiment is explained referring to .  illustrates the configuration of the on-vehicle apparatus in the embodiment. In the explanation, an on-vehicle apparatus  in  is a car navigation apparatus. However, configuration elements required to explain characteristics of the on-vehicle apparatus  are mainly indicated and descriptions of general configuration elements are omitted.","As shown in , the on-vehicle apparatus  includes a near field communication part , a GPS part , an informing part , a storage part , and a controller .","The near field communication part  transmits and receives data to\/from a portable device  by near field communication using Bluetooth (registered trademark). Similarly the portable device  also has a function of near field communication by Bluetooth (registered trademark). The portable device  is a portable device, such as a cell phone, a PHS (Personal Handy-phone System), a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) and a game console.","The portable device  includes an operation part , a display , a controller , a storage part , and a near field communication part . In response to an operation to the operation part  by a user of the portable device , the controller  retrieves and executes a program of an application  stored in the storage part . Thus, the on-vehicle apparatus  is communicably connected to the portable device .","For example, the controller  demands a desired map image from the on-vehicle apparatus  via the near field communication part  by retrieving and executing the program of the application . The controller  obtains the map image transmitted from the on-vehicle apparatus  in response to the demand and displays the map image on the display . As described later, the map image displayed on the display  is generated based on the simplified map data. Therefore, the map image is suitable to a fellow passenger.","This embodiment explains a case where Bluetooth (registered trademark) is used for communication between the on-vehicle apparatus  and the portable device . However, another wireless communication standard such as Wi-Fi (registered trademark) and ZigBee (registered trademark) may be used for the communication. Moreover, wire communication may be used for the communication between the on-vehicle apparatus  and the portable device .","The GPS part  of the on-vehicle apparatus  includes a GPS antenna and a GPS receiver. The GPS antenna receives a GPS signal from a satellite and transmits the GPS signal to the GPS receiver. The GPS receiver outputs to the controller  GPS information generated by demodulating the GPS signal received from the GPS antenna.","The informing part  informs the user of the information. The informing part  includes a display, such as a liquid crystal display, and a sound output part that outputs sound based on sound information via an on-vehicle speaker. The display of the informing part  displays an image output from the controller . The display of the informing part  is operable to display an image, for example, in WVGA size (800\u00d7480).","The storage part  stores an original map database , a simplified map database , and a program .

The node data is information of nodes (points of elements) that are connecting points of roads. The node data includes attribute information such as a longitude, a latitude and an altitude of each node, and a junction of roads, and a fork in a road, width of a road, and the type of a road (national road, prefectural road, highway, etc.). The link data is information of links that link the nodes. The link data includes attribute information such as inclination, and a raised or an underground part of each link (between nodes), and distance information.","The facility data includes types of facilities (e.g. school, convenience store, bank, park, etc.), location coordinates indicating locations of the facilities, area information indicating areas of the facilities, and POI data including detailed information on the facilities.","The background data includes background color data and data indicating terrain, etc. Moreover, the image data includes data of images such as facility icons and a crossroad icon.","Referring back to , the configuration of the on-vehicle apparatus  is described. The simplified map database includes the simplified map data. The simplified map data is map data for generating the map image to be transmitted to the portable device .","The on-vehicle apparatus  has a storing function of storing the simplified map data and the on-vehicle apparatus  may store the simplified map data in any manner. Therefore, a storage manner is not limited to the manner shown in this embodiment where the storage part  of the on-vehicle apparatus  has the simplified map database including the simplified map data. For example, the storage part  may include a storage apparatus dedicated to storing the simplified map database .

In other words, the simplified map data generated from the original map data does not necessarily need to be generated in an on-vehicle apparatus. For example, the on-vehicle apparatus may obtain the simplified map data generated beforehand, from a predetermined server (a server installed in, for example, an external center) on a network via a network communication part (not illustrated), and may store the simplified map data on the on-vehicle apparatus. Moreover, when the on-vehicle apparatus  is manufactured, the simplified map data may be stored on the on-vehicle apparatus .

Concretely, the route guidance part obtains an area required for the route guidance, out of the original map data on a scale selected by the user of the on-vehicle apparatus .","For example, when a scale of \u201c1:5000\u201d is selected by the user of the on-vehicle apparatus , the route guidance part obtains only an area required for the route guidance, out of the original map data on the scale of \u201c1:5000\u201d from the original map database ","The route guidance part determines the area required for the route guidance, for example, based on a destination specified by the user of the on-vehicle apparatus  and the location information (a location of the vehicle) that the location-information obtaining part obtains.","Then the route guidance part generates the map image, for example, in WVGA size, based on the original map data only of the part of the area obtained from the original map database . Then the route guidance part outputs the map image generated to the informing part  and displays the map image on display of the informing part . Moreover, the route guidance part sets a route to the destination if the destination is set. Then the route guidance part causes the sound output part of the informing part  to output voice guidance guiding the vehicle to travel along the route set.","The processing part generates the simplified map data by omitting a part of the element data included in the original map data.  illustrates an example of a procedure where the processing part generates the simplified map data.

Then the processing part retrieves the original map data on the scale selected (in other words selected map data) from the original map database (a step S). The processing part selects a scale on which a map is easy for the fellow passenger to understand.","In many cases, the fellow passenger desires to look at a map of a wide area, to an extent, rather than a detailed map. In other words, a scale of, for example, \u201c1:10000\u201d or \u201c1:25000,\u201d is preferable to the fellow passenger in many cases rather than a scale of, for example, \u201c1:1000\u201d or \u201c1:2000.\u201d Therefore, the processing part selects a scale of, for example, \u201c1:10000\u201d and retrieves the selected map data on the scale of \u201c1:10000.\u201d","Next, the processing part eliminates a part of the element data of the selected map data (a step S).

Since the image generator generates the map image bigger than the display size to be displayed on the display  of the portable device , a certain range of a map can be displayed by scrolling the map without communication between the portable device  and the on-vehicle apparatus .","In addition, the portable device  demands the map image of an area specified by a latitude and a longitude or of an area where the vehicle is located. When the portable device  demands the map image of an area specified by a latitude and a longitude, information including the latitude and the longitude is transmitted from the portable device . The image generator retrieves, from the simplified map database , the simplified map data of the area corresponding to the latitude and the longitude transmitted by the portable device , and generates the map image based on the simplified map data retrieved.","On the other hand, when the portable device  demands the map image of an area where the vehicle is located, information including the demand is transmitted by the portable device .

In this case, the image generator can select icons, a language type, a font type, etc. in response to a demand from the portable device , and can generate the map image having the icon selected in the language type and the font type selected.","For example, icons and a font type suitable to each age group such as elementary school, junior high school, and high school, may be prepared. In this case, an age group is specified with the portable device . Based on the age groups specified, the image generator selects icons, a font type, etc. and provides a map image having the icons selected in the font type selected. Moreover, text data in various language types may be prepared, and from amongst the various language types, a language type specified by the portable device  is selected and the map image in the language type selected may be provided.","Furthermore, for example, icons and a font type for each category of, for example, sex of male or female, season, and region, may be prepared.

As a result, a storage capacity needed for the simplified map database in the storage part  can be reduced.","In the aforementioned embodiments, the simplified map data prepared beforehand is registered in the simplified map database in the storage part , and when the map demand signal is received from the portable device , the image generator  retrieves the simplified map data of a necessary area from the simplified map database , and the transmitter transmits to the portable device  the map image based on the simplified map data. On the other hand, simplified map data is not prepared beforehand, but when a map demand signal is received from a portable device , a processing part may retrieve the original map data of a necessary area from the original map database , may generate the simplified map data based on the original map data and then may cause the simplified map data to be stored in a RAM in a controller . In this case, an image generator  retrieves the simplified map data from the RAM and a transmitter transmits a map image based on the simplified map data, to the portable device .","In the aforementioned embodiments, the image generator generates the map image compressed in a method such as JPEG and PIC, and the map image is transmitted to the portable device . On the other hand, an image generator may clip a part of simplified map data as a map image, corresponding to a necessary area, and may transmit the map image (simplified map data) to a portable device . In this case, a controller  of the portable device  generates an image to be displayed on a display , based on the simplified map data obtained from an on-vehicle apparatus .","Moreover, in the aforementioned embodiments, the simplified map data is generated by eliminating a part of the element data included in the original map data (e.g. the traffic light data included in the road data, and the POI data included in the facility data), and then by changing a part of the contents (font type, language type, icons, etc.) of the element data remaining and included in the original map data of which a part of the element data is eliminated. On the other hand, original map data of which a part of element data is only eliminated may be used as simplified map data. In this case, an on-vehicle apparatus transmits a map image based on the simplified map data, to a portable device. Then the portable device changes the font type, the language type, the icons, etc. using change data stored on the portable device. As a result, it is easier to reflect the taste of a user to the map image to be displayed on the portable device. Therefore, it is possible to provide map information easier to understand and more enjoyable for the user.","As described above, the on-vehicle apparatus of the invention is effective in transmission of a map image easy to understand and enjoyable mainly for a fellow passenger, to a portable device. This invention is suitable to car apparatuses, especially, car navigation apparatuses.","While the invention has been shown and described in detail, the foregoing description is in all aspects illustrative and not restrictive. It is therefore understood that numerous other modifications and variations can be devised without departing from the scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 6A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
