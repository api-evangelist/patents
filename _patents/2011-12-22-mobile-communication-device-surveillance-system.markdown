{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application relates generally to the field of computer technology, and in a specific example embodiment, a surveillance system for a mobile communication device.","Systems for monitoring and\/or controlling security devices have become increasingly popular in recent years. Such systems are used to communicate with security devices such as lights, thermostats, or security systems.","Some conventional systems for controlling and monitoring security devices allow a user to access a server from a remote location using a device such as a desktop computer. For example, a user can use a desktop computer located in a remote location to connect with the server. The user can then send commands to the server to control various security devices. For example, the user can turn lights on or off. In another example, the user accesses a video feed stored at the server that receives a video stream from a camera at a monitored location.","Such conventional systems for controlling and\/or monitoring security devices have at least the following disadvantages and limitations. The connection between the user's remote computer and the server may not be secured. A user could establish a secure connection, but the cost and complexity involved in establishing such a connection are high. Such systems are also complex for users to implement and maintain. For example, the server may be difficult to install and configure. Programming such systems can also be cumbersome and require custom configurations when adding supplemental security devices or services. Last, it is difficult for the user to access the server using different types of remote devices. For instance, conventional systems only allow a user to access the offsite server using, for example, a secured desktop computer located in the user's workplace.","Although the present invention has been described with reference to specific example embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.","In various embodiments, a mobile communication device surveillance system is described. The system includes a gateway, a web server, a wireless mobile communication device, and a client device. The web server introduces the wireless mobile communication device to a gateway. The gateway authenticates the wireless mobile communication device.
