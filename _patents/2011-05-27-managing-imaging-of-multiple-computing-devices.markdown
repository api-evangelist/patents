title: Managing imaging of multiple computing devices
abstract: Systems and methods for managing imaging of multiple computing devices are provided. A device image manager determines a number of device images which may be loaded by the computing devices. The device image manager transmits a set of device images to the computing devices, which then store the device images. When provisioning of one or more of the computing devices is desired, the device image manager selects a device image or receives selection of a device image. The device image manager then sends a provisioning command device to the appropriate computing devices identifying the selected device image. If the computing devices have stored the selected device image, the computing devices may load the selected device image without requiring retransmission of the device image.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Generally described, computing devices utilize a communication network, or a series of communication networks, to exchange data. Companies and organizations operate computer networks that interconnect a number of computing devices to support operations or provide services to third parties. The computing systems can be located in a single geographic location or located in multiple, distinct geographic locations (e.g., interconnected via private or public communication networks). Specifically, data centers or data processing centers, herein generally referred to as a \u201cdata center,\u201d may include a number of interconnected computing systems to provide computing resources to users of the data center. The data centers may be private data centers operated on behalf of an organization or public data centers operated on behalf, or for the benefit of the general public.","To facilitate increased utilization of data center resources, individual computing devices within a data center may be configured to provide specific functionality according to the requirements of the data center. For example, various computing devices may be associated with different operating systems or operating system configurations to enable a computing device to provide different desired functionalities, or to provide similar functionalities more efficiently. These operating systems or operating system configurations are often contained within a device image, which a computing device may process in order implement the desired software configuration. This implementation of a desired software configuration is generally referred to as provisioning.","Generally described, aspects of the present disclosure relate to the management of device imaging processes occurring on multiple computing devices. Specifically, systems and methods are disclosed which facilitate imaging of multiple computing devices. In one aspect, device images are transmitted to a number of computing devices by a device image manager. Illustratively, each device image can correspond to a software configuration of a computing device, such as an operating system or operating system kernel. The computing devices then store the devices images such that they may be accessed at a later time. Illustratively, the computing devices may store the device images on a local hard disk drive of each of the computing devices. The device image manager may then detect that some or all of the computing devices should load at least one of the images. Once a determination is made that some or all of the computing devices under the control of the device image manager should load an image, the device image manager may send a command to the relevant computing devices to load a specified device image. The computing device may then determine whether the specified device image exists within locally accessible storage. If so, the computing device may process the device image without requiring transmission of the specified image from the device image manager in response to the command from the device image manager. In this way, network resources required to load one or more device images onto multiple computing devices may be reduced.","In some embodiments, the device image manager may further be capable of selecting one or more device images to be placed on a computing device. This determination may be made, at least in part, according to the characteristics of the computing device, such as the computing device's hardware, network configuration, performance, or location. Additionally, the determination may be made, at least in part, according to the intended function or functions of the computing device. In still more embodiments, the device image manager may be further capable of updating device images stored by computing devices.","Specific embodiments and example applications of the present disclosure will now be described with reference to the drawings. These embodiments and example applications are intended to illustrate, and not limit, the present disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","106","106","110","110","112","112","106","110","106","108","108","106","106","106","110","108","106","112"]},"The illustrated environment further includes a device image manager  in communication with the computing devices  via a network . The network  may be, for instance, a wide area network (WAN), a local area network (LAN), or a global communications network.","Illustratively, the device image manager may manage provisioning of computing devices  by transmitting device images to the computing devices  or the collection of computing devices . As used herein, provisioning of a computing device refers to the processes of accessing and loading a device image onto the computing device. In some embodiments, such provisioning may alter the software of a computing device such that the device may carry out additional or different functionality, generally referred to as reprovisioning. The computing devices  or collection of computing devices  may store the transmitted set of device images in storage . In this manner, the device images may later be accessed by the computing devices  or collection of computing devices  independent of the device image manager . The device image manager may further manage provisioning by detecting provision events and sending a provision command to the computing devices  or collection of computing devices . The provision events may correspond to an automated detection that one or more computing devices  or collection of computing devices  should be provisioned, or to a received input specifying devices to be provisioned. The device image manager may then cause the computing devices  or collection of computing devices  to load a specified device image by transmitting a provision command. An example of the interaction between components in a provisioning process will be described in more detail with respect to , below.","In some embodiments, the device image manager  may be operable to determine which device images to transmit or cause to be transmitted based on identified configuration information of the computing devices  or the collection of computing devices . The configuration information may correspond to hardware profile information, network profile information, benchmarking information, or computing device location information. Illustratively, configuration information may correspond to hardware components of the computing device , such as information corresponding to a central processing unit of the computing device . Configuration information may further correspond to an IP address of the computing device . Additional examples of configuration information will be discussed with respect to , below. The device image manager  may use the configuration information to determine a set of device images which should be transmitted to the computing devices  or the collections of computing devices . One example illustration of an interaction by which the device image manager  may determine a set of device images based on configuration information will be discussed in more detail with respect to , below. In other embodiments, the set of device images may be determined in advance or otherwise preset, such that a common set of device images is transferred to each computing device  or group of computing devices. In still more embodiments, the devices images to be transferred may be specified manually in response to input received from an operator or client of the device image manager .","In some embodiments, the device image manager  may be operable to update device images stored by computing devices  or collection of computing devices . The device image manager  may determine that an update exists for one or more of the device images which have been transmitted to computing devices  or collection of computing devices . The device image manager may determine which devices are currently storing the non-updated device image and transmit a device image update to the relevant devices. One example illustration of such an update process will be discussed with respect to , below.","With reference to , an illustrative interaction for provisioning multiple computing devices will be described. As illustrated in , the device image manager  may transfer a set of device images to computing devices . As previously described, the set of device images may be selected by an operator of the device image manager , may be a predetermined set of device images, or may be determined based on configuration information of a computing devices  as will be described in , below. Additionally, the device image manger  may transmit a set of device images to a single computing device, such as computing device A, or to multiple computing devices, such as computing devices B and C. Transmission of the device images to computing devices A-C may occur simultaneously, sequentially, or in any order. Additionally, transmission of device images may occur intermittently, such that portions of the set of device images are transmitted separately. For example, the device image manager  may transmit device images or portions of device images during periods of lowered activity across the network  or portions of the network. In some embodiments, the device image manager  may transmit device images or portions of device images during periods of lowered activity by the computing devices . One skilled in the art will appreciate that transmission of the device images to computing devices  may be accomplished by additional or alternative timings or mechanisms while not departing from the scope of the current disclosure. Subsequent to receiving the device images, the computing devices may store the device images in a device image storage, such as storage  of .","With continued reference to , the device image manager  may detect that a provision event has occurred. In some embodiments, this detection will correspond to a provision request by an operator of the device image manager, a client, or another entity. This provision request may correspond to a consumer demand for resources at a data center housing computing devices . In other embodiments, this detection may be automated, such that the device image manager  or another computing device detects that a provision should occur. One skilled in the art will appreciate that provisioning may occur in response to a variety of events. By way of non-limiting example, a provision event may correspond to an addition of one or more computing devices, such that these computing devices must be provisioned in order to be utilized. A provision event may further correspond to a reallocation of computing device resources, such as when demand is increased or decreased for certain functionality provided by provisioning. By way of further example, a provision event may correspond to a detection that utilization of computing devices providing a specific functionality has reached a predetermined threshold. When such a threshold has been reached, a provision event may indicate desirability to reconfigure additional computing devices with the specific functionality in order to reduce overall utilization levels and provide additional computing resources. A provision event may still further correspond to a detection of malfunction on one or more computing devices. Additionally, a detected provision event may correspond to a detection of a change in configuration of a computing device.","After detection of a provision event, the device image manager  may transmit a provision command to computing devices A-C. This provision command may specify the type of provisioning which is to occur, the specific device image which is to be loaded, or other information sufficient to allow the computing device  to load a device image corresponding to the provision command. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, transmission of provision commands to computing devices A-C may occur simultaneously or in any order. In some embodiments, provision commands may be transferred only to a single computing device , such as computing device A, or group of computing devices , such as computing devices B. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the provision command may be transmitted through a variety of processes.","By way of non-limiting example, a provision command may correspond to a command sent from the device image manger  via and application programming interface (API). A provision command may further correspond with boot instructions to a computing device . Such boot instructions may direct the computing device  to take specified actions after a reboot of the computing device. For example, a computing device  may be configured to receive boot instructions from a device image manager  on each boot of the computing device . On detection of a provision event, the boot image manager  may modify the boot instructions such that the computing device  loads a specified device image when it next boots.","In response to receiving a provision command, the computing devices  then process the corresponding device image. If the corresponding device image was previously transmitted to the computing device  and stored in device image storage, the computing device  may process the device image without requiring retransmission of the device image from the device image manager  or another location. If the device image was not previously stored by the computing device , transmission of the device image may be required from another source.","In some embodiments, processing the device image may correspond to copying all or part of a specified device image to an image destination storage of the computing device . The image destination storage corresponds to a storage of the computing device  on which the device image is to be loaded. In some embodiments, this image destination storage may be distinct from the device image storage , which stores the received device images. Image destination storage may correspond to random access memory (RAM) of the computing device , to a hard disk drive of the computing device , or to other storage accessible by the computing device . After copying all or part of the specified device image to the image destination storage, the computing device  may run the software now located on the image destination storage. This software corresponds with the software contained within the specified device image. In some embodiments; the device image may contain an operating system, operating system kernel, or operating system configuration. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, device images may contain a variety of software or software configurations.","In still more embodiments, processing of a specified device image may require loading of more than one device image by a computing device . By way of illustrative example, a computing device  may utilize a temporary device image containing a temporary operating system. The computing device may load this temporary operating system into RAM, and reboot to operate via the temporary operating system. The temporary operating system may then load a final device image into a non-temporary storage of the computing device . The temporary operating system may then cause the computing device  to reboot and load the software contained within the final device image from the non-temporary storage.","In some embodiments, loading of multiple device images may be required gain unrestricted write access to an image destination storage location. Such access may be restricted, for example, by a current operating system which is operating from the image destination storage. By loading an intermediate device image, such as one containing a temporary operating system, unrestricted access to the image destination storage may be gained. The computing device  may then load the desired device image containing the new operating system onto the image destination storage.","As will be appreciate by one skilled in the art, the provision command may correspond to a single command, or to series of commands which cause the processing of a device image or images. For example, where intermediary device images must be processed in order to load a final desired device image, the initial provision command may specify each device image that must be loaded, only a portion of the device images which must be loaded, or only the first device image to be loaded. The device image manager  may subsequently communicate with the software loaded by intermediary device images to specify additional intermediary device images or the final desired device image. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a variety of provision commands and image loading techniques may be utilized without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","With reference now to , an illustrative interaction for provisioning multiple computing devices  contained within collections of computing devices  will be described. As illustrated in , the device image manager  may transfer a set of device images to a collection of computing devices  which contain a control device . As previously described, the set of device images which are transferred may be selected by an operator of the device image manager , may be a predetermined set of device images, or may be determined based on configuration information of a collection of computing devices  or computing devices  contained within the collection of computing devices . The number of device images transferred to a collection of computing devices  may increase where the computing devices  within the collection have many potential functionalities. On illustrative example for determining device images based on configuration information will be described in , below. Transmission of the device images to the collection of computing devices  may occur simultaneously or non-simultaneously. Additionally, as described above, transmission of device images may occur intermittently, such that portions of the set of device images are transmitted separately. For example, the device image manager  may transmit device images or portions of device images during periods of lowered activity across the network  or portions of the network. The device image manager  may further transmit device images during periods of lowered activity by a collection of computing devices . One skilled in the art will appreciate that transmission of the device images to a collection of computing devices  may be accomplished by additional or alternative timings or mechanisms while not departing from the scope of the current disclosure. Subsequent to receiving the device images, the collection of computing devices  may store the device images in device image storage . In some embodiments, storing of the device images may be accomplished by the control device . In still more embodiments, the control device  may transfer some or all of the device images to an individual storage of one or more of the computing devices .","With continued reference to , the device image manager  may detect that a provision event has occurred. As described with reference to , detection may correspond to a provision request by an operator, a client, or another entity, or may be automated such that the device image manager  or another computing device detects that a provision should occur without requiring human input. Similarly to as described above with respect to , a detection of a provision event may correspond to an addition of one or more collections of computing devices  or computing devices  with a collection of computing devices , to a reallocation of computing device resources, a detection of a change in configuration of collections of computing devices , or to a detection of a malfunction of one or more collections of computing devices .","After detection of a provision event, the device image manager  may transmit a provision command to control devices  within the collections of computing devices . This provision command may specify parameters of the provisioning, such as which computing devices  should be provisioned, what image should be loaded into each computing device , or other information sufficient to allow the control device  to provision the computing devices . As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, transmission of provision commands to collections of computing devices  may occur simultaneously or in any order.","In response to receiving a provision command, in one embodiment, the control devices  may then cause the loading of corresponding device image onto appropriate computing devices . If the corresponding device image was previously transmitted to the collection of computing devices  and stored in device image storage , the collection of computing devices  may process the device image without requiring retransmission of the device image from the device image manager  or another location. If the device image was not previously stored by the collection of computing devices , such as in storage , transmission of the device image may be required from an alternative source outside the collection of computing devices .","In other embodiments, the control device  may forward an appropriate provision command to each individual computing device . The control device  may determine the appropriate provision command based on the provision command received from the device image manager . For example, the device image manger  may transmit a provision command to control device A specifying that computing device A is to be provisioned with a first device image. The provision command may further specify that computing device B is to be provisioned with second device image. In this illustrative example, control device A may determine two separate commands for the computing devices A and B, each command specifying the appropriate device image to be loaded by the individual computing device . One illustration of an individual computing device  provisioning itself based on a provision command is discussed with respect to , above.","In other embodiments, the control device  may directly control provisioning of one or more computing devices . In these embodiments, the control device  may copy all or part of the device image to an image destination storage of the computing device . The image destination storage may correspond to random access memory (RAM) of the computing device , to a hard disk drive of the computing device , or to other storage accessible by the computing device  in order to load the software included within the device image. For example, the control device  may directly load a device image onto an image destination storage accessible by the computing device . This direct loading may not require any processing by the computing device . In some embodiments, the computing device  may not be aware that the control device  is loading a device image onto an image destination storage. The control device  may further reboot the computing device  in order to cause the device to load the device image as copied to the image destination storage. In some embodiments, causing the computing device  to load the device image may correspond to a modification of a boot instruction of the computing device . In some embodiments, utilizing a control device  in order to provision a computing device  may eliminate or reduce the need to use temporary device images in order to load a desired device image.","With reference now to , an illustrative interaction for determining a set of device images based on configuration information of computing devices  will be described. As illustrated in , computing devices A-C may transfer device configuration information to device image manager . In one embodiment, the device configuration information may be based on or include one or more device profiles, such as a hardware profile, network profile, benchmark profile, or location profile, or other configuration information associated with the computing devices . These profiles will be discussed in greater detail below. Illustratively, computing devices  may determine device configuration information by querying or identifying hardware components of the computing devices , performing benchmarking or testing on the computing devices , obtaining data previously generated or associated with the computing devices , or inferring information based on any of the above or any other information associated with the computing devices . The process of determining device configuration information may be guided by or based upon device provisioning preferences, which may comprise information identifying or interpretable to identify one or more profiles, types, or specific pieces of device configuration information for the computing devices  to obtain or determine.","Specifically, and for purposes of example, device configuration information may include hardware profile information associated with a hardware component of a computing device including, but not limited to, a network interface controller (NIC), a central processing unit (CPU), a computing device basic input\/output system (BIOS), computing device firmware, a motherboard, a daughterboard, an expansion board, a bus, a computer readable media drive, a memory, a storage device, a computer display, an input or output interface, or a computing device enclosure. Device configuration information may further include network profile information or location information corresponding to or associated with a or logical location in a network or data center, including, but not limited to, information associated or determined from with a MAC address, a static IP address, a logical device group identifier, a control device identifier, a serial number or ID corresponding to one or more components of the computing device , a data storage location, information identifying one or more specific instances of a device image manager , or other information that may indicate or be used to infer a logical or location. Device configuration information may still further include benchmark profile information associated with one or more performance benchmarks of a computing device  or computing device component, including but not limited to, processor performance; energy usage; bus speed; drive or data storage component throughput or seek time; network bandwidth, throughput, or latency to one or more remote or local network locations; or other benchmark data associated with the computing device.","Illustrative, the computing devices transfer device configuration information to the device image manager . Transferring device configuration information may include transmitting data comprising the device configuration information across a direct connection or network  of , transmitting or identifying a pointer or reference to a location of device configuration information stored on a storage device or computer memory, or any combination thereof. Upon receipt, the device image manager  may utilize the device configuration information to select a set of device images based on hardware qualifications associated with the device images. Illustratively, hardware qualifications may be minimum hardware requirements needed by a computing device  in order to run software contained within a device image. In one embodiment, the device image manager  may compare device configuration information corresponding to a computing device  to a set of hardware qualifications associated with a number of device images in order to identify a set of device images capable of be loaded on the computing device . In a further embodiment, the device image manager  may determine a set of device images by comparing network profiles, location profiles, benchmark profiles, or additional non-essential hardware profiles included in the device configuration information to the set of hardware qualifications.","For example, the device image manager  may compare the device configuration information corresponding to the computing device A to a set of hardware qualifications associated with a group of fifty device images to identify a set of ten different device images that may be loaded on computing device A. In an alternate embodiment, the device image manager  may identify all device images as potentially able to be loaded on the computing device A, or may skip the step entirely. To continue this example, the device image manager  may further compare the device configuration information to the set of hardware qualifications to narrow this initial set of device images down to a set of device images appropriate for computing device A. For example, if device configuration information such as a network profile associated with computing device A indicates that the computing device A is located in a network subnet that is dedicated to servicing client DNS queries, a comparison of the device configuration information with the set of hardware qualifications may cause the device image manager  to identify three device images out of the initial set of ten that correspond to operating systems, software, or operating system configurations for responding to DNS queries.","As another example, if device configuration information such as a location profile associated with the computing device A indicates that the computing device A is located in a data center in an area with high energy costs, a comparison of the device configuration information with the hardware qualification information may cause the device image manager  to identify two device images out of the initial set of ten that correspond to operating systems, software, or operating system configurations configured for low power usage. As still another example, if device configuration information such as a benchmark profile associated with the computing device A indicates that the computing device A is associated with a high network latency to a particular group of network clients, a comparison of the device configuration information with the hardware qualification information may cause the device image manager  to identify one device image out of the initial set of ten that corresponds to an operating systems, software, or operating system configuration configured for long term backup or storage of content, rather than rapid service of content to the group of network clients. As still another example, a comparison of the device configuration information with hardware qualifications may cause the device image manager  to identify all ten of the initial set of device images as potential images for the computing device A.","As yet another example, each device image may be associated with one or more specific categories. Illustratively, these categories may correspond to functionalities of a computing device , such as a database server or web services host server. Device images may be manually associated with specific categories. In some embodiments, device images may be automatically associated with a category based on software contained within the device image or hardware requirements associated with the device image. The device image manager  may utilize these categories in order to determine a set of device images which may be loaded onto a computing device . Illustratively, the device image manager  may use configuration information of the computing device A to determine that the computing device A is suitable for loading device images within a database server category. This determination may be based on configuration information indicating computing device A has a large amount of storage space. The device image manager  may further determine that the computing device A is also suitable for loading device images contained within a web services host category. This determination may be based on configuration information indicating that computing device A has a large amount of network resources. The device image manager  may then determine that the set of device images to be transmitted to computing device A is the set of device images contained within the categories \u201cdatabase server\u201d and \u201cweb services host.\u201d","Still further, a set of device images may be determined based in part on past, present, or estimated future demand for specific functionality. For example, where demand for a specific functionality has historically increased, the device image manager  may sent to a computing device A a device image which allows the device to implement that specific functionality. As a further example, where estimations of future user demand indicate that demand is falling for a specific functionality, the device image manager  may be less likely to send to a computing device A a device image which allows the device to implement that specific functionality. In some embodiments, the device image manager  may further gather information as to the number of computing devices  which are currently storing a device image implementing a specific functionality. For example, where future demand is expected to decrease for that specific functionality, and the number of computing devices  storing the device image is high, the device image manager  would be less likely to transmit the device image to an addition computing device . Conversely, where demand is expected to rise for a functionality, and the number of computing devices  storing a device image or images implementing that functionality is low, a device image manager may be more likely to transmit that device image or images.","Although the selection of a first set of device images that may be loaded on the computing device A and the selection of a second subset of device images is described here for the purpose of example as two logical steps, it should be understood that the process of identify one or more appropriate device images may be implemented or executed in one, two, or any other number of logical steps by the device image manager .","After the device image manager  has selected a set of device images for the computing devices , the device image manager  may cause the selected device image to be transferred to the computing devices .","With reference now to , an illustrative interaction for determining a set of device images based on configuration information of collections of computing devices  will be described. As illustrated in , control devices  may transfer device configuration information to the device image manager . As described above with reference to , the device configuration information may be based on or include one or more device profiles, such as a hardware profile, network profile, benchmark profile, or location profile, or other configuration information associated with collections of computing devices , control devices , or computing devices  which exist within collections of computing devices . Illustratively, the control devices  may determine device configuration of the computing devices , the control devices , or the collections of computing devices  by directly querying or identifying hardware information of the relevant devices. In some embodiments, the control devices  may query the computing devices , which may provide hardware information to the control devices . As described above with reference to , the process of determining device configuration information may be guided by or based upon device provisioning preferences, which may comprise information identifying or interpretable to identify one or more profiles, types, or specific pieces of device configuration information for the collections of computing devices  to obtain or determine.","After the control devices  have determined their associated device configuration information, the device configuration information is transferred to the device image manager . Transferring device configuration information may include transmitting data comprising the device configuration information across a direct connection or network  of , transmitting or identifying a pointer or reference to a location of device configuration information stored on a storage device or computer memory, or any combination thereof.","After the device image manager  has access to device configuration information corresponding to the collections of computing devices , the device image manager may utilize the device configuration information to select a set of device images based on hardware qualifications associated with the device images. In one embodiment, the device image manager  may compare device configuration information corresponding to a computing device  to a set of hardware qualifications associated with a number of device images in order to identify a set of device images capable of be loaded on the computing device  of the collection of computing devices . In a further embodiment, device image manager  may determine a set of device images by comparing network profiles, location profiles, benchmark profiles, or additional non-essential hardware profiles included in the device configuration information to the set of hardware qualifications.","For example, the device image manager  may compare device configuration information corresponding to a collection of computing devices  to a set of hardware qualifications associated with a group of fifty device images to identify a set of ten different device images that may be loaded on the collection of computing devices .

For example, if device configuration information such as a network profile associated with a collection of computing devices  indicates that the collection of computing devices  is located in a network subnet that is dedicated to servicing client DNS queries, a comparison of the device configuration information with the set of hardware qualifications may cause the device image manager  to identify three device images out of the initial set of ten that correspond to operating systems, software, or operating system configurations for responding to DNS queries.","Similar to as described above with respect to , each device image may be associated with one or more specific categories. The device image manager  may utilize these categories in order to determine a set of device images which may be loaded onto a collection of computing devices . Illustratively, the device image manager  may use configuration information of the collection of computing devices  to determine that the collection of computing devices  is suitable for loading device images within a database server category. The device image manager  may further determine that the collection of computing devices  is also suitable for loading device images contained within a web services host category.

In some embodiments, the device image manager  may determine an appropriate set of device images based on all categories of device images which may be loaded on any computing device  within a collection of computing devices .","As another example, if device configuration information such as a location profile associated with a collection of computing devices  indicates that the collection of computing devices  is located in a data center in an area with high energy costs, a comparison of the device configuration information with the hardware qualification information may cause the device image manager  to identify two device images out of the initial set of ten that correspond to operating systems, software, or operating system configurations configured for low power usage.

Although the selection of a first set of device images that may be loaded on collection of computing devices  and the selection of a second subset of device images is described here for the purpose of example as two logical steps, it should be understood that the process of identifying one or more appropriate device images may be implemented or executed in one, two, or any other number of logical steps by the device image manager .","Once the device image manager  has selected a set of device images for the collection of computing devices , device image manager  may cause the selected device image to be transferred to the collection of computing devices .","With reference now to , an illustrative interaction for updating a device image will be described. As illustrated in , the device image manager  may determine a device image update event. This event may correspond to any event which notifies the device image manager  that a device image update exists for a device image which is managed by the device image manager . By way of non-limiting example, such an event may correspond to an update received from a manufacturer or developer of software contained within the device image, to a modification of software or software configuration by a client or operator of the device image manager, or to other modification of device images. In order to update a device image or images stored by computing devices , the device image manager  may first determine which computing devices  have stored the non-updated image. One skilled in the art will appreciate that such a determination may be made through a variety of processes without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example, the device image manager  may keep a record of all computing devices  which have previously received a non-updated device image. Further, the device image manager  may query some or all of the computing devices  in order to determine the status of device images stored by the computing devices . In some embodiments, a request from a computing device  may signal that the computing device  requires a device image update. As illustrated in , the device image manager  may determine that computing device A requires a device image update.","The device image manager  may next transfer the device image update to the determined computing device A. The device image update may correspond to a full copy of the updated device image, to a portion of the updated device image, or to other information sufficient to allow the computing device A to update a device image. By way of non-limiting example, a device image update may correspond to a patch file for a device image, or to an executable which updates the device image when processed by the computing device A. In some embodiments, device image manager may transmit a location of a device image update file to the computing device A. The location of the image file may, in some instances, correspond to other computing devices  or to other storage devices. Where a location of a file is specified, the computing device  may further retrieve the image update file from the specified location.","After reception of the device image update, the computing device A may then update the device image using the device image update. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the method used to update the device image may vary according to the format of the device image update. For example, where the device image update is an executable file or a patch, the computing device A may execute the file. Where the device image update is a new device image, the computing device A may replace the non-updated device image in device image storage with the updated device image A. Other variations will be recognized by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope of this disclosure.","With reference now to , one embodiment of a routine  implemented by a device image manager  for sending a set of device images to a set of computing devices will be described. At block , the device image manager  determines or identifies a set of computing devices  to which device images will be transmitted. In some embodiments, the device image manager  may determine that all computing devices  should receive device images. In other embodiments, the device image manager  may determine that only computing devices  meeting certain criteria should receive device images. By way of non-limiting example, such criteria may correspond to network, hardware, benchmarking, location, or current provisioning information. Such criteria may further correspond to manual criteria specified by an operator of the device image manager . Other criteria for determining applicable computing devices  will be appreciated by one skilled in the art. In still more embodiments, a set of computing devices  may be determined by receiving input from an operator or client of the device image manager .","At block , the device image manager  determines the set of device images which should be sent to the determined set of computing devices . As discussed above with respect to , the device image manager  may use configuration information to determine a set of device images which should be transmitted to computing devices  or the collections of computing devices . In some embodiments, the device image manager  may utilize configuration information to associate a computing device  or collection of computing devices  with categories of device images, such as categories corresponding to specific functionality. other embodiments, the set of device images may be determined in advance or otherwise preset, such that a common set of device images is transferred to each computing device  or collection of computing devices . In still more embodiments, the devices images to be transferred may be specified manually in response to input received from an operator or client of the device image manager . Though the determination of the set of device images is discussed subsequent to a determination of the set of computing devices, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the order of these blocks may be interchanged, such that a set of device images is determined prior to determining a set of computing devices .","At block , once both the set of computing devices and set of device images has been determined, the device image manager  may transmit or cause the transmission of the set of device images to the set of computing devices. As discussed previously with respect to , the device image manager  may send all device images in the set of device images during the same period, or may transmit portions of the set of device images over discreet periods of time. For example, the device image manager  may transmit images during periods of low network utilization, encouraging efficient use of network resources. Further, the device image manager  may send the set of device images to individual computing devices  simultaneously or at different times. These different times may correspond to periods of low activity for the individual computing devices . In some embodiments, the device image manager  may utilize a peer to peer network model to distribute device images. In such a peer to peer model, computing devices  may, after reception of a device image or images, act to retransmit the device image or images to other computing devices  which have not yet received them. One skilled in the art will appreciate that a variety of processes may be used to send the set of device images without departing from the scope of the current disclosure. The routine  may then end.","With reference now to , one embodiment of a routine  implemented by a device image manager  for provisioning multiple computing devices will be described. Illustratively, this routing may be implemented subsequent to a routine which causes the multiple computing devices to store a set of device images, such as routine  of . As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, routine  of  may be implemented multiple times before implementation of routine  of . Further, routines  of  of  may be implemented simultaneously on the same or different computing systems. Still further, routines  of  of  may be implanted in any order. For example, routine  of  may occur before routine  of , as long as the computing device which is to be provisioned has access to the relevant stored device image.","With continued reference to , at block , the device image manager  detects that a provision event has occurred. Similarly to as discussed above with respect to , a provision event may correspond to a number of events. For example, a provision could be requested by an operator of the device image manager , a client, or another entity. In some embodiments, the device image manager  or another computer may detect a change in configuration or a malfunction of one or more computing devices . In other embodiments, the device image manager  or another computer may detect the addition of one or more computing devices  or collections of computing devices . In still more embodiments, a provision event may be detected by the device image manager  based on a determination that computing resources may be better allocated by provisioning one or more computing devices . Such a determination may correspond to a detection that utilization of computing devices  providing a specific functionality has reached a predetermined threshold, such that provisioning may provide additional computing resources providing the specific functionality. One skilled in the art will appreciate that provisioning may occur in response to a variety of events.","At block , the device image manager  determines the set of computing devices which are to be provisioned. In some embodiments, the computing devices which are to be provisioned may be based on the provision event which was detected. Provisioning may occur on a single computing device  or a group of computing devices .","At block , the device image manager  may optionally update a device image which has been stored by the computing devices  which are to be provisioned. This may correspond to requesting a device image update from the device image manager . This device image update may then be used to update a device image prior to loading the device image.","At block , a provision command is sent to the determined computing devices  to be provisioned. As discussed above with respect to , a provision command may be transmitted through a variety of processes. By way of non-limiting example, a provision command may correspond to a command sent from the device image manger  via an application programming interface (API). In some embodiments, a provision command may be transmitted with boot instructions to the determined set computing device  to be provisioned. As discussed above, a provision command may correspond with a command to load multiple device images in order to provision to a final desired device image. In some embodiments, a provision command may specify all device images to be loaded. In other embodiments, the device image manager  may further communicate with the computing devices  in order to specify additional required device images. In still more embodiments, a computing device  may be preprogrammed to use specified intermediary device images, such as temporary operating systems, in order to process a final device image. The routine  may then end.","With reference to , one example of a routine to provision based on multiple device images will be described. In , a boot image must first be processed in order to provision the machine with the provision image. Such a boot image may be required, for example, where the provision image is to be placed on an image destination storage already in use by operating system of the computing device . In some embodiments, a boot image may correspond to a temporary operating system which is loaded into RAM or other storage separate from the image destination storage. The temporary operating system may then write to previously inaccessible portions of the image destination storage.","With continued reference to , at block  the computing device  obtains a number of device images from the device image manager . These device images contain a number of software configurations which may be loaded by the computing device . In some embodiments, these device images may correspond to various operating systems or operating system configurations usable by the computing device . By way of non-limiting example, these operating systems or configurations may allow the computing device  to carry out functionalities such as a web services host, a file storage host, networking component, or database server. Other potential functionalities will be apparent to one skilled in the art.","After obtaining the device images, at block  the computing device  may store those device images on device image storage  such that they will be accessible in the future. As discussed above, storage  may correspond to a hard disk drive of the computing device , to network attached storage, or to any storage medium sufficient to store the device images such that they are available during provisioning. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, blocks  and  may, in some embodiments, be repeated a number of times before the routine continues to block .","At block , the computing device  receives a provision command from the device image manager . In this illustrative example, the provision command specifies multiple device images to be loaded by the computing device , as described above in . These device images correspond to both a boot image and a provision image to be used during provisioning. The provision image contains an operating system able to be loaded by the computing device . The boot image corresponds to a temporary operating system to be used by the computing device  in order to gain unrestricted write access to a image destination storage device. In this illustrative example, the image destination storage device is distinct from the device image storage . Either the boot image or the provision image may correspond with images previously received from a device image manager , as described above in . Further, the boot image may be provided by a source other than the device image manager , such as by an operator of the computing device . Illustratively, the operator may provide a boot image corresponding to a temporary operating system from a universal serial bus hard drive. The computing device  may be further operable to determine whether device images are authorized to be loaded onto the computing device A. For example, the computing device  may only load images that are signed with specified digital encryption keys. In another example, the computing device  may only load images when authentication is received from a trusted source. Such a trusted source could be another network connected entity, such as another computing device , or an operator of a computing device . Illustratively, the operator of the computing device could be authenticated by use of a password, by use of biometric hardware, or by other authentication mechanisms. One skilled in the art will appreciate that different images could be associated with different security schemas or mechanisms, and that various authentication methods could be used without departing from the scope of the current disclosure. Further, as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the destination to which a device image is to be written may be required to be different than the source of the device image. This requirement may occur, for example, where loading the device image requires writing to the entirety of the destination storage device. In some embodiments, loading the device image may not require writing to the entirety of the destination storage device. In such embodiments, the image destination storage and the device image storage  may be the same storage device.","At block , the computing device  determines whether the boot image specified in the provision command exists within local storage . If the boot image does not exist within local storage, computing device  proceeds to block  and requests the necessary boot image from the device image manager . Optionally, if the boot image does exist within local storage, the computing device  may update the boot image before proceeding. This may correspond to requesting a device image update from the device image manager . This device image update may then be used to update a device image prior to loading the device image.","At block , after gaining access to the boot image, the computing device  reboots itself in order to load the boot image. In this illustrative embodiment, the computing device  loads the boot image into RAM during the boot process. As described above, the boot image contains a temporary operating system which enables the computing device to gain unrestricted write access to an image destination storage device on which the provision image will be loaded. The boot image further contains code which allows the computing device  to load the provision image.","At block , the computing device  determines whether the provision image specified within the provision command exists within local storage . If the provision image does not exist within local storage , the computing device  may request the provision image from the device image manager . Optionally, if the provision image does exist within local storage the computing device  may update the provision image before proceeding. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, though blocks - are described subsequently to blocks -, blocks - may be performed at any point between receiving a provision command at block  and loading the provision image.","At block , the computing device  may provision itself with the provision image. In this illustrative embodiment, provisioning corresponds to writing the operating system and information contained within the provision image to a destination storage device associated with the computing device . After writing the information within the provision image, the computing device  may reboot in order to load the operating system within the provision image. In this manner, the computing device  may be provisioned to carry out a desired functionality associated with the provision image.","At block , after provisioning the computing device  with the provision image, the computing device  reboots itself in order to load the provision image. In this illustrative embodiment, the computing device  loads the software contained within the provision image from a storage. As such, the computing device  is able to implement the functionality associated with the provision image. The routine  may then end.","It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art and others that all of the functions described in this disclosure may be embodied in software executed by one or more processors of the disclosed components and mobile communication devices. The software may be persistently stored in any type of non-volatile storage.","Conditional language, such as, among others, \u201ccan,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cmight,\u201d or \u201cmay,\u201d unless specifically stated otherwise, or otherwise understood within the context as used, is generally intended to convey that certain embodiments include, while other embodiments do not include, certain features, elements and\/or steps.
