{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This invention generally relates to a method and system for providing dispute resolution for credit card or other electronic payment transactions, including but not limited to, debit card, ACH, eCheck, LEC transactions, etc. More specifically, the invention provides a method and system for allowing card issuers or other electronic payment provider to automatically remove cardholders or other purchasers from recurring payment programs and to issue credits to cardholders for disputed credit card transactions, if appropriate transaction parameters are satisfied, and to decline such credit requests when the transaction parameters are not satisfied.","Credit cards and other payment instruments, such as debit cards and check cards, are widely used by holders to purchase goods and services in the marketplace. It is projected that at least 35% of all U.S. cardholder payments in 2007 will be made via \u201cplastic\u201d (i.e., a credit or debit card), and it is estimated that this rate will increase to at least 49% by 2010. The current annual value of these transactions exceeds 400 billion dollars. While credit card transactions are convenient for cardholders, they present a special set of problems for merchants and credit card issuers. One such problem occurs when a cardholder disputes a credit card transaction, necessitating the expenditure of substantial time and resources in investigating and resolving such disputes.","Cardholders and other purchasers using an electronic payment provider are increasingly going directly to their card issuer to resolve billing disputes rather than contacting the merchant directly. This trend toward chargebacks that are initiated with out any prior contact with the merchant by the cardholder results in inefficient resolution of such disputes because when the merchant is not directly involved in the resolution process, the card issuer must undertake the resolution activities on behalf of the merchant, thus increasing the complexity, time and expense of the resolution process.","To understand the problem presented by credit card and other electronic payment provider transaction disputes, a brief overview of the electronic payment provider process is required. Credit cards are provided to a cardholder by an issuing bank. When a cardholder enters into a transaction with a merchant using the credit card, the issuing bank commits to pay the merchant at the time the transaction is verified.","Each month, the credit card user is sent a statement documenting the purchases made with the card, and the total balance owed. According to the Fair Credit Billing Act, the cardholder can dispute any charges on the statement that he or she thinks are incorrect. The cardholder may or may not have contacted the merchant about remedying the situation before contacting the issuing bank.","The chargeback process varies somewhat from credit card company to credit card company, but generally follows the sequence shown in . At step , a credit card holder disputes a transaction with their issuing bank. At step , the issuing bank investigates to determine whether the chargeback request is valid, and if it is not, denies the chargeback. At step , a provisional credit representing the amount charged is placed back in the user's account. At step , the issuing bank initiates a chargeback process and obtains credit representing the chargeback purchase from the merchant's bank. At step , the merchant's bank investigates the chargeback request to determine if it is valid, and, if not, the chargeback is returned to the issuing bank. If the merchant's bank determines the chargeback is valid, at step , the chargeback amount is removed from the merchant's bank account, and the merchant's bank provides written notice to the merchant. At step , the merchant is given an opportunity to refute the chargeback, and, if its documentation is satisfactory, the chargeback is declined and the cardholder is once again charged for the sale. If the chargeback is not declined, the chargeback is successful and the process is completed.","The present invention provides a card issuer or other electronic payment provider with a system and method for obtaining a quick, favorable and efficient resolution to the customers' disputes with merchants, thus reducing operating expenses, while providing superior customer service. The present invention may also be used simultaneously with one or more of various types of electronic payments offered by card issuers or other electronic payment providers, such as credit card, debit card, ACH, eCheck, mobile payments, LEC, etc., transactions, and with one or more payment brands or networks within each type of electronic payment transactions, such as within credit card electronic payment transactions, providing simultaneous use with Visa, MC, Amex, Discover and JCB card transactions. The present invention thus provides multiple connectivity to a plurality of various types of electronic payment networks, such as credit card, debit card, ACH, eCheck, mobile payments, LEC, etc., and with one or more payment brands or networks within each type of electronic payment transactions.","The present invention allows issuers to obtain a quick turnaround in cardholder credit processing with minimal resource expenditure. For recurring payment program merchants, cardholders are removed from the recurring payment program, which prevents submission of future authorization requests, thus eliminating the potential for future disputes. The present invention thereby significantly reduces the time and cost required for the card issuer to resolve cardholder transaction disputes, while delivering a favorable resolution to the cardholder.","In one preferred embodiment, shown in , the system and method of the present invention are illustrated. The payment instrument holder initiates a notice of dispute to the card issuer and submits the necessary transaction information by internet, mail, fax, email, in-person, via SMS mobile text, mobile phone or by telephone, through the touchtone keypad of the phone, or by responding orally wherein the system utilizes voice recognition software (IVR) to convert voice data into computer readable data.","The card issuer or device associated with the card issuer terminal, such as a scanner or IVR system, inputs the transaction information into the card issuer terminal for processing by the card issuer processing system.","The card issuer processing system sends a queue of eligible transactions to the dispute resolution system server for processing. This request includes the transaction data that is required for adjudication of the dispute regarding the transaction, such as credit card number, transaction amount, transaction date and merchant identification. The dispute resolution system determines if the transaction qualifies for resolution under the system and, if so, directs the issuance of the credit to the cardholder for the transaction, cancels the transaction, and sends reports of the results of the dispute resolution to the card issuer and the originating merchant. The present invention may be used with multiple card types, card issuers, merchants and payment types, such as ACH, mobile payments, LEC billing, etc.","Reference is now made to the figures in which like reference numerals refer to like elements.","In the following description, certain specific details of programming, software modules, user selections, network transactions, database queries, database structures, etc., are provided for a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc.","In some cases, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail in order to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention. Furthermore, the described features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.","In one preferred embodiment, shown in , the system and method of the present invention are illustrated.","As shown in , the system of the present invention preferably includes a dispute resolution server , which is linked to a card issuer's computer processing system  by an application programming interface on the card issuer's computer system. The interface obtains transaction details necessary to implement the dispute resolution process, including credit card number, credit card expiration date, cardholder name and address, transaction amount and merchant identification, such as merchant name, phone number, URL, or merchant acquirer bank identification.","The interface is connected to the dispute resolution server  by a data transmission link, such as the Internet, or other electronic file transfer protocols such as FTP, SFTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, TELNET, SSH, XML, REST, or JSON as examples.","The interface preferably is connected to the dispute resolution server  by data transmission link, such as the Internet, telephone line or network cable. The interface may transfer transaction data to the server in batch files or by single transaction record using electronic file transfer protocols such as FTP, SFTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, TELNET, SSH, XML, REST, or JSON as examples. Either \u201cnighttime\u201d batch file transfer or real time transfer by API may be used for these files.","Alternatively, the system of the present invention may be operated on the card issuer's computer  which is connected via the Internet or other communication network to the dispute resolution program server .","As shown in , the cardholder initiating the dispute may submit the relevant information to the card issuer by telephone , fax , or by e-mail, SMS, on-line or other electronic medium using a computer  or mobile device , such as cellular telephone, standard landline, PDA, or pager. The cardholder may alternatively submit the dispute information by mail or in-person communication.","The cardholder is equipped with a processing device , such as a PC or laptop, which is programmed to receive and process data related to disputed transactions. The dispute data may be input into appropriate electronic format manually by the card issuer's employee using an input device, such as a keyboard or mouse, or it may be converted directly from the cardholder's input by IVR in the case of a telephone notice, by OCR in the case of a mail or fax notice, or directly from electronic input in the case of on-line submissions.","The card issuer processing device  preferably transmits a batch file containing one or more dispute items to the dispute resolution system server  via one of the previously described data transmission links and electronic file transfer protocols. The dispute resolution system will process the file and return a response back to the card issuer processing device  via the same link and format to confirm receipt of the file.","The dispute resolution system will also generate a response concerning the disputed transaction to the originating merchant's processing device  via previously described data transmission links and electronic file transfer protocols. The dispute resolution system server  also serves as the payment processing system for the merchant. Thus, in the capacity of payment processing system for the merchant, the dispute resolution system server  receives transactions from the merchant, forwards received transactions to acquirers , and stores transaction data. As is known in the art, acquirer  is a merchant's acquiring bank which is a banking or financial institution which provides the merchant with a merchant processing account for the processing of electronic transactions originating from the merchant's customers. The acquirer  sends transaction information to the payment networks, such as Visa, MC, Amex, Discover and JCB which connect the Issuer and the Acquirer, and provide a clearing and settlement service to transfer payment information between the Issuer and the Acquirer. Because the dispute resolution system server  also serves as the payment processing system for the merchant, the present invention offers the advantage of immediately declining future transactions from the merchant for the disputing consumer, including terminating ongoing recurring transactions. This prevents the recurrence of such disputed transactions while the dispute relating to the current disputed transaction is resolved.","As shown in , the process begins at step  with the cardholder initiating the dispute by providing notice of the dispute to the card issuer. The cardholder may submit the dispute to the issuer by telephone, mail, fax, e-mail or on-line. On-line submissions may be facilitated by the card issuer in the provision of a link in an on-line statement provided to the cardholder of a pop-up-form. This link may connect the cardholder to the card issuer's processing system, or alternatively directly to the merchant with whom the transaction was initiated. This latter alternative allows the cardholder to mediate the dispute directly with the merchant.","Once the chargeback dispute template is completed by the cardholder, they can select the submit button and the system will use the template to generate a standard charge dispute form, which includes all the necessary information to dispute a charge.","This information may be submitted by the cardholder with the following statement:\n\n","At step , the card issuer inputs the data relating to the notice of dispute received from the card issuer. The dispute data includes such information regarding the transaction, such as:\n\n","At step , upon receipt of the dispute notification, the Issuer processor  determines whether the dispute is eligible for processing by the Dispute Resolution System by matching the disputed transaction details extracted by the Issuer from interchange data against a table of identifiers for participating merchants provided by the Dispute Resolution System. The table may be periodically updated by a data transmission, preferably by secure batch file transmission such as FTPS (FTP over SSL), although other types of file transmission may be used, such as e-mail of Excel spreadsheet files or physical transfer of electronic storage media, including DVD or CD\/ROM.","Preferably, at steps ,  and , the card issuer system also screens disputes for ineligible transactions based on the predetermined transaction-level eligibility requirements such as whether the transaction was previously refunded or refunded by the merchant and\/or the dispute resolution system provider at step , whether the transaction has a Central Processing Date (CPD) greater than a predetermined interval, such as 120 days from the date of the dispute resolution system dispute request, at step , and whether the transaction originated with a merchant who receives chargeback protection, as chargeback rights do not exist for the card Issuer against the merchant in such case in step . As may be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the eligibility criteria which are tested at steps ,  and  may vary for different card issuers, depending upon their specific preferences. For example, eligibility criteria may also be determined according to the identity of the originating merchant, depending upon the Card Issuer's preference. Further, whether the transaction has a Central Processing Date (CPD) greater than a predetermined maximum interval, such as 120 days from the date of the dispute resolution system dispute request, may also be used to determine eligibility. As may be understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art, the 120 day maximum interval from the date of the transaction to the date of the dispute resolution system dispute request is offered only as an example, and this interval may be adjusted as desired by the Card Issuer.","At step  disputes which return a match when referencing the merchant eligibility table, and which do not violate the transaction-level criteria are flagged as Dispute Resolution System eligible and sorted into a separate queue within the Issuer's system prior to processing by the Dispute Resolution System. The Dispute Resolution System request file is generated and supplied by the Issuer as specified below and transmitted via internet for Dispute Resolution System processing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0045"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Field Name","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Issuer ID","Predefined Issuer identification value"]},{"entry":[{},"provided by system to identify the Issuer"]},{"entry":[{},"submitting the dispute request file"]},{"entry":["Transaction Description","Merchant DBA\/payment billing descriptor"]},{"entry":["Billing Descriptor Phone","Billing descriptor merchant phone number"]},{"entry":["Number","parsed from Transaction Description or City"]},{"entry":[{},"Name field"]},{"entry":"Acquiring Institution"},{"entry":"Identification Code"},{"entry":"Card Acceptor"},{"entry":"Identification Code"},{"entry":"Card Acceptor Terminal"},{"entry":"Identification"},{"entry":"Card Acceptor"},{"entry":"Name\/Location -"},{"entry":"Merchant Name"},{"entry":"Card Acceptor"},{"entry":"Name\/Location - City"},{"entry":"Name"},{"entry":"Card Acceptor"},{"entry":"Name\/Location -"},{"entry":"Country Code"},{"entry":"Merchant Type\/MCC"},{"entry":"POS Entry Mode"},{"entry":"POS Condition Mode"},{"entry":["First Name","Cardholder first name"]},{"entry":["Last Name","Cardholder last name"]},{"entry":["Billing Street Address 1","Cardholder billing street address 1"]},{"entry":["Billing Street Address 2","Cardholder billing street address 2"]},{"entry":["Billing City","Cardholder billing city"]},{"entry":["Billing State","Cardholder billing state"]},{"entry":["Billing Zip","Cardholder billing zip"]},{"entry":["Payment Type","\u201cvisa\u201d, \u201cmastercard\u201d, \u201camex\u201d, \u201cdiscover\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cjcb\u201d, or \u201cdiners\u201d"]},{"entry":["Account Number","Full or Hashed CC Number.
