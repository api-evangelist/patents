{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application describes systems and techniques relating to spas, for example, a spa headrest.","Conventional spa headrests are often cushions or pillows that are static in design. When a soft material is used to construct the headrests in a spa, these headrests typically harden or degrade over time as the original soft material is exposed to harsh weather and the water environment inside the spa, providing lower comfort levels as the product wears in the course of its normal life cycle. Some spa pillows have also added a mechanical deflection cushioning component, as opposed to just compression cushioning, by removing some of the material of the pillow fixed to the spa wall, so that the front surface of the pillow is suspended away from the spa wall. Additionally, various fully suspended spa headrests have been used that provide dynamic flexion between dual post fasteners to provide suspension cushioning, where the spa headrest only contacts the spa wall through the dual post fasteners.","The present disclosure includes systems and techniques relating to a flexing support in a spa, such as a flexing spa headrest. According to an aspect, a system includes a surface defining a multi-level recess including a primary recess and secondary mounting recesses, and a pillow including a flexible concave pad and mounts that couple the flexible concave pad with the surface, the secondary mounting recesses receiving the mounts such that the flexible concave pad is suspended above the primary recess, a curved edge of the flexible concave pad contacts the surface, and the flexible concave pad mechanically flexes concavely between the mounts and about the curved edge when force is applied.","One or more of the following advantages may be provided. A flexing spa headrest can enable a large variety of users to have a spa cushion that adjusts to their different head pressures and head sizes, and that promotes correct posture and head positioning. The flexing headrest can function the same when in water or when dry, enabling a potential buyer to see and feel the benefits of the improved headrest before a purchase is made. The flexing headrest can be suspended from two fixed points and flex with respect with those points to provide mechanical motion that actually cradles the head. This can create a very soft and interactive headrest that relieves under pressure, as a pillow does, adjusting to the different needs of spa users. The mechanical flexing movement can automatically give the headrest a very soft feel, irrespective of the material used to construct the headrest, and can create a higher level of comfort during use, while also providing high durability and a long life span. Moreover, the headrest design and materials can result in easy assembly.","Details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages may be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.","The systems and techniques described here relate to spa headrests. As used herein, the term \u201cspa\u201d means a tub used for relaxation, invigoration or health, and can include a device for moving water in the tub; the term \u201cspa\u201d includes hot tubs, bathtubs, whirlpool baths, in-ground spas, free-standing spas, swim spas, and spas and pools generally, regardless of size.  is a top view of an example spa  with two flexing spa headrests . The headrests  can be part of the spa seats in the spa , providing cushions for users to rest their heads against during spa use (e.g., hydrotherapy). Although referred to as a headrest, the described and claimed system can also be used to support other body parts (e.g., as a support in a seat or a back cushion). The spa  can have any shape and any number of seats in any manner of arrangements. The headrest can be used with all spa seats, regardless of position, including a spa seat in a lounge position.","When in use, the headrests  can flex in response to applied pressure. The headrests  can move in a flexure manner, providing spa users with a comfortable head cushion that adjusts to each particular user. The headrest can physically move in a flexure way when the user rests their head against the headrest; the headrest can act as a pillow, in that the headrest can give way to the weight of a person's head. Thus, the headrest can cradle the person's head and give a very soft feeling of comfort to the user, even when the headrest material itself is not soft. The headrests  can flex into a cavity defined by a surface included in the spa . This recess is positioned and angled to promote good spine alignment in a seat. This spine alignment promotes good head position and allows the user to further enjoy the benefits of hydrotherapy. This pillow\/recess angle changes, depending on the seat design. The recess is a multi-level recess described further below.","The surface defining the multi-level recess can be integral to the spa . For example, the spa  can be a free-standing spa, and the surface can be a part of the spa shell. Alternatively, the surface defining the multi-level recess can be part of a separate apparatus that connects to the spa wall. For example, the spa  can include a housing that includes the surface. The housing can couple with the spa wall, can be adjustable, and can be removed when needed. An example of such a housing is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,682,625, issued Nov. 4, 1997 and entitled \u201cHOT TUB WITH ADJUSTABLE HEADREST WITH WATER JET\u201d, which is hereby incorporated by reference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["200","200","200","200","210","220","220","220","200"]},"The mounts  can allow the headrest to flex when in use. The pad  can include a curved flexible cushion  that flexes concavely between the mounts . The cushion  can be made of a soft pliable material with a thin cross section (e.g., Urethane and\/or Silicone, or EVA (Ethylene Vinyl Acetate), with an approximate thickness of 0.25 to 0.7 inches). An applied weight causes the cushion  to flex into the cavity behind it and around the head. At least part of the cushion effect of the cushion  can come from the mechanical motion of the pad  under weight, and thus the cushion  need not be made of an extremely soft material, due to the multi-level recess's ability to allow a material (even stiffer ones) to move past the adjacent surfaces of the shell causing a flexure motion. The flexure movement allows the cushion  to adjust to the different pressures of a large variety of users, and the flexure movement generally does not deteriorate over time. Thus, the headrest  can provide a higher quality, longer lasting product than traditional spa headrests.","The mounts  can couple with the pad  in a cantilevered fashion. The mounts  can be flexible pins that have a flange , a proximate end  having a surface defining holding feature, such as a thread (e.g., a screw shape), and a distal end  having a surface defining a slot or slots. The distal end of the pin can be a bendable boss that can be inserted into a receiving secondary recess of a spa surface (e.g., a spa wall, a spa headrest housing or a cup). The pins work in tandem with the mounting boss on the pillow to interact with the multi-level recess in such a way to promote mechanical movement. The pin is mounted into the secondary recess, as described further below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["200","200","200","240","200","200","200","200","230"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 9","FIG. 10"],"b":["800","800","800","800","810","810","820","820"]},"The surface can be made part of an apparatus that attaches to a spa, as shown, or the surface can be made part of a spa wall directly. Additionally, the housing  can include mounts  used to attach the housing  to a spa. The housing  can also include holes, such as a hole , through which jets can expel water for hydrotherapy in the spa. Alternative housing configurations are also possible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 12","FIG. 13","FIG. 14","FIG. 15","FIG. 16","FIG. 17","FIG. 16"],"b":["800","200","800","200","800","200","800","200","800","200","800","200","800","200","1710","800","1710","1720","800"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 19"],"b":["800","200","1720","800","800","200","1720","1710","800"]},"As illustrated in , a spa surface defines a multi-level recess including a primary recess  and secondary mounting recesses . The multi-level recess design allows a mechanical flexing action to occur when used with the pillow . The multi-level recess design works in connection with the pillow to create a higher level of comfort for a user of the spa. The pillow  can be mounted in a molded plastic carrier or other spa surface, such as a spa wall or shell.","The mechanical flexing movement properties of the pillow connected with the spa surface defining the multi-level recess is created by the interaction of the pillow and the primary and secondary recesses. The pillow is mounted into the two secondary mounting recesses  that are inside the primary recess . The boss height of the pillow mounting pins allow the main body of the pillow to float above the primary recess . The primary recess  works in tandem with the main body of the pillow. The curved edges of the pillow's main body contact the primary recess  in such a manner that a mechanical flexing action occurs when a load or pressure is applied at or near the centerline of the pillow. The curved edges of the pillow contact the primary recess  through the round bearing edges  of the pillow. The round bearing edges  of the pillow can be put in full contact with the compound curved edge of the primary recess  by carefully calculating the height of the mounting boss and pin. When the pillow pin  is mounted in the secondary recess , the depth helps the round bearing edge  conform to the primary recess  surface. The round bearing edge  works with the design of the edge of the pillow . The stiff sidewalls of the pillow  and round bearing edge  works together with the primary recess  and secondary recess  as a system to promote the flexure of the pillow area . This full bearing edge contact helps set up the flexure\/mechanical movement of the design, providing a unique relationship between the pillow and the multi-level recess design.","The curve of the primary recess  is based on ergonomics and anthropometric data (sizes and curves of user's head) to allow a large variety of users to fit the pillow. Anthropometric data from the 1 percentile to the 99 percentile was used to design the curves. Design using these extremes allows the design to support the largest number of users. The overall angle of the multi-level recess is also taken into consideration to promote correct posture and head positioning. The angle of the pillow and multi-level recess is substantially parallel (e.g., within 5 degrees) to the back angle of a seat; the goal of the angles being to promote correct alignment of the neck, shoulders, and head. By providing the correct angles for the multi-level recess, unnecessary neck tension, which might otherwise occur when the pillow\/recess system is in use, can be prevented.","The pillow and multi-level recesses work in tandem to provide a very comfortable headrest. The secondary recesses  have a size and height that are matched to that of the mounts on the rear of the pillow. The main body of the pillow is also designed to conform to the primary recess  and to flex along its edges. The secondary recesses  inside of the primary recess  can be stepped as shown (i.e., stepped away from the primary recess ), or the secondary recesses  can be stepped further to provide additional levels for mounting or comfort characteristics (e.g., there can be a tertiary recess stepped away from the secondary recess). The tandem design achieves a headrest\/pillow that has enhanced comfort and user characteristics. This pillow system has a very soft feel and is able to maintain this characteristic throughout the product's lifespan. Even in the event of failure, the system is easily reestablished with the replacement of the pillow component. The multi-level recess component is durable and is unlikely to fail. The multi-level recess design can be used in an injection molded design as well as a thermoformed spa shell.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIGS. 20-33","FIGS. 2-19","FIGS. 20-33","FIGS. 20-33"],"b":["200","800"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 34","b":["200","800","100"]},"Other embodiments may be within the scope of the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIGS. 2 & 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIGS. 2 & 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIGS. 2 & 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIGS. 20-33","FIGS. 2-19"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 34"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIGS. 35-38","FIGS. 14-17"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
