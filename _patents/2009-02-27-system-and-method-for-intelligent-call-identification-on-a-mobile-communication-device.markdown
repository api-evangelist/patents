{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present application relates generally to mobile communication devices, and more particularly to systems and methods for identifying the communication type of an incoming communication on a mobile communication device.","Many mobile devices are capable of retrieving and displaying identifying information about an incoming communication to the user of the mobile device. This identifying information may aid the user in determining whether to accept a communication at that time. However, the information provided by the mobile device in response to an incoming communication is generally very limited. For example, many mobile devices only provide the number and possibly a name associated with the originator of an incoming telephone call, if it is available. Such information may not be sufficient information for a user to determine whether or not to accept the incoming communication at that time. This is particularly true where, for example, there is a communication already in progress on the mobile device. For example, the user may recognize the name and\/or number associated with an incoming communication but lack information about the urgency of the communication and, particularly, the urgency of the communication as compared to the ongoing communication. In other situations, the user of the mobile device may not recognize the name and\/or number of the incoming communication and, thus, will have no useful information at all on which to base the decision to accept the communication.","Similar reference numerals may have been used in different figures to denote similar components.","In one aspect, the present application provides a mobile device adapted for communication with an enterprise telecommunications network. The mobile device comprises: a processor for controlling operations of the mobile device and communications between the mobile device and other devices; a memory coupled to the processor; a communication subsystem adapted for receiving communications and associated information from the enterprise telecommunications network; at least one display for displaying information of the mobile device; a communication identifying module resident in the memory for execution by the processor, the communication identifying module being configured to cause the processor to determine a communication type for an incoming communication received by the communication subsystem, based on the associated information; and a display module for displaying information relating to the communication type on the at least one display. The communication type comprises at least one of two or more possible communication types and the two or more possible communication types comprise at least one feature-based communication type.","In another aspect, the present application provides a method of displaying information regarding an incoming communication on a mobile communications device, the method executed by at least one processor on the mobile communications device, the mobile communications device comprising a communications subsystem and at least one display. The method comprises: receiving, from the communication subsystem, data representing signals representing information about an incoming communication; causing execution of a communication identifying module resident in a memory associated with the processor to determine a communication type of two or more possible communication types and the two or more possible communication types comprising at least one feature-based communication type; and causing the at least one display to display information relating to the communication type.","Other aspects of the present application will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings.","Embodiments of the present application are not limited to any particular operating system, mobile device architecture, server architecture, or computer programming language.","The present application relates to the control and management of communications. Although reference may be made to \u201ccalls\u201d in the description of example embodiments below, it will be appreciated that the described systems and methods are applicable to session-based communications in general and not limited to voice calls. It will also be appreciated that the systems and methods may not be limited to sessions and may be applicable to messaging-based communications in some embodiments.","Reference is now made to , which shows, in block diagram form, an example system, generally designated , for the control and management of communications. The system  includes an enterprise or business system , which in many embodiments includes a local area network (LAN). In the description below, the enterprise or business system  may be referred to as an enterprise network . It will be appreciated that the enterprise network  may include more than one network and may be located in multiple geographic areas in some embodiments.","The enterprise network  may be connected, often through a firewall , to a wide area network (WAN) , such as the Internet. The enterprise network  may also be connected to a public switched telephone network (PSTN)  via direct inward dialing (DID) trunks or primary rate interface (PRI) trunks.","The enterprise network  may also communicate with a public land mobile network (PLMN) , which may also be referred to as a wireless wide area network (WWAN) or, in some cases, a cellular network. The connection with the PLMN  may be made via a relay , as known in the art.","The enterprise network  may also provide a wireless local area network (WLAN) featuring wireless access points. Other WLANs  may exist outside the enterprise network . For example, WLAN may be connected to WAN .","The system  may include a number of enterprise-associated mobile devices  (only one shown). The mobile devices  may include devices equipped for cellular communication through the PLMN , mobile devices equipped for Wi-Fi communications over one of the WLANs , or dual-mode devices capable of both cellular and WLAN communications. WLANs  may be configured in accordance with one of the IEEE 802.11 specifications.","It will be understood that the mobile devices  include one or more radio transceivers and associated processing hardware and software to enable wireless communications with the PLMN  and\/or one of the WLANs . In various embodiments, the PLMN  and mobile devices  may be configured to operate in compliance with any one or more of a number of wireless protocols, including GSM, GPRS, CDMA, EDGE, UMTS, EvDO, HSPA, 3GPP, or a variety of others. It will be appreciated that the mobile device  may roam within the PLMN  and across PLMNs, in known manner, as the user moves. In some instances, the dual-mode mobile devices  and\/or the enterprise network  are configured to facilitate roaming between the PLMN  and a WLAN , and are thus capable of seamlessly transferring sessions (such as voice calls) from a connection with the cellular interface of the dual-mode device  to the WLAN  interface of the dual-mode device , and vice versa.","The enterprise network  typically includes a number of networked servers, computers, and other devices. For example, the enterprise network  may connect one or more desktop or laptop computers  (one shown). The connection may be wired or wireless in some embodiments. The enterprise network  may also connect to one or more digital telephone sets  (one shown).","The enterprise network  may include one or more mail servers, such as mail server , for coordinating the transmission, storage, and receipt of electronic messages for client devices operating within the enterprise network . Typical mail servers include the Microsoft Exchange Server\u2122 and the IBM Lotus Domino\u2122 server. Each user within the enterprise typically has at least one user account within the enterprise network . Associated with each user account is message address information, such as an e-mail address. Messages addressed to a user message address are stored on the enterprise network  in the mail server . The messages may be retrieved by the user using a messaging application, such as an e-mail client application. The messaging application may be operating on a user's computer  connected to the enterprise network  within the enterprise. In some embodiments, the user may be permitted to access stored messages using a remote computer, for example at another location via the WAN  using a VPN connection. Using the messaging application, the user may also compose and send messages addressed to others, within or outside the enterprise network . The messaging application causes the mail server  to send a composed message to the addressee, often via the WAN .","The relay  serves to route messages received over the PLMN  from the mobile device  to the corresponding enterprise network . The relay  also pushes messages from the enterprise network  to the mobile device  via the PLMN .","The enterprise network  also includes an enterprise server . Together with the relay , the enterprise server  functions to redirect or relay incoming e-mail messages addressed to a user's e-mail address within the enterprise network  to the user's mobile device  and to relay incoming e-mail messages composed and sent via the mobile device  out to the intended recipients within the WAN  or elsewhere. The enterprise server  and relay  together facilitate \u201cpush\u201d e-mail service for the mobile device  enabling the user to send and receive e-mail messages using the mobile device  as though the user were connected to an e-mail client within the enterprise network  using the user's enterprise-related e-mail address, for example on computer .","As is typical in many enterprises, the enterprise network  includes a Private Branch exchange (although in various embodiments the PBX may be a standard PBX or an IP-PBX, for simplicity the description below uses the term PBX to refer to both)  having a connection with the PSTN  for routing incoming and outgoing voice calls for the enterprise. The PBX  is connected to the PSTN  via DID trunks or PRI trunks, for example. The PBX  may use ISDN signaling protocols for setting up and tearing down circuit-switched connections through the PSTN  and related signaling and communications. In some embodiments, the PBX  may be connected to one or more conventional analog telephones . The PBX  is also connected to the enterprise network  and, through it, to telephone terminal devices, such as digital telephone sets , softphones operating on computers , etc. Within the enterprise, each individual may have an associated extension number, sometimes referred to as a PNP (private numbering plan), or direct dial phone number. Calls outgoing from the PBX  to the PSTN  or incoming from the PSTN  to the PBX  are typically circuit-switched calls. Within the enterprise, e.g. between the PBX  and terminal devices, voice calls are often packet-switched calls, for example Voice-over-IP (VoIP) calls.","The enterprise network  may further include a Service Management Platform (SMP)  for performing some aspects of messaging or session control, like call control and advanced call processing features. The SMP  may, in some cases, also perform some media handling. Collectively the SMP  and PBX  may be referred to as the enterprise communications platform, generally designated . It will be appreciated that the enterprise communications platform  and, in particular, the SMP , is implemented on one or more servers having suitable communications interfaces for connecting to and communicating with the PBX  and\/or DID\/PRI trunks. Although the SMP  may be implemented on a stand-alone server, it will be appreciated that it may be implemented into an existing control agent\/server as a logical software component. As will be described below, the SMP  may be implemented as a multi-layer platform.","The enterprise communications platform  implements the switching to connect session legs and may provide the conversion between, for example, a circuit-switched call and a VoIP call, or to connect legs of other media sessions. In some embodiments, in the context of voice calls the enterprise communications platform  provides a number of additional functions including automated attendant, interactive voice response, call forwarding, voice mail, etc. It may also implement certain usage restrictions on enterprise users, such as blocking international calls or 1-900 calls. In many embodiments, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) may be used to set-up, manage, and terminate media sessions for voice calls. Other protocols may also be employed by the enterprise communications platform , for example, Web Services, Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) protocol, Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), and various custom Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), as will be described in greater detail below.","One of the functions of the enterprise communications platform  is to extend the features of enterprise telephony to the mobile devices . For example, the enterprise communications platform  may allow the mobile device  to perform functions akin to those normally available on a standard office telephone, such as the digital telephone set  or analog telephone set . Example features may include direct extension dialing, enterprise voice mail, conferencing, call transfer, call park, etc.","Reference is now made to , which show example embodiments of the enterprise communications system . Again, although references are made below to \u201ccalls\u201d or call-centric features, it will be appreciated that the architectures and systems depicted and described are applicable to session-based communications in general and, in some instances, to messaging-based communications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["16","18","60","60","16","18"]},"In this embodiment, the SMP  assumes control over both call processing and the media itself. This architecture may be referred to as \u201cFirst Party Call Control\u201d. Many of the media handling functions normally implemented by the PBX  are handled by the SMP  in this architecture. Incoming calls addressed to any extension or direct dial number within the enterprise, for example, are always first routed to the SMP . Thereafter, a call leg is established from the SMP  to the called party within the enterprise, and the two legs are bridged. Accordingly, the SMP  includes a digital trunk interface  and a digital signal processing (DSP) conferencing bridge . The DSP conferencing bridge  performs the bridging of calls for implementation of various call features, such as conferencing, call transfer, etc. The digital trunk interface  may be implemented as a plurality of telephonic cards, e.g. Intel Dialogic cards, interconnected by a bus and operating under the control of a processor. The digital trunk interface  may also be partly implemented using a processor module such as, for example, a Host Media Processing (HMP) processor.","The SMP  may include various scripts  for managing call processing. The scripts  are implemented as software modules, routines, functions, etc., stored in non-volatile memory and executed by the processor of the SMP . The scripts  may implement call flow logic, business logic, user preferences, call service processes, and various feature applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["14","16","18","18","18"]},"The call control server  is coupled to the PBX , for example through the LAN, enabling packet-based communications and, more specifically, IP-based communications. In one embodiment, communications between the PBX  and the call control server  are carried out in accordance with SIP. In other words, the call control server  uses SIP-based communications to manage the set up, tear down, and control of media handled by the PBX . In one example embodiment, the call control server  may employ a communications protocol conforming to the ECMA-269 or ECMA-323 standards for Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications (CSTA).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["14","18","74","74","18","72","76","72","76","72","74"]},"The SIP server  interacts with the media server  using SIP-based media handling commands. For example, the SIP server  and media server  may communicate using Media Server Markup Language (MSML) as defined in IETF document Saleem A., \u201cMedia Server Markup Language\u201d, Internet Draft, draft-saleem-msml-07, Aug. 7, 2008. The media server  may be configured to perform Host Media Processing (HMP).","Other architectures or configurations for the enterprise communications system  will be appreciated by those ordinarily skilled in the art.","Reference is now made to , collectively referred to as , which shows another embodiment of the enterprise communications system  with a Third Party Call Control architecture. In this embodiment, the SMP  is a multi-layer platform that includes a protocol layer , a services layer  and an application layer . The protocol layer  includes a plurality of interface protocols configured for enabling operation of corresponding applications in the application layer . The services layer  includes a plurality of services that can be leveraged by the interface protocols to create richer applications. Finally, the application layer  includes a plurality of applications that are exposed out to the communication devices and that leverage corresponding ones of the services and interface protocols for enabling the applications.","Specifically, the protocol layer  preferably includes protocols which allow media to be controlled separate from data. For example, the protocol layer  can include, among other things, a Session Initiation Protocol or SIP , a Web Services protocol , an Application Programming Interface or API , a Computer Telephony Integration protocol or CTI , and a Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions or SIMPLE protocol . It is contemplated that the interface protocols - are plug-ins that can interface directly with corresponding servers in the enterprise network , which will be further described below.","For the purposes of this disclosure, SIP  will be utilized, although it is appreciated that the system  can operate using the above disclosed or additional protocols. As known by those of ordinary skill in the art, SIP is the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) standard for multimedia session management, and more specifically is an application-layer control protocol for establishing, maintaining, modifying and terminating multimedia sessions between two or more endpoints. As further known by those of ordinary skill in the art, the SIP protocol  includes two interfaces for signaling: SIP-Trunk (hereinafter referred to as \u201cSIP-T\u201d) and SIP-Line (hereinafter referred to as \u201cSIP-L\u201d). Specifically, the SIP-T interface is utilized when the endpoint is a non-specific entity or not registered (i.e., when communicating between two network entities). In contrast, the SIP-L interface is utilized when the endpoint is registered (i.e., when dialing to a specific extension). The specific operation of the system  utilizing SIP  will be described in further detail below.","The SMP  also includes a plurality of enablers, among other things, a VoIP enabler , a Fixed Mobile Convergence or FMC enabler , a conference services enabler , a presence enabler  and an Instant Messaging or IM enabler . Each of the enablers - are used by corresponding services in the services layer  that combine one or more of the enablers. Each of the applications in the application layer  is then combined with one or more of the services to perform the desired application. For example, a phone call service may use the VoIP or PBX enabler, and an emergency response application may use the phone call service, an Instant Messenger service, a video call service, and email service and\/or a conference service.","The application layer  may include a conference services application  that, together with the conference services enabler , enables multiple communication devices (including desk telephones and personal computers) to participate in a conference call through use of a centralized conference server . As seen in , the conference server  is provided in the enterprise network  and is in communication with the conference services enabler  preferably through the SIP protocol , although it is recognized that additional protocols that control media separate from data may be appropriate, such as the Web Services protocol  or the CTI protocol . As will be described in further detail below, the conference call server  is configured for directing media and data streams to and from one or more communication devices (i.e., mobile devices , telephones , and computers ).","Reference is now made to , which shows a block diagram illustrating a mobile device  suitable for use in the system  described above in relation to .","In some embodiments mobile device  is a two-way mobile communication device having at least voice and data communication capabilities, including the capability to communicate with other computer systems. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device , it may be referred to as, for example, a data messaging device, a two-way pager, a cellular telephone with data messaging capabilities, a wireless Internet appliance, a data communication device (with or without telephony capabilities), a clamshell device, or a flip-phone. A mobile device  may communicate with any one or more of a plurality of fixed transceiver stations within its geographic coverage area.","A mobile device  may incorporate a communication subsystem , which can include a receiver , a transmitter , and associated components, such as one or more antenna elements  and , local oscillators (LOs) , and a processing module such as a digital signal processor (DSP) . In various embodiments, the antenna elements  and  may be embedded or internal to the mobile device . As will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant arts, the particular design of the communication subsystem  depends on the system(s), such as enterprise network , the PLMN  and\/or the WLANs , with which the mobile device  is intended to communicate.","A mobile device  may send and receive communication signals to and from an enterprise server  through, for example, the PLMN  and\/or one of the WLANs . Signals received by the antenna  are input to the receiver , which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., as well as analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . Signals to be transmitted may be processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP . DSP-processed signals may be input to the transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification, and transmission via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but can also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example, gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","Network access may be associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile device  via a memory module, such as a memory module , which may be a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for use in a GSM network or a Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) card for use in a Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). The SIM card may be inserted in or connected to an interface  of the mobile device . Alternatively, the mobile device  may have an integrated identity module for use with systems such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems.","The mobile device  can also include a battery interface  for receiving one or more rechargeable batteries . Battery(ies)  provide electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile device , and the battery interface  provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+ to the circuitry of the mobile device .","The mobile device  can include a microprocessor  which controls the overall operation of the mobile device . Communication functions, including at least data and voice communications, are performed through the communication subsystem . The microprocessor  also interacts with additional device subsystems such as one or more display(s) , flash memory(ies) , random access memory(ies) (RAM(s)) , read-only memory(ies) (ROM(s)) , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , data port such(s) as Universal Serial Bus (USB) port(s) , keyboard(s) or keypad(s) , speaker(s) or audio port(s)  for connecting to, for example, a set of headphones or an earpiece, microphone(s) , clickable thumbwheel(s) or thumbwheel(s) , open\/close sensor(s) , short-range communications subsystem(s) , and any other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions. Notably, some subsystems, such as the keypad , the display , and the clickable thumbwheel , for example, may be used for both communication-related functions, such as displaying notifications or entering a text message for transmission through, for example, the PLMN  and\/or one of the WLANs , and executing device-resident functions such as a clock, a calculator or a task list. Operating system software used by the microprocessor  is preferably stored in a persistent store such as the flash memory , which may alternatively be the ROM  or similar storage element. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the operating system, specific device applications, or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store such as the RAM .","The microprocessor , in addition to its operating system functions, enables execution of software applications on the mobile device . A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and voice communication applications, will normally be installed on the mobile device  during or after manufacture. The mobile device  may include a personal information manager (PIM) application having the ability to organize and manage data items relating to a user such as, but not limited to, instant messaging, email, calendar events, voice mails, appointments, and task items. One or more memory stores may be available on the mobile device  to facilitate storage of information, such as the flash memory , the RAM , the ROM , the memory module , or other types of memory storage devices or FLASH memory cards represented by the other device subsystems , such as Secure Digital (SD) cards or mini SD cards, etc.","The PIM and\/or media applications have the ability to send and receive data items via the PLMN  and\/or one of the WLANs  or via a link to a computer system. The link to the computer system may be via the serial port  or the short-range communications subsystem . In an embodiment, PIM and\/or media data items are seamlessly combined, synchronized, and updated, for example, through the PLMN  and\/or one of the WLANs , with the mobile device user's corresponding data items stored and\/or associated with a host computer system thereby creating a mirrored or partially mirrored host computer on the mobile device  with respect to such items. This may be advantageous where the host computer system is the mobile device user's office computer system. Additional applications may also be loaded onto the mobile device  through, for example, the PLMN  and\/or one of the WLANs , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the serial port , the short-range communications subsystem , or any other suitable subsystem , and installed by a user in the RAM  or a non-volatile store such as the ROM  for execution by the microprocessor . Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device .","In a data communication mode, a received data signal representing information such as a text message, an email message, a media file to be transferred, or Web page download can be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the microprocessor . The microprocessor  can further process the signal for output to the display  or alternatively to the auxiliary I\/O device . A user of the mobile device  may also compose data items, such as email messages, for example, using the keypad  and\/or the clickable thumbwheel  in conjunction with the display  and possibly the auxiliary I\/O device . The keypad  maybe either a complete alphanumeric keypad or telephone-type keypad. These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem  or via the short range communication subsystem .","For voice communications, the overall operation of the mobile device  is similar, except that the received signals would be output to the speaker or audio port  and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the mobile device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker or audio port  or the display  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party or the communication type, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information. Stereo headphones or an earpiece may also be used in place of the speaker .","The USB port  is normally implemented in a personal digital assistant (PDA) type communication device for which synchronization with a user's computer is a desirable, albeit optional, component. The USB port  enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the mobile device  by providing for information or software downloads to the mobile device  other than through the PLMN  and\/or one of the WLANs . The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load software or data files onto the mobile device  through a direct, reliable and trusted connection.","The short-range communications subsystem  is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth\u2122 communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices (Bluetooth\u2122 is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG, Inc.). In another embodiment, the short-range communications subsystem  may be a wireless networking communications subsystem, conforming to IEEE 802.11 standards such as one or more of 802.11b, 802.11g, and\/or 802.11n.","Reference is next made to , which shows an embodiment of a method  of displaying information relating to a communication type of an incoming communication according to one embodiment. The method  is suitable for use in, for example, the mobile device  such as that shown in  to which reference will be made where appropriate. Method  can start at block  where a communication is received by the communication subsystem  of the mobile device .","At , the communication type of the incoming communication may be determined by the mobile device . This may be done, for example, using a communication identifying module resident in a memory of the mobile device , such as RAM , ROM , or flash memory , to be executed by a processor, such as microprocessor . Each incoming communication can be assigned a communication type. The communication type could, for example, be a feature-based communication type, such as a conference call or a voice notification, and\/or it may be a priority-based type, such as a high priority, low priority, regular priority or emergency communication. While in the examples that follow each communication will be described as being assigned a single communication type, it will be understood by those in the art that a single communication may be assigned or otherwise associated with multiple communication types. For example, a communication could be a high-priority conference call. Communications which have no other designation may be assigned a default communication type such as regular priority.","The communication type of an incoming communication may be assigned by any server or other processor processing data related to the call, including, for example, an enterprise network  originating or receiving the communication. Information relating to the communication type of an incoming communication can be associated with other information associated with the communication, including, for example, data useful in establishing a communications session, and sent to the mobile device  from the enterprise network  when the communication is relayed using, for example, either a voice or data channel. As another option, the mobile device  may interpret the communication and associated information and assign a communication type based on, for example, the identity of the caller or other information available to it.","Where the communication type is a feature-based communication type, such as, for example, a conference call or a voice notification, the communication type may be inherent in the communication. A feature-based communication type relates to a feature of the communication, such as the content or intended form of a communication, not to the priority of the communication. Where the communication type is a priority-based communication type, such as, for example, a high priority, a low priority, a regular priority or an emergency communication, the communication type may be established based on one or more rules. Data representing these rules and useful in their interpretation by the processor(s) by which they are to be applied may reside in the enterprise network . In this case, information regarding the priority of the communication may be sent to the mobile device  as explained above, or may reside in a memory of the mobile device , such as ROM , RAM  or flash memory  of the mobile device of . The rules for designating the priority of a communication may be set by, for example, an information technology policy that is setup by an administrator or may be a personal policy set up by the user of the mobile device .","The rules may, for example, be specific to the identity of the origin of the communication. For example, all communications from a specific individual, such as the user's boss or the user's spouse, may be considered to be high priority communications. The rules may also relate to, for example, the time of day or the location of the mobile device.","In some embodiments, the communication type of an incoming communication may be assigned by the source of the communication either directly or, for example, by contacting a switchboard to have the communication type modified (e.g. increasing the priority of the communication).","At , information relating to the communication type of the incoming communication is displayed on the mobile device , for example on a display  of the mobile device  of . This may be done, for example, using a display module resident in a memory of the mobile device , such as RAM , ROM , or flash memory , to be executed by a processor, such as microprocessor . The displayed information may include, for example, a message identifying the communication type and possibly other relevant information such as the origin of the communication. One or more options may also be presented to the user based on the communication type. For example, as shown in , if the incoming communication is a high priority call, the options presented to the user may include an option to answer the call and an option to disregard the call. As shown in , if the incoming communication is intended to comprise a request to join a conference call, the options presented to the user may include a option to accept the request, reject the request or delay joining the call for a period of time. The information displayed, including the options presented, may also vary depending on other factors such as whether there is currently another communication in progress on the mobile device and the communication type of this other communication.","At block , the mobile device  may optionally perform one or more actions based in the communication type of the incoming communication. This may be done, for example, using an action module resident in a memory of the mobile device , such as RAM , ROM , or flash memory , to be executed by a processor, such as microprocessor . For example, if the incoming communication is an emergency communication, the mobile device may parse and interpret data associated with the communication request and apply previously-stored rules causing the device to interrupt another communication currently in progress on the mobile device . As another example, the mobile device may emit certain type of notification, such as an auditory or visual notification, depending on the communication type of the incoming communication. A visual notification, for example, could include a flashing light, such as an LED light, on the mobile device . The notification may also include movement such as causing the mobile device  to vibrate.","Reference is now made to , which shows an embodiment of a method  of processing based on the communication type of an incoming communication according to one embodiment. Reference will be made to  where appropriate.","Method  can start at block  where a communication is received by the communication subsystem  of the mobile device .","At , it is determined whether the incoming communication is an emergency communication. If the incoming communication is associated with data indicating an emergency communication, at , microprocessor  can cause a suitable wholly- or partially-predetermined message intended to indicate that the communication is an emergency communication to be displayed on a display  of the mobile device . At block , processor  can poll other components, such as a register containing information about current or pending processes being handled by the device , to determine whether there is currently another communication in progress on the mobile device . If there is another communication in progress then the communication in progress may be interrupted, either with or without an option of approval by a user of the device  (as for example through a guided instruction screen such as that shown in  suitably modified, if desired), and the emergency communication may connected at block  in preference of other pending processes. If there is no communication currently in progress on the mobile device then an emergency alert may be provided at block . The emergency alert may, for example, be the regular notification used by the mobile device emitted at a louder volume and\/or it may be a notification specifically designated and\/or reserved for emergency situations. The alert may also include, for example, emitting one or more lights and\/or causing the mobile device  to move (e.g. vibrate).","If the incoming communication is determined, on the basis of information represented by data provided with the communication request, not to be an emergency communication, at block , it can be determined whether the communication is a high priority communication. If the incoming communication is a high priority communication then the high priority information is displayed at block . At block , it is determined whether there is currently another communication in progress on the mobile device . If there is another communication in progress and that communication is an emergency communication then the incoming communication is transferred directly to the voice mail of the user of the mobile device  at block . Otherwise, the mobile device  will wait at block  to receive an indication from the user as to whether the user chooses to respond to the communication at the present time and responds accordingly.","If the incoming communication is determined not to be a high priority communication, at block , it can be determined whether the communication is a conference call request. If the incoming communication is identified by the data associated with the communication request as a conference call request then suitably-adapted conference call request options, such as those shown in , may be displayed at block . At block , the mobile device waits to receive an indication of the option chosen by the user of the mobile device and responds accordingly.","If the incoming communication is not a conference call request, at block , it may be determined whether the communication is a voice notification. If the incoming communication is determined to be a voice notification then information relating to the request may be displayed at block .","If the incoming communication is not a voice notification, it can be assumed that the communication is a regular priority communication. The regular priority information is displayed at block . The mobile device  will wait at block  to receive an indication from the user as to whether or not the user chooses to respond to the communication at the present time and responds accordingly.","The method  represents an example processing of various types of communication types which could be identified and an example of how the mobile device could handle these communication types. Those skilled in the art will recognize that there may be many different possible communication types which could be identified. Similarly, those skilled in the art will recognize that there can be different information displayed in relation to the type of the communication and different responses to the type of the communication.","While the embodiments of methods  and  comprise blocks or steps shown as occurring in a particular order, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that many of the blocks are interchangeable and may occur in different orders that that shown without materially affecting the end results of the methods  and .","Reference is next made to  which shows a front view of an embodiment of a mobile device  displaying a call identification notification. The mobile device  includes a display , a keyboard  and a thumbwheel .","The display  shows a notification of an incoming high priority call according to one embodiment. The notification includes the priority of the communication and the name of the calling party as well as two options  and . The first option  allows the user to answer the call. The second option  allows the user to dismiss the notification without answering the call. An option can be selected by the user using the keyboard , the thumbwheel  or a combination thereof.","Reference is next made to  which shows a second front view of an embodiment of a mobile device  displaying a call identification notification. In this example, the display  shows a notification of an incoming conference call request according to one embodiment. The notification includes three options ,  and . The first option  allows the user to accept the conference call. The second option  allows the user to reject the conference call request. The third option  allows the user to delay joining the conference for a set period of time. An option can be selected using, for example, known types of interactive options selection and known means of entering commands, such as the use of pointing devices, including for example scroll wheels and trackballs and keystrokes or combinations thereof. In this example, an option can be selected using the keyboard , the thumbwheel  or a combination thereof.","While the present disclosure is primarily described as a method, a person of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the present disclosure is also directed to an apparatus for carrying out the disclosed method and including apparatus parts for performing each described method block, be it by way of hardware components, a computer programmed by appropriate software to enable the practice of the disclosed method, by any combination of the two, or in any other manner suitable for accomplishing the purposes disclosed herein.
