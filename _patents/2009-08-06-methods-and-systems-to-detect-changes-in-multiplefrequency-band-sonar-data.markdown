Experimental Results"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/086,559, filed on Aug. 6, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with U.S. Government support under the Naval Sea Systems Command, contract number N00024-03-D-6606. The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.","Methods and systems disclosed herein are directed to detection of changes in a region of space relative to baseline measurements, including detection of changes in multiple-frequency band sonar data.","Sonar images of an underwater area may be used to identify objects in the area. Subsequent sonar images of the area may be used to re-identify objects in the area, which may be compared to the previously identify objects. New objects may be presented to an operator for evaluation.","Sonar images of an underwater area may include relatively vast numbers of non-overlapping target-sized patches of seafloor, any of which may include an object of potential interest. In some situations, there may be a need to present newly identified objects for human evaluation in real-time. The potentially vast quantity of data may, however, render it impractical for humans to detect objects in sonar images, to correlate the detected objects with previously identified objects, and to identify new objects, in real-time.","Computer based techniques have been developed to detect object changes in sonar images.","The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, of Washington D.C., has developed techniques as taught in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009\/0016161, titled, \u201cMethod and System for Real-Time Automated Change Detection and Classification for Images\u201d (hereinafter, NRL). The abstract of NRL provides: \u201cA computer based system and method for real-time display of co-registered historical and current side scan sonar imagery during a side scan sonar survey. Embodiments also include modules for detection of clutter in the current imagery, identification of features, extraction of snippets, filtering based on predetermined size and shape parameters, and determination if a current feature is the same as a previously identified contact from historical imagery.\u201d","Mine counter-measure (MCM) techniques have been developed to classify objects as mines or non-mines using automation to detect points of interest. Human beings make final classification decisions. MCM techniques are addressed in Reference 2 below. The shape, size, and acoustic characteristics of a wide variety of mine types are known, or at least knowable. For a given operating environment, certain types of mines may be expected. Therefore, MCM software has the advantage of knowing to a level of certainty what targets look like in acoustic data, while rocks, tires, barrels, and other objects represent undesirable clutter. MCM software is designed to distinguish mines from clutter objects, which is a multiclass classification problem. By their nature, objects may take any shape or size. Objects that are clutter for the MCM software may, however, be objects of interest in other situations.","Change detection may be performed at pixel-level or object-level. Pixel-level and object-level processing are addressed in Reference 3 below.","In object-level processing, entities, such as rocks, tires, and barrels, are first detected as contacts and then correlated with a database of known objects to detect new ones. There are a number of known techniques to identify objects. In some techniques, pixels corresponding to objects are distinguished from background pixels and are logically clustered. Each cluster represents a contact. Some techniques incorporate heuristics to determine contact boundaries and characteristics to verify detection. Contacts are then compared and correlated with a list of known objects. Uncorrelated contacts represent changes. An object-level change detection approach is addressed in Reference 1 below.","In contrast, pixel-level processing involves comparing sonar data sample by sample (each sample is a \u201cpixel\u201d) to look for changes, and then clustering or otherwise describing these changes in a way that can indicate the presence of a new object.","Pixel-level processing requires a relatively high degree of registration to perform the comparison. In other words, the pixels must represent the same physical patch of ground. At centimeter resolution, the allowable errors in measuring sensor pitch, heading, and location become extremely small. For example, registering a 1 centimeter (cm) pixel at a 75-m range requires a heading accuracy of better than 0.1 mrad and, obviously, a geo-location accuracy of less than 1 cm. Due to the high-aspect dependency of the scattering surfaces, the sensor path must be followed exactly. A few meters difference in depth or cross-track positioning may compromise the data. Warping the sonar data with image-processing techniques may not accurately describe areas that were not actually covered by the sensor, referred to herein as inter-beam holiday regions, and may not sufficiently eliminate intra-image distortions resulting from unknowable sensor heading and location errors. Such registration requirements may render pixel-level processing unfeasible for many applications.","Issues associated with pixel-level registration and potential compensation techniques are addressed in References 4 through 6, below.","The following are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties:\n\n","Disclosed herein are methods and systems to detect changes within an area, including to identify objects in sonar images of the area, to compare the detected objects to a database of known objects in the area, and to identify any changes within the area. Newly detected objects may be presented to a human operator in real-time.","Also disclosed herein are methods and system to detect changes based on multi-frequency band sonar data.","Also disclosed herein are methods and system to represent multi-dimensional sonar data, such as multi-frequency band sonar data and corresponding position information, as support vector data description (SVDD) statistics, and to identify and characterize objects from the SVDD statistics, including to characterize an object with respect to one or more invariant features, which may be based on locations of points on a boundary of the object relative to other points on the boundary.","Also disclosed herein are methods and system to correlate multi-dimensional characteristics of newly detected objects or contacts, with multi-dimensional characteristics of known objects, and to optimally assign contacts to known objects.","Also disclosed herein are methods and system to manage a database of objects, including to add new objects for contacts that do not correlate to existing or known objects, and to manage a confidence metric associated with the objects.","In the drawings, the leftmost digit(s) of a reference number identifies the drawing in which the reference number first appears.","Where targets of interest are unknown or undefined, direct object detection may be challenging or potentially precluded. Change detection may be performed relative to a known or determinable background.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","102"]},"Data processing system  may be configured to identify potential objects, referred to herein as contacts, within a survey area, and to compare the contacts to known objects within the area. Known object data may be stored in a repository , such as a database.","Data processing system  may include an anomaly detection system  to detect anomalies against a natural background such as a sea bed, a contact detection and characterization system  to identify and characterize contacts from the anomalies, and a change detection system  to correlate characterized contacts with objects in repository .","Contacts that do not correlate to known objects may represent potential new objects. Data processing system  may be configured to notify an operator station , in real time, of detected changes, such as potential new objects.","Data processing system  may be configured to process multiple-frequency band sonar data . For example, sonar system  may include a side-looking, multiple-frequency band sonar system, such as an EdgeTech 4200, dual-frequency band (300 and 600 kHz), side-scan sonar system (Reference 9).","Sonar system  and sonar data  are not, however, limited to single or dual-frequency bands. Sonar system  may be configured for, and sonar data  may include, N simultaneous frequency bands, where N may be equal to or greater than 1, including greater than 2.","The simultaneous multiple frequency bands may have different corresponding sampling rates, and anomaly detection system may be configured to time-align the multiple-frequency band sonar data . Time-alignment may include re-sample the multiple-frequency band sonar data  to at a common sample rate.","Environment  may include a classification system  to create new objects corresponding to contacts that do not correlate to existing or known contacts and to manage confidence metrics associated with the object. For example, classification system  may be configured to classify new objects as tentative objects, to re-classify tentative objects as confirmed objects after repeated identification of the corresponding contacts in subsequent surveys, and to remove or to reclassify objects to tentative objects when corresponding contacts do not appear in subsequent surveys.

This may include distinguishing object pixels from background pixels. Such anomalous pixels may be part of an object or spurious background returns. Anomalous data may be analyzed and processed as described below.","Anomaly detection is a useful technique to classify data when characteristics of the background are known or determinable. Of the potential billions of pixels that represent a surveyed channel, a relative large majority may correspond to bottom sediment background. Because varying environmental effects along a water channel may produce relatively significant background variation, it may not be practical to model the background statistically.","Anomaly detection at  may be performed with a relatively large-margin classification technique to classify data without statistical estimation, such as a support vector data description (SVDD) technique. SVDD is addressed in References 7 and 8, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Exemplary SVDD techniques with respect to anomaly detection are described below with respect to  of .","(a) Feature Space Construction","Anomaly detection at  may include feature space construction at .","Feature space construction may be performed with respect to multi-frequency band sonar data  in .","Where sonar data  includes multi-frequency band data, the sonar data may provide additional data to detect objects relative to single-band data. For example, returns from objects may appear in multiple bands, while returns from sediment scattering may appear in fewer than all bands.","The EdgeTech 4200, for example, collects data from both frequency bands simultaneously, but provides the data for each band at a different sample rates. For example, during sea tests described below, the EdgeTech 4200 was operated at a nominal 10-Hz ping rate, providing a 75-m range, for an assumed speed of sound of 1500 m\/s. The higher frequency band nominally provides a 1-cm range resolution, while the lower frequency band provides a 3-cm range resolution.","As noted above, sonar data  is not limited to single or dual-frequency bands and may include N frequency bands, where N may be equal to or greater than 1, including greater than 2.","To align the data samples, both bands may be re-sampled. The number of samples collected during a survey and the ping interval may be utilized in the re-sampling. With sonar  set to provide a certain maximum range, an optimum or desired number of samples collected at the highest resolution (1 cm) may be determined. Then, given the number of desired samples and the number of actual samples, a re-sampling factor may be determined. Signal re-sampling may be performed with a polyphase structure. Signal re-sampling with a polyphase structure is addressed in Reference 10, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Re-sampled signal amplitudes for the high-frequency and low-frequency bands may represent two dimensions of data for object detection. The data may exhibit spatial trends which may be taken into account. For example, due to factors that may include, without limitation, attenuation loss, spreading loss, beam shape, ambient noise, and volume reverberation, each scan line (amplitude versus time return for a single ping) may exhibit a logarithmic shape.  is a graphic depiction of an exemplary scan line  corresponding to one side of a side-scan sonar survey. Relatively large sand waves, which may measure several meters in length, may also affect cross-range dimension. Data may be normalized to remove such uninformative trends.","Physical coordinates, such as in castings and northings, of each sonar data sample may be calculated and used as additional feature dimensions, referred to herein as third and fourth feature dimensions, respectively. The physical coordinates may be calculated using a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. UTM is addressed in Reference 11, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","In , signals in the first 2500 samples correspond to 25 meters with a 1-cm range resolution. A first portion  is relatively noisy, and a second portion , corresponding to approximately the first 1000 samples, corresponds to the holiday region beneath the sonar sensor. Data associated with portion  and  may be ignored, and survey paths may be aligned and\/or overlapped to obtain data for the corresponding areas.  is a graphic depiction of exemplary inbound and outbound sensor paths  and , respectively.","(b) Support Vector Data Description","Returning to , anomaly detection at  may include generating a support vector data description (SVDD) of the feature space construction at .","Inputs to an SVDD classifier may include a multi-dimensional feature space, such as described above with respect to , which may include re-sampled signal amplitudes of high-frequency and low-frequency bands and corresponding physical coordinates. Samples from the feature space may be assumed to represent background data, and the SVDD may be trained to recognize these samples.","Training samples that are identified as anomalies may be removed, and the SVDD may be re-trained on the remaining training samples. Such an iterative training process may reduce or eliminate non-background samples from the training, which may result in a more accurate SVDD decision surface.","Mathematically, the SVDD may describe or define training samples of a training set T, in a relatively high dimensional space through a kernel function transformation, and may then determine parameters of a smallest hypersphere S that can encompass the training set T, which may be subject to one or more constraints. S and T may be define as:\n\n={\u03a6():\u2225\u03a6()\u2212}\n\n={\u03a6((),1 . . . \n","The hypersphere may be manifest as a relatively complex, possibly disjoint, decision boundary in the original four-dimensional feature space. Finding the smallest hypersphere S that contains the training set T may be a constrained optimization problem which may be represented as:\n\nmin()subject to \u03a6()\u03b51\u2003\u2003(1)\n","In equation 1, \u03a6(x) is a higher dimension feature space mapping.

Challenges with such approaches include determining a data model. For example, where the sonar data is treated as a random process, the underlying distribution of the process may not be readily discernable or definable. Another challenge with conventional statistical detection approaches is determining distribution parameters. Distribution parameters may be approximated from measured data that are binned to form estimated probability density functions. For data of more than one dimension, binning may pose challenges. For example, as the number of dimensions increases, the likelihood of measuring samples to populate each bin may be reduced. Where the probability density functions are not accurately estimated, unpredictable detection performance may be encountered. Where the sonar data random process is not stationary, multiple models may be required, which may further complicate the challenges above.","An SVDD approach as disclosed herein may negate such challenges by examining the data directly. An optimal decision boundary may be determined by points on or near an SVDD surface, referred to herein as support vectors. With relatively little tuning, an SVDD may define a relatively complex surface that envelops the background data, leaving anomalies outside.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0113"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A through 6F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0114"},"figref":"FIG. 6A","b":["602","604"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0115"},"figref":["FIG. 6B","FIG. 6A"],"b":["606","602","604"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0116"},"figref":["FIG. 6C","FIG. 6B"],"b":["608","608"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0117"},"figref":["FIG. 6D","FIG. 6C"],"b":"608"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0118"},"figref":["FIG. 6E","FIG. 6C"],"b":"608"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0119"},"figref":["FIG. 6F","FIG. 6C"],"b":"608"},"In the examples of , three-dimensional data are shown for illustrative purposes. Method  may be implemented with data of greater and lesser dimensions.","An advantage of SVDD, as disclosed herein, is that once trained, high variability in the background data may have substantially little or no impact on the ability of the SVDD to detect anomalies. Training involves sampling the background at numerous representative locations. SVDD is also able to handle multiple frequency bands.","Another advantage of SVDD is that, because additional dimensions do not lead to sparse training sets, SVDD may be applied to other types of sensors with multiple frequencies and\/or aspects or beams.","(c) Thresholding and Clustering","Anomaly detection at  may include thresholding at  and clustering at .","The placement of a SVDD decision boundary , such as illustrated at , represents a threshold operation to which points  are subjected. Points  within decision boundary  are background. Points outside decision boundary  are anomalies. Decision boundary  may represent an optimal boundary in a mathematical sense. Costs associated with misclassification are not, however, necessarily equal between background and anomaly. To reduce false alerts, a minimum distance or threshold beyond decision boundary  may be defined, beyond which a data point must lie to be an anomaly. This may be equivalent to increasing the radius of the SVDD hypersphere or decision boundary .","Thresholding at  may include a hysteresis threshold. First, the SVDD decision statistic may modified by:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0127"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":["z","\u2032"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":["z","R"]},"mo":"-","mn":"1"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"5"}}]}}}}},"where z is the original SVDD decision statistic and R is the SVDD hypersphere radius. The hypersphere radius may be determined by computing the SVDD statistics for a support vector that lies exactly on the hypersphere. By definition, the smallest statistic value of any support vector is the radius. Equation 5 normalizes the data so that points on the hypersphere have a value of zero and all points are expressed in relation to the hypersphere size. This may be useful where the SVDD classifier is constantly retraining during real-time operations, and the hypersphere size may vary from one training cycle to the next.","Then, all points with a value less than a threshold, \u03bb, are set to zero and the remaining points are clustered at . If a cluster does not contain a data sample above a second, higher threshold, \u03bb, the points for that cluster are set to zero, and the cluster is discarded. This two-stage thresholding technique allows for detection of less obvious anomalies while preserving good false alert performance. There are many approaches to thresholding data, but this approach has proven effective. Hysteresis thresholding is addressed in Reference 12, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Clustering at  may combine the individual threshold crossings, which may correspond to a binary data surface, in the SVDD decision space to enable detections of whole objects. An object may be represented in the sonar data by many individual samples in relatively close spatial proximity to one another. Clustering at  may identify groups of samples in relatively close spatial proximity.","Clustering may include selecting a nonzero pixel and then examining neighbor pixels. A neighbor is a pixel that is simply in the row or column next to a point under consideration. Nonzero neighbor pixels may be added to the cluster. The process may repeat recursively for each nonzero neighbor until a pixel is found that has no nonzero neighbors that are not already members of the cluster. This approach works when pixels are located at fixed integer locations, as represented by a matrix.","Where pixels correspond to arbitrary locations, clustering at  may include clustering pixels when they are within a distance r of one another. When this approach is applied to each nonzero pixel, clustering of scattered sonar pixel data may be performed in Noperations, where N is the number of nonzero pixels. The processing may be reduced to approximately NlogN operations. Clustering at  may result in a list of clusters that are themselves lists of individual pixels.","Object detection at , described below, may include omitting or discarding clusters based on size, such as clusters of pixels having a length and\/or width dimension below or outside of a threshold. This prescreening may reduce or eliminate clusters that result from spurious SVDD responses, and may reduce corresponding false alerts.","At , potential objects, or contacts may be detected and characterized. Contacts may be detected or defined as clusters of anomalous sonar data, as described above with respect to .","Contact characterizations may be subsequently compared to characterizations of known objects at similar locations, such as described below with respect to . At least a portion of the characterizations may be based, at least in part, on perimeter or boundary information associated with contacts and objects. Accordingly, characterization at  may include determining perimeter or boundary information, such as described below with respect to , and characterizing contacts with respect to shape and size, such as described below with respect to .","Contact detection at  may include separating sonar data corresponding to the contacts from the seafloor background. The anomalousness of the sonar data, as determined by the SVDD, is a useful measure to determine set membership, in part because SVDD reduces multiple data layers, such as individual frequency bands, aspects, and beams, into a single layer.","SVDD data may, however, be limited to representation of relatively sparse, non-uniform measurements of the sonar. Characterization at  may thus include converting the relatively sparse, non-uniform measurements to a relatively regularly sampled representation of the contact perimeters. One or more of a variety of scattered data interpolation techniques, such as projection onto convex sets (POCS), may be implemented to convert the relatively sparse, non-uniform measurements to a relatively regularly sampled representation of the contact perimeters. POCS is addressed in Reference 13, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Alternatively, or additionally, a spline function, such as a basis or B-spline function may be implemented.","(a) B-Spline Interpolation","In , contact detection and characterization at  may include B-spline interpolating at . B-spline interpolating at  may include a multilevel B-spline algorithm (MBA). MBA is addressed in Reference 14, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","An MBA iteratively fits a B-spline surface to the scattered data to form a control lattice, which can be used to estimate a surface through the scattered data at regularly spaced points. B-spline interpolation may be computationally less expensive and less complex to implement relative to other techniques.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0116","num":"0142"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A through 7C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0143"},"figref":"FIG. 7A","b":["702","702"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0144"},"figref":"FIG. 7B","b":["704","702","702"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0145"},"figref":"FIG. 7C","b":["706","706","702","704","706","702"]},"(b) Boundary Determination","Contact detection and characterization at  may include boundary determination at .","Side-scan sonar data of an object may differ each time the object is sensed by the sensor. This may be due to one or more of the relatively high aspect dependency of the individual reflecting surfaces of the object, variability of the medium, and variation of position and orientation of the sensor relative to the object. The inconsistent sonar returns may raise challenges in change detection because visual appearance, or amplitude, alone may be insufficient to accurately detect changes.","Much work has been done in the image-processing field to overcome affine transformations due to rotation and aspect changes, as well as additive or multiplicative noise, but the assumption of a consistent object appearance is fundamental to these methods. For example, the method outlined in Reference 15 is widely considered state of the art in interest point detection and association. But it implicitly assumes that an object looks like the entity it is no matter how it is viewed.","Size and shape of contacts may be inferred from side-scan sonar measurements with relatively minimal error. Boundary determination at  may exploit these properties for object matching. As described below with respect to  in , a contact may be characterized with respect to size and shape based on locations of points on a surface relative to other points on the surface. Therefore, affine transformations due to changes in perspective do not affect the calculations. Similarly, rotation, translation, and scale are not factors, provided the surface of the object is described within a fixed reference frame. Because only the boundary of the object is used for description, the actual appearance of the object and any noise or distortion within it may be relatively inconsequential.
