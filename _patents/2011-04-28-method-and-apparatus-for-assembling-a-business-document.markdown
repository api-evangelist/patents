{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE"],"p":["Aspects of this disclosure relate to providing methods and apparatus which assemble a business document.","A business document may present data from a variety of sources in a comprehensive yet compact form. Different forms of presentation may be used\u2014e.g., slides produced by PowerPoint\u00ae software. The information described by the document may come from a variety of data sources and tools. The data may change over time, requiring changes to the documents that depend on that data.","Some of the drawbacks associated with producing documents on a regular basis are integration and timeliness. Documents may depend on disparate data sources and the underlying data may change. It would be desirable, therefore, to provide apparatus and methods that provide integrated business documents that may be easily constructed from disparate data sources. It would also be desirable to allow documents to be updated when data changes without rewriting the document.","Systems and methods are preferably provided for:","a) Creating input documents and associated representations.","b) Creating an asset library of input documents comprising assets, where an asset may be a data representation.","c) Creating an integrated document that integrates assets.","d) Creating a presentation library of integrated documents.","e) Updating the integrated documents in the presentation library when the data or assets change.","The integrated documents may be produced by presentation software. The systems and methods may include a computer. The computer may include a display screen and a keyboard. Often a mouse or other pointing device\u2014e.g., a trackball\u2014is provided as well. The computer may be connected to the Internet. The software may provide one or more views of documents to the user. The software may be augmented by an asset browser plug-in platform.","Although a full-size, or laptop, computer may run the presentation software, other devices are also suitable and included within the scope of the invention\u2014e.g., a PDA, iPhone\u00ae, Smartphone, iPad\u00ae, Blackberry\u00ae, 3G phone, 4G phone or custom hardware.","Although some of the description of the input documents and the integrated documents utilize PowerPoint\u00ae slides as a presentation method, other methods such as charts, spreadsheets and textual reports are contemplated and included within the scope of the invention. For the purposes of this application, the term slide may refer to a portion of any business document. The presentation of data may be in the form of a business document but other documents\u2014e.g., academic reports\u2014are contemplated and included within the scope of the invention.","The systems and methods according to the invention may receive and store in an asset library, slides, and assets from slides, charts, tables or spreadsheets. The software may further incorporate assets into slides from various sources or persons. The assets may or may not conform to a known template. An asset browser plug-in platform according to the invention may provide access to an asset library. The user may integrate one or more assets from the library in a particular slide. The slides may be stored in a presentation library. The slides in the presentation library may be updated.","Apparatus and methods for creating an asset library of input documents\u2014e.g., Microsoft Word\u00ae, Excel\u00ae or PowerPoint\u00ae documents are provided. The documents may be comprised of assets\u2014e.g., charts, graphs etc. A plug-in software module may allow the user to select and use assets from the asset library. The selected assets may be used to construct an integrated business document, also called an integrated document or a slide. The integrated documents may be stored in a presentation library. If the underlying data of assets change, the integrated documents in the presentation library may be updated.","Documents are often created using readily available software\u2014e.g., Microsoft Word\u00ae, Excel\u00ae or PowerPoint\u00ae. Although some or all of the embodiments in this description refer to PowerPoint\u00ae slides, other software or any sort of presentation tool\u2014e.g., Open Office\u2014is contemplated and included within the scope of the invention.","It would be desirable, therefore, to provide apparatus and methods that provide an interactive and intuitive mechanism for creating integrated documents. It would also be advantageous if the integrated documents could be updated when the information underlying the sources change.","Illustrative embodiments of apparatus and methods in accordance with the principles of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural, functional and procedural modifications may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.","As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the invention described herein may be embodied in whole or in part as a method, a data processing system, or a computer program product. Accordingly, the invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment or an embodiment combining software, hardware and any other suitable approach or apparatus.","Furthermore, such aspects may take the form of a computer program product stored by one or more computer-readable storage media having computer-readable program code, or instructions, embodied in or on the storage media. Any suitable computer readable storage media may be utilized, including hard disks, CD-ROMs, optical storage devices, magnetic storage devices, flash memory, and\/or any combination thereof. In addition, various signals representing data or events as described herein may be transferred between a source and a destination in the form of electromagnetic waves traveling through signal-conducting media such as metal wires, optical fibers, and\/or wireless transmission media\u2014e.g., air and\/or space.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","101","101","102","102"]},"Input documents  may be comprised of different file types\u2014e.g., Excel\u00ae spreadsheets, flat text files or PowerPoint\u00ae files. Each format may have different versions\u2014e.g., Excel\u00ae files may be of the type .xls or .xlsx. Preferably these files are constructed as an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) files or any other suitable format. Binary file formats are contemplated and are included within the scope of the invention. Each file type may require different processing via a handler\u2014e.g., an ASHX handler. A specific ASHX handler may be created for each file type used as an input document .","Assets  may be extracted from the input documents in the asset library. An asset browser platform  presents the assets  to a user. The user may select one or more assets  and place it in an integrated document . The integrated document  may be a slide. The integrated documents are stored in a presentation library .","Each input document  may be tagged according to a category. Categories may indicate the type of integrated document  that will make use of the input document . The input documents  may also be tagged. Preferably a user will specify a category when the integrated document  is created. An input document  and an integrated document  may be placed in more than one category. When a user is offered a selection of assets, the selection may comprise only assets  from documents  that match the category of the integrated document . In the alternative, the assets  may be tagged according to a category or categories.","Integrated documents in presentation library  may be comprised of assets  or they may be comprised of other assets and data, or a combination of assets  and other assets and data.","The system  may implement a Product Data Management (PDM) workflow. A PDM may use software to track and control data related to a particular product\u2014e.g., a business document. The data tracked may relate to technical information within the business document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","200","201","210","202","220","103","104","103"]},"Example input document  may be parsed to locate assets \u2014e.g., to discern that graph  is a different asset than pie chart . Location of assets  within example input document  allows the creation of an asset library where each asset is distinct. Assets  may be linked to other assets  or data\u2014e.g., table  is the data for the creation of graph . Assets  that have linking data may be stored with the links to that data or the data and the pictorial expression of the data. Such pictorial expression may include a graph or pie chart which may be stored as a single asset . If the linking data is changed, the pictorial expression of that data may change as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","102","300","330","331","332","332","332","332","332","332","332","300"]},"Asset library  may be shared among many users. The asset library  may implement security features, limiting access to portions of the asset library  for some of the users. Asset library  may organize the assets according to asset type, document type or any other suitable organization.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","103","450","450","400","440","440"]},"The interface includes an asset browser panel . Asset browser platform  may contain a manifest of assets. Preferably the assets are retrieved from a shared library stored on a SharePoint\u00ae server. Example assets within asset browser platform  are example graph  and example pie chart . The retrieval and sorting of assets may be based on a metadata tag. The metadata tag may be part of the integrated document or part of the input document which is the source of the asset.","Although example interface  utilizes a slide paradigm with an asset browser panel, other embodiments of the example interface  are contemplated and included within the scope of the invention\u2014e.g., a text document utilizing a drop down menu of assets.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","510","500","520","500","500","106"]},"The exemplary graph  and exemplary pie chart  may have been placed into the slide  by the asset browser platform. Some or all of the assets may be updated or refreshed when the presentation is opened by the software. In the alternative, an update may be triggered by the user. An exemplary color status indicator  may be placed in the upper right hand corner of the exemplary slide .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","106","600","630","646","500","646","646","600"]},"Presentation library  may be shared among many users, which may enable construction of composite documents utilizing slides from presentation library . The presentation library  may implement security features, limiting access to portions of the presentation library  for some of the users. Presentation library  may organize the assets according to date, document type or any other suitable organization.","Presentation library may be updated via user interface button . Although example embodiment  of the presentation library  shows an update button , any other suitable update method or methods\u2014e.g., updates on a change of data or when an integrated file is opened\u2014are contemplated and included within the scope of the invention. Updating may use linking data.","Updating presentation library  has the affect of updating each asset within some or all of the integrated documents according to the most current available data. An example update would create a new net worth calculation for a client when the stock market closes according the value of all assets held by the client. Likewise risk management, predicting currency fluctuations etc. may be used to update slides.","Some or all of the integrated documents  may comprise metadata tags. The metadata tags may permit updating of a part of an integrated document\u2014e.g., a slide. As an example a metadata field could be \u201ccolor status\u201d\u2014e.g., the state of the exemplary color status indicator  of exemplary slide . If color status were changed to red, the update process would look at the color status indicator and change it to the appropriate image\u2014e.g., from a yellow bar to a red bar. Thus, the metadata tags permit changes to the input documents  underlying an integrated document  without affecting the presentation until an update is requested. At any time the integrated documents  may be updated to the newer information.","Updating integrated documents may utilize a ReprEsentational State Transfer (REST) protocol, but any suitable protocol may be used. Updates triggered in the presentation library  may also trigger an update of assets  or documents  stored in asset library .","Thus, an apparatus that enables integration of assets from a variety of sources into a integrated document have been presented. Likewise, updating of integrated documents in a presentation library with current data has also been presented. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention can be practiced by other than the described embodiments, which are presented for purposes of illustration rather than of limitation, and that the present invention is limited only by the claims that follow."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
