In two publications by R. Meyers, K. S. Deacon, Y. H. Shih, entitled \u201cGhost Imaging Experiment by Measuring Reflected Photons,\u201d Phys. Rev. A, Rapid Comm., Vol. 77, 041801 (R) (2008) and \u201cA new Two-photon Ghost Imaging Experiment with Distortion Study,\u201d J. Mod. Opt., 54: 16, 2381-2392 (2007), both of which are hereby incorporated by reference, \u201cghost imaging\u201d of remote objects by measuring reflected photons is reported.","\u201cGhost imaging\u201d is a technique that allows a camera or image capture device to produce an image of an object which the camera or device does not directly receive; hence the terminology \u201cghost.\u201d Early demonstrations of ghost imaging were based on the quantum nature of light; using quantum correlations between photon pairs to build an image of the unseen object. Generally speaking, \u201cghost imaging\u201d comprises the characteristics of nonlocal multiphoton interference and imaging resolution that differs from that of classical imaging. Using correlated photons from photon pairs, a camera constructs an image using recorded pixels from photons that hit simultaneously at the object and the camera's image plane.","Two types of \u201cghost imaging\u201d has been used experimentally since 1995; Type I uses entangled photon pairs as the light source and Type II uses a chaotic thermal light. Klyshko diagrams are shown for Type I and II sources are shown in  respectfully.","Conventional line-of-sight imaging (graphically depicted in ) lacks the ability to image target objects hidden by obstacles such as terrain, vegetation, buildings, and caves that place limitations on sensor positioning and field of view. Experiments have been performed proving that Ghost Imaging has abilities beyond those of classical imaging; including imaging through obscurants and turbulence.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"The Pittman, et al. experimental setup is shown in . In the experiment a 2-mm-diameter beam from the 351.1-nm line of an argon ion laser is used to pump a nonlinear beta barium borate (BBO) (\u03b2-BaB0) crystal that is cut at a degenerate type-II phase-matching angle to produce pairs of orthogonally polarized signal (e-ray plane of the BBO) and idler (o-ray plane of the BBO) photons. The pairs emerge from the crystal nearly collinearly, with \u03c9=\u03c9=\u03c9. The pump is then separated from the slowly expanding down-conversion beam by a UV grade fused silica dispersion prism and the remaining signal and idler beams are sent in different directions by a polarization beam-splitting Thompson prism. The reflected signal beam passes through a convex lens with a 400-mm focal length and illuminates the (UMBC) aperture. Behind the aperture is the detector package D, which consists of a 25-mm focal length collection lens in whose focal spot is a 0.8-mm-diam dry ice cooled avalanche photodiode. The transmitted idler beam is met by detector package D, which consists of a 0.5-mm-diameter multimode fiber whose output is mated with another dry ice cooled avalanche photodiode. Both detectors are preceded by 83-nm-bandwidth spectral filters centered at the degenerate wavelength 702.2 nm. The input tip of the fiber is scanned in the transverse plane by two orthogonal encoder drivers, and the output pulses of each detector, which are operating in the Geiger mode, are sent to a coincidence counting circuit with a 1.8-ns acceptance window. By recording the coincident counts as a function of the fiber tip's transverse plane coordinate, an image of the UMBC aperture is seen as described further in Pittman, et al. The aperture containing the UMBC that was inserted in the signal beam (about 3.5\u00d77 mm) is shown in the upper right, and the observed image (reportedly measured 7\u00d714 mm) is shown beneath the aperture. Pittman, et al. demonstrated the viability of ghost imaging, it did not provide a viable solution for non-line-of-sight imaging, Current Ghost Imaging methods are based on having the object being imaged in the line-of-sight or field of view of the bucket detector.","The present invention is directed to obtaining an image of an object that is not in the direct line of sight or field of view of the viewer, which may be for example, a bucket detector. When a photon detector is aimed nearby the object but not at the object then a Ghost Image of part or the entirety of the object is generated. The photon detector detects photons from a first area which have been scattered by a process such as multiple scattering into a second area such that the detector measures photons while aimed at the second area. In addition, photons from the target area may scatter and induce fluorescence in the second area such that a ghost image can also be formed from the fluorescent photons.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention enables imaging of an object or subject area when without the object or subject area being in the field of view of the bucket detector. This creates the possibility of imaging around corners; imaging of concealed objects, imaging of objects not in the line-of-sight to the detector, remote sensing, microscopic sensing, spectroscopy, identification of hidden or concealed objects, remote biometrics, design of new sensors and image processing methods, design of new types of stealth technology, design of new types of communications devices.","The present invention demonstrates the ability to obtain an image of an object using a detector that is not in the direct line of sight or field of view of the image. By aiming a detector at a point nearby the object but not at the object then an image of part or the entirety of the object is generated. Thus, an image of object may be generated even in the presence of turbulence which might otherwise be disruptive to image generation or when a direct view of the object is not possible.","Scattering of quantum particles such as photons off an object carries information of the object shape even when the quantum particles such as photons of light do not go directly to the receiver\/detector, but may in turn be rescattered. The receiver\/detector picks up quantum information on the object shape and its temporal relations to separately reference fields. The reference fields are recorded by an imager (CCD, digital cameras, video cameras, scanner, or camera, etc.) that looks at the light source but not the object. This technique may be utilized even when the detector was aimed at a region to the side of the object that was coplanar with the object. Experiments performed determined that Ghost Imaging has abilities beyond those of classical imaging, including imaging through obscurants and turbulence. Experiments have confirmed the potential to generate ghost images of objects when the \u201cbucket\u201d detector used in ghost imaging is significantly occluded.","A preferred method comprises obtaining an image of an object out of line of sight comprising directing a chaotic light beam at a first area containing the object; measuring the light from the chaotic light beam at a plurality of instances in time; using a photon detector, detecting light from a second area over a plurality of instances in time; the photon detector not being in the line of sight with the first area but in line-of-sight with a second area; using a processor, correlating the information received by the photon detector with the measurement of light from the chaotic light beam at specific instances in time; and producing an image of the object.","A preferred embodiment comprises a system for imaging information comprising a spatial receiver, a chaotic photon light source for producing light; the light comprising a first beam adapted to be directed at a first predetermined area containing an object, and a second beam which is received by the spatial receiver and measured at specific intervals in time; at least one processor operatively connected to the spatial receiver, the spatial receiver operating to transmit spatial information correlated to specific intervals of time to the processor; a first receiver operatively connected to the at least one processor and operative to detect the influence of the object on the first portion of the light beam; the first receiver not being in the line of sight with the first predetermined area and adapted to detect light from a second predetermined area spaced from and coplanar with the first predetermined area, and the at least one processor operating to correlate the outputs of the first receiver with spatial information derived from the spatial receiver at correlating intervals of time to create an image of the object.","A more complete appreciation of the invention will be readily obtained by reference to the following Description of the Preferred Embodiments and the accompanying drawings in which like numerals in different figures represent the same structures or elements.

(1), an equal sized lensless image of A({right arrow over (\u03c1)}) is observed in the joint detection between the CCD array and the photon counting detector D. The visibility of the image is determined by the value of G.","The ghost images are thus successfully interpreted as the result of two-photon interference. The two-photon interference results in a point-point correlation between the object plane and the image plane and yields a ghost image of the object by means of joint photodetection.","As shown in , and disclosed in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 7,812,303, a quantum ghost imaging system comprising an arbitrary random, spatially correlated light source  in an air medium as the source of the illuminating light. Radiation from a chaotic pseudothermal source  is divided into two paths by a nonpolarizing beam splitter , which divides the light into paths  and . In path A, an object  is illuminated by the light source at a distance of d. The object  receives a light source output  and reflects light along 15. The reflected light output , reflected from the surface of the object, is collected by a \u201cbucket\u201d detector  and integrated for some exposure time. The bucket detector  is simulated by using a large area silicon photodiode for collecting the randomly scattered and reflected photons from the object . The integrated values of the intensity are transmitted via interconnection  to the two-photon correlation computation subsystem . In path B, a second spatially addressable detector  is deployed. Output  is collected by a spatially addressable detector  that is observing the source  for the same exposure time at . The detector  includes a two-dimensional (2D) photon counting CCD array, cooled for single-photon detection, and may optionally include a lens. A triggering pulse from a computer is used to synchronize the measurements at 16 and 22 for two-photon joint detection. The time window is preferably chosen to match the coherent time of the radiation to simplify computation. The light intensity is also preferably chosen for each element of the detector  working at a single-photon level within the period of detector element response time. The chaotic light  is simulated by transmitting a laser beam first through a lens to widen the beam and then through a phase screen made from rotating ground glass. The detector  is placed at any given distance d. As shown in , d=d. It can be appreciated, however, that the present invention is operative when ddoes not equal d. The detector  faces the light source instead of facing the object . The spatially addressable intensity values are transmitted via interconnection  to the two-photon correlation computation subsystem . The two-photon correlation computation subsystem  comprises a voltage output recorder, coincidence circuit and CDCD output recorder. Subsystem  computes the two-photon correlation quantum ghost image in accordance with Eq. 3 utilizing the input values from interconnections  and .","Additionally, electronic circuitry components of the computer relative to the detectors  and  comprise a coincidence circuit which provides detection coordination between detectors  and . A photon registration history for detector  is also provided, which provides a temporal log for the integrated values  transmitted to the computer A. The second spatially addressable detector  is provided with spatially addressable output that is subsequently fed to the computer and onto a display (not shown). For the optical bench schematic of FIG. A, the actual ghost image display on a monitor is provided in  and is discernable as the original toy figure. It can be appreciated that the image quality shown in  is improved by increasing photon flux along path .","To confirm the ability to generate a ghost image of an object through an obscuring medium, an obscuring medium of frosted glass is inserted along the optical path  of .  is an instantaneous image of the light source  collected on the detector  (using the target ARL).  is an averaged image of the light source  obtained from detector  on averaging of 100 such images according to .  is a Gimage of the object obtained by correlation to photon ghost imaging from signals  and .  is an instantaneous image of the light source; object reflection.  is an averaged image of the source.  is the Gimage of the object when the obscuring medium is absent from optical path .

Thus, the speckle images  are random distributions in space and time. The beam splitter  essentially \u201chalves\u201d the intensity of the initial speckle image from diffuser  and splits it into two different paths ( and ) as shown in . Spatially correlated means that correlations are present at any given instant of time between the two paths , . There will be a point to point correlation between the speckle images on each path, although paths are spatially distinct. The coincidence detection by the processor  is temporal; i.e. correlated at specific time intervals. \u201cCorrelation\u201d or \u201cCorrelated,\u201d as used in the present application, means a logical or natural association between two or more paths; i.e., an interdependence, relationship, interrelationship, correspondence, or linkage. For example, the present invention may be used in conjunction with sunlight, an incoherent light source, whereby a first and second plurality of photons are emitted from the sun at the same time. If the first detector is located on the earth (ground) receives the first plurality of photons, and the second detector located in space (such as in a satellite orbiting the earth) receives a second plurality of photons, the time intervals need to be synchronized; i.e., a first plurality of photons which strikes the ground object is correlated with a second plurality of photons detected in space at synchronized timing intervals. It can be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that if the detected samples from the first and second plurality of photons are not part of the correlation, it will not contribute to the Gimage as mathematically described in the above equations. Further, coincidence has to do with two measurements at the same or approximately the same time. For example, when a coincidence occurs, one must compensate for the media involved to take into account the variation in particle velocity between different media.","In , the mask \u2032 is a stencil of the letters \u201cARL\u201d.

The photons from the light source may be divided into two paths: one path for the object to be imaged, and the other path in which images of the entangled, thermal, or chaotic light are measured independent of interaction with the objects. Any or all paths may pass through an obscuring medium. The measurements of the entangled, thermal, or chaotic light may then stored for future processing. In U.S. Pat. No. 7,812,303, the light in the object path is collected into a bucket detector and measured. The measurements of the bucket detector are then stored for future processing.
