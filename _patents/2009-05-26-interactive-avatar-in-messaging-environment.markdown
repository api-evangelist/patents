title: Interactive avatar in messaging environment
abstract: A sender sends an email message to a receiver. The message includes an avatar representing the sender. Upon receiving the message, if the receiver has a question related to the message, the receiver sends the question to the sender via the avatar. After receiving the question, the avatar remote server device correlates the question with the message through a MSG-ID associated with the receiver or avatar. The avatar remote server device parses and analyzes the question and then searches mailboxes, agendas, previous answers, toDoLists, folders, resumes, and/or address books of the sender to find a corresponding answer for the question. Then, the avatar remote server device provides the answer to the receiver via the avatar. Alternatively, upon receiving the question, the avatar remote server device sends a notification to the sender. If the sender has an online connectivity, the sender provides the answer to the receiver via the avatar.

Fields of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to electronic messaging systems and method. More particularly, the present invention is related to communicating via an avatar embedded in an email message.","2. Description of the Prior Art","Internet traffic becomes more and more important everyday and an electronic mail (email) provides a quick and convenient way for Internet users over the world to communicate between them. An email communication is initiated by a message sender composing an email message which optionally includes attached files, and then sending the message to one or more recipient via a network (e.g., Internet).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","25","15","20","30","25","25"]},"A mail client (e.g., Outlook Express\u00ae from Microsoft\u00ae, GroupWise\u00ae from Novell\u00ae, Lotus\u00ae Note from IBM\u00ae) has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to use a Messaging service (e.g., email or instant messaging). This GUI is interfaced with two main software stacks (a software stack refers to a set of programs that cooperatively interact together to produce a result):\n\n","The SMTP protocol establishes a connection between MTAs (e.g., SMTP servers  and , MTA  and ) to submit a message for recipients. Information exchanged during this connection are called envelop information and could be stored in a log file or during the store and forward mechanism. In a connection under the SMTP protocol, one message could be submitted for several recipients. A connection under the SMTP protocol is established with a MTA (e.g., a SMTP server  or , MTA  or ) for a specific Domain Name. The SMTP protocol further describes a queuing method for congestion.","An MTA (e.g., a SMTP server  or , MTA  or ) does not modify a message. However, the MTA puts information in a message header to trace a path of the message. When an MTA (e.g., a SMTP server  or MTA ) accepts a message either for relaying or for a final delivery (i.e., a delivery to a recipient), the MTA inserts a time stamp line at the beginning of a message header. The time stamp line indicates an identity of a computing device that sent the message, and an identity of a computing device that received the message (and is inserting this time stamp), and a date and time the message was received. Relayed messages will have multiple time stamp lines like following:\n\n","The SMTP protocol manages the envelop information and the message header in the message. Under the SMTP protocol, a message format is included in the envelop information or the message header. The MTA via the SMTP protocol is not aware about the envelop information and\/or the message header inside the message.","When a message is received and stored in a mailbox of a recipient by the MTA, there are several possibilities for users to access the Mail\n\n","However, in the traditional messaging system (e.g., ), it is difficult for a user to identify a purpose of an email message or to have all background information about an email message. Furthermore, in the traditional messaging system, it is difficult to obtain instantly or immediately more details or information about a received email message.","Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a method or system for communicating via an avatar embedded in an email message to immediately obtain more details or information associated with the received email message.","The present invention describes a system and method communicating via an avatar embedded in an email message to obtain more details or information associated with the email message.","In one embodiment, there is provided an email messaging system for communicating via an avatar, the system comprising:","a first client device for sending an email having an embedded avatar representing a sender;","a second client device for receiving the email from the first client device and enabling a receiver to submit a query via the avatar in the received email; and","a remote server device for communicating with the second client device via a communication protocol, receiving the query from the second client device, parsing and analyzing the query, retrieving a corresponding answer from the sender's mailbox including emails associated with the parsed and analyzed query, and providing the corresponding answer to the second client device via the avatar.","In one embodiment, there is provided a method for communicating via an avatar, the method comprising:","sending an email having an embedded avatar representing a sender;","receiving the email and enabling a receiver to submit a query via the avatar in the received email; and","receiving the query via a communication protocol, parsing and analyzing the query, retrieving a corresponding answer from the sender's mailbox including emails associated with the parsed and analyzed query, and providing the corresponding answer via the avatar.","In a further embodiment, the corresponding answer is retrieved from one or more of: an agenda, a folder, a previous answer, a calendar, a resume, and an expert system with an artificial intelligence.","In a further embodiment, the communication protocol is one or more of: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), SIMPLE (SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions), APEX (Application Exchange), Prim (Presence and Instance Messaging Protocol), XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol), IMPS (Instant Messaging and Presence Service), RTMP (Real Time Messaging Protocol), STM (Simple TCP\/IP Messaging) protocol, Azureus Extended Messaging Protocol, and like messaging protocols.","One embodiment of the present invention implements an avatar remote server device (e.g., an avatar remote server device  in ) to enable a user to submit a question directly and instantly to a sender of an email message. If the sender of the email message is not online, the avatar remote server device retrieves a corresponding answer from a mailbox of the sender. The question may be provided to the sender or the avatar remote server device in a text, audio or speech format.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["1","200","215","240","240","240","215","215","240","215","245","240","215","205","200","215","200","210","215","210","210","200","225"]},"In one embodiment, when the sender creates the email  by using the UA in the first client device, the UA in the first client device also creates a message-identification (MSG-ID) to uniquely identify the email  and the receiver (email's final destination). The UA may create the MSG-ID of the email  based on a date and time at which the email  is created. For example, if the email  is created at 10:20:30 AM on July 10, 2008, the MSG-ID of the UA may be XXXX10203007102008, where XXXX represents a random number that can be generated by a random number generator (e.g., ComScire\u00ae PCQNG True Random Number Generator (TRNG)). In a further embodiment, after sending the email  from the first client device , the email  passes through the avatar remote server device , where the MSG-ID is stored in a profile database (e.g., a profile database  in ).","At step , the MTA sender  transfers the email  to a MTA receiver . The MTA receiver  is another messaging server which delivers the email  to a mailbox of the receiver, e.g., via a message store (not shown) which stores the email  permanently or temporarily. At step , the MTA receiver  delivers the email  to the receiver. In one embodiment, the receiver operates a second device  including a UA to access a mailbox of the receiver. The second device  may be a personal computer, desktop computer, laptop computer, or workstation. After receiving the email , if the receiver wants to ask a query related to the email , then the receiver may send the query to the avatar remote server device  under an ARS (Avatar Remote Server) communication protocol . The ARS communication protocol  includes, but is not limited to, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), SIMPLE (SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions), APEX (Application Exchange), Prim (Presence and Instance Messaging Protocol), XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol), IMPS (Instant Messaging and Presence Service), RTMP (Real Time Messaging Protocol), STM (Simple TCP\/IP Messaging) protocol, Azureus Extended Messaging Protocol and like messaging protocols. In one embodiment, to send a query to the avatar remote server device , the receiver clicks the avatar  in the email . Then, a pop-up window  appears on the second client device . The receiver can type the query in the pop-up window and submit the query to the avatar remote server device by pushing \u201csend\u201d button (not shown). In one embodiment, if the second client device supports a microphone capability, the receiver can ask the query in audio format. For example, after clicking the avatar, a pop-up window  may appear on the second client device  to indicate to record the query in audio format. After recording the query, the receiver may push \u201ccomplete and send\u201d button (not shown) to stop the recording and to send the recorded query.","The avatar remote server device  communicating with the second client device  via the communication protocol  parses and analyzes the query, after receiving the query from the second client device  via the avatar . Hafiz et al., \u201cModular and Efficient Top-Down Parsing for Ambiguous Left-Recursive Grammars\u201d, Proceedings of the 10Conference on Parsing Technologies, June 2007, hereinafter \u201cHafiz\u201d, wholly incorporated as a reference as set forth herein, describes building a parser. To analyze the query, MySQL Query Analyzer and Java Query Analyzer may be utilized. MySQL Query Analyzer and Java Query Analyzer are freeware and can be obtained in Internet. For example, http:\/\/www.download3000.com\/download19469.html provides a download link of MySQL Query Analyzer.","After parsing and analyzing the query, the avatar remote server device  access a mailbox of the sender. The mailbox of the sender may include a plurality of emails. Among the plurality of emails, the avatar remote server device retrieves an answer (i.e., emails, documents and\/or information answering the query) corresponding to the query. To retrieve the answer, the avatar remote server device  may employ a well-known search algorithm such as depth-first search (DFS) or breath-first search (BFS). For example, if the query is \u201cprovide emails between the sender and Mr. Lee between 10\/10\/2007 and 11\/10\/2007\u201d, the avatar remote server device  access one or more mailboxes of the sender and then retrieve emails from \u201cMr. Lee\u201d or emails to \u201cMr. Lee\u201d between 10\/10\/2007 and 11\/10\/2007 by utilizing a well-known search algorithm. In one embodiment, the avatar remote server device  may provide the parsed and analyzed query to the UA in the first client device . Then, the UA (e.g., Microsoft\u00ae Outlook \u00ae, Novell\u00ae GroupWise\u00ae), IBM\u00ae Lotus\u00ae Note) may retrieve a corresponding email, document or information from the mailbox(s) of the sender based on its built-in search feature (e.g., ctrl-F). Then, the UA provides the corresponding email, document or information to the avatar remote server device . After obtaining the answer, the avatar remote server device  provides the answer to the second client device  via an avatar. For example, the avatar  may show the answer on a display of the second client device . Thus, the receiver does not need to wait an hour or a day to obtain the answer, e.g., by sending another email to the sender. The avatar remote server device  provides the answer to the receiver within a couple of minutes, after receiving the query from the receiver.","In a further embodiment, the avatar remote server device may retrieve the answer (e.g., emails, document, or information answering the query) from the mailbox(s) of the sender based on a relevance to the parsed and analyzed query.","In a further embodiment, the avatar remote server device  provides the answer by an email to the receiver. At the same time, the avatar remote server device  may send a notice to the receiver via the avatar . For example, a pop-up window  invoked from the avatar  may show that the avatar remote server device  just sent an email including the answer to the receiver.","In a further embodiment, the avatar remote server device  accesses an agenda associated with the parsed and analyzed query, a folder associated with the parsed and analyzed query, a previous answer associated with the parsed and analyzed query, a calendar associated with the parsed and analyzed query, a resume associated with the parsed and analyzed query, an address book associated with the parsed and analyzed query and an expert system with an artificial intelligence associated with the parsed and analyzed query to retrieve the answer (e.g., emails, documents, information answering the parsed and analyzed query).","In a further embodiment, the MSG-ID stored in the profile database (e.g., a profile database  in ) correlates the email  and the query provided from the receiver, when the avatar remote server device receives the query. For example, when receiving the query from the receiver, the avatar remote server device  checks whether the query passes through a correct avatar corresponding to the MSG-ID. If the query passes through the correct avatar, the avatar remote server device  processes the query by parsing and analyzing the query. Otherwise, the avatar remote server device  ignores the query. Alternatively, the avatar remote server device  sends a notice to the receiver to indicate that the query is invalid because it came from an avatar which does not correspond to the MSG-ID of the email . For a security purpose, the profile database may store the MSG-ID encrypted with an encryption\/description algorithm (e.g., DES (Data Encryption Standard)). When the receiver sending the query, the query may also include an encrypted email address of the receiver. By sharing a public key (i.e., an encryption key) and using a same encryption\/decryption algorithm between the receiver and the avatar remote server device , the encrypted email address of the receiver can be decrypted in the avatar remote server device .","In a further embodiment, after receiving the query from the receiver via an avatar  in the email , the avatar remote server device  sends a notification indicating the query to the sender based on a rule. The rule may be based on a decision table like following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0050"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Decision Table"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Rule 1","Rule 2"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Conditions","Access to Mailbox","Y","Y"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Access to Agenda","Y","Y"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Access to Resume","N","N"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Access to User Profile","Y","N"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Voice Question","Y","Y"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Internet Email","Y","N"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Direct Contact","Y","N"]},{"entry":[{},"Actions","Search Text","Y","Y"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Speech to text","Y","N"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}},"br":{},"b":["205","205","205","205","205","200","235","240","240","205","205","205","205","205","205","135"],"figref":"FIG. 2"},"In one embodiment, the avatar remote server device  receives the query in an audio format from the receiver, performs a speech-to-text transformation on the audio query, parses and analyzes the transformed query, retrieves a corresponding answer (e.g., emails or documents) from a database associated with the parsed and analyzed query, and provides the corresponding answer in a text or in an audio format to receiver via the avatar . The database associated with the parsed and analyzed query includes, but is not limited to, a mailbox, a folder, an address book, a previous answer, a toDoList, an expert system, and a resume.","In an exemplary use scenario, a first user receives an email message from a second user's computing device, which is also sent to a third user. Then, the first user would like to have a previous message exchange by the second user and the third user. So, the first user clicks an avatar embedded in the message to request the previous message. This request is sent to mailboxes of the third user. Previous emails between the second user and the third user are provided from the mailboxes of the third user to the first user via email(s). In a security aspect, the third user may allow only a specific mailbox to be shared. Other mailboxes of the third user may not be allowed to be searched to find a previous message between the second user and the third user. In a further embodiment, the avatar remote server device may implement a security mechanism such as authentication (e.g., validating whether the first user can read an email message of the second user based on a preference setting of the second user's mailbox) and non-repudiation (e.g., the first user should have a key to open or read the previous message). In a further embodiment, the avatar remote server device accesses a personal information management, agenda, to do list (i.e., a list including items that have to be done), an address book of the third user to retrieve more information of the previous message(s). The personal information management refers to both a practice and a study of activities people perform in order to acquire, organize, maintain, retrieve and use documents, web pages and email messages for everyday use to complete tasks and fulfill a person's various roles (as parent, employee, friend, member of a community, etc.).","In one embodiment, the avatar remote server device (e.g., the avatar remote server device  in  or an avatar remote server device  in ) accesses a mailbox of a user using a cryptographic protocol, e.g., Transport Layer Security (TLS). The TLS is a protocol providing a security and data integrity for communications over TCP\/IP networks such as Internet. The mailbox of the user may be maintained in the user's computing device and\/or a mail server (e.g., SMTP ) under one of the communication protocols described above. The avatar remote server device receives a request from a user (e.g., the request to provide the previous email between the second user and the third user), maintains a security aspect (e.g., the avatar remote server device does not access a mailbox of a user, which the user does not want to share) and provide an answer of the request (e.g., by retrieving the previous email from a mailbox of the third user). In one embodiment, the avatar remote server device informs an owner of a mailbox before accessing the mailbox. Then, if the owner of the mailbox is online and can provide the answer of the request immediately, the owner provides the answer immediately. However, a requester who sent the request to the avatar remote server device may not know whether the answer is provided from the avatar remote server device or from the owner, because the answer is provided via the avatar representing the owner regardless of whether the avatar remote server device provides the answer or whether the owner provides the answer.","When an owner of a mailbox provides the answer directly, the avatar remote server device can reuse the answer and save the answer for a future purpose, because a lot of people may ask a same question. For example, assume that a user sent an email to everybody in the user's organization to ask to attend a meeting without specifying the meeting's location and the meeting's time. Then, for the meeting, everybody may ask where the meeting is and what time the meeting starts. The avatar remote server device can provide an answer automatically, if the owner of the mailbox already provided the answer or the avatar remote server device accessed the user's agenda. When a user installs the avatar remote server device, the user (e.g., an owner of a mailbox) can specify who can access mailboxes of the user, which mailboxes can be accessed by the other users, whether agendas, resumes, toDoLists, folders, previous answers, and expert systems with artificial intelligences associated with the user can be accessed or not. An expert system is software that attempts to reproduce a performance of one or more human experts in a specific problem domain. In one embodiment, a user agent (UA), e.g., Outlook\u00ae from Microsoft\u00ae or GroupWise\u00ae from Novell\u00ae, maintains an agenda, toDoList, address book, calendar, and a mail folder. Upon receiving a question, the avatar remote server device may access the UA to retrieve an answer of the question from a mailbox, a mail folder, an agenda, an address book, a calendar, or a toDoList. The user of the avatar remote server device can also specify which services the avatar remote server device can provide. For example, as described above, the avatar remote server device can provide an answer of a question automatically to users without contacting the user by retrieving the answer from a mailbox, a mail folder, an agenda, an address book, a calendar, and\/or a toDoList of the user.","In one embodiment, a sender sends an email including an avatar. A receiver of the email can immediately ask a query related to the email via the avatar, e.g., by clicking the avatar to invoke a pop-up window, typing a query on the pop-up window and submitting the query to the avatar remote server device by pushing \u201csend\u201d button on the pop-up window. Then, the receiver submits the query to the avatar remote server device. Thus, the avatar allows the receiver to interact with the avatar remote server device via a communication protocol, e.g., SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). The avatar remote server device installed in a computing device of the sender, which includes a user agent (UA), e.g., Outlook\u00ae from Microsoft\u00ae, may communicate with the UA to provide answers or services to the receiver who asked the query via an avatar. In another embodiment, the avatar remote server device is installed in an MTA (Message Transfer Agent). Upon receiving a query from a user, the avatar remote server device installed in the MTA parses and analyzes the query and accesses a mailbox, agenda, calendar, or folder associated with the parsed and analyzed query. The mailbox, agenda, calendar, or folder may belong to anyone other than the user who asked the query. Alternatively, the mailbox, agenda, calendar or folder may belong to the user who asked the query. Then, the avatar remote server device retrieves a mail or a document associated with the parsed and analyzed query from the mailbox, agenda, calendar, or folder of the user or another user. The avatar remote server device sends the retrieved mail or document to the receiver. The retrieved mail or document may appear on a screen of a client device that the receiver uses via the avatar.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","205","140","145","150","155","175","165","170","100","175","160","150","205","165","175","205","175","160","145","175","150","145","145","140","190","105","110","115","120","125","130","140","140","175","150","175","180","240","170","175","155","205","155"]},"In a further embodiment, the database  may be configured to allow limited access to specific data. For example, the avatar remote server device  may allow a group of users to access a folder , but may not allow to access a mailbox  including emails. The avatar remote server device  may allow a group of users only access to a folder named \u201cGroup\u201d. The avatar remote server device  may allow a specific user only access to a folder named \u201cBid\u201d and emails from a specific domain (e.g., @ibm.com). Thus, the avatar remote server device  can retrieve the answer by accessing only allowed or authorized data. Alternatively, the avatar remote server device  can retrieve the answer by accessing all data (e.g., resumes -expert systems ) in the database , if an owner of the database  allows to share all the data with other users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 4"],"b":["175","140","185","190","215","190","190","125","285","140","190","140","175"]},"In a further embodiment, the avatar  comprises an interface  including a text pop-up window to provide a text question. The avatar  may be a 2D (two-Dimensional) or 3D (three-Dimensional) image where the avatar represents the owner of the database . According capabilities of the client device  and plug-ins, the interface  collects the query which is then translated in a right grammar and sent via the ARS protocol stack  in another message. The query may be an audio file recorded by the Interface . If the query is the audio file, a speech to text transformation is used at the ARS protocol stack  to covert the query into a text. The selection module  may access an expert system  which is composed of rules (e.g., table 1) to generate actions and access all other databases such as resumes -ToDoList .","In one embodiment, an owner of the database  sends a message including the avatar  to a receiver. The ARS protocol stack  in the client device  and the ARS protocol stack  in the avatar remote server device  maintains compatibility and consistency between the avatar remote server device  and the avatar  by utilizing a same communication protocol. The implementation of the avatar remote server device  and the avatar  does not require any modification of a UA (e.g., IBM\u00ae Lotus\u00ae Note) to support functions of the avatar remote server device  and the avatar .","In a further embodiment, the avatar remote server device  is implemented as hardware on a reconfigurable hardware, e.g., FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) or CPLD (Complex Programmable Logic Device, using a hardware description language (Verilog, VHDL, Handel-C, or System C). In another embodiment, the avatar remote server device  is implemented on a semiconductor chip, e.g., ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit), using a semi custom design methodology, i.e., designing a chip using standard cells and a hardware description language.","In a further embodiment, the avatar remote server device  is implemented as software using one or more programming languages, e.g., C, C++, Java, .NET, Perl, Python, etc. In one embodiment, the avatar remote server device  is recorded in a computer readable medium, e.g., CD (Compact Disc), DVD (Digital Versatile Disc), HDD (Hard Disk Drive), as an instruction, e.g., a machine language or assembly language, that is executed by a processor, e.g., Intel\u00ae Core\u00ae, IBM\u00ae Power PC\u00ae, AMD\u00ae Opteron\u00ae.","In a further embodiment, the avatar remote server device  is implemented as hardware through a computing device, e.g., a desktop, a laptop, a mainframe, a workstation, etc., by being executed in the computing device. The computing device comprises, but not limited to include, processor(s), memory(s), display device(s), input\/output device(s) and network interface(s).","The avatar  may be implemented by a plug-in or API. A standard anti-spamming system, e.g., Symantec\u00ae Norton\u2122 AntiSpam\u2122, can be added in the client device  or the avatar remote server device  to prevent spam mails.","Following is another exemplary usage scenario of the present invention.","(1) A sender (first_user_sender@ibm.com) of an email wants to send his avatar in an email, so at the end of the email the sender embeds or attaches his\/her avatar.
