The present disclosure also relates to methods for controlling undesirable vegetation.","Many recurring problems in agriculture involve controlling growth of undesirable vegetation that can, for instance, inhibit crop growth. To help control undesirable vegetation, researchers have produced a variety of chemicals and chemical formulations effective in controlling such unwanted growth. However, a continuing need exists for new compositions and methods to control growth of undesirable vegetation.","Herbicides of many types have been disclosed in the literature and a number are in commercial use. In some cases, herbicidal active ingredients have been found more effective in combination than when applied individually and this is referred to as \u201csynergy\u201d or \u201csynergism.\u201d The present disclosure is based on the discovery that (a) aminocyclopyrachlor, or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof, and (b) 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof, display a synergistic herbicidal effect when applied in combination.","Accordingly, the present disclosure relates to herbicidal compositions comprising a synergistically herbicidal effective amount of (a) aminocyclopyrachlor, or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof, and (b) 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof. In some embodiments, (a) includes aminocyclopyrachlor in acid form. In some embodiments, (b) is selected from the group consisting of the ethyl, iso-propyl, butyl, iso-butyl, iso-octyl, 2-ethylhexyl, and 2-butoxyethyl esters of 2,4-D, and the sodium, iso-propylammonium, dimethylammonium, diethanolammonium, di-iso-propylammonium, triethanolammonium, tri-iso-propylammonium, tri-iso-propanolammonium, and choline salts of 2,4-D. The acid equivalent weight ratio of (a) to (b) can be from 1:560 to 2.4:1 (e.g., from 1:32 to 1:5.3). In some embodiments, the composition further comprises an additional pesticide (e.g., amicarbazone, aminopyralid, bromoxynil, chlorsulfuron, clopyralid, dicamba, dichlorprop-P, diclosulam, diuron, florasulam, flucarbazone-sodium, flumetsulam, fluroxypyr, glyphosate, glufosinate, imazamox, imazapyr, imazapic, imazaquin, imazethapyr, imazamethabenz, indaziflam, ioxynil, MCPA, mecoprop-P, metsulfuron-methyl, oxyfluorfen, penoxsulam, picloram, pinoxaden, pyroxsulam, rimsulfuron, sulfometuron, thifensulfuron-methyl, tebuthiuron, tribenuron-methyl, triclopyr, or agriculturally acceptable salts or esters or mixtures thereof). The additional pesticide can include aminopyralid choline salt, triclopyr choline salt, or a mixture thereof. In some embodiments, the composition is free of naptalam and salts and esters thereof. In some embodiments, the composition further comprises a herbicidal safener, an agriculturally acceptable adjuvant or carrier, or a combination thereof.","The present disclosure also relates to methods of controlling undesirable vegetation, which comprise applying to vegetation or an area adjacent the vegetation or applying to soil or water to prevent the emergence or growth of vegetation (a) aminocyclopyrachlor, or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof and (b) 2,4-D, or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof, wherein (a) and (b) are each added in an amount sufficient to produce a synergistic herbicidal effect. In some embodiments, (a) and (b) are applied simultaneously. In some embodiments, (a) and (b) are applied postemergence to the undesirable vegetation. The undesirable vegetation can be controlled in, for instance, cereals, conservation reserve program (CRP) lands, trees and vines, grasses grown for seed, pastures, grasslands, rangelands, industrial vegetation management (IVM), fallow land, forestry, wildlife management areas, rights-of-way, aquatics, sugar cane, or turf. In some embodiments, the undesirable vegetation is a broadleaf weed, a woody plant, or a semi-woody plant. The undesirable vegetation can be controlled in crops tolerant to glyphosate, glufosinate, dicamba, phenoxy auxins, pyridyloxy auxins, aryloxyphenoxypropionates, acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitors, imidazolinones, acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors, 4-hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitors, protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) inhibitors, triazines, bromoxynil, or combinations thereof. For example, the undesired vegetation can be controlled in phenoxy acid tolerant crops and the phenoxy acid tolerant crops have tolerance conferred by an AAD12 gene. In some embodiments, the undesirable vegetation is resistant to auxinic herbicides. In some embodiments, (a) is applied in an amount of from 8-240 grams of acid equivalent per hectare (g ae\/ha). In some embodiments, (b) is applied in an amount of from 100-4483 g ae\/ha.","The description below sets forth details of one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.
