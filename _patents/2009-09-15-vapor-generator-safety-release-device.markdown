{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.","This invention relates to the field of chemical agent vapor generator systems which are used for calibrating and testing detectors, respirators, and other equipment.","The present invention pertains generally to the field of chemical agent vapor generator systems which are used for specialized purposes. Such purposes include calibrating and testing chemical agent detectors, challenging protective respirators such as gas masks with a controlled concentration of chemical agent to determine respirator protection factors, and similar applications involving toxic chemicals. These systems typically utilize chemical warfare agents such as Tabun (GA), Sarin (GB), Soman (GD), Cyclosarin (GF), Lewisite (L), Sulfur mustard gas (HD, H, HT, HL, HQ), Nitrogen mustard gas (HN1, HN2, HN3), and V-Agents (VE, VG, VM, VR, VX). In addition to such chemical warfare agents, these vapor generator systems may be used with toxic industrial chemicals and toxic industrial materials. The present invention comprises a safety release device for preventing the possible over-pressurization of such systems, which could cause component failure and the uncontrolled release of toxic chemicals. For the purposes herein, the phrase \u201csurety system\u201d will be used to refer to any system designed to operate with chemical warfare agents, toxic industrial chemicals, toxic industrial materials, or any combination thereof.","A chemical agent vapor generator system that would benefit from the present invention is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,728,927, which is incorporated herein by reference. The system of the '927 patent provides a means for creating a conditioned chemical agent airstream through the blending of a chemical agent airstream with a controlled relative humidity airstream. The '927 system, however, relies on a traditional flask bubbler with a rubber stopper to generate the controlled relative humidity airstream. Over-pressurization within this system, as well as other similar vapor generator systems, can occur because of a downstream blockage of gas flow, an excess inlet flow rate, or other causes. Such over-pressurization can result in a component failure and the uncontrolled release of toxic chemicals. For example, the rubber stopper of the traditional flask bubbler can be forced out of the flask if the pressure is too great thus resulting in an uncontrolled release of gas or the uncontrolled dispersion of broken glass. While it is possible to include pressure relief valves as components within chemical agent vapor generator systems either upstream or downstream of the flask bubbler, or both upstream and downstream, there are limitations to this approach. Even with such precautions of including one or more pressure relief valves within the system it is still possible that the local pressure at the flask bubbler could exceed the safe working pressure of the flask bubbler if, for example, a flow blockage occurred between the flask bubbler and the relief valve. In addition, for such surety systems, minimizing the number of components is desirable because of the exposure of these components to toxic chemicals and the corresponding need for decontamination and special handling.","The present invention overcomes these problems by providing a vapor generator with combined bubbler and pressure relief means and a limited number of parts which are easy to clean and decontaminate.","A safety relief device for use in a surety system is described. The device includes a conical flask, manifold, bubbler, and relief valve. The manifold includes a first chamber for inlet gas and a second chamber for outlet gas. The first chamber includes an inlet port, an inlet tube, and a pressure relief valve housing. The second chamber includes an outlet tube and an outlet port. The bubbler is confluent with the inlet tube and disposed within the flask.","Aspects of the invention may include one or more of the following. The conical flask may be made of glass. Additionally, the entire manifold may be made of glass, including the inlet and outlet ports, inlet and outlet tubes, bubbler, relief valve housing, and relief valve port. The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference symbols in the drawings indicate like elements.","A vapor generator safety relief device  for use in a surety system is shown in . In the preferred embodiment illustrated here, flask  is a conical flask, preferably made of glass, and having a threaded neck for engaging flask cap . Flask  serves as a vessel for holding a liquid, such as water or a chemical agent, and for housing the lower portion of manifold , which includes inlet tube , bubbler , and outlet tube . Flask  may be made of borosilicate glass, also known under the trade name PYREX, or it may be made of another type of glass used for laboratory glassware.","Manifold  is held in place relative to flask  by flask cap . The substantially cylindrical body of the lower portion of manifold  fits within the cylindrical interior of flask cap  which in turn is attached to flask  via a threaded connection. That is, flask cap  includes external threads  which engage corresponding internal threads on the neck of flask . The body of flask cap  contains a cylindrical bore or hole which is of an internal diameter only slightly larger than the outer diameter of outlet tube , thus providing a snug fit of manifold  when disposed within the bore of flask cap . An o-ring  (shown in ) is used to provide a gas-tight seal between flask cap , manifold , and flask , thus preventing gas from flowing out of the flask through any path other than outlet port  or pressure relief port . Flask cap  is preferably made of plastic, such as nylon or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) which is known by the brand name TEFLON. O-ring  is preferably made of synthetic rubber such as butyl or nitrile.","The upper portion of manifold , which is visible above flask cap , includes inlet port , outlet port , and relief valve port . Manifold  also includes outlet tube , inlet tube , and bubbler . Bubbler  in the preferred embodiment is a sintered glass disc. This allows manifold  to be constructed entirely of glass which provides transparency, an easily cleaned component, and compatibility with surety system laboratory practices. Borosilicate glass, also known under the trade name PYREX, may be used as the material choice given its overall properties which include a low coefficient of thermal expansion.","Manifold  also includes separation wall  which divides manifold  into a first chamber  for inlet gas and a second chamber  for outlet gas. The relief valve housing  and relief valve port  are part of first chamber  in the preferred embodiment as illustrated. Thus first chamber  provides for the confluence, or flowing together, of gas within inlet port , inlet tube , and relief valve housing . Similarly, second chamber  provides for the confluence of gas within outlet port  and outlet tube .","In normal operation, inlet gas is channeled by first chamber  as follows. Gas flowing into inlet port  flows through inlet tube  and bubbler  where it bubbles into the liquid within flask . Outlet gas is channeled by second chamber  as follows. Gas above the liquid surface in flask  is able to flow out into and through outlet tube  and continue flowing through outlet port  where it goes to other parts of the chemical agent vapor generator system. Separation wall , which divides first chamber  and second chamber , prevents gas from outlet tube  from flowing to first chamber  and inlet port .","The top of manifold , which is part of first chamber , includes a housing  for relief valve  and relief port . Relief valve  is preferably made of plastic such as TEFLON. Spring adjustment cap  holds relief valve  within valve housing  of manifold  and, at normal operating pressures, is seated such that gas cannot flow out of relief port . Spring adjustment cap  is adjustably biased to provide a suitable range of pressures at which the seal is broken to allow gas to flow out of relief port  thereby relieving any undesired pressure in the system. Such bias is typically set to a value within 5 to 50 psi. Further details of the relief valve are provided below in reference to the exploded view of .","When device  is in use it is typically placed within a laboratory fume hood or on a laboratory bench. The surface area provided by the base of conical flask , combined with the weight and center of gravity of the fluid contained within flask , serves to stabilize device  so it is self-standing and stable. In use, device  is connected to a source of gas (not shown), such as air or nitrogen, by connecting a tube from the gas source to inlet port . Typically, the source is a pressurized gas cylinder or air compressor and a regulator is used between the source and inlet port  in order to lower and regulate the gas pressure as delivered to device . The gas source as delivered to device  is thereby at a higher pressure than the gas in device  which causes a continuous flow of gas into inlet  and the first chamber  of manifold  where it flows down towards and into flask  through inlet tube  until it bubbles out of bubbler  and into the liquid held in flask . Gas above the liquid level within flask  is free to flow up through outlet tube  of the second chamber  and continues flowing through outlet port . Separation wall , which divides the first chamber  and the second chamber , channels the gas within outlet tube  so that it can only exit via outlet port .","The safety release feature of the present invention functions as follows. If the pressure within device  exceeds a pre-established set point, the force resulting from gas pressure acting against relief valve  will cause spring  (shown in ) to compress thereby breaking the gas seal of relief valve  and allowing gas to escape through relief port . Relief port  can be connected to an appropriate exhaust filter, such as activated carbon, so that any released toxic gasses can be contained and filtered.","Turning to the exploded view of , further details of the present invention are described. Relief valve  is attached to relief valve adjustment cap  by spring  which serves to bias relief valve  against the valve seat in relief valve housing . Spring adjustment cap  contains internal threads to adjustably engage external threads  of manifold . Turning relief valve adjustment cap  clockwise causes spring  to be further compressed, therefore establishing a higher set point at which pressure relief valve  will lift out of its seat and allow gas to flow out of relief port  of manifold . Turning relief valve adjustment cap  counter-clockwise causes spring  to be relaxed, therefore establishing a lower set point at which pressure relief valve  will lift out of its seat and allow gas to flow out of relief port  of manifold .","The all-glass construction of the preferred embodiment of manifold  is readily apparent in . The upper portion of manifold  includes inlet port , outlet port , and relief port . The upper portion of manifold  also includes relief valve housing  and external threads  for engaging the corresponding internal thread of relief valve adjustment cap . The lower portion of manifold  includes inlet tube , bubbler , and outlet tube . As noted above, all of these parts of manifold  are made of glass which provides flow visibility and is easy to clean and decontaminate. Additionally, the bubbler and relief valve functions are provided using a minimal number of parts.","Flask cap  includes external threads  for engaging internal threads  of flask . The interior bore of flask cap  is sized to allow manifold  to fit snuggly within flask cap . In particular, the outer diameter of outlet tube  of manifold  is only slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the interior bore of flask cap , thus providing a snug fit when manifold  is inserted into the bore of flask cap . O-ring  is sized to fit snuggly around outlet tube  of manifold . It is placed around outlet tube  of manifold  after inserting manifold  into flask cap  and before threading flask cap  into threaded flask neck , thereby forming a gas-tight seal once flask cap  is fully threaded into flask neck .","While specific embodiments of the invention have been described, it will be understood that additional embodiments and various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, manifold  may vary in shape and size while still performing the functions as described herein. Accordingly, these and other embodiments of the invention fall within the scope of the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
