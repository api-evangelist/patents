{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This is a continuation application which claims priority under 35 USC \u00a7120 to non-provisional application Ser. No. 11\/254,182 filed Oct. 19, 2005, which claims priority under 35 USC \u00a7119 to provisional application 60\/620,413 filed Oct. 20, 2004, the entire diclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","The present invention concerns antibody formulations, including monoclonal antibodies formulated in histidine-acetate buffer, as well as a formulation comprising an antibody that binds to domain II of HER2 (for example, Pertuzumab), and a formulation comprising an antibody that binds to DR5 (for example, Apomab).","In the past ten years, advances in biotechnology have made it possible to produce a variety of proteins for pharmaceutical applications using recombinant DNA techniques. Because proteins are larger and more complex than traditional organic and inorganic drugs (i.e. possessing multiple functional groups in addition to complex three-dimensional structures), the formulation of such proteins poses special problems. For a protein to remain biologically active, a formulation must preserve intact the conformational integrity of at least a core sequence of the protein's amino acids while at the same time protecting the protein's multiple functional groups from degradation. Degradation pathways for proteins can involve chemical instability (i.e. any process which involves modification of the protein by bond formation or cleavage resulting in a new chemical entity) or physical instability (i.e. changes in the higher order structure of the protein). Chemical instability can result from deamidation, racemization, hydrolysis, oxidation, beta elimination or disulfide exchange. Physical instability can result from denaturation, aggregation, precipitation or adsorption, for example. The three most common protein degradation pathways are protein aggregation, deamidation and oxidation. Cleland et al. 10(4): 307-377 (1993).","Included in the proteins used for pharmaceutical applications are antibodies. An example of an antibody useful for therapy is an antibody which binds to the HER2 antigen, such as Pertuzumab.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,339,142 describes a HER2 antibody composition comprising a mixture of anti-HER2 antibody and one or more acidic variants thereof, wherein the amount of the acidic variant(s) is less than about 25%. Trastuzumab is an exemplified HER2 antibody.","U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,267,958 and 6,685,940 (Andya et al.) describe lyophilized antibody formulations, including HER2 and IgE antibody formulations. WO97\/04807 and US 2004\/0197326A1 (Fick et al.) describe methods for treating allergic asthma with an IgE antibody. WO99\/01556 (Lowman et al.) relates to IgE antibody with aspartyl residues prone to isomerization, and improved variants thereof. US 2002\/0045571 (Liu et al.) provides reduced viscosity concentrated protein formulations, exemplified by humanized IgE antibody formulations, rhuMAb E25 and E26. WO 02\/096457 and US 2004\/0170623 (Arvinte et al.) describes stable liquid formulations comprising anti-IgE antibody E25. See, also, US 2004\/0197324 A1 (Liu and Shire) concerning high concentration anti-IgE formulation.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,171,586 (Lam et al) describes stable aqueous antibody formulations. A F(ab\u2032)2 rhuMAb CD18 antibody was formulated in sodium acetate and histidine-HCl buffers. The preferred formulation for rhuMAb CD18 was 10 mM sodium acetate, 8% trehalose, 0.01% TWEEN 20\u2122, pH 5.0. Acetate (pH 5.0) formulations of rhuMAb CD20 stored at 40 C for one month demonstrated greater stability than those samples formulated in histidine (pH 5.0 or 6.0).","US 2003\/0190316 (Kakuta et al.) concerns formulated antibody hPM-1, a humanized IL-6 receptor antibody. Monomer loss was the greatest in sodium citrate (pH 6.7), followed by sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), histidine-HCl (pH 7.2) and glycine (pH 7.6) in descending order. The effect of phosphate-Na (pH 6.5), phosphate-His (pH 6.0 or 6.5), His-HCl (pH 6.5), and phosphate-Na (pH 6.0) on the stability of hPM-1 was assessed.","WO 2004\/071439 (Burke et al.) state that impurities arose in a natalizumab (anti-alpha4 integrin humanized monoclonal antibody) formulation from the degradation of polysorbate 80, apparently through an oxidation reaction involving metal ions and hisitidine. Thus, a phosphate buffer was selected.","WO 2000\/066160 (English language counterpart EP 1 174 148A1) (Okada et al.) refers to a formulation of a humanized C4G1 antibody which binds to a fibrinogen receptor of a human platelet membrane glycoprotein GPIIb\/IIIa, in a sodium phosphate or sodium citrate buffer.","WO 2004\/019861 (Johnson et al.) concerns CDP870, a pegylated anti-TNFa Fab fragment, formulated at 200 mg\/ml in 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.5) and 125 mM sodium chloride.","WO 2004\/004639 (Nesta, P.) refers to a formulation for huC242-DM1, a tumor-activated immunotoxin, in a 50 mM succinic acid buffer (pH 6.0) and sucrose (5% w\/v).","WO 03\/039485 (Kaisheva et al.) found that Daclizumab (a humanized IL-2 receptor antibody) had the highest stability in sodium succinate buffer at pH 6.0, and rapidly lost potency in histidine as the buffer oxidized.","WO 2004\/001007 concerns a CD80 monoclonal antibody in a histidine HCl, sodium acetate or sodium citrate buffer.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,252,055 (Relton, J.) refers to anti-CD4 and anti-CD23 antibodies formulated in maleate, succinate, sodium acetate or phosphate buffers, with phosphate being identified as the preferred buffer.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,608,038 (Eibl et al.) refers to highly concentrated polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations with immunoglobulin, glucose or sucrose, and sodium chloride therein.","WO 03\/105894 (Oliver et al.) refers to an aqueous formulation of 100 mg\/mL SYNAGIS\u00ae, 25 mM histidine-HCl, 1.6 mM glycine, pH 6.0, and a lyophilized SYNAGIS\u00ae which when formulated (before lyophilization) contains 25 mM histidine, 1.6 mM glycine and 3% w\/v mannitol at pH 6.0.","US 2004\/0191243 A1 (Chen et al.) reports formulation of ABX-IL8, a human IgG2 antibody.","US 2003\/0113316 A1 (Kaisheva et al.) refers to a lyophilized anti-IL2 receptor antibody formulation.","The HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases are important mediators of cell growth, differentiation and survival. The receptor family includes four distinct members including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, ErbB1, or HER1), HER2 (ErbB2 or p185), HER3 (ErbB3) and HER4 (ErbB4 or tyro2).","EGFR, encoded by the erbB1 gene, has been causally implicated in human malignancy. In particular, increased expression of EGFR has been observed in breast, bladder, lung, head, neck and stomach cancer as well as glioblastomas. Increased EGFR receptor expression is often associated with increased production of the EGFR ligand, transforming growth factor alpha(TGF-\u03b1), by the same tumor cells resulting in receptor activation by an autocrine stimulatory pathway. Baselga and Mendelsohn 64:127-154 (1994). Monoclonal antibodies directed against the EGFR or its ligands, TGF-\u03b1 and EGF, have been evaluated as therapeutic agents in the treatment of such malignancies. See, e.g., Baselga and Mendelsohn., supra; Masui et al. 44:1002-1007 (1984); and Wu et al. 95:1897-1905 (1995).","The second member of the HER family, p185, was originally identified as the product of the transforming gene from neuroblastomas of chemically treated rats. The activated form of the neu proto-oncogene results from a point mutation (valine to glutamic acid) in the transmembrane region of the encoded protein. Amplification of the human homolog of neu is observed in breast and ovarian cancers and correlates with a poor prognosis (Slamon et al., 235:177-182 (1987); Slamon et al., 244:707-712 (1989); and U.S. Pat. No. 4,968,603). To date, no point mutation analogous to that in the neu proto-oncogene has been reported for human tumors. Overexpression of HER2 (frequently but not uniformly due to gene amplification) has also been observed in other carcinomas including carcinomas of the stomach, endometrium, salivary gland, lung, kidney, colon, thyroid, pancreas and bladder. See, among others, King et al., 229:974 (1985); Yokota et al., 1:765-767 (1986); Fukushige et al., 6:955-958 (1986); Guerin et al., 3:21-31 (1988); Cohen et al., 4:81-88 (1989); Yonemura et al., 51:1034 (1991); Borst et al., 38:364 (1990); Weiner et al., 50:421-425 (1990); Kern et al., 50:5184 (1990); Park et al., 49:6605 (1989); Zhau et al., 3:254-257 (1990); Aasland et al. 57:358-363 (1988); Williams et al., 59:46-52 (1991); and McCann et al., 65:88-92 (1990). HER2 may be overexpressed in prostate cancer (Gu et al. 99:185-9 (1996); Ross et al. 28:827-33 (1997); Ross et al. 79:2162-70 (1997); and Sadasivan et al. 150:126-31 (1993)).","Antibodies directed against the rat p185and human HER2 protein products have been described. Drebin and colleagues have raised antibodies against the rat neu gene product, p185See, for example, Drebin et al., 41:695-706 (1985); Myers et al., 198:277-290 (1991); and WO94\/22478. Drebin et al. 2:273-277(1988) report that mixtures of antibodies reactive with two distinct regions of p185result in synergistic anti-tumor effects on neu-transformed NIH-3T3 cells implanted into nude mice. See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,311 issued Oct. 20, 1998.","Hudziak et al., 9(3):1165-1172 (1989) describe the generation of a panel of HER2 antibodies which were characterized using the human breast tumor cell line SK-BR-3. Relative cell proliferation of the SK-BR-3 cells following exposure to the antibodies was determined by crystal violet staining of the monolayers after 72 hours. Using this assay, maximum inhibition was obtained with the antibody called 4D5 which inhibited cellular proliferation by 56%. Other antibodies in the panel reduced cellular proliferation to a lesser extent in this assay. The antibody 4D5 was further found to sensitize HER2-overexpressing breast tumor cell lines to the cytotoxic effects of TNF-\u03b1. See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,171 issued Oct. 14, 1997. The HER2 antibodies discussed in Hudziak et al. are further characterized in Fendly et al. 50:1550-1558 (1990); Kotts et al., 26(3):59A (1990); Sarup et al. 1:72-82 (1991); Shepard et al. 11(3):117-127 (1991); Kumar et al. 11(2):979-986 (1991); Lewis et al. 37:255-263 (1993); Pietras et al. 9:1829-1838 (1994); Vitetta et al. 54:5301-5309 (1994); Sliwkowski et al. 269(20):14661-14665 (1994); Scott et al. 266:14300-5 (1991); D'souza et al. 91:7202-7206 (1994); Lewis et al. 56:1457-1465 (1996); and Schaefer et al. 15:1385-1394 (1997).","A recombinant humanized version of the murine HER2 antibody 4D5 (huMAb4D5-8, rhuMAb HER2, Trastuzumab or HERCEPTIN\u00ae; U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337) is clinically active in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancers that have received extensive prior anti-cancer therapy (Baselga et al., 14:737-744 (1996)). Trastuzumab received marketing approval from the Food and Drug Administration Sep. 25, 1998 for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein.","Other HER2 antibodies with various properties have been described in Tagliabue et al. 47:933-937 (1991); McKenzie et al. 4:543-548 (1989); Maier et al. 51:5361-5369 (1991); Bacus et al. 3:350-362 (1990); Stancovski et al. () 88:8691-8695 (1991); Bacus et al. 52:2580-2589 (1992); Xu et al. 53:401-408 (1993); WO94\/00136; Kasprzyk et al. 52:2771-2776 (1992); Hancock et al. 51:4575-4580 (1991); Shawver et al. 54:1367-1373 (1994); Arteaga et al. 54:3758-3765 (1994); Harwerth et al. 267:15160-15167 (1992); U.S. Pat. No. 5,783,186; and Klapper et al. 14:2099-2109 (1997).","Homology screening has resulted in the identification of two other HER receptor family members; HER3 (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,183,884 and 5,480,968 as well as Kraus et al. () 86:9193-9197 (1989)) and HER4 (EP Pat Appln No 599,274; Plowman et al., 90:1746-1750 (1993); and Plowman et al., 366:473-475 (1993)). Both of these receptors display increased expression on at least some breast cancer cell lines.","The HER receptors are generally found in various combinations in cells and heterodimerization is thought to increase the diversity of cellular responses to a variety of HER ligands (Earp et al. 35: 115-132 (1995)). EGFR is bound by six different ligands; epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-\u03b1), amphiregulin, heparin binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), betacellulin and epiregulin (Groenen et al. 11:235-257 (1994)). A family of heregulin proteins resulting from alternative splicing of a single gene are ligands for HER3 and HER4. The heregulin family includes alpha, beta and gamma heregulins (Holmes et al., 256:1205-1210 (1992); U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,869; and Schaefer et al. 15:1385-1394 (1997)); neu differentiation factors (NDFs), glial growth factors (GGFs); acetylcholine receptor inducing activity (ARIA); and sensory and motor neuron derived factor (SMDF). For a review, see Groenen et al. 11:235-257 (1994); Lemke, G. . & 7:247-262 (1996) and Lee et al. 47:51-85 (1995). Recently three additional HER ligands were identified; neuregulin-2 (NRG-2) which is reported to bind either HER3 or HER4 (Chang et al. 387 509-512 (1997); and Carraway et al. 387:512-516 (1997)); neuregulin-3 which binds HER4 (Zhang et al. () 94(18):9562-7 (1997)); and neuregulin-4 which binds HER4 (Harari et al. 18:2681-89 (1999)) HB-EGF, betacellulin and epiregulin also bind to HER4.","While EGF and TGF\u03b1 do not bind HER2, EGF stimulates EGFR and HER2 to form a heterodimer, which activates EGFR and results in transphosphorylation of HER2 in the heterodimer. Dimerization and\/or transphosphorylation appears to activate the HER2 tyrosine kinase. See Earp et al., supra. Likewise, when HER3 is co-expressed with HER2, an active signaling complex is formed and antibodies directed against HER2 are capable of disrupting this complex (Sliwkowski et al., 269(20):14661-14665 (1994)). Additionally, the affinity of HER3 for heregulin (HRG) is increased to a higher affinity state when co-expressed with HER2. See also, Levi et al., 15: 1329-1340 (1995); Morrissey et al., 92: 1431-1435 (1995); and Lewis et al., 56:1457-1465 (1996) with respect to the HER2-HER3 protein complex. HER4, like HER3, forms an active signaling complex with HER2 (Carraway and Cantley, 78:5-8 (1994)).","To target the HER signaling pathway, rhuMAb 2C4 (Pertuzumab) was developed as a humanized antibody that inhibits the dimerization of HER2 with other HER receptors, thereby inhibiting ligand-driven phosphorylation and activation, and downstream activation of the RAS and AKT pathways. In a phase I trial of Pertuzumab as a single agent for treating solid tumors, 3 subjects with advanced ovarian cancer were treated with Pertuzumab. One had a durable partial response, and an additional subject had stable disease for 15 weeks Agus et al. 22: 192, Abstract 771 (2003).","Various ligands and receptors belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily have been identified in the art. Included among such ligands are tumor necrosis factor-alpha (\u201cTNF-alpha\u201d), tumor necrosis factor-beta (\u201cTNF-beta\u201d or \u201clymphotoxin-alpha\u201d), lymphotoxin-beta (\u201cLT-beta\u201d), CD30 ligand, CD27 ligand, CD40 ligand, OX40 ligand, 4-1BB ligand, LIGHT, Apo-1 ligand (also referred to as Fas ligand or CD95 ligand), Apo-2 ligand (also referred to as Apo2L or TRAIL), Apo-3 ligand (also referred to as TWEAK), APRIL, OPG ligand (also referred to as RANK ligand, ODF, or TRANCE), and TALL-1 (also referred to as BlyS, BAFF or THANK) (See, e.g., Ashkenazi, 2:420-430 (2002); Ashkenazi and Dixit, 281:1305-1308 (1998); Ashkenazi and Dixit, 11:255-260 (1999); Golstein, 7:R750-R753 (1997) Wallach, , Academic Press, 2000, pages 377-411; Locksley et al., 104:487-501 (2001); Gruss and Dower, 85:3378-3404 (1995); Schmid et al., 83:1881 (1986); Dealtry et al., 17:689 (1987); Pitti et al., 271:12687-12690 (1996); Wiley et al., 3:673-682 (1995); Browning et al., 72:847-856 (1993); Armitage et al. 357:80-82 (1992), WO 97\/01633 published Jan. 16, 1997; WO 97\/25428 published Jul. 17, 1997; Marsters et al., 8:525-528 (1998); Chicheportiche et al., 272:32401-32410 (1997); Hahne et al., 188:1185-1190 (1998); WO98\/28426 published Jul. 2, 1998; WO98\/46751 published Oct. 22, 1998; WO\/98\/18921 published May 7, 1998; Moore et al., 285:260-263 (1999); Shu et al., 65:680 (1999); Schneider et al., 189:1747-1756 (1999); Mukhopadhyay et al., 274:15978-15981 (1999)).","Induction of various cellular responses mediated by such TNF family ligands is typically initiated by their binding to specific cell receptors. Some, but not all, TNF family ligands bind to, and induce various biological activity through, cell surface \u201cdeath receptors\u201d to activate caspases, or enzymes that carry out the cell death or apoptosis pathway (Salvesen et al., 91:443-446 (1997)). Included among the members of the TNF receptor superfamily identified to date are TNFR1, TNFR2, TACI, GITR, CD27, OX-40, CD30, CD40, HVEM, Fas (also referred to as Apo-1 or CD95), DR4 (also referred to as TRAIL-R1), DR5 (also referred to as Apo-2 or TRAIL-R2), DcR1, DcR2, osteoprotegerin (OPG), RANK and Apo-3 (also referred to as DR3 or TRAMP).","Most of these TNF receptor family members share the typical structure of cell surface receptors including extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular regions, while others are found naturally as soluble proteins lacking a transmembrane and intracellular domain. The extracellular portion of typical TNFRs contains a repetitive amino acid sequence pattern of multiple cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), starting from the NH-terminus.","The ligand referred to as Apo-2L or TRAIL was identified several years ago as a member of the TNF family of cytokines. (see, e.g., Wiley et al., 3:673-682 (1995); Pitti et al., 271:12687-12690 (1996); WO 97\/01633; WO 97\/25428; U.S. Pat. No. 5,763,223 issued Jun. 9, 1998; U.S. Pat. No. 6,284,236 issued Sep. 4, 2001). The full-length native sequence human Apo2L\/TRAIL polypeptide is a 281 amino acid long, Type II transmembrane protein. Some cells can produce a natural soluble form of the polypeptide, through enzymatic cleavage of the polypeptide's extracellular region (Mariani et al., 137:221-229 (1997)). Crystallographic studies of soluble forms of Apo2L\/TRAIL reveal a homotrimeric structure similar to the structures of TNF and other related proteins (Hymowitz et al., 4:563-571 (1999); Cha et al., 11:253-261 (1999); Mongkolsapaya et al., 6:1048 (1999); Hymowitz et al., 39:633-640 (2000)). Apo2L\/TRAIL, unlike other TNF family members however, was found to have a unique structural feature in that three cysteine residues (at position 230 of each subunit in the homotrimer) together coordinate a zinc atom, and that the zinc binding is important for trimer stability and biological activity. (Hymowitz et al., supra; Bodmer et al., 275:20632-20637 (2000)).","It has been reported in the literature that Apo2L\/TRAIL may play a role in immune system modulation, including autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (see, e.g., Thomas et al., 161:2195-2200 (1998); Johnsen et al., 11:664-672 (1999); Griffith et al., 189:1343-1353 (1999); Song et al., 191:1095-1103 (2000)).","Soluble forms of Apo2L\/TRAIL have also been reported to induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells, including colon, lung, breast, prostate, bladder, kidney,ovarian and brain tumors, as well as melanoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma (see, e.g., Wiley et al., supra; Pitti et al., supra; U.S. Pat. No. 6,030,945 issued Feb. 29, 2000; U.S. Pat. No. 6,746,668 issued Jun. 8, 2004; Rieger et al., 427:124-128 (1998); Ashkenazi et al., 104:155-162 (1999); Walczak et al., 5:157-163 (1999); Keane et al., 59:734-741 (1999); Mizutani et al., 5:2605-2612 (1999); Gazitt, 13:1817-1824 (1999); Yu et al., 60:2384-2389 (2000); Chinnaiyan et al., 97:1754-1759 (2000)). In vivo studies in murine tumor models further suggest that Apo2L\/TRAIL, alone or in combination with chemotherapy or radiation therapy, can exert substantial anti-tumor effects (see, e.g., Ashkenazi et al., supra; Walzcak et al., supra; Gliniak et al., 59:6153-6158 (1999); Chinnaiyan et al., supra; Roth et al., 265:479-483 (1999); PCT Application US\/00\/15512; PCT Application US\/01\/23691). In contrast to many types of cancer cells, most normal human cell types appear to be resistant to apoptosis induction by certain recombinant forms of Apo2L\/TRAIL (Ashkenazi et al., supra; Walzcak et al., supra). Jo et al. has reported that a polyhistidine-tagged soluble form of Apo2L\/TRAIL induced apoptosis in vitro in normal isolated human, but not non-human, hepatocytes (Jo et al., 6:564-567 (2000); see also, Nagata, 6:502-503 (2000)). It is believed that certain recombinant Apo2L\/TRAIL preparations may vary in terms of biochemical properties and biological activities on diseased versus normal cells, depending, for example, on the presence or absence of a tag molecule, zinc content, and % trimer content (See, Lawrence et al., 7:383-385 (2001); Qin et al., , Letter to the Editor, 7:385-386 (2001)).","Apo2L\/TRAIL has been found to bind at least five different receptors. At least two of the receptors which bind Apo2L\/TRAIL contain a functional, cytoplasmic death domain. One such receptor has been referred to as \u201cDR4\u201d (and alternatively as TR4 or TRAIL-R1) (Pan et al., 276:111-113 (1997); see also WO98\/32856 published Jul. 30, 1998; WO99\/37684 published Jul. 29, 1999; WO 00\/73349 published Dec. 7, 2000; U.S. Pat.

Like DR4, DR5 is reported to contain a cytoplasmic death domain and be capable of signaling apoptosis upon ligand binding (or upon binding a molecule, such as an agonist antibody, which mimics the activity of the ligand). The crystal structure of the complex formed between Apo-2L\/TRAIL and DR5 is described in Hymowitz et al., 4:563-571 (1999).","Upon ligand binding, both DR4 and DR5 can trigger apoptosis independently by recruiting and activating the apoptosis initiator, caspase-8, through the death-domain-containing adaptor molecule referred to as FADD\/Mort1 (Kischkel et al., 12:611-620 (2000); Sprick et al., 12:599-609 (2000); Bodmer et al., 2:241-243 (2000)).","Apo2L\/TRAIL has been reported to also bind those receptors referred to as DcR1, DcR2 and OPG, which believed to function as inhibitors, rather than transducers of signaling (see., e.g., DcR1 (also referred to as TRID, LIT or TRAIL-R3) (Pan et al., 276:111-113 (1997); Sheridan et al., 277:818-821 (1997); MacFarlane et al., 272:25417-25420 (1997); Schneider et al., 416:329-334 (1997); Degli-Esposti et al., 186:1165-1170 (1997); and Mongkolsapaya et al., 160:3-6 (1998)); DcR2 (also called TRUNDD or TRAIL-R4) (Marsters et al., 7:1003-1006 (1997); Pan et al., 424:41-45 (1998); Degli-Esposti et al., 7:813-820 (1997)), and OPG.

In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations that typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they are uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method.

Preferably, the full length antibody has one or more effector functions.","The term \u201cmain species antibody\u201d herein refers to the antibody structure in a composition which is the quantitatively predominant antibody molecule in the composition. In one embodiment, the main species antibody is a HER2 antibody, such as an antibody that binds to Domain II of HER2, antibody that inhibits HER dimerization more effectively than Trastuzumab, and\/or an antibody which binds to a heterodimeric binding site of HER2. The preferred embodiment herein of a main species HER2 antibody is one comprising the variable light and variable heavy amino acid sequences in SEQ ID Nos. 3 and 4, and most preferably comprising the light chain and heavy chain amino acid sequences in SEQ ID Nos. 15 and 16 (Pertuzumab).","An \u201camino acid sequence variant\u201d antibody herein is an antibody with an amino acid sequence which differs from a main species antibody.

The amino acid sequence variants possess substitutions, deletions, and\/or additions at certain positions within or adjacent to the amino acid sequence of the main species antibody. Examples of amino acid sequence variants herein include acidic variant (e.g. deamidated antibody variant), basic variant, the antibody with an amino-terminal leader extension (e.g. VHS-) on one or two light chains thereof, antibody with a C-terminal lysine residue on one or two heavy chains thereof, etc, and includes combinations of variations to the amino acid sequences of heavy and\/or light chains. The antibody variant of particular interest herein is the antibody comprising an amino-terminal leader extension on one or two light chains thereof, optionally further comprising other amino acid sequence and\/or glycosylation differences relative to the main species antibody.","A \u201ctherapeutic monoclonal antibody\u201d is an antibody used for therapy of a human subject. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies disclosed herein include: HER2 antibodies for cancer and various non-malignant diseases or disorders; CD20 or BR3 antibodies for therapy of B cell malignancies, autoimmune diseases, graft rejection, or blocking an immune response to a foreign antigen; IgE antibodies for therapy of an IgE-mediated disorder; DR5 or VEGF antibodies for cancer therapy.","A \u201cglycosylation variant\u201d antibody herein is an antibody with one or more carbohydrate moeities attached thereto which differ from one or more carbohydate moieties attached to a main species antibody. Examples of glycosylation variants herein include antibody with a G1 or G2 oligosaccharide structure, instead a G0 oligosaccharide structure, attached to an Fc region thereof, antibody with one or two carbohydrate moieties attached to one or two light chains thereof, antibody with no carbohydrate attached to one or two heavy chains of the antibody, etc, and combinations of glycosylation alterations.","Where the antibody has an Fc region, an oligosaccharide structure such as that shown in  herein may be attached to one or two heavy chains of the antibody, e.g. at residue 299 (298, Eu numbering of residues). For Pertuzumab, G0 was the predominant oligosaccharide structure, with other oligosaccharide structures such as G0-F, G-1, Man5, Man6, G1-1, G1(1-6), G1(1-3) and G2 being found in lesser amount in the Pertuzumab composition.","Unless indicated otherwise, a \u201cG1 oligosaccharide structure\u201d herein includes G-1, G1-1, G1(1-6) and G1(1-3) structures.","An \u201camino-terminal leader extension\u201d herein refers to one or more amino acid residues of the amino-terminal leader sequence that are present at the amino-terminus of any one or more heavy or light chains of an antibody. An exemplary amino-terminal leader extension comprises or consists of three amino acid residues, VHS, present on one or both light chains of an antibody variant.","\u201cHomology\u201d is defined as the percentage of residues in the amino acid sequence variant that are identical after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent homology. Methods and computer programs for the alignment are well known in the art. One such computer program is \u201cAlign 2\u201d, authored by Genentech, Inc., which was filed with user documentation in the United States Copyright Office, Washington, D.C. 20559, on Dec. 10, 1991.","Antibody \u201ceffector functions\u201d refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g. B cell receptor; BCR), etc.","Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, full length antibodies can be assigned to different \u201cclasses\u201d. There are five major classes of full length antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into \u201csubclasses\u201d (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b3, and \u03bc, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.","\u201cAntibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity\u201d and \u201cADCC\u201d refer to a cell-mediated reaction in which nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc receptors (FcRs) (e.g. Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express Fc\u03b3RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells in summarized is Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, 9:457-92 (1991). To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. () 95:652-656 (1998).","\u201cHuman effector cells\u201d are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. Preferably, the cells express at least Fc\u03b3RIII and perform ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils; with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source thereof, e.g. from blood or PBMCs as described herein.","The terms \u201cFc receptor\u201d or \u201cFcR\u201d are used to describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII, and Fc\u03b3 RIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc\u03b3RII receptors include Fc\u03b3RIIA (an \u201cactivating receptor\u201d) and Fc\u03b3RIIB (an \u201cinhibiting receptor\u201d), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc\u03b3RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc\u03b3RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain. (see review M. in Da\u00ebron, 15:203-234 (1997)). FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, 9:457-92 (1991); Capel et al., 4:25-34 (1994); and de Haas et al., 126:330-41 (1995). Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term \u201cFcR\u201d herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., 117:587 (1976) and Kim et al., 24:249 (1994)).","\u201cComplement dependent cytotoxicity\u201d or \u201cCDC\u201d refers to the ability of a molecule to lyse a target in the presence of complement. The complement activation pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system (C1q) to a molecule (e.g. an antibody) complexed with a cognate antigen. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g. as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., 202:163 (1996), may be performed.","\u201cNative antibodies\u201d are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (V) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (V) and a constant domain at its other end. The constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light-chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains.","The term \u201cvariable\u201d refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions (FRs). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs, largely adopting a \u03b2-sheet configuration, connected by three hypervariable regions, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the P-sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the hypervariable regions from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).","The term \u201chypervariable region\u201d when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues from a \u201ccomplementarity determining region\u201d or \u201cCDR\u201d (e.g. residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Kabat et al., 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)) and\/or those residues from a \u201chypervariable loop\u201d (e.g. residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk 196:901-917 (1987)). \u201cFramework Region\u201d or \u201cFR\u201d residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.","Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called \u201cFab\u201d fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual \u201cFc\u201d fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab\u2032)fragment that has two antigen-binding sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.","\u201cFv\u201d is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and antigen-binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy chain and one light chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. It is in this configuration that the three hypervariable regions of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the V-Vdimer. Collectively, the six hypervariable regions confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three hypervariable regions specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.","The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab\u2032 fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab\u2032-SH is the designation herein for Fab\u2032 in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear at least one free thiol group. F(ab\u2032)antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab\u2032 fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.","The \u201clight chains\u201d of antibodies from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (\u03ba) and lambda (\u03bb), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.","\u201cSingle-chain Fv\u201d or \u201cscFv\u201d antibody fragments comprise the Vand Vdomains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the Vand Vdomains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see Pl\u00fcckthun in , vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994). HER2 antibody scFv fragments are described in WO93\/16185; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,571,894; and 5,587,458.","The term \u201cdiabodies\u201d refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a variable heavy domain (V) connected to a variable light domain (V) in the same polypeptide chain (V-V). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93\/11161; and Hollinger et al., 90:6444-6448 (1993).","\u201cHumanized\u201d forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et al., 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, 2:593-596 (1992).","Humanized HER2 antibodies include huMAb4D5-1, huMAb4D5-2, huMAb4D5-3, huMAb4D5-4, huMAb4D5-5, huMAb4D5-6, huMAb4D5-7 and huMAb4D5-8 or Trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN\u00ae) as described in Table 3 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337 expressly incorporated herein by reference; humanized 520C9 (WO93\/21319) and humanized 2C4 antibodies as described herein.","For the purposes herein, \u201cTrastuzumab,\u201d \u201cHERCEPTIN\u00ae,\u201d and \u201chuMAb4D5-8\u201d refer to an antibody comprising the light and heavy chain amino acid sequences in SEQ ID NOS. 13 and 14, respectively.","Herein, \u201cPertuzumab\u201d and \u201crhuMAb 2C4\u201d refer to an antibody comprising the variable light and variable heavy amino acid sequences in SEQ ID Nos. 3 and 4, respectfully. Where Pertuzumab is a full length antibody, it preferably comprises the light chain and heavy chain amino acid sequences in SEQ ID NOS. 15 and 16, respectively.","A \u201cnaked antibody\u201d is an antibody (as herein defined) that is not conjugated to a heterologous molecule, such as a cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel.","An \u201caffinity matured\u201d antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more hypervariable regions thereof which result an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration(s). Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al. 10:779-783 (1992) describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and\/or framework residues is described by: Barbas et al. 91:3809-3813 (1994); Schier et al. 169:147-155 (1995); Yelton et al. 155:1994-2004 (1995); Jackson et al., 154(7):3310-9 (1995); and Hawkins et al., 226:889-896 (1992).","An \u201cagonist antibody\u201d is an antibody which binds to and activates a receptor. Generally, the receptor activation capability of the agonist antibody will be at least qualitatively similar (and may be essentially quantitatively similar) to a native agonist ligand of the receptor. An example of an agonist antibody is one which binds to a receptor in the TNF receptor superfamily, such as DR5, and induces apoptosis of cells expressing the TNF receptor (e.g. DR5). Assays for determining induction of apoptosis are described in WO98\/51793 and WO99\/37684, both of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.","An \u201cisolated\u201d antibody is one which has been identified and separated and\/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.","A HER2 antibody which \u201cinhibits HER dimerization more effectively than Trastuzumab\u201d is one which reduces or eliminates HER dimers more effectively (for example at least about 2-fold more effectively) than Trastuzumab. Preferably, such an antibody inhibits HER2 dimerization at least about as effectively as an antibody selected from the group consisting of murine monoclonal antibody 2C4, a Fab fragment of murine monoclonal antibody 2C4, Pertuzumab, and a Fab fragment of Pertuzumab. One can evaluate HER dimerization inhibition by studying HER dimers directly, or by evaluating HER activation, or downstream signaling, which results from HER dimerization, and\/or by evaluating the antibody-HER2 binding site, etc. Assays for screening for antibodies with the ability to inhibit HER dimerization more effectively than Trastuzumab are described in Agus et al. 2: 127-137 (2002) and WO01\/00245 (Adams et al.). By way of example only, one may assay for inhibition of HER dimerization by assessing, for example, inhibition of HER dimer formation (see, e.g., FIG. 1A-B of Agus et al. 2: 127-137 (2002); and WO01\/00245); reduction in HER ligand activation of cells which express HER dimers (WO01\/00245and FIG. 2A-B of Agus et al. 2: 127-137 (2002), for example); blocking of HER ligand binding to cells which express HER dimers (WO01\/00245, and FIG. 2E of Agus et al. 2: 127-137 (2002), for example); cell growth inhibition of cancer cells (e.g. MCF7, MDA-MD-134, ZR-75-1, MD-MB-175, T-47D cells) which express HER dimers in the presence (or absence) of HER ligand (WO01\/00245 and FIGS. 3A-D of Agus et al. 2: 127-137 (2002), for instance); inhibition of downstream signaling (for instance, inhibition of HRG-dependent AKT phosphorylation or inhibition of HRG- or TGF\u03b1-dependent MAPK phosphorylation) (see, WO01\/00245, and FIGS. 2C-D of Agus et al. 2: 127-137 (2002), for example). One may also assess whether the antibody inhibits HER dimerization by studying the antibody-HER2 binding site, for instance, by evaluating a structure or model, such as a crystal structure, of the antibody bound to HER2 (See, for example, Franklin et al. 5:317-328 (2004)).","The HER2 antibody may \u201cinhibit HRG-dependent AKT phosphorylation\u201d and\/or inhibit \u201cHRG- or TGF\u03b1-dependent MAPK phosphorylation\u201d more effectively (for instance at least 2-fold more effectively) than Trastuzumab (see Agus et al. 2: 127-137 (2002) and WO01\/00245, by way of example).","The HER2 antibody may be one which does \u201cnot inhibit HER2 ectodomain cleavage\u201d (Molina et al. 61:4744-4749(2001).","A HER2 antibody that \u201cbinds to a heterodimeric binding site\u201d of HER2, binds to residues in domain II (and optionally also binds to residues in other of the domains of the HER2 extracellular domain, such as domains I and III), and can sterically hinder, at least to some extent, formation of a HER2-EGFR, HER2-HER3, or HER2-HER4 heterodimer. Franklin et al. Cancer Cell 5:317-328 (2004) characterize the HER2-Pertuzumab crystal structure, deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank (ID Code IS78), illustrating an exemplary antibody that binds to the heterodimeric binding site of HER2.","An antibody that \u201cbinds to domain II\u201d of HER2 binds to residues in domain II and optionally residues in other domain(s) of HER2, such as domains I and III. Preferably the antibody that binds to domain II binds to the junction between domains I, II and III of HER2.","A \u201cgrowth inhibitory agent\u201d when used herein refers to a compound or composition which inhibits growth of a cell, especially a HER expressing cancer cell either in vitro or in vivo. Thus, the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of HER expressing cells in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression (at a place other than S phase), such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M-phase arrest. Classical M-phase blockers include the vincas (vincristine and vinblastine), taxanes, and topo II inhibitors such as doxorubicin, epirubicin, daunorubicin, etoposide, and bleomycin. Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S-phase arrest, for example, DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen, prednisone, dacarbazine, mechlorethamine, cisplatin, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and ara-C. Further information can be found in , Mendelsohn and Israel, eds., Chapter 1, entitled \u201cCell cycle regulation, oncogenes, and antineoplastic drugs\u201d by Murakami et al. (W B Saunders: Philadelphia, 1995), especially p. 13.","Examples of \u201cgrowth inhibitory\u201d antibodies are those which bind to HER2 and inhibit the growth of cancer cells overexpressing HER2. Preferred growth inhibitory HER2 antibodies inhibit growth of SK-BR-3 breast tumor cells in cell culture by greater than 20%, and preferably greater than 50% (e.g. from about 50% to about 100%) at an antibody concentration of about 0.5 to 30 \u03bcg\/ml, where the growth inhibition is determined six days after exposure of the SK-BR-3 cells to the antibody (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,171 issued Oct. 14, 1997). The SK-BR-3 cell growth inhibition assay is described in more detail in that patent and hereinbelow. The preferred growth inhibitory antibody is a humanized variant of murine monoclonal antibody 4D5, e.g., Trastuzumab.","An antibody which \u201cinduces apoptosis\u201d is one which induces programmed cell death as determined by binding of annexin V, fragmentation of DNA, cell shrinkage, dilation of endoplasmic reticulum, cell fragmentation, and\/or formation of membrane vesicles (called apoptotic bodies). The cell is usually one which expresses the antigen to which the antibody binds. Preferably the cell is a tumor cell. For example, phosphatidyl serine (PS) translocation can be measured by annexin binding; DNA fragmentation can be evaluated through DNA laddering; and nuclear\/chromatin condensation along with DNA fragmentation can be evaluated by any increase in hypodiploid cells. Preferably, the antibody which induces apoptosis is one which results in about 2 to 50 fold, preferably about 5 to 50 fold, and most preferably about 10 to 50 fold, induction of annexin binding relative to untreated cell in an annexin binding assay using cells that express an antigen to which the antibody binds. Examples of antibodies that induce apoptosis are HER2 antibodies 7C2 and 7F3, and certain DR5 antibodies.","The \u201cepitope 2C4\u201d is the region in the extracellular domain of HER2 to which the antibody 2C4 binds. In order to screen for antibodies which bind to the 2C4 epitope, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed. Alternatively, epitope mapping can be performed to assess whether the antibody binds to the 2C4 epitope of HER2. Epitope 2C4 comprises residues from domain II in the extracellular domain of HER2. 2C4 and Pertuzumab bind to the extracellular domain of HER2 at the junction of domains I, II and III. Franklin et al. 5:317-328 (2004).","The \u201cepitope 4D5\u201d is the region in the extracellular domain of HER2 to which the antibody 4D5 (ATCC CRL 10463) and Trastuzumab bind. This epitope is close to the transmembrane domain of HER2, and within Domain IV of HER2. To screen for antibodies which bind to the 4D5 epitope, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed. Alternatively, epitope mapping can be performed to assess whether the antibody binds to the 4D5 epitope of HER2 (e.g. any one or more residues in the region from about residue 529 to about residue 625, inclusive, of HER2).","The \u201cepitope 7C2\/7F3\u201d is the region at the amino terminus, within Domain I, of the extracellular domain of HER2 to which the 7C2 and\/or 7F3 antibodies (each deposited with the ATCC, see below) bind. To screen for antibodies which bind to the 7C2\/7F3 epitope, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed. Alternatively, epitope mapping can be performed to establish whether the antibody binds to the 7C2\/7F3 epitope on HER2 (e.g. any one or more of residues in the region from about residue 22 to about residue 53 of HER2).","\u201cTreatment\u201d refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disease as well as those in which the disease is to be prevented. Hence, the patient to be treated herein may have been diagnosed as having the disease or may be predisposed or susceptible to the disease.","The terms \u201ccancer\u201d and \u201ccancerous\u201d refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma (including medulloblastoma and retinoblastoma), sarcoma (including liposarcoma and synovial cell sarcoma), neuroendocrine tumors (including carcinoid tumors, gastrinoma, and islet cell cancer), mesothelioma, schwannoma (including acoustic neuroma), meningioma, adenocarcinoma, melanoma, and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer (e.g. epithelial squamous cell cancer), lung cancer including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, anal carcinoma, penile carcinoma, testicular cancer, esophagael cancer, tumors of the biliary tract, as well as head and neck cancer.","The term \u201ceffective amount\u201d refers to an amount of a drug effective to a disease in the patient. Where the disease is cancer, the effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and\/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and\/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and\/or cytotoxic. The effective amount may extend progression free survival, result in an objective response (including a partial response, PR, or complete response, CR), increase overall survival time, and\/or improve one or more symptoms of cancer.","A \u201cHER2-expressing cancer\u201d is one comprising cells which have HER2 protein present at their cell surface.","A cancer which \u201coverexpresses\u201d a HER receptor is one which has significantly higher levels of a HER receptor, such as HER2, at the cell surface thereof, compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type. Such overexpression may be caused by gene amplification or by increased transcription or translation. HER receptor overexpression may be determined in a diagnostic or prognostic assay by evaluating increased levels of the HER protein present on the surface of a cell (e.g. via an immunohistochemistry assay; IHC). Alternatively, or additionally, one may measure levels of HER-encoding nucleic acid in the cell, e.g. via fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH; see WO98\/45479 published October, 1998), southern blotting, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, such as real time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR). One may also study HER receptor overexpression by measuring shed antigen (e.g., HER extracellular domain) in a biological fluid such as serum (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,933,294 issued Jun. 12, 1990; WO91\/05264 published Apr. 18, 1991; U.S. Pat. No. 5,401,638 issued Mar. 28, 1995; and Sias et al. 132: 73-80 (1990)). Aside from the above assays, various in vivo assays are available to the skilled practitioner. For example, one may expose cells within the body of the patient to an antibody which is optionally labeled with a detectable label, e.g. a radioactive isotope, and binding of the antibody to cells in the patient can be evaluated, e.g. by external scanning for radioactivity or by analyzing a biopsy taken from a patient previously exposed to the antibody.","Conversely, a cancer which \u201cdoes not overexpress HER2 receptor\u201d is one which does not express higher than normal levels of HER2 receptor compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type.","A cancer which \u201coverexpresses\u201d a HER ligand is one which produces significantly higher levels of that ligand compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type. Such overexpression may be caused by gene amplification or by increased transcription or translation. Overexpression of the HER ligand may be determined diagnostically by evaluating levels of the ligand (or nucleic acid encoding it) in the patient, e.g. in a tumor biopsy or by various diagnostic assays such as the IHC, FISH, southern blotting, PCR or in vivo assays described above.","The term \u201ccytotoxic agent\u201d as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and\/or causes destruction of cells.

As described above, other receptors for Apo-2L include DcR1, DcR2, and OPG. The term \u201cApo-2L receptor\u201d when used herein encompasses native sequence receptor and receptor variants. These terms encompass Apo-2L receptor expressed in a variety of mammals, including humans. Apo-2L receptor may be endogenously expressed as occurs naturally in a variety of human tissue lineages, or may be expressed by recombinant or synthetic methods. A \u201cnative sequence Apo-2L receptor\u201d comprises a polypeptide having the same amino acid sequence as an Apo-2L receptor derived from nature. Thus, a native sequence Apo-2L receptor can have the amino acid sequence of naturally-occurring Apo-2L receptor from any mammal, including humans. Such native sequence Apo-2L receptor can be isolated from nature or can be produced by recombinant or synthetic means. The term \u201cnative sequence Apo-2L receptor\u201d specifically encompasses naturally-occurring truncated or secreted forms of the receptor (e.g., a soluble form containing, for instance, an extracellular domain sequence), naturally-occurring variant forms (e.g., alternatively spliced forms) and naturally-occurring allelic variants. Receptor variants may include fragments or deletion mutants of the native sequence Apo-2L receptor.  show the 411 amino acid sequence of human DR5 receptor, along with its nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID Nos. 47 and 48) as published in WO 98\/51793 on Nov. 19, 1998. A transcriptional splice variant of human DR5 receptor is known in the art. This splice variant encodes the 440 amino acid sequence of human DR5 receptor as shown in , along with its nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID Nos. 49 and 50), and as published in WO 98\/35986 on Aug. 20, 1998.","\u201cDeath receptor antibody\u201d is used herein to refer generally to antibody or antibodies directed to a receptor in the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and containing a death domain capable of signalling apoptosis, and such antibodies include DR5 antibody and DR4 antibody.","\u201cDR5 receptor antibody\u201d, \u201cDR5 antibody\u201d, or \u201canti-DR5 antibody\u201d is used in a broad sense to refer to antibodies that bind to at least one form of a DR5 receptor or extracellular domain thereof. Optionally the DR5 antibody is fused or linked to a heterologous sequence or molecule. Preferably the heterologous sequence allows or assists the antibody to form higher order or oligomeric complexes. Optionally, the DR5 antibody binds to DR5 receptor but does not bind or cross-react with any additional Apo-2L receptor (e.g. DR4, DcR1, or DcR2). Optionally the antibody is an agonist of DR5 signalling activity.","Optionally, the DR5 antibody of the invention binds to a DR5 receptor at a concentration range of about 0.1 nM to about 20 mM as measured in a BIAcore binding assay. Optionally, the DR5 antibodies of the invention exhibit an IC50 value of about 0.6 nM to about 18 mM as measured in a BIAcore binding assay.","Purely for the purposes herein, the term \u201cApomab\u201d refers to an agonist antibody which binds to DR5 and comprises the variable heavy and variable light amino acid sequences of SEQ ID Nos. 55 and 56. Preferably Apomab comprises the heavy and light chains of SEQ ID Nos. 51 and 52, respectively.","II. Production of Antibodies","Techniques for producing antibodies which can be formulated according to the present invention follow.","(i) Antigen Selection and Preparation","Preferably, the antigen to which the antibody binds is a biologically important glycoprotein and administration of the antibody to a mammal suffering from a disease or disorder can result in a therapeutic benefit in that mammal. However, antibodies directed against nonpolypeptide antigens (such as tumor-associated glycolipid antigens; see U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,178) are also contemplated.","Where the antigen is a polypeptide, it may be a transmembrane molecule (e.g. receptor) or ligand such as a growth factor. Exemplary antigens include molecules such as renin; a growth hormone, including human growth hormone and bovine growth hormone; growth hormone releasing factor; parathyroid hormone; thyroid stimulating hormone; lipoproteins; alpha-1-antitrypsin; insulin A-chain; insulin B-chain; proinsulin; follicle stimulating hormone; calcitonin; luteinizing hormone; glucagon; clotting factors such as factor VIIIC, factor IX, tissue factor (TF), and von Willebrands factor; anti-clotting factors such as Protein C; atrial natriuretic factor; lung surfactant; a plasminogen activator, such as urokinase or human urine or tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA); bombesin; thrombin; hemopoietic growth factor; tumor necrosis factor-alpha and -beta; enkephalinase; RANTES (regulated on activation normally T-cell expressed and secreted); human macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1-alpha); a serum albumin such as human serum albumin; Muellerian-inhibiting substance; relaxin A-chain; relaxin B-chain; prorelaxin; mouse gonadotropin-associated peptide; a microbial protein, such as beta-lactamase; DNase; IgE; a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen (CTLA), such as CTLA-4; inhibin; activin; vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); receptors for hormones or growth factors; protein A or D; rheumatoid factors; a neurotrophic factor such as bone-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3,-4, -5, or -6 (NT-3, NT-4, NT-5, or NT-6), or a nerve growth factor such as NGF-b; platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF); fibroblast growth factor such as aFGF and bFGF; epidermal growth factor (EGF); transforming growth factor (TGF) such as TGF-alpha and TGF-beta, including TGF-b1, TGF-b2, TGF-b3, TGF-b4, or TGF-b5; a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) such as TNF-alpha or TNF-beta; insulin-like growth factor-I and -II (IGF-I and IGF-II); des(1-3)-IGF-I (brain IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor binding proteins; CD proteins such as CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD20, CD22 and CD40; erythropoietin; osteoinductive factors; immunotoxins; a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP); an interferon such as interferon-alpha, -beta, and -gamma; colony stimulating factors (CSFs), e.g., M-CSF, GM-CSF, and G-CSF; interleukins (ILs), e.g., IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9 and IL-10; superoxide dismutase; T-cell receptors; surface membrane proteins; decay accelerating factor; viral antigen such as, for example, a portion of the AIDS envelope; transport proteins; homing receptors; addressins; regulatory proteins; integrins such as CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD18, an ICAM, VLA-4 and VCAM; a tumor associated antigen such as HER2, HER3 or HER4 receptor; and fragments of any of the above-listed polypeptides.","Exemplary molecular targets for antibodies encompassed by the present invention include CD proteins such as CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD34 and CD40; members of the ErbB receptor family such as the EGF receptor, HER2, HER3 or HER4 receptor; B cell surface antigens, such as CD20 or BR3; a member of the tumor necrosis receptor superfamily, including DR5; prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA); cell adhesion molecules such as LFA-1, Mac 1, p150.95, VLA-4, ICAM-1, VCAM, alpha4\/beta7 integrin, and alphav\/beta3 integrin including either alpha or beta subunits thereof (e.g. anti-CD11a, anti-CD18 or anti-CD11b antibodies); growth factors such as VEGF as well as receptors therefor; tissue factor (TF); a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) such as TNF-alpha or TNF-beta, alpha interferon (alpha-IFN); an interleukin, such as IL-8; IgE; blood group antigens; flk2\/flt3 receptor; obesity (OB) receptor; mpl receptor; CTLA-4; protein C etc.","Soluble antigens or fragments thereof, optionally conjugated to other molecules, can be used as immunogens for generating antibodies. For transmembrane molecules, such as receptors, fragments of these (e.g. the extracellular domain of a receptor) can be used as the immunogen. Alternatively, cells expressing the transmembrane molecule can be used as the immunogen. Such cells can be derived from a natural source (e.g. cancer cell lines) or may be cells which have been transformed by recombinant techniques to express the transmembrane molecule. Other antigens and forms thereof useful for preparing antibodies will be apparent to those in the art.","For production of HER2 antibodies, the HER2 antigen to be used for production thereof may be, e.g., a soluble form of the extracellular domain of HER2 or a portion thereof, containing the desired epitope. Alternatively, cells expressing HER2 at their cell surface (e.g. NIH-3T3 cells transformed to overexpress HER2; or a carcinoma cell line such as SK-BR-3 cells, see Stancovski et al. PNAS (USA) 88:8691-8695 (1991)) can be used to generate antibodies.","(ii) Monoclonal Antibodies","Monoclonal antibodies are obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical and\/or bind the same epitope, except for possible variants that may arise during production of the monoclonal antibody. Thus, the modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies. For example, the monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., 256:495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567).","In the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster, is immunized as hereinabove described to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, , pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)).","The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.","Preferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these, preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA, and SP-2 or X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, 133:3001 (1984); and Brodeur et al., , pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).","Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA).","The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson et al., 107:220 (1980).","After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and\/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, , pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal.","The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.","DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as cells, simian COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce antibody protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al., 5:256-262 (1993) and Pl\u00fcckthun, 130:151-188 (1992).","In a further embodiment, monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al., 348:552-554 (1990). Clackson et al., 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., 222:581-597 (1991) describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies, respectively, using phage libraries. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity (nM range) human antibodies by chain shuffling (Marks et al., 10:779-783 (1992)), as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries (Waterhouse et al., 21:2265-2266 (1993)). Thus, these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies.","The DNA also may be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy chain and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison, et al., 81:6851 (1984)), or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide.","Typically such non-immunoglobulin polypeptides are substituted for the constant domains of an antibody, or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen-combining site having specificity for an antigen and another antigen-combining site having specificity for a different antigen.","(iii) Humanized Antibodies","Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies have been described in the art. Preferably, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as \u201cimport\u201d residues, which are typically taken from an import\u201d variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al., 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., 239:1534-1536 (1988)), by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such \u201chumanized\u201d antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567) wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.","The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called \u201cbest-fit\u201d method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework region (FR) for the humanized antibody (Sims et al., 151:2296 (1993); Chothia et al., 196:901 (1987)). Another method uses a particular framework region derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al., 89:4285 (1992); Presta et al., 151:2623 (1993)).","It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.","WO 01\/00245 describes production of exemplary humanized HER2 antibodies which bind HER2 and block ligand activation of a HER receptor. The humanized antibody of particular interest herein blocks EGF, TGF-\u03b1 and\/or HRG mediated activation of MAPK essentially as effectively as murine monoclonal antibody 2C4 (or a Fab fragment thereof) and\/or binds HER2 essentially as effectively as murine monoclonal antibody 2C4 (or a Fab fragment thereof). The humanized antibody herein may, for example, comprise nonhuman hypervariable region residues incorporated into a human variable heavy domain and may further comprise a framework region (FR) substitution at a position selected from the group consisting of 69H, 71H and 73H utilizing the variable domain numbering system set forth in Kabat et al., 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991). In one embodiment, the humanized antibody comprises FR substitutions at two or all of positions 69H, 71H and 73H.","An exemplary humanized antibody of interest herein comprises variable heavy domain complementarity determining residues GFTFTDYTMX, where X is preferably D or S (SEQ ID No. 7); DVNPNSGGSIYNQRFKG (SEQ ID No. 8); and\/or NLGPSFYFDY (SEQ ID No. 9), optionally comprising amino acid modifications of those CDR residues, e.g. where the modifications essentially maintain or improve affinity of the antibody. For example, the antibody variant of interest may have from about one to about seven or about five amino acid substitutions in the above variable heavy CDR sequences. Such antibody variants may be prepared by affinity maturation, e.g., as described below. The most preferred humanized antibody comprises the variable heavy domain amino acid sequence in SEQ ID No. 4.","The humanized antibody may comprise variable light domain complementarity determining residues KASQDVSIGVA (SEQ ID No. 10); SASYXXX, where the X as position 5 is preferably R or L, wherein the X at position 6 is preferably Y or E, and the X as position 7 is preferably T or S (SEQ ID No. 11); and\/or QQYYIYPYT (SEQ ID No. 12), e.g. in addition to those variable heavy domain CDR residues in the preceding paragraph. Such humanized antibodies optionally comprise amino acid modifications of the above CDR residues, e.g. where the modifications essentially maintain or improve affinity of the antibody. For example, the antibody variant of interest may have from about one to about seven or about five amino acid substitutions in the above variable light CDR sequences. Such antibody variants may be prepared by affinity maturation, e.g., as described below. The most preferred humanized antibody comprises the variable light domain amino acid sequence in SEQ ID No. 3.","The present application also contemplates affinity matured antibodies which bind HER2 and block ligand activation of a HER receptor. The parent antibody may be a human antibody or a humanized antibody, e.g., one comprising the variable light and\/or heavy sequences of SEQ ID Nos. 3 and 4, respectively (i.e. variant 574). The affinity matured antibody preferably binds to HER2 receptor with an affinity superior to that of murine 2C4 or variant 574 (e.g. from about two or about four fold, to about 100 fold or about 1000 fold improved affinity, e.g. as assessed using a HER2-extracellular domain (ECD) ELISA). Exemplary variable heavy CDR residues for substitution include H28, H30, H34, H35, H64, H96, H99, or combinations of two or more (e.g. two, three, four, five, six, or seven of these residues). Examples of variable light CDR residues for alteration include L28, L50, L53, L56, L91, L92, L93, L94, L96, L97 or combinations of two or more (e.g. two, to three, four, five or up to about ten of these residues).","Various forms of the humanized antibody or affinity matured antibody are contemplated. For example, the humanized antibody or affinity matured antibody may be an antibody fragment, such as a Fab, which is optionally conjugated with one or more cytotoxic agent(s) in order to generate an immunoconjugate. Alternatively, the humanized antibody or affinity matured antibody may be an full length antibody, such as an full length IgG1 antibody.","(iv) Human Antibodies","As an alternative to humanization, human antibodies can be generated. For example, it is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (J) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, e.g., Jakobovits et al., 90:2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al., 362:255-258 (1993); Bruggermann et al., 7:33 (1993); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,591,669, 5,589,369 and 5,545,807.","Alternatively, phage display technology (McCafferty et al., 348:552-553 (1990)) can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B-cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats; for their review see, e.g., Johnson, Kevin S. and Chiswell, David J., 3:564-571 (1993). Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al., 352:624-628 (1991) isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al., 222:581-597 (1991), or Griffith et al., 12:725-734 (1993). See, also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,565,332 and 5,573,905.","As discussed above, human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,567,610 and 5,229,275).","Human HER2 antibodies are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,772,997 issued Jun. 30, 1998 and WO 97\/00271 published Jan. 3, 1997.","(v) Antibody Fragments","Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of full length antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al., 24:107-117 (1992); and Brennan et al., 229:81 (1985)). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. For example, the antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fab\u2032-SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F(ab\u2032)fragments (Carter et al., 10:163-167 (1992)). According to another approach, F(ab\u2032)fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments, the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv). See WO 93\/16185; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,571,894; and 5,587,458. The antibody fragment may also be a \u201clinear antibody\u201d, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870 for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.","(vi) Bispecific Antibodies","Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of the HER2 protein. Other such antibodies may combine a HER2 binding site with binding site(s) for EGFR, HER3 and\/or HER4. Alternatively, a HER2 arm may be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T-cell receptor molecule (e.g. CD2 or CD3), or Fc receptors for IgG (Fc\u03b3R), such as Fc\u03b3RI (CD64), Fc\u03b3RII (CD32) and Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16) so as to focus cellular defense mechanisms to the HER2-expressing cell. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express HER2.These antibodies possess a HER2-binding arm and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent (e.g. saporin, anti-interferon-\u03b1, vinca alkaloid, ricin A chain, methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten). Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g. F(ab\u2032)bispecific antibodies).","WO 96\/16673 describes a bispecific HER2\/Fc\u03b3RIII antibody and U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,234 discloses a bispecific HER2\/Fc\u03b3RI antibody IDM1 (Osidem). A bispecific HER2\/Fc\u03b1 antibody is shown in WO98\/02463. U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337 teaches a bispecific HER2\/CD3 antibody. MDX-210 is a bispecific HER2-Fc\u03b3RIII Ab.","Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities (Millstein et al., 305:537-539 (1983)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93\/08829, and in Traunecker et al., 10:3655-3659 (1991).","According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1) containing the site necessary for light chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.","In a preferred embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94\/04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., 121:210 (1986).","According to another approach described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,168, the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the C3 domain of an antibody constant domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory \u201ccavities\u201d of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g. alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.","Bispecific antibodies include cross-linked or \u201cheteroconjugate\u201d antibodies. For example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (WO 91\/00360, WO 92\/200373, and EP 03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.","Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al., 229: 81 (1985) describe a procedure wherein full length antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab\u2032)fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab\u2032 fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab\u2032-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab\u2032-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab\u2032-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.","Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab\u2032-SH fragments from , which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., 175: 217-225 (1992) describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab\u2032)molecule. Each Fab\u2032 fragment was separately secreted from and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the HER2 receptor and normal human T cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets. Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al., 148(5):1547-1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab\u2032 portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The \u201cdiabody\u201d technology described by Hollinger et al., 90:6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (V) connected to a light-chain variable domain (V) by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the Vand Vdomains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary Vand Vdomains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al., 152:5368 (1994).","Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al. 147: 60 (1991).","(vii) Other Amino Acid Sequence Modifications","Amino acid sequence modification(s) of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and\/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the Antibody are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the Antibody nucleic acid, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and\/or insertions into and\/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of the Antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post-translational processes of the Antibody, such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.","A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the Antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called \u201calanine scanning mutagenesis\u201d as described by Cunningham and Wells 244:1081-1085 (1989). Here, a residue or group of target residues are identified (e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (most preferably alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed Antibody variants are screened for the desired activity.","Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and\/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include a Antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to a cytotoxic polypeptide. Other insertional variants of the Antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the Antibody to an enzyme (e.g. for ADEPT) or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.","Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the Antibody molecule replaced by a different residue. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but FR or Fc region alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of \u201cpreferred substitutions\u201d. If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity, then more substantial changes, denominated \u201cexemplary substitutions\u201d in Table 1, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced and the products screened.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0271","num":"0276"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00010","num":"00010"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Original","Exemplary","Preferred"]},{"entry":["Residue","Substitutions","Substitutions"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Ala (A)","Val; Leu; Ile","Val"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Arg (R)","Lys; Gln; Asn","Lys"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Asn (N)","Gln; His; Asp, Lys; Arg","Gln"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Asp (D)","Glu; Asn","Glu"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Cys (C)","Ser; Ala","Ser"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Gln (Q)","Asn; Glu","Asn"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Glu (E)","Asp; Gln","Asp"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Gly (G)","Ala","Ala"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["His (H)","Asn; Gln; Lys; Arg","Arg"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Ile (I)","Leu; Val; Met; Ala;","Leu"]},{"entry":[{},"Phe; Norleucine"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Leu (L)","Norleucine; Ile; Val;","Ile"]},{"entry":[{},"Met; Ala; Phe"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Lys (K)","Arg; Gln; Asn","Arg"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Met (M)","Leu; Phe; Ile","Leu"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Phe (F)","Trp; Leu; Val; Ile;","Tyr"]},{"entry":[{},"Ala; Tyr"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Pro (P)","Ala","Ala"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Ser (S)","Thr","Thr"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Thr (T)","Val; Ser","Ser"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Trp (W)","Tyr; Phe","Tyr"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Tyr (Y)","Trp; Phe; Thr; Ser","Phe"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Val (V)","Ile; Leu; Met; Phe;","Leu"]},{"entry":[{},"Ala; Norleucine"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains (in A. L. Lehninger, in , second ed., pp. 73-75, Worth Publishers, New York (1975)):","(1) non-polar: Ala (A), Val (V), Leu (L), Ile (I), Pro (P), Phe (F), Trp (W), Met (M)","(2) uncharged polar: Gly (G), Ser (S), Thr (T), Cys (C), Tyr (Y), Asn (N), Gin (Q)","(3) acidic: Asp (D), Glu (E)","(4) basic: Lys (K), Arg (R), His(H)","Alternatively, naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:","(1) hydrophobic: Norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile;","(2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gin;","(3) acidic: Asp, Glu;","(4) basic: His, Lys, Arg;","(5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro;","(6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.","Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.","Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the Antibody also may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability (particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment).","A particularly preferred type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (e.g. a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly, several hypervariable region sites (e.g. 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino substitutions at each site. The antibody variants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g. binding affinity) as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification, alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively, or additionally, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and its antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated, the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.","Another type of amino acid variant of the antibody alters the original glycosylation pattern of the antibody. By altering is meant deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody, and\/or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the antibody.","Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.","Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).","Where the antibody comprises an Fc region, the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. For example, antibodies with a mature carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached to an Fc region of the antibody are described in US Pat Appl No US 2003\/0157108 A1, Presta, L. See also US 2004\/0093621 A1 (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd). Antibodies with a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in the carbohydrate attached to an Fc region of the antibody are referenced in WO03\/011878, Jean-Mairet et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,684, Umana et al. Antibodies with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to an Fc region of the antibody are reported in WO97\/30087, Patel et al. See, also, WO98\/58964 (Raju, S.) and WO99\/22764 (Raju, S.) concerning antibodies with altered carbohydrate attached to the Fc region thereof. Antibody compositions comprising main species antibody with such carbohydrate structures attached to the Fc region are contemplated herein.","Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the Antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the antibody.","(viii) Screening for Antibodies with the Desired Properties","Techniques for generating antibodies have been described above. One may further select antibodies with certain biological characteristics, as desired.","To identify an antibody which blocks ligand activation of a HER receptor, the ability of the antibody to block HER ligand binding to cells expressing the HER receptor (e.g. in conjugation with another HER receptor with which the HER receptor of interest forms a HER hetero-oligomer) may be determined. For example, cells naturally expressing, or transfected to express, HER receptors of the HER hetero-oligomer may be incubated with the antibody and then exposed to labeled HER ligand. The ability of the HER2 antibody to block ligand binding to the HER receptor in the HER hetero-oligomer may then be evaluated.","For example, inhibition of HRG binding to MCF7 breast tumor cell lines by HER2 antibodies may be performed using monolayer MCF7 cultures on ice in a 24-well-plate format essentially as described in WO01\/00245. HER2 monoclonal antibodies may be added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes. I-labeled rHRG\u03b21-224 (25 pm) may then be added, and the incubation may be continued for 4 to 16 hours. Dose response curves may be prepared and an ICvalue may be calculated for the antibody of interest. In one embodiment, the antibody which blocks ligand activation of an HER receptor will have an ICfor inhibiting HRG binding to MCF7 cells in this assay of about 50 nM or less, more preferably 10 nM or less. Where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as a Fab fragment, the ICfor inhibiting HRG binding to MCF7 cells in this assay may, for example, be about 100 nM or less, more preferably 50 nM or less.","Alternatively, or additionally, the ability of the HER2 antibody to block HER ligand-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of a HER receptor present in a HER hetero-oligomer may be assessed. For example, cells endogenously expressing the HER receptors or transfected to expressed them may be incubated with the antibody and then assayed for HER ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation activity using an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal (which is optionally conjugated with a detectable label). The kinase receptor activation assay described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,863 is also available for determining HER receptor activation and blocking of that activity by an antibody.","In one embodiment, one may screen for an antibody which inhibits HRG stimulation of p180 tyrosine phosphorylation in MCF7 cells essentially as described in WO01\/00245. For example, the MCF7 cells may be plated in 24-well plates and monoclonal antibodies to HER2 may be added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature; then rHRG\u03b21-244 may be added to each well to a final concentration of 0.2 nM, and the incubation may be continued for 8 minutes. Media may be aspirated from each well, and reactions may be stopped by the addition of 100 \u03bcl of SDS sample buffer (5% SDS, 25 mM DTT, and 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). Each sample (25 \u03bcl) may be electrophoresed on a 4-12% gradient gel (Novex) and then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Antiphosphotyrosine (at 1 \u03bcg\/ml) immunoblots may be developed, and the intensity of the predominant reactive band at M\u02dc180,000 may be quantified by reflectance densitometry. The antibody selected will preferably significantly inhibit HRG stimulation of p180 tyrosine phosphorylation to about 0-35% of control in this assay. A dose-response curve for inhibition of HRG stimulation of p180 tyrosine phosphorylation as determined by reflectance densitometry may be prepared and an ICfor the antibody of interest may be calculated. In one embodiment, the antibody which blocks ligand activation of a HER receptor will have an ICfor inhibiting HRG stimulation of p180 tyrosine phosphorylation in this assay of about 50 nM or less, more preferably 10 nM or less. Where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as a Fab fragment, the ICfor inhibiting HRG stimulation of p180 tyrosine phosphorylation in this assay may, for example, be about 100 nM or less, more preferably 50 nM or less.","One may also assess the growth inhibitory effects of the antibody on MDA-MB-175 cells, e.g, essentially as described in Schaefer et al. 15:1385-1394 (1997). According to this assay, MDA-MB-175 cells may treated with a HER2 monoclonal antibody (10 \u03bcg\/mL) for 4 days and stained with crystal violet. Incubation with a HER2 antibody may show a growth inhibitory effect on this cell line similar to that displayed by monoclonal antibody 2C4. In a further embodiment, exogenous HRG will not significantly reverse this inhibition. Preferably, the antibody will be able to inhibit cell proliferation of MDA-MB-175 cells to a greater extent than monoclonal antibody 4D5 (and optionally to a greater extent than monoclonal antibody 7F3), both in the presence and absence of exogenous HRG.","In one embodiment, the HER2 antibody of interest may block heregulin dependent association of HER2 with HER3 in both MCF7 and SK-BR-3 cells as determined in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment such as that described in WO01\/00245 substantially more effectively than monoclonal antibody 4D5, and preferably substantially more effectively than monoclonal antibody 7F3.","To identify growth inhibitory HER2 antibodies, one may screen for antibodies which inhibit the growth of cancer cells which overexpress HER2. In one embodiment, the growth inhibitory antibody of choice is able to inhibit growth of SK-BR-3 cells in cell culture by about 20-100% and preferably by about 50-100% at an antibody concentration of about 0.5 to 30 \u03bcg\/ml. To identify such antibodies, the SK-BR-3 assay described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,171 can be performed. According to this assay, SK-BR-3 cells are grown in a 1:1 mixture of F12 and DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine and penicillin streptomycin. The SK-BR-3 cells are plated at 20,000 cells in a 35 mm cell culture dish (2 mls\/35 mm dish). 0.5 to 30 \u03bcg\/ml of the HER2 antibody is added per dish. After six days, the number of cells, compared to untreated cells are counted using an electronic COULTER\u2122 cell counter. Those antibodies which inhibit growth of the SK-BR-3 cells by about 20-100% or about 50-100% may be selected as growth inhibitory antibodies. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,171 for assays for screening for growth inhibitory antibodies, such as 4D5 and 3E8.","In order to select for HER2 antibodies which induce apoptosis, an annexin binding assay using BT474 cells is available. The BT474 cells are cultured and seeded in dishes as discussed in the preceding paragraph. The medium is then removed and replaced with fresh medium alone or medium containing 10 \u03bcg\/ml of the monoclonal antibody. Following a three day incubation period, monolayers are washed with PBS and detached by trypsinization. Cells are then centrifuged, resuspended in Ca binding buffer and aliquoted into tubes as discussed above for the cell death assay. Tubes then receive labeled annexin (e.g. annexin V-FTIC) (1 \u03bcg\/ml). Samples may be analyzed using a FACSCAN\u2122 flow cytometer and FACSCONVERT\u2122 CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Those antibodies which induce statistically significant levels of annexin binding relative to control are selected as apoptosis-inducing antibodies. In addition to the annexin binding assay, a DNA staining assay using BT474 cells is available. In order to perform this assay, BT474 cells which have been treated with the antibody of interest as described in the preceding two paragraphs are incubated with 9 \u03bcg\/ml HOECHST 33342\u2122 for 2 hr at 37\u00b0 C., then analyzed on an EPICS ELITE\u2122 flow cytometer (Coulter Corporation) using MODFIT LT\u2122 software (Verity Software House). Antibodies which induce a change in the percentage of apoptotic cells which is 2 fold or greater (and preferably 3 fold or greater) than untreated cells (up to 100% apoptotic cells) may be selected as pro-apoptotic antibodies using this assay. See WO98\/17797 for assays for screening for HER2 antibodies which induce apoptosis, such as 7C2 and 7F3.","To screen for antibodies which bind to an epitope on HER2 bound by an antibody of interest, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed to assess whether the antibody cross-blocks binding of an antibody, such as 2C4 or Pertuzumab, to HER2. Alternatively, or additionally, epitope mapping can be performed by methods known in the art and\/or one can study the antibody-HER2 structure (Franklin et al. 5:317-328 (2004)) to see what domain(s) of HER2 is\/are bound by the antibody.","(ix) Immunoconjugates","The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, toxin (e.g. a small molecule toxin or an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including fragments and\/or variants thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate).","Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have been described above. Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins, such as a calicheamicin, a maytansine (U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020), a trichothene, and CC 1065 are also contemplated herein.","In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the antibody is conjugated to one or more maytansine molecules (e.g. about 1 to about 10 maytansine molecules per antibody molecule). Maytansine may, for example, be converted to May-SS-Me which may be reduced to May-SH3 and reacted with modified antibody (Chari et al. 52: 127-131 (1992)) to generate a maytansinoid-antibody immunoconjugate.","Another immunoconjugate of interest comprises a HER2 antibody conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double-stranded DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations. Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include, but are not limited to, \u03b3, \u03b1, \u03b1, N-acetyl-\u03b3, PSAG and \u03b8(Hinman et al. 53: 3336-3342 (1993) and Lode et al. 58: 2925-2928 (1998)).

See, for example, WO 93\/21232 published Oct. 28, 1993.","The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity (e.g. a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease; DNase).","A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated HER2 antibodies. Examples include At, I, I, Y, Re, Re, Sm, Bi, Pand radioactive isotopes of Lu.","Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol)propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis(p-azidobenzoyl)hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as tolyene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. 238: 1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94\/11026. The linker may be a \u201ccleavable linker\u201d facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example, an acid-labile linker, peptidase-sensitive linker, dimethyl linker or disulfide-containing linker (Chari et al. 52: 127-131 (1992)) may be used.","Alternatively, a fusion protein comprising the HER2 antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made, e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis.","In yet another embodiment, the antibody may be conjugated to a \u201creceptor\u201d (such streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pretargeting wherein the antibody-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a \u201cligand\u201d (e.g. avidin) which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g. a radionucleotide).","(x) Other Antibody Modifications","Other modifications of the antibody are contemplated herein. For example, the antibody may be linked to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyoxyalkylenes, or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol. The antibody also may be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization (for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively), in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules), or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 16th edition, Oslo, A., Ed., (1980).","It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function, e.g. so as to enhance antigen-dependent cell-mediated cyotoxicity (ADCC) and\/or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) of the antibody. This may be achieved by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in an Fc region of the antibody. Alternatively or additionally, cysteine residue(s) may be introduced in the Fc region, thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated may have improved internalization capability and\/or increased complement-mediated cell killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). See Caron et al., 176:1191-1195 (1992) and Shopes, B. 148:2918-2922 (1992). Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti-tumor activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross-linkers as described in Wolff et al. 53:2560-2565 (1993). Alternatively, an antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al. -3:219-230 (1989).","WO00\/42072 (Presta, L.) describes antibodies with improved ADCC function in the presence of human effector cells, where the antibodies comprise amino acid substitutions in the Fc region thereof. Preferably, the antibody with improved ADCC comprises substitutions at positions 298, 333, and\/or 334 of the Fc region. Preferably the altered Fc region is a human IgG1 Fc region comprising or consisting of substitutions at one, two or three of these positions.","Antibodies with altered C1q binding and\/or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) are described in WO99\/51642, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,194,551B1, 6,242,195B1, 6,528,624B1 and 6,538,124 (Idusogie et al.). The antibodies comprise an amino acid substitution at one or more of amino acid positions 270, 322, 326, 327, 329, 313, 333 and\/or 334 of the Fc region thereof.","To increase the serum half life of the antibody, one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody (especially an antibody fragment) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,277, for example. As used herein, the term \u201csalvage receptor binding epitope\u201d refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule (e.g., IgG, IgG, IgG, or IgG) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half-life of the IgG molecule. Antibodies with substitutions in an Fc region thereof and increased serum half-lives are also described in WO00\/42072 (Presta, L.).","Engineered antibodies with three or more (preferably four) functional antigen binding sites are also contemplated (US Appln No. US2002\/0004587 A1, Miller et al.).","The HER2 antibodies disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art, such as described in Epstein et al., 82:3688 (1985); Hwang et al., 77:4030 (1980); U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545; and WO97\/38731 published Oct. 23, 1997. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,556.","Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab\u2032 fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in Martin et al. 257: 286-288 (1982) via a disulfide interchange reaction. A chemotherapeutic agent is optionally contained within the liposome. See Gabizon et al. 81(19)1484 (1989).","(ix) Exemplary Antibodies","Exemplary antibodies which can be formulated according to the present invention include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n","(xi) Antibody Variant Compositions","The present invention, in at least one aspect, concerns formulations comprising a composition which comprises a mixture of a main species antibody and one or more variants thereof. Where the main species antibody binds HER2, preferably the HER2 antibody (either or both of the main species HER2 antibody and antibody variant thereof) is one which binds to Domain II of HER2, inhibits HER dimerization more effectively than Trastuzumab, and\/or binds to a heterodimeric binding site of HER2. The preferred embodiment herein of the main species antibody is one comprising the variable light and variable heavy amino acid sequences in SEQ ID Nos. 3 and 4, and most preferably comprising a light chain amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID No. 15 and 23, and a heavy chain amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID No. 16 and 24.","In one embodiment, the formulated HER2 antibody composition comprises a mixture of the main species HER2 antibody and an amino acid sequence variant thereof comprising an amino-terminal leader extension. Preferably, the amino-terminal leader extension is on a light chain of the antibody variant (e.g. on one or two light chains of the antibody variant). The main species HER2 antibody or the antibody variant may be an full length antibody or antibody fragment (e.g. Fab of F(ab\u2032)2 fragments), but preferably both are full length antibodies. The antibody variant herein may comprise an amino-terminal leader extension on any one or more of the heavy or light chains thereof. Preferably, the amino-terminal leader extension is on one or two light chains of the antibody. The amino-terminal leader extension preferably comprises or consists of VHS-. Presence of the amino-terminal leader extension in the composition can be detected by various analytical techniques including, but not limited to, N-terminal sequence analysis, assay for charge heterogeneity (for instance, cation exchange chromatography or capillary zone electrophoresis), mass spectrometry, etc. The amount of the antibody variant in the composition generally ranges from an amount that constitutes the detection limit of any assay (preferably N-terminal sequence analysis) used to detect the variant to an amount less than the amount of the main species antibody. Generally, about 20% or less (e.g. from about 1% to about 15%, for instance from 5% to about 15%) of the antibody molecules in the composition comprise an amino-terminal leader extension. Such percentage amounts are preferably determined using quantitative N-terminal sequence analysis or cation exchange analysis (preferably using a high-resolution, weak cation-exchange column, such as a PROPAC WCX-10\u2122 cation exchange column). Aside from the amino-terminal leader extension variant, further amino acid sequence alterations of the main species antibody and\/or variant are contemplated, including but not limited to an antibody comprising a C-terminal lysine residue on one or both heavy chains thereof, a deamidated antibody variant, etc.","Moreover, the main species antibody or variant may further comprise glycosylation variations, non-limiting examples of which include HER2 antibody comprising a G1 or G2 oligosaccharide structure attached to the Fc region thereof, HER2 antibody comprising a carbohydrate moiety attached to a light chain thereof (e.g. one or two carbohydrate moieties attached to one or two light chains of the antibody), HER2 antibody comprising a non-glycosylated heavy chain.","III. Preparation of the Formulation","The present invention provides, in a first aspect, a stable pharmaceutical formulation comprising a monoclonal antibody, preferably a full length human or humanized IgG1 antibody, in histidine-acetate buffer, pH 5.5 to 6.5, preferably pH 5.8 to 6.2. However, the antibody in the formulation may be an antibody fragment comprising an antigen-binding region, such as a Fab or F(ab\u2032)2 fragment.","In another embodiment, the invention concerns a pharmaceutical formulation comprising, or consisting essentially of, a full length IgG1 antibody susceptible to deamidation or aggregation in an amount from about 10 mg\/mL to about 250 mg\/mL; histidine-acetate buffer, pH 5.5 to 6.5; saccharide selected from the group consisting of trehalose and sucrose, in an amount from about 60 mM to about 250 mM; and polysorbate 20 in an amount from about 0.01% to about 0.1%.","In yet a further embodiment, the invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising an antibody that binds to domain II of HER2 in a histidine buffer at a pH from about 5.5 to about 6.5, a saccharide and a surfactant. For example, the formulation may comprise Pertuzumab in an amount from about 20 mg\/mL to about 40 mg\/mL, histidine-acetate buffer, sucrose, and polysorbate 20, wherein the pH of the formulation is from about 5.5 to about 6.5","In another aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a DR5 antibody in a histidine buffer at a pH from about 5.5 to about 6.5, a saccharide, and a surfactant. Such a formulation may, for example, comprise, Apomab in an amount from about 10 mg\/mL to about 30 mg\/mL, histidine-acetate buffer, trehalose, and polysorbate 20, wherein the pH of the formulation is from about 5.5 to about 6.5.","The formulation is especially useful for antibodies that are susceptible to deamidation and\/or aggregation and\/or fragmentation, in that the buffer retards deamidation and\/or aggregation and\/or fragmentation of the antibody formulated therein. In addition, unlike other histidine buffers prepared using HCl, the histidine-acetate buffer lacks the chloride ion which was found to be beneficial herein in that this buffer when combined with saccharide had the same protective effect on antibody as polysorbate 20, and was stable and compatible with storage in stainless steel tanks. Thus, in addition to the formulation per se comprising the antibody susceptible to deamidation, aggregation and\/or fragmentation, the invention provides a method for reducing deamidation, aggregation and\/or fragmentation of a therapeutic monoclonal antibody (for example, relative to a composition at a different pH or in a different buffer), comprising formulating the antibody in a histidine-acetate buffer, pH 5.5 to 6.5. In this embodiment, one may determine or measure deamidation, aggregation and\/or fragmentation before and after the antibody is formulated, with the formulated antibody demonstrating acceptable deamidation, aggregation and\/or fragmentation in the formulation and upon storage thereof.","The antibody in the formulation may bind an antigen including but not limited to: HER2, CD20, IgE, DR5, BR3 and VEGF.","Where the formulated antibody binds HER2, it preferably is one which binds to Domain II of HER2, inhibits HER dimerization more effectively than Trastuzumab, and\/or binds to a heterodimeric binding site of HER2. The preferred embodiment herein of a formulated HER2 antibody is one comprising the variable light and variable heavy amino acid sequences in SEQ ID Nos. 3 and 4, and most preferably comprising the light chain and heavy chain amino acid sequences in SEQ ID Nos. 15 and 16 (Pertuzumab).","Examples of CD20 antibodies which can be formulated herein include: \u201cC2B8\u201d which is now called \u201cRituximab\u201d (\u201cRITUXAN\u00ae\u201d) commercially available from Genentech (see also U.S. Pat.

The most preferred DR5 antibody is Apomab.","Each of the formulations noted above comprises a buffer, preferably a histidine buffer, and most preferably a histidine-acetate buffer with a pH of 5.5 to 6.5, preferably 5.8 to 6.2, for example approximately 6.0. The concentration of the buffer is dictated, at least in part, by the desired pH. Exemplary concentrations for the buffer are in the range from about 1 mM to about 200 mM, preferably from about 10 mM to about 40 mM, most preferably about 20 mM.","The antibody concentration in the formulation is preferably in the range from about 10 mg\/mL to about 250 mg\/mL. The antibody concentration may be determined based on the intended use and mode of administration of the formulation. For example, where the formulation is for IV administration (e.g. a HER2 antibody), the antibody concentration in the formulation is preferably from about 20 mg\/mL to about 40 mg\/mL. In the exemplified Pertuzumab formulation intended for intravenous (IV) administration, the antibody concentration was from about 20 mg\/mL to about 40 mg\/mL, most preferably about 30 mg\/mL.","Where the antibody is for SQ or IM administration (e.g. for an anti-IgE antibody) higher concentrations of the antibody may be desired. Such substantially high antibody concentrations may be from about 50 mg\/mL to about 250 mg\/mL, or from about 80 mg\/mL to about 250 mg\/mL, or from about 100 mg\/mL to about 200 mg\/mL.","Where the formulation comprises a DR5 antibody, such as Apomab, exemplary antibody concentrations are from about 10 mg\/mL to about 30 mg\/mL, for example about 20 mg\/mL DR5 antibody; such formulation being useful for intravenous administration.","The formulation for administration is preferably an aqueous formulation (not lyophilized) and has not been subjected to prior lyophilization. While the formulation may be lyophilized, preferably it is not. However, freezing of the aqueous formulation, without simultaneous drying that occurs during freeze-drying, is specifically contemplated herein, facilitating longer term storage thereof, for instance in a stainless steel tank.","The formulation preferably further comprises a saccharide, most preferably a disaccharide, such as trehalose or sucrose.

Various stability assays are available to the skilled practitioner for confirming the stability of the formulation. For example, the formulation may be one which is found to be stable upon storage: at about 40\u00b0 C. for at least 4 weeks; at about 5\u00b0 C. or about 15\u00b0 C. for at least 3 months or at least 1 year; and\/or about \u221220\u00b0 C. for at least 3 months. Stability can be tested by evaluating physical stability, chemical stability, and\/or biological activity of the antibody in the formulation around the time of formulation as well as following storage at the noted temperatures. Physical and\/or stability can be evaluated qualitatively and\/or quantitatively in a variety of different ways, including evaluation of aggregate formation (for example using size exclusion chromatography, by measuring turbidity, and\/or by visual inspection); by assessing charge heterogeneity using cation exchange chromatography or capillary zone electrophoresis; amino-terminal or carboxy-terminal sequence analysis; mass spectrometric analysis; SDS-PAGE analysis to compare reduced and intact antibody; peptide map (for example tryptic or LYS-C) analysis; evaluting biological activity or antigen binding function of the antibody; etc. Instability may result in aggregation, deamidation (e.g. Asn deamidation), oxidation (e.g. Met oxidation), isomerization (e.g. Asp isomeriation), clipping\/hydrolysis\/fragmentation (e.g. hinge region fragmentation), succinimide formation, unpaired cysteine(s), N-terminal extension, C-terminal processing, glycosylation differences, etc. Biological activity or antigen binding function can be evaluated using various techniques available to the skilled practitioner.","As noted above, freezing of the formulation is specifically contemplated herein.

For a DR5 antibody, such as Apomab, the formulation may be provided in a 5 cc glass vial (e.g. 5.5 ml fill).","In another embodiment, the formulation is provided inside a stainless steel tank. The formulation in the stainless steel tank is optionally frozen and not freeze-dried.","One or more other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers such as those described in 16th edition, Osol, A.

Acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include; additional buffering agents; co-solvents; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; chelating agents such as EDTA; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); biodegradable polymers such as polyesters; preservatives; and\/or salt-forming counterions such as sodium.","IV. Treatment with the Antibody Formulation","In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating a disease or disorder in a subject comprising administering the formulation described herein to a subject in an amount effective to treat the disease or disorder.","Where the antibody in the formulation binds to HER2, it is preferably used to treat cancer. The cancer will generally comprise HER2-expressing cells, such that the HER2 antibody herein is able to bind to the cancer cells. Thus, the invention in this embodiment concerns a method for treating HER2-expressing cancer in a subject, comprising administering the HER2 antibody pharmaceutical formulation to the subject in an amount effective to treat the cancer. Various cancers that can be treated with the composition are listed in the definitions section above.","It is also contemplated that the HER2 antibody formulation may be used to treat various non-malignant diseases or disorders, such a include autoimmune disease (e.g. psoriasis); endometriosis; scleroderma; restenosis; polyps such as colon polyps, nasal polyps or gastrointestinal polyps; fibroadenoma; respiratory disease (see definition above); cholecystitis; neurofibromatosis; polycystic kidney disease; inflammatory diseases; skin disorders including psoriasis and dermatitis; vascular disease (see definition above); conditions involving abnormal proliferation of vascular epithelial cells; gastrointestinal ulcers; Menetrier's disease, secreting adenomas or protein loss syndrome; renal disorders; angiogenic disorders; ocular disease such as age related macular degeneration, presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, retinal neovascularization from proliferative diabetic retinopathy, retinal vascularization, diabetic retinopathy, or age related macular degeneration; bone associated pathologies such as osteoarthritis, rickets and osteoporosis; damage following a cerebral ischemic event; fibrotic or edemia diseases such as hepatic cirrhosis, lung fibrosis, carcoidosis, throiditis, hyperviscosity syndrome systemic, Osler Weber-Rendu disease, chronic occlusive pulmonary disease, or edema following burns, trauma, radiation, stroke, hypoxia or ischemia; hypersensitivity reaction of the skin; diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy; Guillain-Barre syndrome; graft versus host disease or transplant rejection; Paget's disease; bone or joint inflammation; photoaging (e.g. caused by UV radiation of human skin); benign prostatic hypertrophy; certain microbial infections including microbial pathogens selected from adenovirus, hantaviruses, spp. and ; thrombus caused by platelet aggregation; reproductive conditions such as endometriosis, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, preeclampsia, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, or menometrorrhagia; synovitis; atheroma; acute and chronic nephropathies (including proliferative glomerulonephritis and diabetes-induced renal disease); eczema; hypertrophic scar formation; endotoxic shock and fungal infection; familial adenomatosis polyposis; neurodedenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, AIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, retinitis pigmentosa, spinal muscular atrophy and cerebellar degeneration); myelodysplastic syndromes; aplastic anemia; ischemic injury; fibrosis of the lung, kidney or liver; T-cell mediated hypersensitivity disease; infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis; urinary obstructive syndrome; psoriatic arthritis; and Hasimoto's thyroiditis. Preferred non-malignant indications for therapy herein include psoriasis, endometriosis, scleroderma, vascular disease (e.g. restenosis, artherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, or hypertension), colon polyps, fibroadenoma or respiratory disease (e.g. asthma, chronic bronchitis, bronchieactasis or cystic fibrosis).","Where the antibody in the formulation binds to a B-cell surface marker such as CD20 or BR3, the formulation may be used to treat a B-cell malignancy, such as NHL or CLL, an autoimmune disease, graft rejection, or to block an immune response to a foreign antigen, such as an antibody, a toxin, a gene therapy viral vector, a graft, an infectious agent, or an alloantigen (see WO 01\/03734, Grillo-Lopez et al.).","Where the antibody in the formulation is an IgE antibody, it may be used to treat an IgE-mediated disorder (USSN 2004\/0197324 A1, Liu and Shire), such as allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, allergic gastroenteropathy, hypersensitivity, eczema, urticaria, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, parasitic disease, hyper-IgE syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, thymic alymphoplasia, IgE myeloma, and graft-versus-host reaction.","Antibodies that bind to a receptor in the TNF superfamily (for instance which bind to DR5), or which bind to VEGF (or a receptor thereof), may be used to treat cancer, various forms of which are described in the definitions section above. Preferably, the cancer treated with a DR5 antibody formulation is a solid tumor or NHL.","Where the indication is cancer, the patient may be treated with a combination of the antibody formulation, and a chemotherapeutic agent. The combined administration includes coadministration or concurrent administration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities. Thus, the chemotherapeutic agent may be administered prior to, or following, administration of the composition. In this embodiment, the timing between at least one administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and at least one administration of the composition is preferably approximately 1 month or less, and most preferably approximately 2 weeks or less. Alternatively, the chemotherapeutic agent and the composition are administered concurrently to the patient, in a single formulation or separate formulations.","Treatment with the formulation will result in an improvement in the signs or symptoms of cancer or disease. For instance, where the disease being treated is cancer, such therapy may result in an improvement in survival (overall survival and\/or progression free survival) and\/or may result in an objective clinical response (partial or complete). Moreover, treatment with the combination of the chemotherapeutic agent and the antibody formulation may result in a synergistic, or greater than additive, therapeutic benefit to the patient.","Preferably, the antibody in the formulation administered is a naked antibody. However, the antibody administered may be conjugated with a cytotoxic agent. Preferably, the immunoconjugate and\/or antigen to which it is bound is\/are internalized by the cell, resulting in increased therapeutic efficacy of the immunoconjugate in killing the cancer cell to which it binds. In a preferred embodiment, the cytotoxic agent targets or interferes with nucleic acid in the cancer cell. Examples of such cytotoxic agents include maytansinoids, calicheamicins, ribonucleases and DNA endonucleases.","The formulation is administered to a human patient in accord with known methods, such as intravenous administration, e.g., as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracerobrospinal, subcutaneous, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrathecal, oral, topical, or inhalation routes. Intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of antibody composition is preferred, with intravenous administration being most preferred.","For subcutaneous delivery, the formulation may be administered via syringe; injection device (e.g. the INJECT-EASE\u2122 and GENJEC\u2122 device); injector pen (such as the GENPEN\u2122); needleless device (e.g. MEDIJECTOR\u2122 and BIOJECTOR\u2122); or subcutaneous patch delivery system.","For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of the antibody will depend on the type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 50 mg\/kg (e.g. 0.1-20 mg\/kg) of HER2 or DR5 antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. The dosage of the antibody will generally be in the range from about 0.05 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg. If a chemotherapeutic agent is administered, it is usually administered at dosages known therefor, or optionally lowered due to combined action of the drugs or negative side effects attributable to administration of the chemotherapeutic agent. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturers' instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in Chemotherapy Service Ed., M. C. Perry, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, Md. (1992).","Other therapeutic regimens may be combined with the antibody including, but not limited to: a second (third, fourth, etc) chemotherapeutic agent(s) (i.e. \u201ccocktails\u201d of different chemotherapeutic agents); another monoclonal antibody;a growth inhibitory agent; a cytotoxic agent; a chemotherapeutic agent; EGFR-targeted drug; tyrosine kinase inhibitor; anti-angiogenic agent; and\/or cytokine; etc.","In addition to the above therapeutic regimes, the patient may be subjected to surgical removal of cancer cells and\/or radiation therapy.","V. Articles of Manufacture","In another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture is provided which contains the pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention and provides instructions for its use. The article of manufacture comprises a container. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials (e.g. dual chamber vials), syringes (such as dual chamber syringes) and test tubes. The container may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic.

All literature and patent citations are incorporated herein by reference.","These examples describe the development and stability testing of stable liquid formulations comprising Pertuzumab at protein concentrations in the range from about 10 mg\/mL-180 mg\/mL. The selected formulations had low turbidity, and were physically and chemically stable. A chloride ion was removed from the formulation to reduce the risk of corrosion. The formulation was isotonic, and suitable for subcutaneous or intramuscular delivery. Insoluble aggregate formation upon agitation stress was prevented using histidine-acetate and sucrose formulation, without the need to include polysorbate 20.","Analytical Methods","Color, Appearance and Clarity (CAC)","The color, appearance, and clarity of the samples were determined by visual inspection of vials against a white and black background under white fluorescence light at room temperature.","UV Concentration Measurements","The liquid product aliquot was first diluted with formulation buffer so that the Anear 278 nm is within 0.5-1.0 absorbance unit. The UV absorbance of the diluted samples was measured in a quartz cuvette with 1 cm path length on an HP 8453 spectrophotometer. Absorbance was measured at 278 nm and 320 nm. The absorbance from 320 nm is used to correct background light scattering due to larger aggregates, bubbles and particles. The measurements were blanked against the formulation buffer. The protein concentration was determined using the absorptivity of 1.50 (mg\/mL)cm.","pH Measurements","The pH was measured at room temperature using a RADIOMETER COPENHAGEN PHM82\u2122 pH meter. The probe used was a combined glass\/reference electrode with radiometer connector (Sigma, Cat#E-5759). Standard solutions of pH 4.01 and pH 7.00 (EM Science) were used for calibration of the pH meter.","Ion-Exchange Chromatography (IEX)","Cation exchange chromatography was employed to measure changes in charge variants.

Chemotherapy can cause cell damage and may trigger apoptosis by the intrinsic pathway in response to cellular damage. However, cancer cells often develop resistance to chemotherapy through mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene (Ashkenazi A. Targeting Death and Decoy Receptors of the Tumour-Necrosis Factor Superfamily. 2:420-430 (2002)). Death receptors, such as DR4 and DR5, located on the surface of cells trigger apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway that does not involve p53. Agonistic molecules, such as Apo2L, bind to DR4 and DR5 receptors and activate caspases 8 and 10 through Fas-associated death domain. Caspase 8 and 10 then activate caspases 3, 6, and 7 to induce apoptosis. Molecular signaling of death receptors on tumor cells has therapeutic potential for the elimination of cancer cells that are resistant to conventional therapies and molecules, like Apo2L, are currently undergoing clinical evaluation.","\u201cApomab\u201d is a full-length CHO derived humanized IgG1 constructed with a lamda light chain.

Absorbance was monitored at 280 nm.","Potency","The purpose of the potency bioassay was to measure the ability of Apomab to kill Colo205 cells using ALAMARBLUE\u2122. Colo205 is a colon carcinoma cell line, which expresses both DR5 and DR4 death receptors. This assay incorporates a fluorometric\/colorimetric growth indicator based on detection of metabolic activity. ALAMARBLUE\u2122 is a redox dye that is blue and non-fluorescent in oxidized state. The intracellular metabolic reduction converts it into a red color that is also fluorescent. The changes in color and fluorescence are proportional to the metabolic activity and number of living cells. The signal decreased when cells die. Apomab was diluted in medium with anti-Fc and then Colo 205 cells were added to Apomab samples and incubate at 37\u00b0 C. for 48 hours. ALAMARBLUE\u2122 is added for the last 2-3 hours. The plate was read at 530 nm excitation and 590 nm emission to get relative fluorescence units (RFU). The data were analyzed by KALEIDAGRAPH\u2122. A dilution curve of killing was generated.","Formulation pH Screen Study","The effect of pH on antibody stability was studied using Apomab produced from an unamplified stable cell line. For this analysis, Apomab was formulated at 20 mg\/mL antibody in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5; 20 mM histidine acetate buffer at pH 6.0 and 6.5; and 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. All of the formulations contained 240 mM trehalose and 0.02% TWEEN 20\u00ae. The formulations were stored for up to 3 months at temperatures of-70\u00b0 C., 5\u00b0 C., 30\u00b0 C., and 40\u00b0 C. and protein st various analytical assays, including CAC, pH, concentration, SEC and IEC. No significant changes in CAC, pH or protein concentration were observed during storage of the samples.","Analysis of the samples by SEC showed that no significant changes occurred during storage at 5\u00b0 C. and \u221270\u00b0 C. However, degradation observed as the formation of antibody fragments and soluble aggregates occurred during storage at 30\u00b0 C. and 40\u00b0 C. (). To compare the formulations, antibody monomer kinetics during storage was monitored and the first-order rate constants were calculated. The obtained pH rate profile for the loss in antibody monomer is shown in . The optimal condition for the stability of antibody monomer was obtained by formulating in histidine acetate buffer at pH 6.0.","Apomab charge heterogeneity was monitored by IEC. No significant changes in the IEC profile occurred during storage at 5\u00b0 C. and \u221270\u00b0 C. However, degradation observed as the formation of acidic or basic variants occurred depending on the formulation (). In general, increased basic variants were formed at lower formulation pH and more acidic variants were formed at higher formulation pH. To compare the formulations, IEC main peak kinetics was monitored during storage and the first-order rate constants were calculated. The obtained pH rate profile for the loss in IEC main peak is shown in . The rate constants observed by IEC were approximately 10 fold higher than those from SEC (). Therefore, the loss in IEC main peak was the primary degradation of the antibody that will ultimately limit the product shelf life. Furthermore, as observed by SEC, optimal antibody stability to stabilize IEC main peak was obtained by formulating in histidine acetate buffer at pH 6.0.","Following the analysis of pH screening data described above, an Apomab formulation was selected that comprised 20 mg\/mL antibody in 20 mM histidine acetate, 240 mM trehalose, 0.02% polysorbate 20, pH 6.0. For the drug product, the vial configuration consisted of 5.5 mL fill in a 5 cc FORMA VITRUM\u2122 vial with a 20 mM DAIKYO\u2122 West stopper.

characteristics of the protein were observed after being frozen at \u221220\u00b0 C. for at least 15 hours and thawed at ambient temperature three times. For example, Apomab appeared as a clear and colorless liquid, the pH remained at 6.0\u00b10.3, and the SEC monomer peak percentage was unchanged.","Apomab stability in stainless steel containers was evaluated at \u221220\u00b0 C. and 5\u00b0 C. (Table 9).","Samples were aseptically pulled from the mini-tanks at specific intervals and analyzed. Apomab showed no change in protein quality at 5\u00b0 C. by pH, CAC, protein concentration and % main peak by IEC but lost 0.1% monomer by SEC every 3 months. Decreased potency was observed during storage at 5\u00b0 C. for 3 months. However, the potency of the sample increased again at the 6 and 9 month timepoints. Therefore, the observed potency difference at the 3 month timepoint was attributed to assay variation. Apomab showed no change in protein quality at \u221220\u00b0 C. by pH, CAC, protein concentration, % monomer by SEC, % main peak by IEC, and no significant change in potency. The stability data show that Apomab is stable for at least 1 year at \u221220\u00b0 C. and three months at 5\u00b0 C.","Formulation screening studies were performed to select a formulation for Apomab. A pH screen covering the pH range 4.0 to 7.0 using sodium acetate, histidine acetate, and sodium phosphate as buffers with 240 mM trehalose dihydrate and 0.02% polysorbate 20 showed that Apomab is most stable in solution at pH 6.0. Therefore, a formulation consisting of 20 mM histidine acetate, 240 mM trehalose, 0.02% polysorbate 2, pH 6.0 was developed and demonstrated experimentally to be stable. Using this formulation, Apomab was shown to be stable for at least 12 months at 5\u00b0 C. Furthermore, Apomab was shown to be stable for at least 12 months at \u221220\u00b0 C. and three months at 5\u00b0 C. when stored in 316L stainless steel containers. Apomab was also shown to be stable when subjected to up to 3 freeze\/thaw cycles."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","Antibody Formulations","HER2 Antibodies","DR5 Antibodies","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS","EXAMPLES","Stable Pertuzumab Liquid Formulations","Example 1","Example 2","Example 3","Example 4","Example 5","Example 6","Example 7","Example 8","Example 9","Example 10","Example 11","Example 12","Results","Conclusion"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"],"sub":["L","H","L ","H ","L ","H "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A and 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A and 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIGS. 14A and 14B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIGS. 15A and 15B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIGS. 16A and 16B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":["FIGS. 17A and 17B","FIG. 17A","FIG. 17B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 18A","sub":["L","L "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 18B","sub":["H","H "]},"In  and , the CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 in each chain are enclosed within brackets, flanked by the framework regions, FR1-FR4, as indicated. 2H7 refers to murine 2H7 antibody.
