{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Network administrators often have to manage large and complex networks that stretch across multiple domains each having a plethora of resources and users. Various tools have been developed to assist network administrators in managing such networks. For example, \u201cActive Directory\u201d is a technology created by Microsoft that allows network administrators to hierarchically organize objects (e.g., users, computers, groups, etc.) within a network in order to more easily assign policies, deploy software, apply software updates, and\/or perform other management activities associated with one or more objects within the network.","However, the Active Directory framework is relatively rigid in terms of accessibility and deployment. For example, a network administrator must utilize a stand-alone Active Directory application installed on a computer to manage one or more objects within a network. Moreover, delegation of administrative authority over one or more objects from one user to another user and compliance with various security auditing requirements are cumbersome and time consuming using the Active Directory framework.","Exemplary methods and systems for managing one or more active directory objects are described herein. As described in more detail below, a web server subsystem may be configured to provide a web-based interface for display on a client device. The web server subsystem may be further configured to receive a request via the web-based interface from an end-user to perform a management activity associated with an active directory object and acquire authorization from an object security subsystem to perform the management activity associated with the active directory object. If the end-user is authorized to perform the management activity, the web server subsystem may transmit the request to an independent web services subsystem. The web services subsystem may perform the management activity associated with the active directory object and update in real-time an active directory maintained by a domain controller subsystem in accordance with the performed management activity.","As used herein, the term \u201cactive directory\u201d refers to any hierarchical grouping of active directory objects included within a particular network (e.g., domain). An active directory may include or be implemented by Microsoft's Active Directory framework and\/or any other active directory service as may serve a particular application.","The term \u201cactive directory object\u201d (or simply \u201cobject\u201d) may refer to any entity included within or controlled by a particular domain or network. For example, an active directory object may include, but is not limited to, a user or user account, a group of users (e.g., a global group or distribution list), a computing device (e.g., a personal computer), a resource (e.g., a printer), a service (e.g., email), and\/or any other network entity. In some examples, an active directory object may include a unique identifier and a set of attributes defining one or more characteristics, permissions, and\/or other settings associated with the active directory object.","The term \u201cmanagement activity\u201d may refer to any activity performed in relation to an active directory object. Exemplary management activities include, but are not limited to, adding one or more users to a global group and\/or distribution list, removing one or more users from a global group and\/or distribution list, enumerating a global group and\/or distribution list, modifying a service account associated with one or more users, creating an active directory object, assigning administrative authority over an active directory object to one or more users, and\/or any other activity associated with an active directory object.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","100","102","104","106","108","100"]},"Web server subsystem  may be specific to a particular domain (which may be trusted or untrusted) and configured to provide a web-based interface for display on a client device within the domain. Web server subsystem  may be further configured to receive a request from an end-user via the web-based interface to perform a management activity associated with an active directory object. In response to the request, web server subsystem  may determine whether the end-user is authorized to perform the management activity by communicating with object security subsystem . If the end-user is authorized to perform the management activity, web server subsystem  may transmit the request to perform the management activity to web services subsystem . If the end-user is not authorized to perform the management activity, web server subsystem  may be configured to prevent the end-user from performing the management activity.","Web services subsystem  is may be configured to perform the management activity associated with the active directory object in response to receiving the request from web server subsystem . In some examples, web services subsystem  may be \u201cindependent\u201d in that it is independent of the domain of which web server subsystem  is a part. To this end, web services subsystem  may provide one or more application programming interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d) configured to facilitate integration of one or more applications executed by web services subsystem  with web server subsystem , object security subsystem , domain controller subsystem , and\/or any other subsystem and\/or device as may serve a particular application. In this manner, as will be described in more detail below, web services subsystem  may perform management activities associated with active directory objects autonomous of domain membership.","Web services subsystem  may be further configured to update in real-time an active directory maintained by domain controller subsystem . In this manner, as will be described in more detail below, information included within the active directory may be available immediately to users thereof.","Object security subsystem  may be configured to maintain data representative of one or more authorization relationships between one or more users and one or more active directory objects. As will be described in more detail below, the data may be used to determine whether a particular end-user has authorization to perform a management activity associated with an active directory object.","In some examples, object security subsystem  may be further configured to maintain and\/or acquire data representative of one or more communication protocols and network paths used to access one or more active directory objects. As will be described in more detail below, this data may be used to facilitate access to an active directory object and updating of an active directory in accordance with a performed management activity.","Object security subsystem  may be further configured to maintain a transaction log representative of the management activity performed by web services subsystem . In this manner, as will be described in more detail below, compliance with one or more audit requirements may be facilitated.","Domain controller subsystem  may be configured to manage active directory objects included within one or more domains. To this end, domain controller subsystem  may be configured to maintain an active directory within which the active directory objects are organized.","System , including web server subsystem , web services subsystem , object security subsystem , and domain controller subsystem , may include any computer hardware and\/or computer-implemented instructions (e.g., software), or combinations of computer-implemented instructions and hardware, configured to perform one or more of the processes described herein. For example, system , including web server subsystem , web services subsystem , object security subsystem , and domain controller subsystem , may include computer hardware (e.g., one or more servers and\/or other computing devices) configured to perform one or more of the processes described herein. In some examples, each of the subsystems - may be implemented on one physical computing device or may be implemented on more than one physical computing device. Accordingly, system  may include any number of computing devices, and may employ any of a number of computer operating systems.","One or more of the processes described herein may be implemented at least in part as instructions executable by one or more computing devices. In general, a processor (e.g., a microprocessor) receives instructions, from a computer-readable medium, (e.g., a memory, etc.), and executes those instructions, thereby performing one or more processes, including one or more of the processes described herein. Such instructions may be stored and\/or transmitted using any of a variety of known computer-readable media.","A computer-readable medium (also referred to as a processor-readable medium) includes any medium that participates in providing data (e.g., instructions) that may be read by a computer (e.g., by a processor of a computer). Such a medium may take many forms, including, but not limited to, non-volatile media and\/or volatile media. Non-volatile media may include, for example, optical or magnetic disks and other persistent memory. Volatile media may include, for example, dynamic random access memory (\u201cDRAM\u201d), which typically constitutes a main memory. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, DVD, any other optical medium, a RAM, a PROM, an EPROM, a FLASH-EEPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Web server subsystem , web services subsystem , object security subsystem , and domain controller subsystem  may communicate using any communication platforms and technologies suitable for transporting data, including known communication technologies, devices, media, and protocols supportive of remote or local data communications. Examples of such communication technologies, devices, media, and protocols include, but are not limited to, data transmission media, communications devices, Microsoft Internet Information Server (\u201cIIS\u201d), Microsoft .Net 2.x Framework, Java, Extensible Markup Language (\u201cXML\u201d), Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\u201cLDAP\u201d), Secure LDAP (\u201cSLDAP\u201d), LDAP with Kerberos, Transmission Control Protocol (\u201cTCP\u201d), Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d), File Transfer Protocol (\u201cFTP\u201d), Telnet, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (\u201cHTTP\u201d), Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (\u201cHTTPS\u201d), Simple Object Access Protocol (\u201cSOAP\u201d), Session Initiation Protocol (\u201cSIP\u201d), Ethernet, and any other suitable communications technologies, devices, media, and protocols.","In some examples, web server subsystem , web services subsystem , object security subsystem , and domain controller subsystem  may communicate via a network . Network  may include one or more networks, including, but not limited to, wireless networks, broadband networks, closed media networks, cable networks, satellite networks, the Internet, intranets, local area networks, public networks, private networks, optical fiber networks, and\/or any other networks capable of carrying data and communications signals between web server subsystem , web services subsystem , object security subsystem , and domain controller subsystem .

The client device may be located within a domain associated with web server subsystem . Alternatively, the client device may be located outside the domain associated with web server subsystem . The web-based interface may be configured to execute a web application configured to facilitate management by an end-user of the client device of one or more active directory objects within the domain associated with web server subsystem  and\/or any other domain within which the end-user is authorized to operate. The web application executed by the web-based interface may be configured to utilize or run on Microsoft IIS, Microsoft .Net 2.x Framework, JavaScript, and\/or any other programming framework or environment. Because the web application is web-based, it is platform independent and does not require the purchase or installation of additional software on the client device. Moreover, as will be described in more detail below, management activities initiated by the end-user via the web-based interface may be performed in real-time without the need for secondary synchronization services to process the management activities.","In some examples, web interface facility  is further configured to display on-demand transaction logs representative of one or more performed management activities. In this manner, the end-user may track management activities initiated by the end-user and\/or by any other user. Such tracking may be performed to comply with one or more active directory object audit requests or requirements.","Web interface facility  may be further configured to provide data representative of one or more results of a performed management activity for display within the web-based interface. For example, after communication facility  receives notification that a requested management activity has been performed, web interface facility  may provide data representative of one or more results of the performed management activity for display within the web-based interface.","As shown in , storage facility  may be configured to maintain request data  representative of one or more requests to perform one or more management activities associated with one or more active directory objects as initiated by an end-user, management activity data  representative of one or more management activities associated with one or more active directory objects as initiated by an end-user, and log data  representative of one or more transaction logs.

One or more reasons for resetting the password may be entered into text box . To process the password reset request, a \u201cprocess request\u201d link  may be selected. In response, a new password may be automatically generated by object security subsystem  and\/or by any other subsystem or device. The new password may then be displayed within web-based interface .","In some examples, the end-user may desire to perform one or more management activities associated with administrative authority over an active directory object. For example, the end-user may desire to assign administrative authority over an active directory object to one or more users. To illustrate, a network administrator may desire to delegate authority over a particular active directory object (e.g., a global group) to a security trustee. The security trustee is then responsible for all management activities performed in relation to the active directory object.","A security trustee may delegate limited authority over the active directory object to one or more administrators. For example, a security trustee may allow one or more administrators to perform day to day maintenance of an active directory object. To facilitate monitoring by the security trustee of such activities, an email notification may be sent to the security trustee any time a management activity is performed in relation to the active directory object. The email notification may include a name of the user performing the management activity, a time stamp of the management activity, a description of the management activity, an IP address of the computing device used to perform the management activity, and\/or any other information associated with the management activity as may serve a particular application.","To further ensure that an active directory object is properly maintained, the security trustee may be required to periodically review and certify that the active directory object is accurate and still needed. The security trustee may additionally or alternatively be required to review and certify the authoritative rights over the active directory object that have been delegated to administrators. For example, the security trustee may be required to periodically (e.g., quarterly) review a list of administrators associated with a particular active directory object and certify that the list is accurate and complete. If the certification is not completed by the security trustee, the active directory object may be inactivated or deleted.","In some examples, object security subsystem  may be configured keep track of which users are assigned as security trustees and\/or administrators. For example, data representative of such designations may be stored within user data . In some examples, object security subsystem  may be configured to receive human resources (\u201cHR\u201d) data on a periodic basis and\/or in response to a certain event (e.g., designation of one or more security trustees and\/or administrators). The HR data may be used to determine whether there has been a change in employment status for one or more security trustees and\/or administrators. If there has been such a change, object security subsystem  may be configured to automatically reassign one or more authoritative roles to one or more users.","For example, if the HR data indicates that a user having an administrator role has left the company, object security subsystem  may be configured to automatically revoke administrator privileges from the departed user. If the HR data indicates that a user having a security trustee role has left the company, object security subsystem  may be configured to automatically designate another user (e.g., a manager of the security trustee) as the new security trustee.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 13"],"b":["1300","1300"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 14"],"b":["1400","1400"]},"As shown in , a security trustee may assign one or more administrators to the distribution list using input box  and\/or remove one or more administrators from the distribution list using input box .
