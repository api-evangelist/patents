Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to methods for identifying organ-specific proteins that are secreted into the blood. The invention further relates to methods of diagnosis and methods of use of such proteins.","2. Description of the Related Art","The ability to detect the onset of disease very early has been a longtime goal of the diagnostic field. Early detection will in most cases permit the disease to be effectively dealt with. For example, with most cancers, early detection would permit a patient to be cured by conventional therapies (chemotherapy, radiation, surgery). Hence early diagnosis is the cornerstone of dealing effectively with many diseases.","Differentially expressed proteins, particularly proteins found in blood, may serve as biological markers that can be measured for diagnostic (or therapeutic) purposes. Different approaches for measuring blood proteins have been used with varying degrees of success. In particular, two-dimensional (2-DE) gel electrophoresis is widely used for analysis of proteomic patterns in blood and other tissues. However, several limitations restrict its utility in diagnostic proteomics. First, because (2-DE) gels are limited to spatial resolution, it is difficult to resolve large numbers of proteins such as are expressed in the average cell (1,000 to 10,000 proteins) or even worse\u2014blood. High abundance proteins can distort carrier ampholyte gradients in capillary isoelectric focusing electrophoresis (CGE) and result in crowding in the gel matrix of size sieving electrophoretic methods (e.g., the second dimension of (2-DE) gel electrophoresis and CGE), thus causing irreproducibility in the spatial pattern of resolved proteins (see e.g., Corthals, G. L., et al. 18:317 (1997). Lopez, M. F., and W. F. Patton, 18:338 (1997)). Note, for example, that albumen constitutes about 51% of the blood protein. Indeed, 22 proteins constitute about 99% of the blood protein and most of these will not be useful diagnostic markers\u2014those will be present in the 1% of the remaining proteins that are often hidden by the abundant proteins. High abundance proteins can also precipitate in a gel and cause streaking of fractionated proteins (Corthals, G. L., et al., supra). Variations in the crosslinking density and electric field strength in cast gels can further distort the spatial pattern of resolved proteins. Another problem is the inability to resolve low abundance proteins neighboring high abundance proteins in a gel because of the high staining background and limited dynamic range of gel staining and imaging techniques. Limitations with staining also make it difficult to obtain reproducible and quantifiable protein concentration values, with average standard variations in relative protein abundance between replicate (2-DE) gels reported to be 20% and as high as 45% (Anderson, L. and J. Seilhamer, 18:533 (1997)). For example, investigators were only able to match 62% of the spots formed on 3-7 gels run under similar conditions (Lopez, M. F., and W. F. Patton, supra; see also Blomber, A., et al., 16:1935 (1995) and Corbett, J. M., et al., 15:1205 (1994)). Additionally, many proteins are not soluble in buffers compatible with acrylamide gels, or fail to enter the gel efficiently because of their high molecular weight (see e.g., Ramsby, M., et al., 15:265 (1994)).","Thus, a major stumbling block in the diagnostic proteomic analysis of the blood is the high degree of complexity of the blood proteome. Another major challenge is the large dynamic range across which proteins are expressed\u2014about 10e. This means that one protein may be present at one copy in a given volume, whereas another may be present at 10ecopies. Additionally, pattern analysis using techniques such as 2-DGE and other similar techniques has been problematic primarily as a result of the irreproducibility of the gel patterns, inability to detect very low abundance proteins, difficulty in quantitating the individual spots (e.g., proteins) that make up a complex proteomic pattern and the inability to identify the individual proteins that constitute the complex pattern. Further, the ability to extend these techniques to easy, consistent, and high throughput diagnostic assays has been extremely limited. Thus, there is a need in the art to provide such diagnostic assays. The present invention provides for methods and assays that fulfill these and other needs.","One aspect of the invention provides a method for identifying organ-specific proteins secreted into the blood comprising, generating a signature sequence from transcripts from a sample from a specific organ; identifying transcripts that are specifically expressed in the organ; identifying from the transcripts in (b) those transcripts that encode secreted proteins; and thereby identifying organ-specific proteins secreted into the blood.","Another aspect of the invention provides a method for identifying organ-specific proteins secreted into the blood comprising, generating a signature sequence from substantially all transcripts from a sample from a specific organ; comparing the signature sequences to a database of known sequences to determine the identity of the transcript; comparing the identified transcripts to transcripts expressed in other organs; removing any transcripts that are substantially expressed in other organs; identifying computationally from the remaining transcripts those that encode a signal peptide; confirming the presence of the secreted proteins in a blood sample; and thereby identifying organ-specific proteins secreted into the blood.","In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method for diagnosing a biological condition in a subject comprising measuring the level of a plurality of organ-specific proteins in the blood of the subject, wherein the plurality of organ-specific proteins are secreted from the same organ and wherein the levels of the plurality of organ-specific proteins together provide a diagnostic fingerprint for the biological condition in the subject. In one embodiment of the method, the level of the plurality of organ-specific proteins is measured using any one or more methods, such as mass spectrometry, an immunoassay such as an ELISA, Western blot, microfluidics\/nanotechnology sensors, and aptamer capture assay. In this regard, an aptamer may be used in a similar manner to an antibody in a variety of appropriate binding assays known to the skilled artisan and described herein. In certain embodiments, the plurality of organ-specific proteins is measured using tandem mass spectrometry or other spectrometry-based techniques. In one embodiment, the plurality of organ-specific proteins comprises from at least about 1 or 2 organ-specific proteins to about 100, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, or more organ-specific proteins.

As would be readily appreciated by the skilled artisan, an altered level can mean an increase in the level or a decrease in the level. In this regard, the skilled artisan would readily appreciate that a variety of statistical tests can be used to determine if an altered level is significant. The Z-test (Man, M. Z., et al., 16: 953-959, 2000) or other appropriate statistical tests can be used to calculate P values for comparison of protein expression levels. In certain embodiments, the level of each of the plurality of organ-specific proteins in the blood sample from the subject is compared to a previously determined normal control level of each of the plurality of organ-specific proteins taking into account standard deviation.

Thus, in one embodiment, the predetermined control amount is determined from one or more normal blood samples. The skilled artisan would readily appreciate that a variety of statistical tests can be used to determine if an altered level of a given protein is significant. The Z-test (Man, M. Z., et al., 16: 953-959, 2000) or other appropriate statistical tests can be used to calculate P values for comparison of protein expression levels. In certain embodiments, the level of each of the plurality of organ-specific proteins in the blood sample from the subject is compared to a previously determined normal control level of each of the plurality of organ-specific proteins taking into account standard deviation (see e.g., U.S. Patent Application No. 20020095259).

In one embodiment, the organ-specific proteins comprise prostate-specific proteins, liver-specific proteins, or breast-specific proteins. In this regard, the organ-specific proteins can be from any organ, tissue, cell, or system as described further herein.","A further aspect of the present invention provides a diagnostic panel for determining the presence or absence of disease in a subject comprising, a plurality of detection reagents each specific for detecting one of a plurality of organ-specific proteins present in a blood sample; wherein the organ-specific proteins are secreted from the same organ and wherein detection of the plurality of organ-specific proteins with the plurality of detection reagents results in a fingerprint indicative of the presence or absence of disease in the subject. As noted elsewhere herein, the term \u201csubject\u201d is intended to include humans Thus, as further described herein, the organ-specific molecular blood fingerprint is unique for a given disease and further for a given stage of the disease and thus is a powerful diagnostic indicator.

In certain embodiments, the pattern of interaction is the combination of, a snapshot of sorts, of the different quantitative levels of the organ-specific proteins detected. Thus, in certain embodiments, the pattern of interaction is a set of numbers, each number corresponding to a level of a particular organ-specific protein. This set of numbers and the specific organ-specific proteins that they correspond to together make up the pattern of interaction (e.g., fingerprint) that defines a biological condition.","A further aspect of the present invention provides a method for diagnosing a biological condition in a subject comprising measuring the level of a plurality of organ-specific proteins in the blood of the subject, wherein the organ-specific proteins are secreted from the same organ or specific to the same organ and wherein the levels of the plurality of organ-specific proteins together provide a fingerprint for the biological condition in the subject; thereby diagnosing the biological condition.

SEQ ID NOs:1797-1947 are the GENBANK sequences of prostate-specific genes as described in Table 5. Both polynucleotide and amino acid sequences are provided where available for each GENBANK accession number.","A powerful new systems approach to disease is revealing powerful new blood diagnostics approaches. Particularly, in specific cells there are protein and gene regulatory networks that mediate the normal functions of the cell. The disease process causes one or more of these networks to be perturbed, either genetically or environmentally (e.g. infections). The disease-altered networks result in altered patterns of protein expression\u2014and some of the transcripts with altered expression levels are organ (cell)-specific and some of these organ-specific transcripts encode secreted proteins. Thus, disease leads to altered expression patterns of organ-specific, secreted proteins in the blood.","Hence the blood may be viewed as a window into the health and disease of an individual. The levels of organ-specific secreted proteins present in the blood taken together represent molecular fingerprints in the blood that reflect the operation of normal organs. Each organ has a specific quantitative molecular fingerprint. When disease attacks an organ, that blood fingerprint changes, for example, in the levels of these proteins expressed in the blood and the change in the fingerprint correlates with the specific disease. The changes in the fingerprints occur as a consequence of virtually any disease or organ perturbation with each disease fingerprint being unique. The changes in the fingerprints are sufficiently informative to carry out disease stratification, follow the progression of the particular disease stratification or type and follow responses to therapy. These fingerprints also allow one to stratify patients with regard to their ability to respond to particular therapies and even to visualize adverse effects of drugs. The disease fingerprints are determined by comparing the blood from normal individuals against that from patients with specific diseases at known stages. Not only will the absolute levels of the changes in the proteins constituting individual fingerprints be determined, but all the protein changes (e.g. N changed proteins) will be compared against one another to generate an N-dimensional shape space that will correlate even more powerfully with the disease stratifications and progression states described above (see e.g., U.S. Patent Application No. 20020095259).","In the studies described herein, the transcriptomes of two prostate cancer cell lines were analyzed: LNCaP, an androgen sensitive cell line, and hence a model for early stage of prostate cancer; and a variant of this cell, CL1, an androgen unresponsive cell line, thus, a model for late stage of prostate cancer. Analyses of the transcriptomes of these two cell lines revealed changes in cellular states that occur with the progression of prostate cancer. These transcriptomes were also compared to normal prostate tissue, prostate cancer tissues and prostate cancer metastases. These prostate transcriptomes were compared against their counterparts from 29 other tissues to identify those transcripts that are primarily expressed in the prostate. Computational approaches were used to predict which of these transcripts encode secreted proteins. Further, a prostate protein, referred to as WDR19, that was previously shown by microarray and northern analysis to be prostate-specific, was used in a multiparameter analysis of prostate cancer samples.","Thus, the present invention is generally directed to methods for identifying organ-specific secreted proteins present in the blood. The present invention is also directed to methods for defining organ-specific molecular blood fingerprints and further provides defined examples of predicted organ-specific molecular blood fingerprints. Additionally, the present invention is directed to panels of reagents or proteomic techniques employing mass spectrometry that detect organ-specific secreted proteins in the blood for use in diagnostics and other settings.","The blood fingerprints described herein enable physicians to develop a powerful new predictive medicine that can serve as one of the cornerstones for a revolution in medicine, moving it from a reactive mode (treating after the patient is sick) to more predictive, preventive and personalized modes.","By predefining the components of a given molecular blood fingerprint using the methods described herein, the present invention alleviates the need to blindly search for protein patterns using blood proteomics. Thus, the present invention enables the skilled artisan to 1) identify blood proteins which collectively constitute unique molecular blood fingerprints for healthy and diseased individuals; 2) identify unique fingerprints for each different disease; 3) identify fingerprints that can uniquely distinguish the different types of a particular disease (e.g., for prostate cancer, the ability to distinguish between benign disease, slowly growing disease and rapidly metastatic disease); 4) identify fingerprints that can reveal the stage of progression of each type of disease, and 5) fingerprints that will allow one to assess the response to therapy. Importantly, the potential organ-specific, secreted disease-detecting blood fingerprints can be predicted from a combination of quantitative comparative transcriptome studies and computational methods to predict which transcripts encode secreted proteins. The methods for determining the organ-specific, blood fingerprints for all organs described herein allow disease detection at very early stages, since even in the earliest disease stages, the cellular networks which control the expression patterns of these blood molecular signatures will be perturbed. Hence the present invention allows detection of virtually any type of disease and detection of each disease at a very early stage.","Methods for Identifying Organ-Specific Proteins Secreted Into the Blood","The invention provides methods for identifying organ-specific secreted proteins. In this regard, as used herein, the term \u201corgan\u201d is defined as would be understood in the art. Thus, the term, \u201corgan-specific\u201d as used herein generally refers to proteins (or transcripts) that are primarily expressed in a single organ. It should be noted that the skilled artisan would readily appreciate upon reading the instant specification that cell-specific transcripts and proteins and tissue-specific transcripts and proteins are also contemplated in the present invention. As such, and as discussed further herein, in certain embodiments, organ-specific protein is defined as a protein encoded by a transcript that is expressed at a level of at least 3 copies\/million (as measured, for example, by massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) in the cell\/tissue\/organ of interest but is expressed at less than 3 copies\/million in other cells\/tissues\/organs. In a further embodiment, an organ-specific protein is one that is encoded by a transcript that is expressed 95% in one organ and the remaining 5% in one or more other organs. (In this context, total expression across all organs examined is taken as 100%).","In certain embodiments, an organ-specific protein is one that is encoded by a transcript that is expressed at about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80% to about 90% in one organ and wherein the remaining 10%-50% is expressed in one or more other organs. As would be readily recognized by the skilled artisan upon reading the present disclosure, in certain embodiments, an organ-specific molecular blood fingerprint can readily be discerned even if some expression of an \u201corgan-specific\u201d protein from a particular organ is detected at some level in another organ, or even more than one organ. For example, the organ-specific molecular blood fingerprint from prostate can conclusively identify a particular prostate disease (and stage of disease) despite expression of one or more protein members of the fingerprint in one or more other organs. Thus, an organ-specific protein as described herein may be predominantly or differentially expressed in an organ of interest rather than uniquely or specifically expressed in the organ. In this regard, in certain embodiments, differentially expressed means at least 1.5 fold expression in the organ of interest as compared to other organs. In another embodiment, differentially expressed means at least 2 fold expression in the organ of interest as compared to expression in other organs. In yet a further embodiment, differentially expressed means at least 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5 fold or higher expression in the organ of interest as compared to expression of the protein in other organs. As described elsewhere herein, \u201cprotein\u201d expression can be determined by analysis of transcript expression using a variety of methods.","In one embodiment, the organ-specific proteins are identified by preparing a cDNA library from an organ of interest. Any organ of a mammalian body is contemplated herein. Illustrative organs include, but are not limited to, heart, kidney, ureter, bladder, urethra, liver, prostate, heart, blood vessels, bone marrow, skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, brain (amygdala, caudate nucleus, cerebellum, corpus callosum, fetal, hypothalamus, thalamus), spinal cord, peripheral nerves, retina, nose, trachea, lungs, mouth, salivary gland, esophagus, stomach, small intestines, large intestines, hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid, pancreas, adrenal glands, ovaries, oviducts, uterus, placenta, vagina, mammary glands, testes, seminal vesicles, penis, lymph nodes, PBMC, thymus, and spleen. As noted above, upon reading the present disclosure, the skilled artisan would recognize that cell-specific and tissue-specific proteins are contemplated herein and thus, proteins specifically expressed in cells or tissues that make up such organs are also contemplated herein. In certain embodiments, in each of these organs transcriptomes are obtained for the cell types in which the disease of interest arises. For example, in the prostate there are two dominant types of cells\u2014epithelial cells and stromal cells. About 98% of prostate cancers arise in epithelial cells. As such, in certain embodiments, \u201corgan-specific\u201d means the transcripts that are expressed in particular cell types of the organ of interest (e.g., prostate epithelial cells). In this regard, any cell type that makes up any of the organs described herein is contemplated herein. Illustrative cell types include, but are not limited to, epithelial cells, stromal cells, endothelial cells, endodermal cells, ectodermal cells, mesodermal cells, lymphocytes (e.g., B cells and T cells including CD4+ T helper 1 or T helper 2 type cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells), erythrocytes, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts. Particular cell types within organs or tissues may be obtained by histological dissection, by the use of specific cell lines (e.g., prostate epithelial cell lines), by cell sorting or by a variety of other techniques known in the art.","It should be noted that in certain embodiments, fingerprints can be determined from \u201corgan-specific\u201d proteins from multiple organs, such as from organs that share a common function or make up a system (e.g., digestive system, circulatory system, respiratory system, cardiovascular system, the immune system (including the different cells of the immune system, such as, but not limited to, B cells, T cells including CD4+ T helper 1 or T helper 2 type cells, regulatory T cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, granulocytes, mast cells, etc.), the sensory system, the skin, brain and the nervous system, and the like).","Complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries can be generated using techniques known in the art, such as those described in Ausubel et al. (2001 , Greene Publ. Assoc. Inc. & John Wiley & Sons, Inc., NY, N.Y.); Sambrook et al. (1989 , Second Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Plainview, N.Y.); Maniatis et al. (1982 , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Plainview, N.Y.) and elsewhere. Further, a variety of commercially available kits for constructing cDNA libraries are useful for making the cDNA libraries of the present invention. Libraries are constructed from organs\/tissues\/cells procured from normal subjects.","All or substantially all of the transcripts of the cDNA library, e.g., representing virtually or substantially all genes functioning in the organ of interest, are cloned and sequenced using any of a variety of techniques known in the art. In this regard, in certain embodiments, substantially all refers to a sample representing at least 80% of all genes functioning in the organ of interest. In a further embodiment, substantially all refers to a sample representing at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% 99% or higher of all genes functioning in the organ of interest. In one embodiment, substantially all the transcripts from a cDNA library are amplified, sorted and signature sequences generated therefrom according to the methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,013,445; 6,172,218; 6,172,214; 6,140,489 and Brenner, P., et al., 18:630-634 2000. Briefly, polynucleotide templates from a cDNA library of interest are cloned into a vector system that contains a vast set of minimally cross-hybridizing oligonucleotide tags (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,863,722). The number of tags is usually at least 100 times greater than the number of cDNA templates (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,013,445 and Brenner, P., et al., supra). Thus, the set of tags is such that a 1% sample taken of template-tag conjugates ensures that essentially every template in the sample is conjugated to a unique tag and that at least one of each of the different template cDNAs is represented in the sample with >99% probability (U.S. Pat. No. 6,013,445 and Brenner, P., et al., supra). The conjugates are then amplified and hybridized under stringent conditions to microbeads each of which has attached thereto a unique complementary, minimally cross-hybridizing oligonucleotide tag. The transcripts are then directly sequenced simultaneously in a flow cell using a ligation-based sequencing method (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,013,445). A short signature sequence of about 17-20 base pairs is generated simultaneously from each of the hundreds of thousands of beads (or more) in the flow cell, each having attached thereto copies of a unique transcript from the sample. This technique is termed massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS).","In certain embodiments, other techniques may be used to evaluate the transcripts from a particular cDNA library, including microarray analysis (Han, M., et al., 19: 631-635, 2001; Bao, P., et al., 74: 1792-1797, 2002; Schena et al., . USA 93:10614-19, 1996; and Heller et al., . USA 94:2150-55, 1997) and SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression). Like MPSS, SAGE is digital and can generate a large number of signature sequences. (see e.g., Velculescu, V. E., et al., 16: 423-425, 2000; Tuteja R. and Tuteja N. 2004 August; 26(8):916-22) although the coverage is not nearly as deep as with MPSS.","The resulting sequences, (e.g., MPSS signature sequences), are generally about 20 bases in length. However, in certain embodiments, the sequences can be about 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 or more bases in length. The sequences are annotated using annotated human genome sequence (such as human genome release hg16, released in November, 2003, or other public or private databases) and the human Unigene (Unigene build #184) using methods known in the art, such as the method described by Meyers, B. C., et al., Genome Res, 14: 1641-1653, 2004. Other databases useful in this regard include Genbank, EMBL, or other publicly available databases. In certain embodiments, transcripts are considered only for those with 100% matches between an MPSS or other type of signature and a genome signature. As would be readily appreciated by the skilled artisan upon reading the present disclosure, this is a stringent match criterion and in certain embodiments, it may be desirable to use less stringent match criteria. Indeed, polymorphisms could lead to variations in transcripts that would be missed if only exact matches were used. For example, it may be desirable to consider signature sequences that match a genome signature with 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identity. In one embodiment, signatures that are expressed at less than 3 transcripts per million in libraries of interest are disregarded, as they might not be reliably detected since this, in effect, represents less than one transcript per cell (see for example, Jongeneel, C. V., et al., 2003). cDNA signatures are classified by their positions relative to polyadenylation signals and poly (A) tails and by their orientation relative to the 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 orientation of source mRNA. Full-length sequences corresponding to the signature sequences can be thus identified.","In order to identify organ-specific transcripts, the resulting annotated transcripts are compared against public and\/or private sequence databases, such as a variety of annotated human genome sequence databases (e.g., Genebank, the EMBL and Japanese databases and databases generated and compiled from other normal tissues, to identify those transcripts that are expressed primarily in the organ of interest but are not expressed in other organs. As noted elsewhere herein, some expression in organs other than the organ of interest does not necessarily preclude the use of a particular transcript in a blood molecular signature panel of the present invention.","Comparisons of the transcripts between databases can be made using a variety of computer analysis algorithms known in the art. As such, alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted by the local identity algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1981) 2:482, by the identity alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (1970) 48:443, by the search for similarity methods of Pearson and Lipman (1988) 85: 2444, by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, BLAST, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by inspection. As would be understood by the skilled artisan, many algorithms are available and are continually being developed. Appropriate algorithms can be chosen based on the specific needs for the comparisons being made (See also, e.g., J. A. Cuff, et al., 16(2):111-116, 2000; S. F Altschul and B. W. Erickson. 48(5\/6):603-616, 1986; S. F. Altschul and B. W. Erickson. 48(5\/6):633-660, 1986; S. F. Altschul, et al., 215:403-410, 1990; K. Bucka-Lassen, et al., 15(2):122-130, 1999; K.-M. Chao, et al., 55(3):503-524, 1993; W. M. Fitch and T. F. Smith. 80:1382-1386, 1983; A. D. Gordon. 60:197-200, 1973; O. Gotoh. 162:705-708, 1982; O. Gotoh. 52(3):359-373, 1990; X. Huang, et al., 6:373-381, 1990; X. Huang and W. Miller. 12:337-357, 1991; J. D. Thompson, et al., 27(13):2682-2690, 1999).","In certain embodiments, a particular transcript is considered to be organ-specific when the number of transcripts\/million as determined by MPSS is 3 or greater in the organ of interest but is less than 3 in all other organs. In another embodiment, a transcript is considered organ-specific if it is expressed in the organ of interest at a detectable level using a standard measurement (e.g., microarray analysis, quantitative real-time RT-PCR, MPSS, etc.) in the organ of interest but is not detectably expressed in other organs, using appropriate negative and positive controls as would be familiar to the skilled artisan. In a further embodiment, an organ-specific transcript is one that is expressed 95% in one organ and the remaining 5% in one or more other organs. (In this context, total expression across all organs examined is taken as 100%). In certain embodiments, an organ-specific transcript is one that is expressed at about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80% to about 90% in one organ and wherein the remaining 10%-50% is expressed in one or more other organs.","In another embodiment, organ-specific transcripts are identified by determining the ratio of expression of a transcript in the organ of interest as compared to other organs. In this regard, expression levels in the organ of interest of at least 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0 fold or higher as compared to expression in all other organs is considered to be organ-specific expression.","As would be readily recognized by the skilled artisan upon reading the present disclosure, in certain embodiments, an organ-specific molecular blood fingerprint can readily be discerned even if some expression of an \u201corgan-specific\u201d protein from a particular organ is detected at some level in another organ, or even more than one organ. This is because the fingerprint (e.g., the combination of the levels of multiple proteins; the pattern of the expression levels of multiple markers) itself is unique despite that the expression levels of one or more individual members of the fingerprint may not be unique to a particular organ. For example, the organ-specific molecular blood fingerprint from prostate can conclusively identify a particular prostate disease (and stage of disease) despite some expression of one or more members of the fingerprint in one or more other organs. Thus the present invention relates to determining the presence or absence of a disease or condition or stage of disease based on a pattern (e.g., fingerprint) of markers measured concurrently using any one or more of a variety of methods described herein (e.g., antibody binding, mass spectrometry, and the like), rather than the measure of individual markers.","In further embodiments, specificity can be confirmed at the protein level using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and\/or other protein measurement techniques known in the art (e.g., isotope-coded affinity tags and mass spectrometry, such as described by Han, D. K., et al., 19: 946-951, 2001). The Z-test (Man, M. Z., et al., 16: 953-959, 2000) or other appropriate statistical tests can be used to calculate P values for comparison of gene and protein expression levels between libraries from organs of interest.","Organ-specific sequences identified as described herein are further analyzed to determine which of the sequences encode secreted proteins. Proteins with signal peptides (classical secretory proteins) can be predicted using computation analysis known in the art. Illustrative methods include, but are not limited to the criteria described by Chen et al., 14: 859-865, 2003. In certain embodiments, such analyses are carried out using prediction servers, for example SignalP 3.0 server developed by The Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Lyngby, Denmark (httpcolon double slash dot www dot cbs dot dtu dot dkslash services slash SignalP-3.0; see also, J. D. Bendtsen, et al., 340:783-795, 2004.) and the TMHMM2.0 server (see for example A. Krogh, et al., 305(3):567-580, January 2001; E. L. L. Sonnhammer, et al., In J. Glasgow, T. Littlejohn, F. Major, R. Lathrop, D. Sankoff, and C. Sensen, editors, , pages 175-182, Menlo Park, Calif., 1998. AAAI Press). Other prediction methods that can be used in the context of the present invention include those described for example, in S. Moller, M. D. R. et al., 17(7):646-653, July 2001. Nonclassical secretory secreted proteins (without signal peptides) can be predicted using, for example, the SecretomeP 2.0 server, (http colon double slash www dot cbs dot dtu dot dk slash services slash SecretomeP-2.0 slash\/) with an odds ratio score >3.0. Updated versions of these analysis programs are also contemplated for use in the present methods as are other methods known in the art (e.g., PSORT (http colon double slash psort dot nibb dot acdot jp slash\/) and Sigfind (http colon double slash 139.91.72.10 slash sigfindslash sigfind dot html).","Confirmation that the identified secreted proteins are present in blood can be carried out using a variety of methods known in the art. For example, the proteins can be expressed, purified, and specific antibodies can be made against them. The specific antibodies can then be used to test the presence of the protein in blood\/serum\/plasma by a variety of immunoaffinity based techniques (e.g., immunoblot, Western analysis, immunoprecipitation, ELISA, etc.). Antibodies specific for the organ-specific protein identified herein can also be used to study expression patterns of the identified proteins. It should be noted that in certain circumstances, the secreted protein may not be detectable in normal blood samples but will be detected in the blood as a result of perturbation due to disease or other environmental factors. Accordingly, both normal and disease samples are tested for the presence of the secreted protein and particularly for changes in levels of expression in the two states. As an alternative, aptamers (short DNA or RNA fragments with binding complementarity to the proteins of interest) may be used in assays similar to those described for antibodies (see for example, 2001 February; 30(2):290-2, 294-5; 1999; 45:1628-1650). In addition, antibodies or aptamers may be used in connection with nanowires to create highly sensitive detections systems (see e.g., J. Heath et al., Science. 2004 Dec. 17; 306(5704):2055-6). In further embodiments, mass spectrometry-based methods can be used to confirm the presence of a particular protein in the blood.","As would be recognized by the skilled artisan, while the organ-specific secreted proteins, the levels of which make up a given fingerprint, need not be isolated, in certain embodiments, it may be desirable to isolate such proteins (e.g., for antibody production). As such, the present invention provides for isolated organ-specific secreted proteins or fragments or portions thereof and polynucleotides that encode such proteins. As used herein, the terms protein and polypeptide are used interchangeably. The terms \u201cpolypeptide\u201d and \u201cprotein\u201d encompass amino acid chains of any length, including full-length endogenous (i.e., native) proteins and variants of endogenous polypeptides described herein. Illustrative polypeptides of the present invention are described in Table 1 and Tables 3-5, the section entitled \u201cBrief Description of the Sequence Identifiers\u201d and are set forth in the sequence listing. \u201cVariants\u201d are polypeptides that differ in sequence from the polypeptides of the present invention only in substitutions, deletions and\/or other modifications, such that either the variants' disease-specific expression patterns are not significantly altered or the polypeptides remain useful for diagnostics\/detection of organ-specific blood fingerprints as described herein. For example, modifications to the polypeptides of the present invention may be made in the laboratory to facilitate expression and\/or purification and\/or to improve immunogenicity for the generation of appropriate antibodies and other binding agents, etc. Modified variants (e.g., chemically modified) of the polypeptides of organ-specific, secreted proteins may be useful herein, (e.g., as standards in mass spectrometry analyses of the corresponding proteins in the blood, and the like). As such, in certain embodiments, the biological function of a variant protein is not relevant for utility in the methods for detection and\/or diagnostics described herein. Polypeptide variants generally encompassed by the present invention will typically exhibit at least about 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% or more identity along its length, to a polypeptide sequence set forth herein. Within a polypeptide variant, amino acid substitutions are usually made at no more than 50% of the amino acid residues in the native polypeptide, and in certain embodiments, at no more than 25% of the amino acid residues. In certain embodiments, such substitutions are conservative. A conservative substitution is one in which an amino acid is substituted for another amino acid that has similar properties, such that one skilled in the art of peptide chemistry would expect the secondary structure and hydropathic nature of the polypeptide to be substantially unchanged. In general, the following amino acids represent conservative changes: (1) ala, pro, gly, glu, asp, gln, asn, ser, thr; (2) cys, ser, tyr, thr; (3) val, ile, leu, met, ala, phe; (4) lys, arg, his; and (5) phe, tyr, trp, his. Thus, a variant may comprise only a portion of a native polypeptide sequence as provided herein. In addition, or alternatively, variants may contain additional amino acid sequences (such as, for example, linkers, tags and\/or ligands), usually at the amino and\/or carboxy termini. Such sequences may be used, for example, to facilitate purification, detection or cellular uptake of the polypeptide.","When comparing polypeptide sequences, two sequences are said to be \u201cidentical\u201d if the sequence of amino acids in the two sequences is the same when aligned for maximum correspondence, as described below. Comparisons between two sequences are typically performed by comparing the sequences over a comparison window to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. A \u201ccomparison window\u201d as used herein, refers to a segment of at least about 20 contiguous positions, usually 30 to about 75, 40 to about 50, in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned.","Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted using the Megalign program in the Lasergene suite of bioinformatics software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, Wis.), using default parameters. This program embodies several alignment schemes described in the following references: Dayhoff, M. O. (1978) A model of evolutionary change in proteins\u2014Matrices for detecting distant relationships. In Dayhoff, M. O. (ed.) , National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington D.C. Vol. 5, Suppl. 3, pp. 345-358; Hein J. (1990) Unified Approach to Alignment and Phylogenes pp. 626-645 vol. 183, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, Calif.; Higgins, D. G. and Sharp, P. M.

(1973) , Freeman Press, San Francisco, Calif.; Wilbur, W. J. and Lipman, D. J. (1983) 80:726-730.","Alternatively, optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted by the local identity algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1981) 2:482, by the identity alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (1970) 48:443, by the search for similarity methods of Pearson and Lipman (1988) 85: 2444, by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, BLAST, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by inspection.","Illustrative examples of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity include the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al. (1977) 25:3389-3402 and Altschul et al. (1990) 215:403-410, respectively. BLAST and BLAST 2.0 can be used, for example, to determine percent sequence identity for the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information.","An isolated polypeptide is one that is removed from its original environment. For example, a naturally occurring protein or polypeptide is isolated if it is separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system. In certain embodiments, such polypeptides are also purified, e.g., are at least about 90% pure, in some embodiments, at least about 95% pure and in further embodiments, at least about 99% pure.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a polypeptide comprises a fusion protein comprising an organ-specific secreted polypeptide. The present invention further provides, in other aspects, fusion proteins that comprise at least one polypeptide as described herein, as well as polynucleotides encoding such fusion proteins. The fusion proteins may comprise multiple polypeptides or portions\/variants thereof, as described herein, and may further comprise one or more polypeptide segments for facilitating the expression, purification, detection, and\/or activity of the polypeptide(s).","In certain embodiments, the proteins and\/or polynucleotides, and\/or fusion proteins are provided in the form of compositions, e.g., pharmaceutical compositions, vaccine compositions, compositions comprising a physiologically acceptable carrier or excipient. Such compositions may comprise buffers such as neutral buffered saline, phosphate buffered saline and the like; carbohydrates such as glucose, mannose, sucrose or dextrans, mannitol; proteins; polypeptides or amino acids such as glycine; antioxidants; chelating agents such as EDTA or glutathione; adjuvants (e.g., aluminum hydroxide); and preservatives.","In general, organ-specific secreted polypeptides and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides as described herein, may be prepared using any of a variety of techniques that are well known in the art. For example, a DNA sequence encoding an organ-specific secreted protein may be prepared by amplification from a suitable cDNA or genomic library using, for example, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or hybridization techniques. Libraries may generally be prepared and screened using methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as those described in Sambrook et al., , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989. cDNA libraries may be prepared from any of a variety of organs, tissues, cells, as described herein. Other libraries that may be employed will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the present disclosure. Primers for use in amplification may be readily designed based on the polynucleotide sequences encoding organ-specific polypeptides as provided herein, for example, using programs such as the PRIMER3 program (http colon double slash www-genome dot wi dot mit dot edu\/cgi-bin\/primer\/primer3_www dot cgi).","Polynucleotides encoding the organ-specific secreted polypeptides as described herein are also provided by the present invention. A polynucleotide as used herein may be single-stranded (coding or antisense) or double-stranded, and may be DNA (genomic, cDNA or synthetic) or RNA molecules. Thus, within the context of the present invention, a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide may also be a gene. A gene is a segment of DNA involved in producing a polypeptide chain; it includes regions preceding and following the coding region (leader and trailer) as well as intervening sequences (introns) between individual coding segments (exons). Additional coding or non-coding sequences may, but need not, be present within a polynucleotide of the present invention, and a polynucleotide may, but need not, be linked to other molecules and\/or support materials. An isolated polynucleotide, as used herein, means that a polynucleotide is substantially away from other coding sequences, and that the DNA molecule does not contain large portions of unrelated coding DNA, such as large chromosomal fragments or other functional genes or polypeptide coding regions. Of course, this refers to the DNA molecule as originally isolated, and does not exclude genes or coding regions later added to the segment by the hand of man.","Polynucleotides of the present invention may comprise a native sequence (i.e., an endogenous polynucleotide, for instance, a native or non-artificially engineered or naturally occurring gene as provided herein) encoding an organ-specific secreted protein, an alternate form of such a sequence, or a portion or splice variant thereof or may comprise a variant of such a sequence. Polynucleotide variants may contain one or more substitutions, additions, deletions and\/or insertions such that the polynucleotide encodes a polypeptide useful in the methods described herein, such as for the detection of organ-specific proteins (e.g., wherein said polynucleotide variants encode polypeptides that can be used to generate detection reagents as described herein that are specific for an organ-specific secreted protein). In certain embodiments, variants exhibit at least about 70% identity, and in other embodiments, exhibit at least about 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, identity and in yet further embodiments, at least about 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identity to a polynucleotide sequence that encodes a native organ-specific secreted polypeptide or an alternate form or a portion thereof. Illustrative polynucleotides of the present invention are described in Table 1 and Tables 3-5, the section entitled \u201cBrief Description of the Sequence Identifiers\u201d and are set forth in the sequence listing. The percent identity may be readily determined by comparing sequences using computer algorithms well known to those having ordinary skill in the art and described herein.","Polynucleotides that are complementary to the polynucleotides described herein, or that have substantial identity to a sequence complementary to a polynucleotide as described herein are also within the scope of the present invention. \u201cSubstantial identity\u201d, as used herein refers to polynucleotides that exhibit at least about 70% identity, and in certain embodiments, at least about 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identity to a polynucleotide sequence that encodes a native organ-specific secreted polypeptide as described herein. Substantial identity can also refer to polynucleotides that are capable of hybridizing under stringent conditions to a polynucleotide complementary to a polynucleotide encoding an organ-specific secreted protein. Suitable hybridization conditions include prewashing in a solution of 5\u00d7SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8.0); hybridizing at 50-65\u00b0 C., 5\u00d7SSC, overnight; followed by washing twice at 65\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes with each of 2\u00d7, 0.5\u00d7 and 0.2\u00d7SSC containing 0.1% SDS. Nucleotide sequences that, because of code degeneracy, encode a polypeptide encoded by any of the above sequences are also encompassed by the present invention.","Oligonucleotide primers for amplification of the polynucleotides encoding organ-specific secreted proteins are also within the scope of the present invention. Many amplification methods are known in the art such as PCR, RT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR, and the like. The PCR conditions used can be optimized in terms of temperature, annealing times, extension times and number of cycles depending on the oligonucleotide and the polynucleotide to be amplified. Such techniques are well known in the art and are described in, for example, Mullis et al., 51:263, 1987; Erlich ed., , Stockton Press, NY, 1989. Oligonucleotide primers can be anywhere from 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30 nucleotides in length. In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotide primers of the present invention are typically 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, or more nucleotides in length.","Organ-Specific Molecular Blood Fingerprints","The present invention also provides methods for defining organ-specific molecular blood fingerprints. Additionally, the present invention provides defined examples of organ-specific molecular blood fingerprints as described further herein.","Each normal organ controls the expression of a variety of genes, some of which are expressed at major levels at other organs or tissues in the body and some of which are expressed only in the organ of interest or at significantly increased levels in the organ of interest as compared to expression in other organs\/tissues (e.g., at least 2 fold, at least 2.5 fold, at least 3.0 fold, at least 3.5 fold, at least 4.0 fold, at least 4.5 fold, or higher fold expression in the organ of interest as compared to other tissues. Some of the organ-specific transcripts encode proteins which can be secreted into the blood. Hence these secreted proteins constitute an organ-specific molecular fingerprint for that organ in the blood. Analysis of levels of these proteins in the blood provides organ-specific molecular blood fingerprints that are indicative of biological states. A biological state may be a normal, healthy state or a disease state (e.g., perturbation from normal). Thus, there are molecular fingerprints in the blood that reflect the operation of normal organs and each organ has a specific molecular fingerprint. These organ-specific blood fingerprints are perturbed when disease, or other agents such as drugs, affects the organ. Different diseases will alter the organ-specific blood fingerprints in different ways (e.g. alter the expression levels of the corresponding secreted proteins). Thus, a unique perturbed blood molecular fingerprint is associated with each type of distinct disease. In effect, each distinct disease, or stage of a disease, creates its own molecular blood fingerprint for each organ that it affects. As would be readily appreciated by the skilled artisan, each disease or stage of a disease can affect multiple organs. For example, in kidney cancer, a primary perturbation in the kidney-specific molecular blood fingerprint would occur. However, a secondary or indirect effect may also be observed in the bladder-specific molecular blood fingerprint. As another example, in liver cancer, perturbation of a liver-specific blood fingerprint as a primary indicator of disease would occur. However, secondary or indirect effects at other sites, for example in a lymphocyte-specific blood fingerprint, would also be observed. As described elsewhere herein, each disease type and stage results in a unique, identifiable fingerprint for each organ that it affects, for primary and secondary organs affected. Thus, multiple organ-specific molecular blood fingerprints can be used in combination to determine a particular biological state and the fingerprints may include those for the primary organ affected and\/or for a secondary or indirect organ that is affected by a particular disease.","Most common diseases such as prostate cancer actually represent multiple distinct diseases that initially appear similar (e.g., benign and very slowly growing prostate cancer, slowly invasive prostate cancer and rapidly metastatic prostate cancer represent three different types of prostate cancer\u2014the process of dividing individual prostate cancers into one of these three types is called stratification). The blood molecular fingerprints will be distinct for each of these disease types, thus allowing for the stratification of similar diseases and rapid intervention where necessary. The blood fingerprints will also be perturbed in unique ways as each type of disease progresses\u2014hence the blood fingerprints will also permit the progression of disease to be followed. The blood fingerprints also change with therapy, and hence will permit the effectiveness of therapy to be followed, thereby allowing a physician to alter treatment accordingly. Further, the blood fingerprints change with exposure to a variety of environmental factors, such as drugs, and can be used to assess toxic or off target damage by the drug and it will even permit following the subsequent recovery from such adverse drug exposure.","Thus, an organ-specific molecular blood fingerprint for a given setting (e.g., a particular disease) is defined by the levels in the blood of the organ-specific proteins that make up the fingerprint. As such, an organ-specific molecular blood fingerprint for a given organ at any given time and in any given disease setting is determined by measuring the levels of each of a plurality of organ-specific proteins in the blood. It is the combination of the different levels in the blood of the organ-specific proteins that reveals a unique pattern that defines the fingerprint. Equally important, each of the levels of the proteins can be compared against one another to create an N-dimensional measure of the fingerprint space, a very powerful correlate to health and disease (see e.g., U.S. Patent Application No 20020095259). It should be noted that, in certain embodiments, an organ-specific molecular blood fingerprint may be comprised of the determined level in the blood of one or more organ-specific secreted proteins. In one embodiment, an organ-specific molecular blood fingerprint may comprise the determined level in the blood of anywhere from at least 1 to more than about 100, 200 or more organ-specific secreted proteins from a particular organ of interest. In one embodiment, the organ-specific molecular blood fingerprint comprises the quantitatively measured level in the blood of at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 organ-specific secreted proteins. In another embodiment, the organ-specific molecular blood fingerprint comprises the determined level in the blood of at least, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, or 30 organ-specific secreted proteins. In a further embodiment, the organ-specific molecular blood fingerprint comprises the determined level in the blood of at least, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, or 40 organ-specific secreted proteins. In yet a further embodiment, the organ-specific molecular blood fingerprint comprises the determined level in the blood of at least, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50 organ-specific secreted proteins. In an additional embodiment, the organ-specific molecular blood fingerprint comprises the determined level in the blood of 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, or 60 organ-specific secreted proteins. In another embodiment, the organ-specific molecular blood fingerprint comprises the determined level in the blood of 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, or 70 organ-specific secreted proteins. In further embodiments, the organ-specific molecular blood fingerprint comprises the determined level in the blood of 75, 80, 85, 90, 100, or more organ-specific secreted proteins.","It should be noted that in certain circumstances, an organ-specific molecular blood fingerprint can be defined (in part or entirely) merely by the presence or absence of one or a plurality of organ-specific proteins, and determining the exact level of each of a plurality of organ-specific proteins in the blood may not be necessary.","In a further embodiment, the disease (e.g., perturbed) molecular blood fingerprints for a particular organ are determined by comparing the blood from normal individuals against that from patients with specific diseases at known stages. A statistically significant change in the levels (e.g., an increase or a decrease) of one or more of the organ-specific proteins in the blood that comprise the fingerprint as compared to normal is indicative of a perturbation of the fingerprint and is useful in diagnostics of the particular disease and\/or stage of disease. As discussed elsewhere herein, the fingerprint may be for the primary organ affected by the particular disease of interest, or a secondarily, indirectly affected organ. The skilled artisan would readily appreciate that a variety of statistical tests can be used to determine if an altered level of a given protein is significant. The Z-test (Man, M. Z., et al., 16: 953-959, 2000) or other appropriate statistical tests can be used to calculate P values for comparison of protein expression levels. In certain embodiments, the level of each of the plurality of organ-specific proteins in the blood sample from the subject is compared to a previously determined normal control level of each of the plurality of organ-specific proteins taking into account standard deviation. Thus, the present invention provides determined normal control levels of each of a plurality of organ-specific proteins that make up a particular molecular blood fingerprint.","Organ-specific molecular blood fingerprints can be determined using any of a variety of detection reagents in the context of a variety of methods for measuring protein levels. Any detection reagent that can specifically bind to or otherwise detect an organ-specific secreted protein as described herein is contemplated as a suitable detection reagent. Illustrative detection reagents include, but are not limited to antibodies, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, yeast ScFv, DNA or RNA aptamers, isotope labeled peptides, microfluidic\/nanotechnology measurement devices and the like.","In one illustrative embodiment, a detection reagent is an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof. Antibodies may be prepared by any of a variety of techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. See, e.g., Harlow and Lane, , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1988. In general, antibodies can be produced by cell culture techniques, including the generation of monoclonal antibodies as described herein, or via transfection of antibody genes into suitable bacterial or mammalian cell hosts, in order to allow for the production of recombinant antibodies. In one technique, an immunogen comprising the polypeptide is initially injected into any of a wide variety of mammals (e.g., mice, rats, rabbits, sheep or goats). In this step, the polypeptides of this invention may serve as the immunogen without modification. Alternatively, particularly for relatively short polypeptides, a superior immune response may be elicited if the polypeptide is joined to a carrier protein, such as bovine serum albumin or keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The immunogen is injected into the animal host, usually according to a predetermined schedule incorporating one or more booster immunizations, and the animals are bled periodically. Polyclonal antibodies specific for the polypeptide may then be purified from such antisera by, for example, affinity chromatography using the polypeptide coupled to a suitable solid support.","In one embodiment, multiple target proteins or peptides are used in a single immune response to generate multiple useful detection reagents simultaneously. In one embodiment, the individual specificities are later separated out.","In certain embodiments, antibody can be generated by phage display methods (such as described by Vaughan, T. J., et al., 14: 309-314, 1996; and Knappik, A., et al., 296: 57-86, 2000); ribosomal display (such as described in Hanes, J., et al., 18: 1287-1292, 2000), or periplasmic expression in (see e.g., Chen, G., et al., 19: 537-542, 2001.). In further embodiments, antibodies can be isolated using a yeast surface display library. See e.g., nonimmune library of 10human antibody scFv fragments as constructed by Feldhaus, M. J., et al., 21: 163-170, 2003. There are several advantages of this yeast surface display compared to more traditional large nonimmune human antibody repertoires such as phage display, ribosomal display, and periplasmic expression in 1). The yeast library can be amplified 10-fold without measurable loss of clonal diversity and repertoire bias as the expression is under control of the tightly GAL1\/10 promoter and expansion can be done under non induction conditions; 2) nanomolar-affinity scFvs can be routinely obtained by magnetic bead screening and flow-cytometric sorting, thus greatly simplified the protocol and capacity of antibody screening; 3) with equilibrium screening, a minimal affinity threshold of the antibodies desired can be set; 4) the binding properties of the antibodies can be quantified directly on the yeast surface; 5) multiplex library screening against multiple antigens simultaneously is possible; and 6) for applications demanding picomolar affinity (e.g. in early diagnosis), subsequent rapid affinity maturation (Kieke, M. C., et al., 307: 1305-1315, 2001.) can be carried out directly on yeast clones without further re-cloning and manipulations.","Monoclonal antibodies specific for an organ-specific secreted polypeptide of interest may be prepared, for example, using the technique of Kohler and Milstein, 6:511-519, 1976, and improvements thereto. Briefly, these methods involve the preparation of immortal cell lines capable of producing antibodies having the desired specificity (i.e., reactivity with the polypeptide of interest). Such cell lines may be produced, for example, from spleen cells obtained from an animal immunized as described above. The spleen cells are then immortalized by, for example, fusion with a myeloma cell fusion partner, in certain embodiments, one that is syngeneic with the immunized animal. A variety of fusion techniques may be employed. For example, the spleen cells and myeloma cells may be combined with a nonionic detergent for a few minutes and then plated at low density on a selective medium that supports the growth of hybrid cells, but not myeloma cells. An illustrative selection technique uses HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, thymidine) selection. After a sufficient time, usually about 1 to 2 weeks, colonies of hybrids are observed. Single colonies are selected and their culture supernatants tested for binding activity against the polypeptide. Hybridomas having high reactivity and specificity are preferred.","Monoclonal antibodies may be isolated from the supernatants of growing hybridoma colonies. In addition, various techniques may be employed to enhance the yield, such as injection of the hybridoma cell line into the peritoneal cavity of a suitable vertebrate host, such as a mouse. Monoclonal antibodies may then be harvested from the ascites fluid or the blood. Contaminants may be removed from the antibodies by conventional techniques, such as chromatography, gel filtration, precipitation, and extraction. The polypeptides of this invention may be used in the purification process in, for example, an affinity chromatography step.","A number of therapeutically useful molecules are known in the art which comprise antigen-binding sites that are capable of exhibiting immunological binding properties of an antibody molecule. The proteolytic enzyme papain preferentially cleaves IgG molecules to yield several fragments, two of which (the \u201cF(ab)\u201d fragments) each comprise a covalent heterodimer that includes an intact antigen-binding site. The enzyme pepsin is able to cleave IgG molecules to provide several fragments, including the \u201cF(ab\u2032)\u201d fragment which comprises both antigen-binding sites. An \u201cFv\u201d fragment can be produced by preferential proteolytic cleavage of an IgM, and on rare occasions IgG or IgA immunoglobulin molecule. Fv fragments are, however, more commonly derived using recombinant techniques known in the art. The Fv fragment includes a non-covalent V::Vheterodimer including an antigen-binding site which retains much of the antigen recognition and binding capabilities of the native antibody molecule. Inbar et al. (1972) 69:2659-2662; Hochman et al. (1976) 15:2706-2710; and Ehrlich et al. (1980)19:4091-4096.","A single chain Fv (\u201csFv\u201d) polypeptide is a covalently linked V::Vheterodimer which is expressed from a gene fusion including V- and V-encoding genes linked by a peptide-encoding linker. Huston et al. (1988) 85(16):5879-5883. A number of methods have been described to discern chemical structures for converting the naturally aggregated\u2014but chemically separated\u2014light and heavy polypeptide chains from an antibody V region into an sFv molecule which will fold into a three dimensional structure substantially similar to the structure of an antigen-binging site. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,091,513 and 5,132,405, to Huston et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778, to Ladner et al.","Each of the above-described molecules includes a heavy chain and a light chain CDR set, respectively interposed between a heavy chain and a light chain FR set which provide support to the CDRS and define the spatial relationship of the CDRs relative to each other. As used herein, the term \u201cCDR set\u201d refers to the three hypervariable regions of a heavy or light chain V region. Proceeding from the N-terminus of a heavy or light chain, these regions are denoted as \u201cCDR1,\u201d \u201cCDR2,\u201d and \u201cCDR3\u201d respectively. An antigen-binding site, therefore, includes six CDRs, comprising the CDR set from each of a heavy and a light chain V region. A polypeptide comprising a single CDR, (e.g., a CDR1, CDR2 or CDR3) is referred to herein as a \u201cmolecular recognition unit.\u201d Crystallographic analysis of a number of antigen-antibody complexes has demonstrated that the amino acid residues of CDRs form extensive contact with bound antigen, wherein the most extensive antigen contact is with the heavy chain CDR3. Thus, the molecular recognition units are primarily responsible for the specificity of an antigen-binding site.","As used herein, the term \u201cFR set\u201d refers to the four flanking amino acid sequences which frame the CDRs of a CDR set of a heavy or light chain V region. Some FR residues may contact bound antigen; however, FRs are primarily responsible for folding the V region into the antigen-binding site, particularly the FR residues directly adjacent to the CDRS. Within FRs, certain amino residues and certain structural features are very highly conserved. In this regard, all V region sequences contain an internal disulfide loop of around 90 amino acid residues. When the V regions fold into a binding-site, the CDRs are displayed as projecting loop motifs which form an antigen-binding surface. It is generally recognized that there are conserved structural regions of FRs which influence the folded shape of the CDR loops into certain \u201ccanonical\u201d structures\u2014regardless of the precise CDR amino acid sequence. Further, certain FR residues are known to participate in non-covalent interdomain contacts which stabilize the interaction of the antibody heavy and light chains.","The detection reagents of the present invention may comprise any of a variety of detectable labels. The invention contemplates the use of any type of detectable label, including, e.g., visually detectable labels, fluorophores, and radioactive labels. The detectable label may be incorporated within or attached, either covalently or non-covalently, to the detection reagent.","Methods for measuring organ-specific protein levels from blood\/serum\/plasma include, but are not limited to, immunoaffinity based assays such as ELISAs, Western blots, and radioimmunoassays, and mass spectrometry based methods (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), MALDI-Time-of-Flight (TOF), Tandem MS (MS\/MS), electrospray ionization (ESI), Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption Ionization (SELDI)-TOF MS, liquid chromatography (LC)-MS\/MS, etc). Other methods useful in this context include isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) followed by multidimensional chromatography and MS\/MS. The procedures described herein for analysis of blood organ-specific protein fingerprints can be modified and adapted to make use of microfluidics and nanotechnology in order to miniaturize, parallelize, integrate and automate diagnostic procedures (see e.g., L. Hood, et al., 306:640-643; R. H. Carlson, et al., 79:2149 (1997); A. Y. Fu, et al., 74:2451 (2002); J. W. Hong, et al., 22:435 (2004); A. G. Hadd, et al., 69:3407 (1997); I. Karube, et al., 750:101 (1995); L. C. Waters et al., 70:158 (1998); J. Fritz et al., 288, 316 (2000)).","It should be noted that when the term \u201cblood\u201d is used herein, any part of the blood is intended. Accordingly, for determining molecular blood fingerprints, whole blood may be used directly where appropriate, or plasma or serum may be used.","Panels\/Arrays for Detecting Organ-Specific Molecular Blood Fingerprints","The present invention also provides panels\/arrays for detecting the organ-specific blood fingerprints at any given time in a subject. The term \u201csubject\u201d is intended to include any mammal or indeed any vertebrate that may be used as a model system for human disease. Examples of subjects include humans, monkeys, apes, dogs, cats, mice, rats, fish, zebra fish, birds, horses, pigs, cows, sheep, goats, chickens, ducks, donkeys, turkeys, peacocks, chinchillas, ferrets, gerbils, rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters and transgenic species thereof.

In one embodiment, the panel\/array of the present invention comprises one detection reagent that specifically detects an organ-specific secreted protein. In another embodiment, the panel\/arrays are comprised of a plurality of detection reagents that each specifically detects an organ-specific secreted protein, wherein the levels of organ-specific secreted proteins taken together form a unique pattern that defines the fingerprint. In certain embodiments, detection reagents can be bispecific such that the panel\/array is comprised of a plurality of bispecific detection reagents that may specifically detect more than one organ-specific secreted protein. The term \u201cspecifically\u201d is a term of art that would be readily understood by the skilled artisan to mean, in this context, that the protein of interest is detected by the particular detection reagent but other proteins are not detected in a statistically significant manner under the same conditions. Specificity can be determined using appropriate positive and negative controls and by routinely optimizing conditions.","The panel\/arrays may be comprised of a solid phase surface having attached thereto a plurality of detection reagents each attached at a distinct location. As would be recognized by the skilled artisan, the number of detection reagents on a given panel\/array would be determined from the number of organ-specific secreted proteins in the fingerprint to be measured. In one embodiment, the panel\/array comprises one or more detection reagents. In a further embodiment, the panel\/array comprises a plurality of detection reagents, wherein the plurality of detection reagents may be anywhere from about 2 to about 100, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200 or more detection reagents each specific for an organ-specific secreted protein.

In certain embodiments, the solid phase surface is a chip. In another embodiment, the solid phase surface may comprise microtiter plates, beads, membranes, microparticles, the interior surface of a reaction vessel such as a test tube or other reaction vessel. In other embodiments the peptides will be fractionated by one or more one-dimensional columns using size separations, ion exchange or hydrophobicity properties and, for example, deposited in a MALDI 96 or 384 well plate and then injected into an appropriate mass spectrometer.","In one embodiment, the panel\/array is an addressable array. As such, the addressable array may comprise a plurality of distinct detection reagents, such as antibodies or aptamers, attached to precise locations on a solid phase surface, such as a plastic chip.

As such, the databases may comprise the defined differential expression levels as determined using any of a variety of methods such as those described herein, of each of the plurality of organ-specific secreted proteins that make up a given fingerprint in any of a variety of settings (e.g., normal or disease fingerprints).","Methods of Use","The present invention provides methods for identifying organ-specific secreted proteins and methods for identifying organ-specific molecular blood fingerprints. The present invention further provides panels+\/arrays of detection reagents for detecting such fingerprints. The present invention also provides defined organ-specific molecular blood fingerprints for normal and disease settings. As such, the present invention provides methods of detecting diseases. The invention further provides methods for stratifying disease types and for monitoring the progression of a disease. The present invention also provides for following responses to therapy in a variety of disease settings and methods for detecting the disease state in humans using the visualization of nanoparticles with appropriate reporter groups and organ-specific antibodies or aptamers.","The present invention can be used as a standard screening test. In this regard, one or more of the detection panel\/arrays described herein can be run on an individual and any statistically significant deviation from a normal organ-specific molecular blood fingerprint would indicate that disease-related perturbation was present. Thus, the present invention provides a standard or \u201cnormal\u201d blood fingerprint for any given organ. In certain embodiments, a normal blood fingerprint is determined by measuring the normal range of levels of the individual protein members of a fingerprint. Any deviation therefrom or perturbation of the normal fingerprint that is outside the standard deviation (normal range) has diagnostic utility (see also U.S. Patent Application No. 0020095259). As would be recognized by the skilled artisan, the significance of any deviation in the levels of (e.g., a significantly altered level of one or more of) the individual protein members of a fingerprint can be determined using statistical methods known in the art and described herein. As noted elsewhere herein, perturbation of the normal fingerprint can indicate primary disease of the organ being tested or secondary, indirect affects on that organ resulting from disease of another organ.","In an additional embodiment, the present invention can be used to determine distinct normal organ-specific molecular fingerprints, such as in different populations of people. In this regard, distinct normal patterns of organ-specific molecular blood fingerprints may have differences in populations of patients that permit one to stratify patients into classes that would respond to a particular therapeutic regimen and those which would not.","In a further embodiment, the present invention can be used to determine the risk of developing a particular biological condition. A statistically significant alteration (e.g., increase or decrease) in the levels of one or more members of a particular molecular blood fingerprint may signify a risk of developing a particular disease, such as a cancer, an autoimmune disease, or other biological condition.","To monitor the progression of a disease, or monitor responses to therapy, one or more organ-specific molecular blood fingerprints are detected\/measured as described herein using any of the methods as described herein at one time point and detected\/measured again at subsequent time points, thereby monitoring disease progression or responses to therapy.","The organ-specific molecular blood fingerprints of the present invention can be used to detect any of a variety of diseases (or the lack thereof).

Further, the following examples are offered by way of illustration, and not by way of limitation.","The following example demonstrates the presence of disease-perturbed networks in prostate.","Prostate cancer is the most common nondermatological cancer in the United States (Greenlee, R. T., et al., 50: 7-33, 2000). Initially, its growth is androgen-dependent (AD); early-stage therapies, including chemical and surgical castration, kill cancerous cells by androgen deprivation. Although such therapies produce tumor regression, they eventually fail because most prostate carcinomas become androgen-independent (AI) (Isaacs, J. T. 26: 263-273, 1999). To improve the efficacy of prostate cancer therapy, it is necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from androgen dependence to androgen independence.","The transition from AD to AI status likely results from multiple processes, including activation of oncogenes, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, and changes in key components of signal transduction pathways and gene regulatory networks. Systems approaches to biology and disease are predicated on the identification of the elements of the systems, the delineation of their interactions and their changes in distinct disease states. Biological information is of two types: the digital information of the genome (e.g. genes and cis-control elements) and environmental cues. Proteins rarely act in isolation; rather, they form parts of molecular machines or participate in network interactions mediating cellular functions such as signal transduction and developmental or physiological response patterns. Gene regulatory networks, whose architecture and linkages are established by cis-control elements, integrate information from signal transduction networks and output it to developmental or physiological batteries or networks of effector proteins. Normal protein and gene regulatory networks may be perturbed by disease\u2014through genetic and\/or environmental perturbations and understanding these differences lies at the heart of systems approaches to disease. Disease-perturbed networks initiate altered responses that bring about pathologic phenotypes such as the invasiveness of cancer cells.","To map network perturbations in cancer initiation and progression, changes in expression levels of virtually all transcripts must be measured. Certain low-abundance transcripts, such as those encoding transcription factors and signal transducers, wield significant regulatory influences in spite of the fact they may be present in the cell at very low copy numbers. Differential display (Bussemakers, M. J., et al., 59: 5975-5979, 1999) or cDNA microarrays (Vaarala, M. H., et al., 80: 1259-1268, 2000; Chang, G. T., et al., 57: 4075-4081, 1997) have been, used to profile changes in gene expression during the AD to AI transition; however, those technologies can identify only a limited number of more abundant mRNAs, and they miss many low-abundance mRNAs due to their low detection sensitivities. Massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS), allows 20-nucleotide signature sequences to be determined in parallel for more than 1,000,000 DNA sequences (Brenner, et al., 2000, supra). MPSS technology allows identification and cataloging of almost all mRNAs that are changed between two cell states, even those with one or a few transcripts per cell, or between different organs or tissues. Differentially expressed genes thus identified can be mapped onto cellular networks to provide a systemic understanding of changes in cellular state.","Although transcriptome (mRNA levels) differences are easier to study than proteome (protein levels) differences and provide extremely valuable information, cellular functions are usually performed by proteins. RNA expression profiling studies do not address how the encoded proteins function biologically, and transcript abundance levels do not always correlate with protein abundance levels (Chen, G., et al., 1: 304-313, 2002). Therefore, the mRNA expression profiling described herein was complemented with a more limited protein profiling by using isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS\/MS) (Gygi, S. P., et al., 17: 994-999, 1999).","The LNCaP cell line is a widely used androgen-sensitive model for early-stage prostate cancer from which androgen-independent sublines have been generated (Vaarala, M. H., et al., 2000, supra; Chang, G. T., et al., 1997, supra; Patel, B. J., et al., 164: 1420-1425, 2000). The cells of one such variant, CL-1, in contrast to their LNCaP progenitors, are highly tumorigenic, and exhibit invasive and metastatic characteristics in intact and castrated mice (Patel, G. J., et al., 2000, supra; Tso, C. L., et al., 6: 220-233, 2000). Thus CL-1 cells model late-stage prostate cancer. MPSS and ICAT data extracted from these model cell lines can be validated by real-time RT-PCR or western blot analysis in more relevant biological models (tumor xenografts) and in tumor biopsies.","An MPSS analysis of about 5 million signatures was conducted for the androgen-dependent LNCaP cell line and its androgen-independent derivative CL1. The resulting database offers the first comprehensive view of the digital transcriptomes of prostate cancer cells and allows exploration of the cellular pathways perturbed during the transition from AD to AI growth. Additionally, protein expression profiles between LNCaP and CL1 cells were compared using ICAT\/MS\/MS technology. Further, computational analysis was used to identify those proteins that are secreted. Once such protein was further investigated and shown to be a diagnostic marker for prostate cancer used either alone, or in combination with the known PSA prostate cancer marker.","MPSS Analysis:","LNCaP and CL1 cells were grown using methods known in the art, for example, as described by Tso et al. 2000, supra). RNAs were isolated using Trizol (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocols (see, e.g., as described by Nelson et al. 99: 11890-11895, 2002). MPSS cDNA libraries were constructed, individual cDNA sequences were amplified and attached to individual beads and sequenced as described by Brenner, et al., 2000, supra. The resulting signatures, generally 20 bases in length, were annotated using the then most recently annotated human genome sequence (human genome release hg16, released in November, 2003) and the human Unigene (Unigene build #184) according to a previously published method (Meyers, B. C., et al., 14: 1641-1653, 2004). Only 100% matches between an MPSS signature and a genome signature were considered. Those signatures that expressed at less than 3 tpm in both LNCaP and CL1 libraries were also excluded, as they might not be reliably detected (this represents less than one transcript per cell) (Jongeneel, C. V., et al., 2003). Additionally, cDNA signatures were classified by their positions relative to polyadenylation signals and poly (A) tails and by their orientation relative to the 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 orientation of source mRNA. The Z-test (Man, M. Z., et al., 16: 953-959, 2000) was used to calculate P values for comparison of gene expression levels between the cell lines.","Isotope-Coded Affinity Tag (ICAT) Analysis:","ICAT reagents were purchased from Applied Biosystems Inc. Fractionation of cells into cytosolic, microsomal and nuclear fractions, as well as ICAT labeling, MS\/MS, and data analyses were performed as described by Han et al. 19: 946-951, 2001. In addition, probability score analysis (Keller, A., et al., 74: 5383-5392, 2002) and ASAPRatio (Automated Statistical Analysis on Protein Ratio) (Li, X. J., et al., 75: 6648-6657, 2003) were used to assess the quality of MS spectra and to calculate protein ratios from multiple peptide ratios. (Briefly, and as described at http colon double slash regis dot systemsbiology dot net\/software, Automated Statistical Analysis on Protein Ratio (ASAPRatio) accurately calculates the relative abundances of proteins and the corresponding confidence intervals from ICAT-type ESI-LC\/MS data. The software first uses a Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter to reconstruct LC spectra of a peptide and its partner in a single charge state, subtracts background noise from each spectrum, and calculates light:heavy ratio of the peptide in that charge state. The ratios of the same peptide in different charge states are averaged and weighted by the corresponding spectrum intensity to obtain the peptide light:heavy ratio and its error. Subsequently, all unique peptides identified for a given protein are collected, their ratios and errors calculated, outliers are checked for using Dixon's tests, and the relative abundance and confidence interval for the protein are calculated by applying statistics for weighed samples. The software quickly generates a list of interesting proteins based on their relative abundance. A byproduct of the software is to identify outlier peptides which may be misidentified or, more interestingly, post-translationally modified.) To compare protein and mRNA expression levels, the Unigene numbers of the differentially expressed proteins were used to find MPSS signatures and their expression levels in transcripts per million (tpm). If one Unigene had more than one MPSS signature, likely due to alternative terminations, the average tpm of all signatures was taken.","Real-Time RT-PCR:","All primers were designed with the PRIMER3 program (httpcolon double slash www-genome dot wi dot mit dot edu slash cgi-bin slash primer slash primer3_www dot cgi) and BLAST-searched against the human cDNA and EST database for uniqueness. Real-time PCR was performed on an ABI 7700 machine (PE Biosystems) and the SYBR Green dye (Molecular Probe Inc.) was used as a reporter. PCR conditions were designed to give bands of the expected size with minimal primer dimer bands.","Identification of Perturbed Networks:","Genes in the 328 Biocarta and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways or networks (http colon double slash cgap dot nci dot nih dot gov slash Pathways slash) were downloaded and compared with the MPSS data, using Unigene IDs as identifiers. If a Unigene ID or an E.C. number corresponded to multiple signatures, potentially due to multiple alternatively terminated isoforms, the tpm counts of the isoforms were combined and then subjected to the Z-test (Man, M. Z., et al., 2000, supra). Genes with P values of 0.001 or less were considered to be significantly differentially expressed. The following criteria were used to identify perturbed networks: a perturbed network must have more than 3 genes represented our differentially expressed gene list (p<0.001) and at least 50% of those genes must be up regulated, it was considered an up-regulated pathway (vice versa for the down-regulated pathways).","Display of KEGG Networks by Cytoscape:","Cytoscape software was used (www dot cytoscape dot org) (Shannon, P., et al., 13: 2498-2504, 2003), to map the data onto the web of intracellular molecular interactions. We imported metabolic network maps and related information such as enzymes, substrates, and reactions from the recently developed KEGG (http colon double slash www dot genome dot ad dot jp slash) API 2.0 web server into the Cytoscape program. Expression data were thus automatically mapped to the KEGG and Biocarta pathways\/networks and visualized by Cytoscape.","MPSS Analyses of the Androgen-Dependent LNCaP Cell Line and its Androgen-Independent Variant CL1:","Using MPSS technology, 2.22 million signature sequences were sequenced for LNCaP cells and 2.96 million for CL1 cells.","A total of 19,595 unique transcript signatures expressed at levels >3 tpm in at least one of the samples were identified. The signatures were classified into three major categories: 1093 signatures matched repeat sequences; 15,541 signatures matched unique cDNAs or ESTs, and 2961 signatures had no matches to any cDNA or EST sequences (but did match genomic sequences). The last category included sequences falling into one of three different categories: signatures representing new transcripts yet to be defined, signatures representing polymorphisms in cDNA sequences (a match of an MPSS sequence to cDNA or EST sequences requires 100% sequence identity), or errors in the MPSS reads. Transcript tags with matches to a cDNA or EST sequence were further classified based on the signatures' relative orientation to transcription direction and their position relative to a polyadenylation site and\/or poly(A) tail. A searchable MySQL database (www dot mysql dot com) was also built containing the expression levels (tpm), the genomic locations of the MPSS sequences, the cDNAs or EST matches, and the classification of each signature.","The first analysis was restricted to those MPSS signatures corresponding to cDNAs with poly(A) tails and\/or polyadenylation sites, so that corresponding genes could be conclusively identified. The Z-test was used to compare differential gene expression between LNCaP cells and CL1 cells (Mann, et al., 2000, supra). Using very stringent P values (less than 0.001), 2088 MPSS signatures were identified (corresponding to 1987 unique genes, as some genes have two or more MPSS signatures, due to alternative usages of polyadenylation sites) with significant differential expression. Of these, 1011 signatures (965 genes) were overexpressed in CL1 cells, and 1077 signatures (1022 genes) were overexpressed in LNCaP cells. The significance score of Z-test was dependent on the expression level. If a cut off P value of less than 0.001 was taken in the dataset, the expression level in tpm changed from 0 to 26 tpm for the most lowly expressed transcript (>26 fold); and changed from 7591 and 11206 tpm for the most highly expressed transcript (1.48 fold).","The expression levels of nine randomly chosen genes were identified using the MPSS and quantitative real-time RT-PCR techniques and showed that both RNA data sets were concordant. The MPSS expression profiling data were consistent with the available published data. For example, using RT-PCR, Patel et al. (Patel, B. J., et al., 164: 1420-1425, 2000) showed that CL1 tumors express barely detectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and androgen receptor (AR) mRNAs as compared with LNCaP cells. The present MPSS results indicated that LNCaP cells expressed 584 tpm of androgen receptor (AR) and 841 tpm of PSA; CL1 cells did not express either AR or PSA (0 tpm in both cases). Freedland et al. found that CD10 expression was lost in CL1 cells compared with LNCaP cells (Freedland, S. J., et al., 55: 71-80, 2003); the present study found that CD10 was expressed at 0 tpm in CL1 cells but at 56 tpm in LNCaP cells. Using cDNA microarrays, Vaarala et al. (Vaarala, M. H., et al., 80: 1259-1268, 2000) compared LNCaP cells and another androgen-independent variant, non-PSA-producing LNCaP line, which is similar to CL1, and identified a total of 56 differentially expressed genes. We found completely concordant expression changes in these 56 genes between LNCaP and CL1 (in contrast to 1987 found by MPSS), and between LNCaP and non-PSA-producing LNCaP cells. This underscores the striking differences in sensitivity between the MPSS and cDNA microarray techniques.","CL1 cells do not express AR and thus lack the AR-mediated response program. To distinguish androgen response from other programs contributing to prostate cancer progression, the list of genes differentially expressed between LNCaP and CL1 cells were compared with a complementary list derived from MPSS analysis of LNCaP cells grown in the presence or absence of androgens (LNCaP R+\/R\u2212). From the 1987 differentially expressed gene between LNCaP and CL1, 525 genes were identified that were also differentially expressed in the LNCaP R+\/R\u2212 dataset. Differential expression of these genes between LNCaP and CL1 cells probably reflects the fact that LNCaP cells express AR but CL1 does not, and the fact that normal medium contains some androgen. The remaining 1462 differentially expressed genes were not directly related to cellular AR status.","To compare the sensitivity of the MPSS and cDNA microarray procedures, cDNA microarrays containing 40,000 human cDNAs were hybridized to the same LNCaP and CL1 RNAs that were used for MPSS. Three replicate array hybridizations were performed. MPSS signatures and array clone IDs were mapped to Unigene IDs for data extraction and comparisons. The results showed that only those genes expressed at >40 tpm by MPSS could be reliably detected as changing levels by cDNA microarray hybridizations [judged by an expression level twice the standard deviation of the background, a standard cutoff value for microarray data analysis]. This observation is consistent with the 33-60 tpm sensitivity of microarrays estimated from the experiment performed by Hill et al. Science, 290: 809-812, 2000, in which known concentrations of synthetic transcripts were added. In LNCaP and CL1 cells, about 68.75% (13,471 of 19,595) of MPSS signatures (>3 tpm) were expressed at a level below 40 tpm; changes in the levels of these genes will be missed by microarray methods. Many attempts have been made to increase the sensitivity of DNA array technology (Han, M., et al., 19: 631-635, 2001; Bao, P., et al., 74: 1792-1797, 2002.), however, the present study has not compared these new improvements against MPSS but it is clear that there will still be significant differences in the levels of change that can be detected.","SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) (Velculescu, V. E., et al., 16: 423-425, 2000) is another technology for gene expression profiling; like MPSS, it is digital and can generate a large number of signature sequences. However, MPSS, which can sequence \u02dc1 million signatures per sample, can achieve a much deeper coverage than SAGE (typical \u02dc10,000-100,000 signatures sequenced\/sample) at reasonable cost. The MPSS data on LNCaP cells was compared against publicly available SAGE data on LNCaP cells (NCBI SAGE database) through common Unigene IDs. The SAGE library GSM724 (total SAGE tags sequenced: 22,721) (Lal, A., et al., 59: 5403-5407, 1999) was derived from LNCaP cells with an inactivated PTEN gene; it is the SAGE library most similar to the LNCaP cells. Only 400 (about 20%) of the 1987 significantly differentially expressed genes (P<0.001) had any SAGE tag entry in GSM724. These data illustrate the importance of deep sequence coverage in identifying state changes in transcripts expressed at low abundance levels.","Functional Classifications of Genes Differentially Expressed Between LNCaP and CL1 Cells:","Examination of the GO (Gene Ontology) classification of the 1987 genes revealed that multiple cellular processes change during the transition from LNCaP cells to CL1 cells. The most interesting groups, categorized by function, are shown in Table 1.","Nineteen differentially expressed proteins are related to apoptosis. Twelve of these are up regulated in CL1 cells, including the apoptosis inhibitors Taxi (human T-cell leukemia virus type I) binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1) and CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator. Seven are down regulated in CL1, including programmed cell death 8 and 5 (apoptosis-inducing factors), and BCL2-like 13 (an apoptosis facilitator). Since CL1 cells have increased expression of apoptosis inhibitors and decreased expression of apoptosis inducers, net inhibition of apoptosis may contribute to their greater tumorigenicity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0151","num":"0150"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"294pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"EXAMPLES OF DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED GENES"},{"entry":"AND THEIR FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATIONS"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"LNCaP","CL1",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Signatures","(tpm)","(tpm)","Description","GenBank ID","SEQ ID NOS:"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"294pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Apoptosis related"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["GATCAAATGTGTGGCCT","0","3609","lectin,","BC001693","1574-1575"]},{"entry":["(SEQ ID NO: 3)",{},{},"galactoside-",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"binding,",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"soluble, 1",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"(galectin 1),",{},{}]},{"entry":["GATCATAATGTTAACTA","0","14","pleiomorphic ","NM_002656","1576-1577"]},{"entry":["(SEQ ID NO: 4)",{},{},"adenoma gene-",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"like 1",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"(PLAGL1)",{},{}]},{"entry":["GATCATCCAGAGGAGCT","0","16","caspase 7,","U40281","1578-1579"]},{"entry":["(SEQ ID NO: 5)",{},{},"apoptosis-",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"related cysteine",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"protease",{},{}]},{"entry":["GATCGCGGTATTAAATC","0","15","tumor necrosis","U75380","1580-1581"]},{"entry":["(SEQ ID NO: 6)",{},{},"factor receptor",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"superfamily,",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"member 12",{},{}]},{"entry":["GATCTCCTGTCCATCAG","0","24","interleukin 1,","M15330","1582-1583"]},{"entry":["(SEQ ID NO: 7)",{},{},"beta",{},{}]},{"entry":["GATCCCCTTCAAGGACA","1","19","nudix (nucleoside","NM_006024","1584-1585"]},{"entry":["(SEQ ID NO: 8)",{},{},"diphosphate",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"linked moiety",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"X)-type motif 1",{},{}]},{"entry":["GATCATTGCCATCACCA","51","278","EST, Highly","AL832733","1586"]},{"entry":["(SEQ ID NO: 9)",{},{},"similar to",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"CUL2_HUMA",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"N CULLIN",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"HOMOLOG 2",{},{}]},{"entry":["GATCTGAAAATTCTTGG","16","56","CASP8 and","U97075","r587-1588"]},{"entry":["(SEQ ID NO: 10)",{},{},"FADD-like",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"apoptosis",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"regulator",{},{}]},{"entry":["GATCCACCTTGGCCTCC","49","149","tumor necrosis","NM_003842","1589-1590"]},{"entry":["(SEQ ID NO: 11)",{},{},"factor receptor",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"superfamily,",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"member 10b",{},{}]},{"entry":["GATCATGAATGACTGAC","118","257","cytochrome c","BC009582","1591-1592"]},{"entry":["(SEQ ID NO: 12)",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["GATCAAGTCCTTTGTGA","299","102","programmed","H20713","1593"]},{"entry":["(SEQ ID NO: 13)",{},{},"cell death 8",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"(apoptosis-",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"inducing factor)",{},{}]},{"entry":["GATCACCAAAACCTGAT","72","24","BCL2-like 13","BM904887","1594"]},{"entry":["(SEQ ID NO: 14)",{},{},"(apoptosis facilitator)",{},{}]},{"entry":["GATCAATCTGAACTATC","563","146","apoptosis","NM_016085","1595-1596"]},{"entry":["(SEQ ID NO: 15)",{},{},"related protein",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"APR-3 (APR-3)",{},{}]},{"entry":["GATCCCTCTGTACAGGC","83","13","unc-13-like (C.

extracellular matrix components that physically impede cell migration, are implicated in tumor cell growth, invasion, and metastasis. MMP1, 2, 10 and 13 were found to be significantly overexpressed in CL1 cells (Table 1), which may partially explain these cells' aggressive and metastatic behavior.","CD (cluster designation of monoclonal antibodies) markers are generally localized at the cell surface; some may be associated with prostate cancer (Liu, A. Y., et al., 40: 192-199, 1999). All currently identified CD markers (CD1 to CD247) from the PROW CD index database (www dot ncbi dot nlm dot nih dot govslash prow slash guide slash 45277084 dot htm) were converted to UniGene numbers and the Unigene numbers used to identify their signatures and their expression levels. Fifteen CD markers were identified that were differentially expressed between LNCaP and CL1 cells (Z score <0.001) (Table 1). Eleven CD markers, including CD213a2 and CD213a1, which encode IL-13 receptors alpha 1 and 2, are up regulated in CL1 cells; three CD markers, CD9, CD10, and CD107, WERE downregulated in these cells (Table 1). Six CD markers went from 0 or 1 tpm to >35 tpm (Table 1), making them good digital or absolute markers or therapeutic targets. These data suggest that carefully selected CD markers may be useful in following the progression of prostate cancer, and indeed could serve as potential targets for antibody-mediated therapies (Liu, A. Y., et al., 40: 192-199, 1999).","Delineation of Disease-Perturbed Networks in Prostate Cancer Cells.","Genes and proteins rarely act alone but rather generally operate in networks of interactions. Identifying key nodes (proteins) in the disease-perturbed networks may provide insights into effective drug targets. Comparing the genes (proteins) currently available in the 314 BioCarta and 155 KEGG pathway or network (http colon double slash cgap dot nci dot nih dot gov slash Pathways slash) databases with the MPSS data through Unigene IDs, we identified 37 BioCarta and 14 KEGG pathways that are up regulated and 23 BioCarta and 22 KEGG pathways down regulated in LNCaP cells versus CL1 cells (Table 2). The number of genes whose expression patterns changed in each pathway is listed in Table 2. Each gene along with its expression level in LNCaP and CL1 cells is listed pathway by pathway in our database (ftp colon double slash ftp dot systemsbiology dot net slash blin slash mpss). Changes in these pathways reveal the underlying phenotypic differences between LNCaP and CL1 cells. For example, multiple networks involved in modulating cell mobility, adhesion and spreading are up regulated in CL1 cells, which are more metastatic and invasive than LNCaP cells (Table 2). In the uCalpain and Friends in Cell Spread pathway, calpains are calcium-dependent thiol proteases implicated in cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell migration. During cell migration, calpain cleaves target proteins such as talin, ezrin, and paxillin at the leading edge of the membrane, while at the same time cleaving the cytoplasmic tails of the integrins \u03b21(a) and \u03b23(b) to release adhesion attachments at the trailing membrane edge. Increased activity of calpains increases migration rates and facilitates cell invasiveness (Liu, A. et al., Prostate, 40: 192-199, 1999).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0156","num":"0155"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"294pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

form networks (in fact there are probably no discrete pathways, only networks). For example, the insulin signaling pathway, the signal transduction through IL1R pathway, NF-kB signaling pathway are interconnected through c-Jun, IL1R and NF-kB. The mapping of genes onto networks\/pathways will be an ongoing objective as more networks\/pathways become available. Our transcriptome data will be an invaluable resource in delineating these relationships.","As gene regulatory networks controlled by transcription factors form the top layer of the hierarchy that controls the physiological network, we sought to identify differentially expressed transcription factors. Of 554 transcription factors expressed in LNCaP and CL1 cells, 112 showed significantly different levels between the cell lines (P<0.001) This clearly demonstrated significant difference in the functioning of the corresponding gene regulatory networks during the progression of prostate cancer from the early to late stages.","Quantitative Proteomics Analysis of Prostate Cancer Cells.","We quantitatively profiled the protein expression changes between LNCaP and CL1 cells using the ICAT-MS\/MS protocol described by Han et al. 19: 946-951, 2001. To increase proteome coverage, cells were separated into nuclear, cytosolic and microsomal fractions prior to ICAT analysis as described in Han et al., 2001, supra. We generated a total of 142,849 tandem mass spectra, 7282 of which corresponded to peptides with a mass spectrum quality score P value (Keller, A., et al., 2002 Oct. 15; 74(20):5383-92) greater than 0.9 (allowing unambiguous identification of peptides). These 7282 peptides represented 971 proteins (Keller, A., et al., 2002, supra). We obtained quantitative peptide ratios for 4583 peptides corresponding to 941 proteins. The number of peptides is greater than the number of proteins because 1) mass spectrometry identified multiple peptides from the same protein and 2) the ionization step of mass spectrometry created different charge states for the same peptide. The protein ratios were calculated from multiple peptide ratios using an algorithm for the automated statistical analysis of protein abundance ratios (ASAPRatio) (Li, X. J., et al., 75: 6648-6657, 2003). In the end, we identified 82 proteins that are down regulated and 108 proteins that are up regulated by at least 1.8-fold in LNCaP cells compared with CL1 cells. For example, five proteins belong to annexins that were markers for prostate and other cancers (Hayes, M. J. and Moss, S. E. 322: 1166-1170, 2004), seven are involved in fatty acids and lipid metabolism that are involved in the carcinogenesis and progression of prostate cancer (Pandian, S. S., et al., 44: 352-361, 1999), five are related to apoptosis, 11 are cancer related, and five proteins are putative transcription factors. As we only identified a limited number of proteins that are significantly differentially expressed due to low sensitivity of ICAT technology, we were only able to identify a few pathways that are perturbed based on ICAT data alone (using the stringent criteria discussed above). This also illustrated the importance of MPSS analysis described earlier.","103 of 190 (54%) differentially expressed proteins identified have enzymatic activity and hence many are involved in metabolism. Notably, many of the proteins identified are involved in fatty acid and lipid metabolism, including fatty acid synthase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase II and propionyl Coenzyme A carboxylase alpha polypeptide. Fatty acid and lipid metabolism is known to be perturbed in prostate cancer (Fleshner, N., et al., 171: S19-24, 2004). Additionally, many genes involved in lipid transport were altered, including the annexins, prosaposin, and fatty acid binding protein 5. Annexin A1 has previously been shown to be overexpressed in non-PSA-producing LNCaP cells as compared with PSA-producing LNCaP cells (Vaarala, M. H., et al., 2000, supra). Annexin A7 is postulated to be a prostate tumor suppressor gene (Cardo-Vila, M., et al., 1: 92-94, 2001). Annexin A2 expression is reduced or lost in prostate cancer cells, and its re-expression inhibits prostate cancer cell migration (Liu, J. W., et al., 22: 1475-1485, 2003).","Other genes identified here have been implicated in carcinogenesis, including tumor suppressor p16 and insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (Chi, S. G., et al., 3: 1889-1897, 1997; Kiess, W., et al., 41 2: 66-73, 1994). Some genes have previously been implicated in prostate cancer, such as prostate cancer over expressed gene 1 POV1, which is over expressed in prostate cancer (Cole, K. A., et al., 51: 282-287, 1998), and delta 1 and alpha 1 catenin (cadherin-associated protein) and junction plakoglobin, which are down regulated in prostate cancer cells (Kallakury, B. V., et al., 92: 2786-2795, 2001). However, the potential relationships of most of the proteins identified here to prostate cancer require further elucidation. For example, transmembrane protein 4 (TMEM4), a gene predicted to encode a 182-amino acid type II transmembrane protein, is downregulated about twofold in CL1 cells compared with LNCaP cells. MPSS data also indicated that TMEM4 is down regulated about twofold in CL1 cells. Many type II transmembrane proteins, such as TMPRSS2, are overexpressed in prostate cancer patients (Vaarala, M. H., et al., 94: 705-710, 2001). It will be interesting to see whether TMEM4 overexpression plays a primary role in prostate carcinogenesis. We also identified 12 proteins that have not been annotated or functionally characterized.","The mRNA expression level of eight proteins change from 0 tpm in LNCaP cells to greater than 50 tpm (we called them \u2018digital changes\u2019 because they go from zero to some expression) in CL1 cells, and that of one protein changed from 0 tpm in CL1 cells to greater than 50 in LNCaP cells. These genes can be used as digital diagnostic signals. Twenty-two of the differentially expressed proteins were predicted to be secreted proteins (See Table 3) and can be further evaluated as serum marker (see also Example 2 below).","Additionally, we sought to compare the expression at the protein level with that at the mRNA level. We converted the protein IDs and MPSS signatures to Unigene IDs to compare the MPSS data with the ICAT-MS\/MS data. We limited this comparison to those with common Unigene IDs and with reliable ICAT ratios (standard deviation less than 0.5) and ended up with a subset of 79 proteins. Of these, 66 genes (83.5%) were concordant in their changes in mRNA and protein levels of expression and 13 genes (16.5%) were discordant, i.e. having higher protein expression but lower mRNA expression or vice versa. There are no functional similarities among the discordant genes. As these mRNAs and proteins are expressed at relatively high levels, discordance due to measurement errors is unlikely. Clearly posttranscriptional mechanism(s) of protein expression are functioning, although the elucidation of the specific mechanism(s) awaits further studies.","Thus, these results, and those described in the Examples below, indicate a systems approach to disease will offer powerful tools for diagnostics, therapeutics, and even aid in prevention in the future.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0166","num":"0165"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"308pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

be exploited for blood cancer diagnosis and prognosis. As such, the differentially expressed genes identified in Example 1 were further analyzed to determine how many of the differentially expressed genes encode secreted proteins. Proteins with signal peptides (classical secretory proteins) were predicted using the same criteria described by Chen et al., Mamm Genome, 14: 859-865, 2003, with the SignalP 3.0 server developed by The Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Lyngby, Denmark (http colon double slash www dot cbs dot dtu dot dk slash services slash SignalP-3.0; see also, J. D. Bendtsen, et al., 340:783-795, 2004.) and the TMHMM2.0 server (see for example A. Krogh, et al., 305(3):567-580, January 2001; E. L. L. Sonnhammer, et al., In J. Glasgow, T. Littlejohn, F. Major, R. Lathrop, D. Sankoff, and C. Sensen, editors, , pages 175-182, Menlo Park, Calif., 1998. AAAI Press). Putatively nonclassical secretory secreted proteins (without signal peptides) were predicted based on the SecretomeP 1.0 server, (httpcolon double slash www dot cbs dot dtu dot dkslash services slash SecretomeP-1.0 slash) and required an odds ratio score >3.","Five hundred and twenty one signatures belonging to 460 genes potentially encoding secreted proteins (Table 3) were identified. Among these, 287 (259 genes) and 234 (201 genes) signatures were overexpressed or underexpressed in CL1 cells compared with LNCaP cells. Thus these proteins can be used in blood diagnostics to follow prostate cancer progression.","This example describes a multiparameter diagnostic fingerprint using the WDR19 prostate-specific secreted protein in combination with PSA. The WDR19 prostate-specific protein is diagnostically superior to PSA when used alone and further improved prostate cancer detection when used in combination with PSA.","WDR19 was previously identified as relatively tissue-specific by cDNA array studies and Northern blot analysis (see e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20020150893). This protein was selected, expressed as protein, purified and antibodies were made against it, all using standard techniques known in the art (the cDNA encoding the WDR19 protein is provided in SEQ ID NO:1, the amino acid sequence is provided in SEQ ID NO:2). The WDR19-specific antibody was shown to be an excellent tissue-specific marker of prostate cancer with staining of the specific epithelial cells being directly proportional to the progression of the cancer. In this regard it is very different from the well-established PSA marker which is not a good prostate tissue cancer marker.","The WDR19 antibodies and those for the well-established PSA prostate cancer blood marker were used to analyze 10 blood samples from normal individuals, 10 blood samples from early prostate cancer patients and 10 blood samples from late prostate cancer patients. The results showed that WDR19 reacted against no normals, against 5\/10 early cancers, and against 5\/10 late cancers, whereas PSA reacted against no normals, no early cancers and 7\/10 late cancers. The two markers together detected all the late cancers. Thus the mutiparameter analysis of blood markers (e.g. the analyses of multiple markers) for prostate cancer was far more powerful than using each marker alone.","Accordingly, the results show a molecular blood fingerprint that comprises the WDR19 and PSA proteins. This fingerprint allows superior diagnostic power to PSA alone and further improves prostate cancer detection.","WDR19 was also shown to be an effective histochemical marker for prostate cancer. Two hundred and seventy-five tissue cores that contain both stromal and epithelial cells from cancer patients, 17 from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 12 from normal individuals were examined. The mean WDR19 protein staining intensities were 2.52 [standard error (S.E.), 0.05; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.41-2.61] for prostate cancer; 1.03 BPH (S.E. 0.03; 95% CI, 0.96-1.09); and 1.0 (S.E., 0, 95% CI 1.0-1.0) for normal individuals. Pair-wise comparisons (using independent t-test) demonstrated that WDR19 staining intensity is significantly different between prostate cancer and BPH (mean difference 1.49; P<0.0001) and between prostate cancers and normal (mean difference 1.52; P<0.0001). These data suggested that WDR19, in addition to being a prostate-specific blood biomarker, is a quantitative cancer-specific marker for prostate tissues.","MPSS as described in Example 1 and in the detailed description, was used to identify more than 2 million transcripts from each of the prostate cell lines (see Example 1) and in normal prostate tissue. The MPSS signature sequences from normal prostate were compared against 29 other tissues each with about 1 million or more mRNA transcripts. This comparison revealed that about 300 of these transcripts are organ-specific and about 60 of these organ-specific transcripts are potentially secreted into the blood.

The comparison showed that the transcriptomes were distinct for the normal tissue, the early prostate cancer and the late prostate cancer. An additional comparison was carried out between localized prostate cancer and metastases in the liver. About 6,000 genes were identified that were significantly changed between the localized prostate cancer and the metastasized cancer and again, many of the changed genes encoded secreted proteins that can be part of the blood fingerprints indicative of the more advanced disease status of metastases. The metastases-altered blood fingerprints may indicate the site of metastases.","These experiments demonstrate that there are continuous changes in the two types of networks as prostate cancer progresses\u2014from localized to androgen independence to metastases. These graded network transitions suggest that one will be able to detect the very earliest stages of prostate cancer and, accordingly, that the organ-specific, molecular blood fingerprints approach described herein will also permit a very early diagnosis of prostate and other types of cancers.","This experiment demonstrates perturbation-specific fingerprints of patterns of gene expression for nuclear, cytoplasmic, membrane-bound and secreted proteins in the yeast metabolic system that converts the sugar galactose into glucose-6-phosphate (the gal system).","The gal systems includes 9 proteins. In the course of studying how this systems works, 9 new strains of yeast were created, each with a different one of the 9 relevant genes destroyed (gene knockouts). Yeast is a single celled eukaryote organism with about 6,000 genes. The expression patterns of each of the 6,000 genes was studied in the wild type yeast and each of the 9 knockout strains. The data from these experiments showed: 1) the wild type and each of knock out strains exhibited statistically significant changes in patterns of gene expression from the wild type strain ranging from 89 to 465 altered patterns of gene expression; 2) each of these patterns of changed gene expression were unique; and 3) on average about 15% of the genes with changed expression patterns encoded proteins that were potentially secreted (as determined by computational analysis from the sequence of the gene). These genes are as follows: (listed by gene name as available through the public yeast genome database at http:\/\/www.yeastgenome.org\/.

Accordingly, these data further support the notion that each disease has a unique expression fingerprint and that each disease generates unique collections of secreted proteins that constitute molecular fingerprints capable of identifying the corresponding disease.","Organ specific\/enriched expression can be determined by the ratio of the expression (e.g., measured in transcripts per million (tpm)) in a particular organ as compared to other organs. In this example, prostate enriched\/specific expression was analyzed by comparing the expression level (tpm counts) of MPSS signature sequences identified from normal prostate tissue to their corresponding expression levels in 33 normal tissues. A particular gene that demonstrated at least a 2.5-fold increase in expression in prostate as compared to all tissues examined (each tissue evaluated individually) was considered to be prostate-specific\/enriched. The tissues examined were adrenal gland, bladder, bone marrow, brain (amygdala, caudate nucleus, cerebellum, corpus callosum, hypothalamus, and thalamus), whole fetal brain, heart, kidney, liver (new cloning), lung, mammary gland, monocytes, peripheral blood lymphocytes, pituitary gland, placenta, pancreas, prostate, retina, spinal cord, salivary gland, small intestine, stomach, spleen, testis, thymus, trachea, thyroid, and uterus. This analysis identified 109 unique genes (with mpss signature sequence belonging to class 1-4, i.e. with confirmed match to cDNAs) whose expression was at least 2.5 fold that observed in other normal tissues. The list of prostate-specific\/enriched genes is provided in Tables 5A-5D with the expression level in tpm in prostate shown. This list includes KLK2, KLK3, KLK4, TMPRSS2, which are genes previously shown to be prostate-specific.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0182","num":"0181"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"378pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

The analysis programs used included SignalP 3.0, Secretome 2.0 and TMHMM 2.0 (see http colon double slash www dot cbs dot dtu dot dk\/services\/). The SignalP analysis identifies classical secreted proteins and was conducted using the classical secretion pathway prediction as described at http colon double slash www dot cbs dot dtu dot dk\/services\/SignalP\/ (see Jannick Dyrl\u00f8v Bendtsen, et al. J. Mol. Biol., 340:783-795, 2004; Henrik Nielsen et al., Protein Engineering, 10:1-6, 1997; Henrik Nielsen and Anders Krogh. Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB 6), AAAI Press, Menlo Park, Calif., pp. 122-130, 1998). The Secretome2.0 analysis identifies nonclassical secreted proteins (see J. Dyrl\u00f8v Bendtsen, et al., Protein Eng. Des. Sel., 17(4):349-356, 2004). TMHMM uses hidden Markov model for three-state (TM-helix, inside, outside) topology prediction of transmembrane proteins (see Erik L. L. Sonnhammer, et al., Proc. of Sixth Int. Conf. on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology, p. 175-182 Ed. J. Glasgow, T. Littlejohn, F. Major, R. Lathrop, D. Sankoff, and C. Sensen, Menlo Park, Calif.: AAAI Press, 1998). According to the SignalP analysis method, proteins with an odds scoring 3 or higher have a high confidence of being secreted. However, it should be noted that several proteins scoring well below 3 by this method are known to be secreted proteins detected in the blood (see e.g., Table 5, KLK2). Further, these analyses do not take into account proteins that may be shed.","In summary, this example identifies prostate-specific and potentially secreted prostate-specific proteins that can be used in diagnostic panels for the detection of diseases of the prostate.","This example describes a multiparameter diagnostic fingerprint using the NDRG1 prostate-specific protein in combination with PSA. The NDRG1 prostate-specific protein further improved prostate cancer detection when used in combination with PSA.","Commercially available antibodies specific for numerous proteins encoded by prostate-specific genes as described in Table 5 were used to determine which proteins would be useful in a multiparameter diagnostic assay for prostate cancer. Most of the commercially available antibodies were not suitable (e.g., were not sensitive enough or showed non-specific binding). However, the antibody available for NDRG1 (anti-NDRG1 (C terminal) poly IgY; Cat#A22272B; GenWay Inc) was shown to specifically bind to NDRG1 from serum. NDRG1 is a member of the N-myc downregulated gene (NDRG) family that belongs to the alpha\/beta hydrolase superfamily. It is classified as a tumor suppressor and heavy metal-response protein. Its expression is modulated by diverse physiological and pathological conditions including hypoxia, cellular differentiation, heavy metal, N-myc and neoplasia (Lachat P, et al.; Histochem Cell Biol. 2002 November; 118 (5):399-408).","NDRG1 protein expression was analyzed in serum samples from 18 advanced prostate cancer patients, 21 prostate cancer patients with localized cancer, and 22 normal controls. Western blot analysis was used to measure serum protein expression as follows: Serum was diluted (1:10) with lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 4 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 2 \u03bcM PMSF, 20 \u03bcg\/ml, leupeptine (or 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail), 1 mM NaVO,10 mM NaF, 2 mM Na pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Serum proteins (50 \u03bcg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Hybond-P, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J.). The membrane was blocked with 4% non-fat milk in TBS (25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 125 mM NaCl) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibodies against NDRG1 IgY (1:500) overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The membranes were washed 3 times with TBS, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit IgY (1:16,000) for 1 h. The immunoblot was then washed five times with TBS and developed using an ECL (Amersham). The intensities of the single band corresponding to the NDRG1 protein were then scored. The results are summarized in Table 6 together with serum PSA measurements performed using a commercial ELISA kit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0191","num":"0190"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00009","num":"00009"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

NDRG1 was detected in 14 out of 18 advanced cancers (78%) (see Table 6, scores greater than 3). Serum PSA levels below 15 ng\/ml, particularly, levels between 4-10 ng\/ml (often referred to as the \u2018grey zone\u2019 in the PSA assay) cannot reliably detect prostate cancer as PSA levels in this range may be the result of other factors such as infection (prostatitis) or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a common condition in older men. Additionally, the normal range of PSA values increases with patient age. NDRG1 detection in serum reinforced the diagnosis of three prostate cancer patients with PSA levels between 4.9 ng\/ml and 15 ng\/ml. In these three patients, the NDRG1 scores were 3 or 4, significantly higher than the NDRG1 scores in a cohort of 22 normal individuals (average 0.09, range \u22121 to 2).","Thus, this example illustrates that the use of two or more prostate specific\/enriched cancer markers such as NDRG1 and PSA can improve prostate cancer diagnosis to reduce false positive and false negative rates.","From the foregoing it will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not limited except as by the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
