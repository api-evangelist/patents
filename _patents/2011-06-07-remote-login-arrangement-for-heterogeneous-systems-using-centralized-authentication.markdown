{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to management of login credentials; in particular, the present disclosure relates to a remote login arrangement for heterogeneous systems using centralized authentication.","Various computing environments and applications require users to provide credentials prior to allowing access to certain functionalities, data, or applications. For example, a user may be required to provide a username and password to be provided access to applications running within the context of an operating system, or to the operating system itself. In this context, an operating system will validate users for each application executing within that operating system. Alternately, a user may provide a domain username and domain password to a domain server, which in turn would manage access to domain resources (e.g., one or more computing systems and\/or applications operable within the domain).","In some computing environments, servers or applications may use different security methods or different operating systems, each having different standards and settings for user credentials. These servers or applications could have, for example, a different set of minimum standards related to length and robustness of password strings, or a particular format for username or domain username notation, or different frequencies with which passwords must change.","Difficulties arise when a computing environment includes multiple such heterogeneous, yet interrelated systems having different management or settings for user authentication. Specifically, when one such system requires access to resources of a different system, those systems must be coordinated to allow such access to occur.","In applications or servers having heterogeneous authentication systems, typically a user will either provide credentials for each system separately, or will provide credentials for a first one of those authentication systems, which then stores a set of credentials used by a second authentication system. This second arrangement allows the authentication systems to coordinate and allow the user to access information in both applications or servers with a single login process. However, using the first authentication system to provide access to the second heterogeneous system does not provide reliable access to both systems, since the credentials (e.g., a username or password) for the user on the second heterogeneous system may change without the information stored in the first authentication system being updated.","Inclusion of remote access into such systems only exacerbates these problems. If a user wishes to access a set of computing systems having heterogeneous authentication systems from a remote location, that user typically must use a remote access protocol, such as the lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP). However, if user credentials in any of the heterogeneous authentication systems have changed, that remote access protocol would also not be notified of those changes. Therefore, when user credentials change, remote access would be prevented.","For these and other reasons, improvements are desirable.","In accordance with the following disclosure, the above and other issues are addressed by the following:","In a first aspect, a method for authenticating a remote user across heterogeneous authentication systems is disclosed. The method includes receiving domain user credentials at a first heterogeneous authentication system, and transmitting the domain user credentials from the first heterogeneous authentication system to an authentication interface associated with a second heterogeneous authentication system. The method also includes transmitting the domain user credentials from the second heterogeneous authentication system to a centralized authentication system, and receiving at the authentication interface a validation message from the centralized authentication system, thereby authenticating the user. The method further includes determining a local username at the authentication interface based on the domain user credentials. The method includes using the local username to authenticate the user within the first heterogeneous authentication system.","In a second aspect, a system for authenticating remote users across heterogeneous authentication systems is disclosed. The system includes a first heterogeneous authentication system configured to control access to a first server application on a server, and a second heterogeneous authentication system configured to control access to an operating system on a server, the server hosting the first server application. The system also includes an authentication interface operable in connection with the second heterogeneous authentication system, the authentication interface configured to communicate with a centralized authentication system operating external to the server. Within the system as disclosed, the first heterogeneous authentication system lacks definition of the user credentials used to access the first server application.","In a third aspect, a computer-implemented method of authenticating a remote user across heterogeneous authentication systems is disclosed. The computer-implemented method includes receiving domain user credentials and local login information at a local authentication system associated with a server application, and transmitting the domain user credentials from the local authentication system associated with a server application to an authentication interface associated with an operating system authentication system, the authentication interface including an application programming interface configured to interface with a domain authentication system. The computer-implemented method further includes transmitting the domain user credentials from the authentication interface to the domain authentication system, and receiving at the authentication interface a validation message from the domain authentication system. The computer-implemented method includes, upon receipt of the validation message, authenticating the domain user credentials at the operating system authentication system, and determining a local username at the authentication interface based on the domain user credentials. The computer-implemented method also includes using the local login information to authenticate the user within the local authentication system associated with the server application.","Various embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals represent like parts and assemblies throughout the several views. Reference to various embodiments does not limit the scope of the invention, which is limited only by the scope of the claims attached hereto. Additionally, any examples set forth in this specification are not intended to be limiting and merely set forth some of the many possible embodiments for the claimed invention.","The logical operations of the various embodiments of the disclosure described herein are implemented as: (1) a sequence of computer implemented steps, operations, or procedures running on a programmable circuit within a computer, and\/or (2) a sequence of computer implemented steps, operations, or procedures running on a programmable circuit within a directory system, database, or compiler.","In general the present disclosure relates to systems and methods for authenticating users across heterogeneous authentication systems, in particular for supporting authentication of remote users. In various embodiments of the present disclosure, coordination of authentication systems is provided, allowing for centralized (e.g., network-based or domain-level) authentication of users, and allowing those users to access computer-based applications requiring both authentication and access to resources within a system requiring separate authentication requirements. The methods and systems of the present disclosure simplify and streamline domain-based authentication, allowing users with identical domain usernames in different domains to access a local application by allowing \u201cbackground\u201d assignment of unique local usernames. Furthermore, the methods and systems described herein resolve a possible disconnect between systems when a user's passwords change and access across heterogeneous authentication systems is required.","In the context of the present disclosure, various types of authentication across a network, domain, or commonly-managed set of computing systems are discussed. While the present disclosure relates to use of any type of similar authentication process, the terms \u201ccentralized\u201d or \u201ccentralized authentication\u201d or analogous terms are used to represent any of a variety of network, domain, or commonly-managed authentication system (e.g. LDAP-based authentication). Additionally, although in some examples user credentials to be used in connection with centralized authentication are discussed as \u201cdomain credentials\u201d or a \u201cdomain identifier\u201d, it is recognized that these terms encompass credentials used to access other centralized authentication systems as well, such as network based authentication systems.","Referring now to , an example system  for authenticating a remote user across heterogeneous authentication systems is shown. The system  includes a first operating system  and a second operating system . The first and second operating system ,  operate on one or more computing systems, such as the computing systems described below in connection with . In certain embodiments, the first and second operating systems ,  reside on separate computing systems, and communicate by way of a network connection, or over the Internet. In alternative embodiments, the first and second operating systems ,  can reside on a single computing system. In such embodiments, the first and second operating systems ,  can execute within one or more different virtual environments or on different processors. Other arrangements are possible as well.","The first operating system  hosts an application  that includes an authentication system incorporated therein. The application  can be any of a number of types of productivity based server or client side applications in which user-based security is required. In certain embodiments, the application  can be an instance of Business Information Server for OS 2200, provided by Unisys Corporation of Blue Bell, Pa. Other applications requiring localized authentication could be used as well.","A local authorization system  can execute within the first operating system  as well, and can be configured to provide an interface to one or more additional external authorization systems. The local authorization system  provides an application programming interface (API)  that offers authentication systems to applications, for example the application . In certain embodiments, the local authorization system  allows applications incorporating systems capable of communicating with the API  to authenticate with a variety of other types of authentication systems, for example possible operating systems on which the applications can operate. In certain embodiments API  is configured to contain a plurality of modules, each of which are defined to authenticate a user against one or more different heterogeneous authentication systems. For example, a first API module can be configured for local authentication using the local authorization system , and a second API module can be configured for network-level or domain-level authentication. Other modules can be included in the API  as well, and can be defined to interface with other types of local or centralized authentication systems.","The first operating system  also includes an authentication system  associated with the operating system  itself, for example to allow access to files or other computer resources managed by that operating system. In certain embodiments, the first operating system  can be a Unisys OS 2200 operating system, provided by Unisys Corporation of Blue Bell, Pa. Other operating systems could be used as well.","The second operating system  can, in various embodiments, host a centralized authentication system , which provide for network- or directory-level authentication of a user. By providing such authentication, the centralized authentication system  can grant access to resources across a directory in a network of similarly-controlled systems. In certain embodiments, the second operating system  is a Microsoft Windows-based system, provided by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. In such embodiments, the centralized authentication system  can be configured to operate using any of a variety of types of services, such as an Active Directory service from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. The various other directory services, including LDAP access, or other types of centralized domain-based username and password management systems could be implemented.","Although in typical arrangements, a centralized authentication system  can authenticate a user within a particular network, in the case of heterogeneous authentication systems there are situations where the centralized authentication system  is not straightforwardly used on a stand-alone basis. For example, there may be circumstances where a remote user wishes to directly access an application (e.g., application ) requiring local authentication and access to resources in a system such as operating system , but that application  does not support such directory-level authentication. In such circumstances, simply using a centralized authentication system is insufficient, because the local authentication information used by either the application  or operating system  may change without being tracked by the directory authentication system . In such circumstances, an arrangement such as illustrated in  can be implemented in which use of local authentication in conjunction with the centralized authentication system  can be accomplished.","Referring now to , a logical flow diagram for a system  for remote access to a server application and operating system containing heterogeneous authentication systems is shown, according to a possible embodiment of the present disclosure. The illustration provided in  provides an example flow among authentication systems by which remote authentication can be accomplished using centralized authentication, for example in the system  of .","In the embodiment of system  shown, a remote client  is configured to transmit an authentication request from a remote system to a first authentication system . The first authentication system  can reside, for example, within an application requiring authentication, such as the Business Information Server for OS 2200 application mentioned above, which is provided by Unisys Corporation of Blue Bell, Pa. In the context of the present disclosure, the first authentication system  is referred to herein as a heterogeneous authentication system, in that the first authentication system  separately authenticates a user, and is not generally configured to authenticate that user based on use of a domain name or operating system login directly, for example where the authentication system  is required to provide access to resources in a system operating with a different heterogeneous authentication system, (e.g., authentication system ).","In certain embodiments, the authentication request can include domain or network user credentials for authentication. Additionally, in certain embodiments the authentication request can include local authentication information, such as a local department or other static local information required for authentication or access control at the first authentication system  (e.g., information that will not change periodically such as a user's department, username, or other user credentials).","If the authentication request includes domain or network user credentials (e.g., as determined by presence of a backslash (\u2018\\\u2019) present in a username string) received from the remote client , the domain username and domain password can be routed from the first authentication system  to a second heterogeneous authentication system , for example to an interface provided in association with that system (e.g., interface  of ). In addition, the first authentication system  can provide to the second heterogeneous authentication system  an identifier of a specific module to use for authentication, for example a number or other identifier of a module defined by the API  of  to describe an external (e.g., network or domain) authentication process. Example modules include an LDAP-compliant authentication module, a network authentication module, and an operating system-based authentication module.","In some embodiments, the second heterogeneous authentication system  is an authentication system incorporated into the Unisys OS 2200 operating system, provided by Unisys Corporation of Blue Bell, Pa. Other types of operating systems or authentication systems could be used as well.","A centralized authentication system  is configured to receive the domain user credentials from the second heterogeneous authentication system , for example to authenticate the domain user. The centralized authentication system  generally corresponds to directory authentication system , in that it is configured to provide a remote domain or network authentication service to the first and second systems , . In certain embodiments, the centralized authentication system  operates using the Active Directory service from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. or some other similar centralized authentication system, and can provide LDAP-based or other domain-based or network-based authentication.","The centralized authentication system  is configured to return a confirmation of authorization of the user based on the domain user credentials, or a notification of a failed authorization. If a confirmation of authorization is returned, the second heterogeneous authentication system  then recognizes that the user is an authorized user within the domain, and transmits the domain username to a security database . The security database  is associated with the second heterogeneous authentication system , and includes associated local usernames and domain usernames (and optionally domain identifiers). The security database  provides in response to the domain username a local username that is used both by the second heterogeneous authentication system  and the first authentication system . The second heterogeneous authentication system  is configured to return the local username from the security database  to the first authentication system , which uses that local username, alongside any confirmation of authentication necessary to indicate to the first authentication system that the centralized authentication was successful. Since the first authentication system  then knows that the user has already been authenticated by the second heterogeneous authentication system , the local username is simply validated against any other information associated with that user account in a local database , for example identified department information received from the remote system .","Through use of this arrangement of authentication systems, a remote user can access an application or other software system associated with a first authentication system without that system having control over either a username or password of that remote user. Local username management can be controlled by a second heterogeneous authentication system  and passed to the first authentication system , and password authentication can occur in a centralized authentication system , allowing for network-level or domain-level user authentication. The second authentication system  will only provide the local username to the first authentication system  if it receives notification of authentication from the external authentication system , thereby controlling access to the software application associated with the first authentication system .","It is recognized that, in the context of the system , the external authentication system  implements authentication standards acceptable to the second heterogeneous authentication system , which in turn supplies credentials and is \u201ctrusted\u201d to authenticate users on behalf of the first authentication system . The centralized authentication system  preferably implements a set of standards, including password strength, password update frequency, and optionally naming conventions that comply with those of the first and second authentication systems , , so that security is not weakened through remote access via domain-based authentication.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":"204"},"In the embodiment shown, the user configuration information can be stored in a local database , as illustrated in . The local database contains local user information  and a domain name login (\u201cDNL\u201d) report . The local user information includes a listing of local usernames (e.g., usernames associated with and managed by either the first or second authentication systems , ). The local user information  also optionally contains information used to define that user's access to information within the application associated with the authentication system . In some embodiments, that additional information can include an identifier of a department or departments associated with that user. Other information could be used as well.","The domain name login report  includes information regarding expected domain or network names that may be used for authentication, as well as optional default information for handling a login or authentication request defining an unknown domain name. When the first authentication system  detects a domain username received from a remote system (e.g., remote system  of ), the domain name login report  is accessed to determine the manner in which authentication is to be accomplished. For example, the domain name login report  can include a correlation between specific domains and identifiers of various interface modules included in an authentication interface, such as API  of , that defines whether the authentication is to be performed, for example, at a separate heterogeneous authentication system (e.g., authentication system  of , or operating system authentication system  of ), or at a centralized (e.g., network or domain name) authentication system, such as centralized authentication system  of  or domain authentication system  of . Other types of authentication modules could be used as well, to support various different types of authentication.","In addition to the local user information  and the domain name login report , additional information could be included in the local database . For example, the local database  can include additional files or tables correlating a local operating system username to an application username and department, thereby allowing the local operating system and application to operate using different naming conventions. Other types of information could be used as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-3"],"b":["400","400","400"]},"The method  is instantiated at a start operation , which generally corresponds to an access attempt for accessing a server application or other process associated with a first authentication system. The method includes a credential receipt operation  in which domain user credentials (e.g., a domain username and a domain password) are received at a first authentication system. The first authentication system can be, for example a local authentication system associated with the server application being accessed by a remote user. Optionally, the credential receipt operation  further includes receipt of local information associated with the user, for example a department or other identifying characteristic of the user that defines that user's scope of rights within the local server application.","A transmission operation  corresponds to transmission of the domain user credentials from the first authentication system to a second authentication that is separate from, and separately managed from (i.e., is heterogeneous as compared to) the first authentication system. In some aspects, the second heterogeneous authentication system is an authentication system associated with an operating system within which the server application executes, or from which the server application requires access to resources (e.g., files or other data). The transmission operation  also optionally transmits an identifier of a particular module available in an authentication interface, for example to define the manner in which the domain user credentials are to be authenticated.","In certain embodiments, the second heterogeneous authentication system includes an authentication interface defining a number of modules to which the domain credentials are routed. An external transmission operation  transmits the domain user credentials from the second heterogeneous authentication system (optionally, from an identified interface module) to a centralized authentication system, such as an LDAP-based or domain-based authentication system.","An authentication receipt operation  corresponds to receipt of a confirmation message from the centralized authentication system indicating that the user identified by the domain user credentials is authenticated within the network or domain. A local authentication operation  transmits the domain username provided in the domain user credentials to a security database associated with the second heterogeneous authentication system, and receives in return a local username associated with the selected domain name and domain username that can be used for registration of the user within the systems associated with both the first and second authentication systems. In accordance with the present disclosure, it is recognized that each unique domain name and domain username is associated with a previously-established local username in the second heterogeneous authentication system (e.g., an operating system authentication system) for use with a local server application.","The local username is returned to the first authentication system, which registers the local user as authenticated at both the server application and operating system within which it is running (i.e., authenticated by both first and second heterogeneous authentication systems) at an authentication operation . Optionally, the department information received during the credential receipt operation  is used in connection with the local username to define a set of access rights to the server application. Additionally, optionally the server application can access username and department information specific to that server application, and correlate it to the local username, which in such cases represents a local operating system username. An end operation  corresponds to completed centralized (e.g., domain- or network-level) authentication of the remote user.","Referring now to  a flowchart of a method  for authenticating users in a local application is shown, according to a possible embodiment of the present disclosure. The method  generally illustrates an example of an overall authentication process that can include the remote domain-based or network-based login methodology of , but can be used to adapt to circumstances where a user may or may not be at a remote location, and may wish to authenticate him or herself either locally or on a domain\/network. Example systems within which the method  can be performed are described above in connection with .","The method  generally is instantiated by a start operation , which generally corresponds to initiation of an authentication process by a user, such as a local or remote user of a server application executing within the context of an operating system. A credential receipt operation  generally corresponds to the credential receipt operation  of , in that it corresponds to receipt of user credentials at an authentication system. In the context of , the credential receipt operation  corresponds to receipt of a username and password, and optionally additional information required to log in to a server application remote from the user.","In accordance with the present disclosure, the username and password received during the credential receipt operation  can take a number of forms. In one example, if a user is defined as a domain user, that user will enter his\/her domain username and domain password, which are predefined in a domain database. The user will, if remote from the server application, connect to the server application using a web-based portal or application-based program (e.g., a Java program). Analogously, a network name and password, LDAP-based name and password, or local username and password could be used. In some embodiments, the credential receipt operation  also receives local definition information, such as a local department associated with the user.","A domain username detection operation  determines whether the username received at the authentication system associated with the server application is a domain or network username. This can be accomplished, for example, by detecting the presence of a backslash (\u201c\\\u201d) character in the entered string associated with the username. If the username entered is not a domain or network username, a local login operation  submits the local username for authentication of the user with the server application, as well as with a local operating system within which the server application operates. It is assumed, in this case, that if the user has entered a local username, that same user will have provided a local password, which can be passed to the operating system for authentication as necessary.","If the username entered is a domain or network username, a domain user information operation  operating within the authentication system associated with the server application accesses information about the domain user, for example in a table associated with the DNL Report  of . This table specifies the specific module used by an authentication interface for authenticating the user. For example, a first module could be used for domain authentication, while a second module could be used for LDAP-based authentication, a third module could be used for another network authentication protocol\/system, and a further module could be used for local authentication.","A transmission operation  sends the authentication request information to an identified authentication interface based on the results of reading the table defined by the DNL Report. For example, the transmission operation can transmit the name of the domain, as well as the user's domain username and password, to the identified interface defined by API  of .","An authentication operation  authenticates that user based on the information passed to the identified authentication interface module. The authentication operation  provides for domain or other centralized authentication according to any of a variety of authentication protocols, using the supplied domain username and password, and addressed to the identified domain. If the authentication is successful, a message is returned to the authentication interface module indicating successful authentication. If the authentication is unsuccessful, the authentication interface module receives a failure notification, which it returns to the remote user via the first authentication system associated with the server application.","Assuming a successful centralized authentication, a local username operation  corresponds to the authentication system associated with the operating system accessing the security database (e.g., security database  of ) managed in the operating system to find a local username or user identifier. The local username or user identifier is associated with the network or domain username used by the authentication module in a listing or table in the security database containing local usernames or user identifiers and associated domain and domain username information. By performing a lookup of the domain and domain username information after obtaining the authentication message, the authentication system associated with the operating system can determine the local user that has been authenticated.","At this point, regardless of whether the user has provided local or domain authentication credentials, a local user authentication operation  can occur, and corresponds to validating a local username (either entered by the user and passed to the local authentication system by operation  or obtained from the security database by the local username operation ) and department to the authentication system associated with the server application. Upon receipt of confirmation of successful authentication of that user, an end operation  corresponds to completed authentication of the user within the server application, the operating system hosting that server application, and optionally also within the domain or network defined by that user's entered authentication credentials. Optionally, the end operation  can include transmitting a confirmation message regarding authentication to a remote user, for example via a web or network application in which the user entered his\/her credentials during the credential receipt operation .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 1-5","FIGS. 1-5"],"b":"600"},"In the example of , the computing device  includes a memory , a processing system , a secondary storage device , a network interface card , a video interface , a display unit , an external component interface , and a communication medium .
