{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The invention relates to processes for hydrocracking of hydrocarbon-containing feedstocks in which at least 50% by weight of the compounds have an initial boiling point above 340\u00b0 C. and a final boiling point below 540\u00b0 C. Preferably, the hydrocarbon-containing feedstock used in the process according to the invention is a feedstock of the vacuum distillate (VD) type.","The objective of the process according to the invention is essentially the production of middle distillates corresponding to kerosene and gas oil cuts, i.e. cuts having an initial boiling point of at least 150\u00b0 C. and a final boiling point of at most 370\u00b0 C., and preferably of at most 340\u00b0 C.","The hydrocracking of heavy petroleum cuts is a very important refining process that makes it possible to produce, starting from surplus heavy feedstocks for which there is little demand for upcycling, lighter fractions such as gasolines, kerosenes and light gas oils that are required by the refiner for adapting production to the structure of demand. Certain hydrocracking processes also make it possible to obtain a highly purified residue that can provide excellent bases for oils. With regard to catalytic cracking, the advantage of catalytic hydrocracking is that it provides middle distillates, kerosene and gas oil, of very good quality. Conversely, the gasoline produced has a much lower octane number than that resulting from catalytic cracking.","Hydrocracking is a process that owes its flexibility to three main elements which are: the operating conditions used, the types of catalysts used, and the fact that the hydrocracking of hydrocarbon-containing feedstocks can be carried out in one or two steps.","The composition and the use of the catalysts for the hydrotreating and hydrocracking of hydrocarbon-containing feedstocks are described in detail, respectively in the work \u201cHydrocracking Science and Technology\u201d, 1996, J. Scherzer, A. J. Gruia, Marcel Dekker Inc. and in the article by B. S. Clausen, H. T. Tops\u00f8e, F. E. Massoth, which appeared in the work \u201cCatalysis Science and Technology\u201d, 1996, volume 11, Springer-Verlag. Thus, the catalysts used in the hydrocracking processes, whether they are intended for hydrotreating or hydrocracking reactions, are generally characterized by a hydrogenating-dehydrogenating function supplied by the presence of an active phase based on at least one metal of group VIB and\/or at least one metal of group VIII of the periodic table. The commonest formulations are of the type cobalt-molybdenum (CoMo), nickel-molybdenum (NiMo) and nickel-tungsten (NiW). These catalysts can be in bulk form (applies specifically to hydrotreating catalysts) or supported, in that case using a porous solid of a different nature. In the latter case, the porous support is generally an amorphous or poorly crystallized oxide (alumina, aluminosilicate, etc.) optionally combined with a zeolitic or a non-zeolitic material. After preparation, at least one group VIB metal and\/or at least one group VIII metal that are constituents of said catalysts is\/are often in the oxide form. As the active, stable form for the hydrocracking and hydrotreating processes is the sulphurized form, these catalysts must undergo a sulphurizing step. The latter can be carried out in the unit of the process in question (and is then called in-situ sulphurizing) or prior to loading the catalyst into the unit (and is then called ex-situ sulphurizing).","In the particular case of hydrocracking catalysts, these are all of the bifunctional type, combining an acid function with the hydrogenating-dehydrogenating function described above. The acid function is supplied by supports, the surface areas of which generally vary from 150 to 800 m\u00b7gand display superficial acidity, such as halogenated aluminas (in particular chlorinated or fluorinated), combinations of oxides of boron and of aluminium, amorphous or crystalline mesoporous aluminosilicates, and zeolites. The equilibrium between the two functions, acidic and hydrogenating-dehydrogenating, is one of the parameters determining the activity and selectivity of the hydrocracking catalysts. A weak acid function and a strong hydrogenating-dehydrogenating function give catalysts of low activity, generally operating at a high temperature, preferably greater than or equal to 390 or 400\u00b0 C. and with a low feed space velocity or HSV, expressed in volume of feedstock to be treated per unit volume of catalyst per hour, and preferably less than or equal to 2, but having very good selectivity for middle distillates. Conversely, a strong acid function and a weak hydrogenating-dehydrogenating function give catalysts that are active, but have lower selectivities for middle distillates (kerosene and gas oil). One type of conventional hydrocracking catalysts is based on moderately acidic amorphous supports, such as mesoporous aluminosilicates for example. These systems are used for producing middle distillates of good quality and, optionally, oil bases. These catalysts are used for example in the single-step processes.","It is generally known to a person skilled in the art that good catalytic performance in the fields of application mentioned above depends on 1) the nature of the hydrocarbon-containing feedstock to be treated, 2) the process used, 3) the operative operating conditions selected and 4) the catalyst used. In the latter case, it is also assumed that a catalyst with a strong catalytic potential is characterized 1) by an optimized hydrogenating-dehydrogenating function (associated active phase perfectly dispersed on the surface of the support and having a high metal content) and 2) in the particular case of processes employing hydrocracking reactions, by a good balance between said hydrogenating-dehydrogenating function and the cracking function as mentioned above. It should also be noted that, ideally, whatever the nature of the hydrocarbon-containing feedstock to be treated, the catalyst must be able to offer accessibility of the active sites for the reactants and reaction products while developing a high active surface area, which leads to specific constraints in terms of intrinsic structure and texture of the oxide support that is a component of said catalysts.","The usual methods for forming the hydrogenating-dehydrogenating phase of the hydrotreating and hydrocracking catalysts consist of depositing molecular precursor(s) of at least one group VIB metal and\/or at least one group VIII metal on an oxide support by the so-called \u201cdry impregnation\u201d technique followed by the steps of maturation, drying and calcination leading to the formation of the oxidized form of said metal(s) used. This is followed by the final step of sulphurizing, which generates the active hydrogenating-dehydrogenating phase as mentioned above.","The catalytic performance of catalysts resulting from these \u201cconventional\u201d synthesis protocols has been investigated extensively. In particular, it has been shown that, for relatively high metal contents, phases appear that are refractory to sulphurization, formed as a consequence of the calcination step (sintering phenomenon) (B. S. Clausen, H. T. Tops\u00f8e, and F. E. Massoth, from the work \u201cCatalysis Science and Technology\u201d, 1996, volume 11, Springer-Verlag). For example, in the case of catalysts of the CoMo or NiMo type supported on a support of an alumina nature, they are 1) crystallites of MoO, NiO, CoO, CoMoOor CoO, of sufficient size to be detected with XRD, and\/or 2) species of the type Al(MoO), CoAlOor NiAlO. The above three species containing the element aluminium are well known to a person skilled in the art. They result from the interaction between the alumina support and the precursor salts in solution of the active hydrogenating-dehydrogenating phase, which is reflected in concrete terms by a reaction between Al ions extracted from the alumina matrix and said salts to form Anderson heteropolyanions of formula [Al(OH)MoO], which are themselves precursors of the phases that are refractory to sulphurization. The presence of all of these species leads to a not inconsiderable indirect loss of catalytic activity of the associated catalyst because all of the elements belonging to at least one group VIB metal and\/or at least one group VIII metal are not used to the maximum of their potential since a proportion of the latter is immobilized in species with little or no activity.","The catalytic performance of the conventional catalysts described above could therefore be improved, in particular by developing new methods for preparing these catalysts that would make it possible to:","1) ensure a good dispersion of the hydrogenating-dehydrogenating phase, in particular for high metal contents (for example by controlling the size of the particles based on transition metals, maintaining the properties of these particles after thermal treatment, etc.),","2) limit the formation of species refractory to sulphurization (for example by obtaining better synergy between the transition metals constituting the active phase, controlling the interactions between the active hydrogenating-dehydrogenating phase (and\/or its precursors) and the porous support used, etc.),","3) ensure a good diffusion of the reactants and the reaction products while maintaining high developed active surface areas (optimization of the chemical, textural and structural properties of the porous support).","The applicant's research therefore led him to prepare hydrocracking catalysts by modifying the chemical and structural composition of the metallic species that are the precursors of the active phases and thus modifying the interactions between the support and the active phase of the catalyst and\/or its oxide precursors. In particular, the applicant's research led him to use polyoxometallates the formula of which is explained below as particular oxide precursors of the active phase of the catalysts used in the process for the hydrocracking hydrocarbon-containing feedstocks according to the invention.","Moreover, since the oxide support of the catalyst plays a not inconsiderable role in the development of high-performance hydrocracking catalysts, in that it will induce changes in the interactions between the support and the active phase of said catalyst and\/or its oxide precursors, the applicant also directed his research towards the preparation of hydrocracking catalysts using oxide supports having particular textural properties.","The applicant has therefore demonstrated that a catalyst comprising, in its oxide form, at least one active phase precursor in the form of at least one polyoxometallate of formula (HXMO) explained below, trapped within a mesostructured oxide matrix serving as support, displayed an improved catalytic activity relative to catalysts prepared from standard precursors not containing polyoxometallates, said catalyst being sulphurized and then used in a process for the hydrocracking of at least one hydrocarbon-containing feedstock in which the compounds have boiling points between 340\u00b0 C. and 540\u00b0 C.","An objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the hydrocracking of at least one hydrocarbon-containing feedstock in which at least 50% by weight of the compounds have an initial boiling point above 340\u00b0 C. and a final boiling point below 540\u00b0 C. and in particular of a feedstock of the vacuum distillate type, using a catalyst displaying improved catalytic performance.","The invention relates to a process for the hydrocracking of at least one hydrocarbon-containing feedstock in which at least 50% by weight of the compounds have an initial boiling point above 340\u00b0 C. and a final boiling point below 540\u00b0 C., using a catalyst comprising, in its oxide form, at least one metal selected from the metals of group VIB, the metals of group VIII and the metals of group VB of the periodic table, used alone or in a mixture, said metals being present in the form of at least one polyoxometallate of formula (HXMO) in which X is an element selected from phosphorus (P), silicon (Si), boron (B), nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co), said element being used alone, M is one or more element(s) selected from vanadium (v), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co), O is oxygen, H is hydrogen, h is an integer comprised between 0 and 12, x is an integer comprised between 0 and 4, m is an integer equal to 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 or 18, y is an integer comprised between 17 and 72 and q is an integer comprised between 1 and 20, said polyoxometallates being present within a mesostructured matrix based on the oxide of at least one element Y selected from the group constituted by silicon, aluminium, titanium, zirconium, gallium, and cerium and a mixture of at least one of these elements, said matrix having a pore size between 1.5 and 50 nm and having amorphous walls of thickness comprised between 1 and 30 nm, said catalyst being sulphurized before being used in said process.","One of the advantages of the present invention is that it uses, in a process for the hydrocracking of at least one hydrocarbon-containing feedstock in which at least 50% by weight of the compounds have an initial boiling point above 340\u00b0 C. and a final boiling point below 540\u00b0 C., a catalyst having simultaneously the specific catalytic properties due to the presence of polyoxometallates and the textural and surface properties of a mesostructured oxide matrix in which said polyoxometallates are trapped. This results in innovative properties and interactions between said polyoxometallates and the mesostructured inorganic network of said matrix. These interactions are reflected in increased conversion of products boiling at a temperature above 340\u00b0 C. into products boiling at a temperature below 340\u00b0 C. and\/or in increased hydrodesulphurization (HDS), hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and hydrodemetallation (HDM). This is due in particular to better dispersion of the active phase through the use of a mesostructured oxide matrix in which the polyoxometallates are trapped.","Feedstocks","Very varied feedstocks can be treated by the hydrocracking processes according to the invention. The feedstock used in the hydrocracking process according to the invention is a hydrocarbon-containing feedstock in which at least 50% by weight of the compounds have an initial boiling point above 340\u00b0 C. and a final boiling point below 540\u00b0 C., preferably in which at least 60% by weight, preferably in which at least 75% by weight and more preferably in which at least 80% by weight of the compounds have an initial boiling point above 340\u00b0 C. and a final boiling point below 540\u00b0 C.","Advantageously, said hydrocarbon-containing feedstock is selected from vacuum distillates or VD, the effluents originating from a catalytic cracking unit FCC (Fluid Catalytic Cracking), the light gas oils originating from a catalytic cracking unit (or LCO for Light Cycle Oil), the heavy fraction oils (HCO for Heavy Cycle Oil), the paraffinic effluents originating from Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, the effluents originating from vacuum distillation, such as for example gas oil fractions of the VGO (Vacuum Gas Oil) type, the effluents originating from a coal liquefaction process, feedstocks originating from biomass or the effluents derived from the conversion of feedstocks originating from biomass, and the aromatic extracts and the feedstocks obtained from units for the extraction of aromatics, used alone or in a mixture.","Preferably, said hydrocarbon-containing feedstock is a vacuum distillate cut. The vacuum distillate cut generally originates from the vacuum distillation of crude oil. Said vacuum distillate cut comprises aromatic compounds, olefinic compounds, naphthenic compounds and\/or paraffinic compounds.","Said vacuum distillate cut advantageously comprises heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, sulphur and a mixture of these two elements. When nitrogen is present in said feedstock to be treated, the nitrogen content is greater than or equal to 500 ppm, preferably said content is between 500 and 10000 ppm by weight, more preferably between 700 and 4000 ppm by weight and even more preferably between 1000 and 4000 ppm. When sulphur is present in said feedstock to be treated, the sulphur content is between 0.01 and 5% by weight, preferably between 0.2 and 4% by weight and even more preferably between 0.5 and 3% by weight.","Advantageously, said vacuum distillate cut can optionally contain metals, in particular nickel and vanadium. The cumulative content of nickel and vanadium in said vacuum distillate cut is preferably less than 1 ppm by weight. The content of asphaltenes in said hydrocarbon-containing feedstock is generally below 3000 ppm, preferably below 1000 ppm, even more preferably below 200 ppm.","In a preferred embodiment, said hydrocarbon-containing feedstock of the vacuum distillate type or VD can be used as it is, i.e. alone or mixed with other hydrocarbon cuts, preferably selected from the effluents originating from a catalytic cracking unit FCC (Fluid Catalytic Cracking), light gas oils originating from a catalytic cracking unit (or LCO for Light Cycle Oil), heavy fraction oils (HCO for Heavy Cycle Oil), the atmospheric residues and vacuum residues originating from atmospheric and vacuum distillation of crude oil, the paraffinic effluents originating from Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, the effluents originating from vacuum distillation, for example gas oil fractions of the VGO type (Vacuum Gas Oil), the deasphalted oils or DAO, the effluents originating from a coal liquefaction process, the feedstocks originating from biomass or the effluents derived from the conversion of feedstocks originating from biomass, and the aromatic extracts and the feedstocks originating from units for the extraction of aromatics, used alone or in a mixture.","In the preferred case when said hydrocarbon-containing feedstock of the vacuum distillate type or VD is used mixed with other hydrocarbon-containing cuts, said hydrocarbon-containing cuts, added alone or in a mixture, are present at max. 50% by weight of said mixture, preferably at max. 40% by weight, preferably at max. 30% by weight and more preferably at max. 20% by weight of said mixture.","According to the invention, the catalyst used in said process for the hydrocracking of at least said hydrocarbon-containing feedstock comprises in its oxide form, i.e. before undergoing a sulphurizing step generating the sulphurized active phase, at least one metal selected from the metals of group VIB, the metals of group VIII and the metals of group VB of the periodic table, used alone or in a mixture, said metals being present in the form of at least one polyoxometallate of formula (HXMO) explained above, said polyoxometallates being present within a mesostructured oxide matrix.","More precisely, said polyoxometallates present within said matrix are trapped in the walls of said matrix. Said polyoxometallates therefore are not simply deposited for example by impregnation on the surface of the pores of said matrix but are located right inside the walls of said matrix.","The particular location of said polyoxometallates right inside the walls of said mesostructured oxide matrix permits a better interaction between said matrix serving as support and the active phase and\/or its oxide precursors comprising said polyoxometallates. This also results in better maintenance of the textural and structural properties of the mesostructured oxide matrices, improved maintenance of the structure of said polyoxometallate and preferably of said heteropolyanion after post-treatment of the final solid, as well as improvement in the dispersion, heat resistance and chemical resistance of said polyoxometallate.","Although a misuse of language, the polyoxometallates used according to the invention are defined hereinafter as the compounds corresponding to the formula (HXMO) in which X is an element selected from phosphorus (P), silicon (Si), boron (B), nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co), said element being used alone, M is one or more element(s) selected from vanadium (v), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co), O is oxygen, H is hydrogen, h is an integer comprised between 0 and 12, x is an integer comprised between 0 and 4, m is an integer equal to 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 or 18, y is an integer comprised between 17 and 72 and q is an integer comprised between 1 and 20.","Preferably, element M cannot be a nickel atom or a cobalt atom alone.","The polyoxometallates defined according to the invention include two families of compounds, the isopolyanions and the heteropolyanions. These two families of compounds are defined in the article Heteropoly and Isopoly Oxometallates, Pope, Publ Springer-Verlag, 1983.","The isopolyanions that can be used in the present invention are polyoxometallates of general formula (HXMO) in which x=0, the other elements having the meaning given above.","Preferably, the m atoms M of said isopolyanions are either only molybdenum atoms, or only tungsten atoms, or only group VB atoms selected from vanadium (V), niobium (Nb) and tantalum (Ta), or a mixture of a molybdenum and a vanadium atom (MoV), or a mixture of a niobium and a tungsten atom (NbW).","The m atoms M of said isopolyanions can also advantageously be either a mixture of nickel, molybdenum and tungsten atoms or a mixture of cobalt, molybdenum and tungsten atoms.","Preferably, in the case where element M is molybdenum (Mo), m is equal to 7. Moreover, preferably, in the case where element M is tungsten (W), m is equal to 12.","The isopolyanions MoO and HWO are advantageously used as active phase precursors in the context of the invention.","Said isopolyanions are advantageously formed by reaction of the oxoanions of the type MO with one another. For example, the molybdic compounds are well known for reactions of this kind, since depending on the pH, the molybdic compound in solution can be in the form MoO or in the form of an isopolyanion of formula MoO, which is obtained according to the reaction: 7MoO+8H\u2192MoO+4HO. In the case of the isopolyanions in which M is a tungsten atom, potential acidification of the reaction mixture, through causing the formation of tungstates WO, can result in generating \u03b1-metatungstate, 12 times condensed according to the following reaction: 12WO+18H\u2192HWO+8HO.","The heteropolyanions that can be used in the present invention are polyoxometallates of formula (HXMO) in which x=1, 2, 3 or 4, the other elements having the meaning given above.","The heteropolyanions generally have a structure in which element X is the \u201ccentral\u201d atom and element M is a metal atom, nearly always in octahedral coordination with X\u2260M.","Preferably, the m atoms M are either only molybdenum atoms, or only tungsten atoms, (or only group VB atoms selected from vanadium (V), niobium (Nb) and tantalum (Ta), or a mixture of molybdenum and cobalt atoms (CoMo), or a mixture of molybdenum and nickel (NiMo), or a mixture of tungsten and molybdenum atoms (MoW), or a mixture of tungsten and nickel atoms (NiW). Preferably, the m atoms M are either only molybdenum atoms, or a mixture of molybdenum and cobalt atoms, or one or a mixture of molybdenum and nickel (NiMo). Preferably, the m atoms M cannot be only nickel atoms, nor only cobalt atoms.","Among the m atoms M of said heteropolyanions, the group VIII elements are partially replaced with group VIB elements and\/or with group VB elements.","In particular, in the case where the m atoms M are either a mixture of molybdenum and cobalt atoms, or a mixture of molybdenum and nickel, or a mixture of tungsten and cobalt atoms, or a mixture of tungsten and nickel atoms, the cobalt and nickel atoms are partially replaced with molybdenum and tungsten atoms and preferably with molybdenum atoms. Preferably, element X is at least one phosphorus atom.","The heteropolyanions are advantageously obtained by polycondensation of oxoanions of the type MO, in the case where M is a molybdenum or tungsten atom, around one or more oxoanion(s) of the type XO in which the charge q is dictated by the octet rule and the position of the element X in the periodic table. There is then elimination of water molecules and creation of oxo bridges between the atoms. These condensation reactions are governed by various experimental factors such as the pH, the concentration of the species in solution, the nature of the solvent, and the m\/x ratio, which is the ratio of the number of atoms of element M to the number of atoms of element X.","The heteropolyanions are negatively charged polyoxometallate species. In order to compensate these negative charges, it is necessary to introduce counter-ions and more particularly cations. These cations can advantageously be protons H, or any other cation of the NH type or metal cations and in particular metal cations of group VIII metals.","In the case where the counter-ions are protons, the molecular structure comprising the heteropolyanion and at least one proton constitutes a heteropolyacid. The heteropolyacids that can be used as active phase precursors in the present invention can be for example phosphomolybdic acid (3H.PMoO) or phosphotungstic acid (3H.PWO).","In the case where the counter-ions are not protons, this molecular structure is then called a heteropolyanion salt. It is then possible, advantageously, to benefit from the association within the same molecular structure, via the use of a heteropolyanion salt, of metal M and of its promoter, i.e. of the element cobalt and\/or of the element nickel which can either be in position X within the structure of the heteropolyanion, or partially substituted with at least one atom M of molybdenum and\/or of tungsten within the structure of the heteropolyanion or in the position of a counter-ion.","Preferably, the polyoxometallates used according to the invention are the compounds corresponding to the formula (HXMO) in which X is an element selected from phosphorus (P), silicon (Si), boron (B), nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co), said element being used alone, M is one or more element(s) selected from vanadium (V), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co), O is oxygen, H is hydrogen, h is an integer comprised between 0 and 6, x is an integer that can be equal to 0, 1 or 2, m is an integer equal to 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11 or 12, y is an integer comprised between 17 and 48 and q is an integer comprised between 3 and 12.","Depending on the desired type of catalyst, non exhaustively and as an example, polyoxometallates combining within their structure an active phase based on cobalt and molybdenum (systems CoMo), nickel and molybdenum (NiMo systems), nickel and tungsten (NiW), molybdenum and vanadium (MoV system), nickel, molybdenum and vanadium (NiMoV systems), phosphorus and molybdenum (PMo), silicon and molybdenum (SiMo), can advantageously be used.","More preferably, the polyoxometallates used according to the invention are the compounds corresponding to the formula (HXMO) in which h is an integer equal to 0, 1, 4 or 6, x is an integer equal to 0, 1 or 2, m is an integer equal to 5, 6, 10 or 12, y is an integer equal to 23, 24, 38 or 40 and q is an integer equal to 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8, X, M, H and O having the meaning given above.","The preferred polyoxometallates used according to the invention are advantageously selected from the polyoxometallates of formula PVMoO, PVMoO, PVMoO and PVMoO, HPNiMoO, PMoO, NiMoOH, NiMoOH, PMoO, PWO and PMoWO with z being between 1 and 11. The most preferred polyoxometallates used according to the invention are advantageously selected from the polyoxometallates of formula PVMoO, PVMoO, PVMoO and PVMoO, HPNiMoO, PMoO, NiMoOH, NiMoOH, PMoO, PWO and PMoWO, PMoWO, used alone or in a mixture.","The preferred polyoxometallates that can advantageously be used as active phase precursors of the catalyst used in the process according to the invention are the so-called Anderson heteropolyanions of general formula XMO for which the m\/x ratio is equal to 6 and in which the elements X and M and the charge q have the meaning given above. Element X is therefore an element selected from phosphorus (P), silicon (Si), boron (B), nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co), said element being used alone, M is one or more element(s) selected from vanadium (V), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co), and q is an integer comprised between 1 and 20 and preferably between 3 and 12.","The particular structure of said so-called Anderson heteropolyanions is described in the article Nature, 1937, 150, 850. The structure of said so-called Anderson heteropolyanions comprises 7 octahedra located in one and the same plane and joined together by the edges: out of the 7 octahedra, 6 octahedra surround the central octahedron containing element X.","The Anderson heteropolyanions containing cobalt and molybdenum or nickel and molybdenum within their structure are preferred. The Anderson heteropolyanions of formula CoMoOH and NiMoOH are particularly preferred. According to the formula, in these Anderson heteropolyanions, the cobalt and nickel atoms are respectively the heteroelements X of the structure.","In fact, said heteropolyanions combine molybdenum and cobalt or molybdenum and nickel in the same structure. In particular, the latter make it possible, when they are in the form of cobalt salts or nickel salts, to reach an atomic ratio of said promoter to the metal M and in particular an atomic ratio (Co and\/or Ni)\/Mo between 0.4 and 0.6. This ratio of said promoter (Co and\/or Ni)\/Mo between 0.4 and 0.6 is particularly preferred for maximizing the performance of the hydrotreating and in particular hydrodesulphurization catalysts used in the process according to the invention.","In the case where the Anderson heteropolyanion contains cobalt and molybdenum within its structure, a mixture of the two forms, monomeric of formula CoMoOH and dimeric of formula CoMoOH of said heteropolyanion, the two forms being in equilibrium, can advantageously be used. In the case where the Anderson heteropolyanion contains cobalt and molybdenum within its structure, said Anderson heteropolyanion is preferably dimeric of formula CoMoOH.","In the case where the Anderson heteropolyanion contains nickel and molybdenum within its structure, a mixture of the two forms, monomeric of formula NiMoOH and dimeric of formula NiMoOH of said heteropolyanion, the two forms being in equilibrium, can advantageously be used.

Rev., 2002, 102, 4093) at low temperature via the coexistence in aqueous solution or in solvents with marked polarity, of inorganic precursors with structure-forming agents, generally ionic or neutral molecular or supramolecular surfactants. Control of the electrostatic or hydrogen bonding interactions between the inorganic precursors and the structure-forming agent jointly linked with hydrolysis\/condensation reactions of the inorganic precursor leads to a cooperative assembly of the organic and inorganic phases generating micellar aggregates of surfactants of controlled, uniform size within an inorganic matrix. This phenomenon of cooperative self-assembly governed by, among other things, the concentration of structure-forming agent can be induced by gradual evaporation of a solution of reactants whose concentration of structure-forming agent is below the critical micellar concentration, or via precipitation or direct gelling of the solid when using a solution of precursors with higher concentration of reactants.","The porosity is then released by removing the surfactant, which is carried out conventionally by methods of chemical extraction or by thermal treatment.","Depending on the nature of the inorganic precursors and of the structure-forming agent used as well as the operating conditions applied, several families of mesostructured materials have been developed.

In fact, the transformation of at least one polyoxometallate trapped in the mesostructured oxide matrix into its associated sulphurized active phase is advantageously carried out by sulphurization, i.e. by a thermal treatment of said matrix in contact with a sulphur-containing organic compound that is decomposable and generates HS or directly in contact with a gaseous stream of HS diluted in Hat a temperature comprised between 200 and 600\u00b0 C. and preferably comprised between 300 and 500\u00b0 C. according to methods well known to a person skilled in the art. More precisely, sulphurization is carried out 1) in a unit of the process itself by means of the feedstock to be treated in the presence of hydrogen and of hydrogen sulphide (HS) introduced as it is or resulting from the decomposition of a sulphur-containing organic compound, which is called in-situ sulphurization or 2) prior to loading the catalyst into the unit, it is then called ex-situ sulphurization. In the case of ex-situ sulphurization, gas mixtures can advantageously be used such as the mixtures H\/HS or N\/HS.

Low-temperature decomposition, i.e. at a temperature comprised between 80 and 90\u00b0 C., of said sulphur-containing precursors, either during the maturation step c) or during the autoclaving step d), leads to the formation of HS, thus permitting sulphurization of said polyoxometallates.","According to another preferred embodiment, partial or complete sulphurization of said polyoxometallates can advantageously be carried out by introduction of said sulphur-containing precursors in step g) of partial or complete regeneration of said polyoxometallates trapped in said mesostructured oxide matrix of the catalyst used in the invention.","The hydrocracking process according to the invention is advantageously carried out in the presence of one or more hydrocracking catalyst(s) described according to the invention in one or more reaction unit(s) equipped with one or more reactor(s). The hydrocracking process according to the invention can advantageously be implemented in one or more fixed bed reactor(s) or in one or more ebullating bed reactor(s).","A preliminary step of hydrotreating or hydrorefining said hydrocarbon-containing feedstock is advantageously implemented in the hydrocracking process according to the invention upstream of at least one hydrocracking catalyst described according to the invention and permitting hydrocracking of the feedstock. Said step of hydrotreating or hydrorefining makes it possible to reduce the content of sulphur, nitrogen and oxygenated compounds present in the feedstock to be treated before said feedstock is brought into contact with the hydrocracking catalyst, located downstream so as to avoid its deactivation.","At least one hydrotreating or hydrorefining catalyst can advantageously be used in said preliminary step of hydrotreating or of hydrorefining. Said hydrotreating or hydrorefining catalyst, alone or in combination with another conventional hydrorefining catalyst, located upstream of the catalyst described according to the invention used in the hydrocracking process according to the invention, advantageously comprises at least one group VIII element and\/or at least one group VIB element and optionally at least one doping element selected from phosphorus, boron and silicon and an alumina or silica-alumina support.","In a preferred embodiment, said catalyst described according to the invention is advantageously used in said preliminary step of hydrotreating or hydrorefining, said catalyst used in said preliminary step of hydrotreating or hydrorefining being able to be identical to or different from that used in the hydrocracking process according to the invention located downstream and said catalyst preferably being different.","In the preferred case where said catalyst described according to the invention is advantageously used in said preliminary step of hydrotreating or of hydrorefining, said catalyst comprises a mesostructured matrix constituted by silicon oxide.","In a preferred embodiment, the hydrocracking process according to the invention is implemented in a so-called one-step process. So-called \u201cone-step\u201d hydrocracking generally comprises firstly a deep hydrorefining for the purpose of deep hydrodenitrogenation and deep hydrodesulphurization of the feedstock before the latter is sent onto the hydrocracking catalyst(s). This deep hydrorefining of the feedstock only leads to limited conversion of the feedstock, into lighter fractions, which remains insufficient and must therefore be completed on the more active hydrocracking catalyst(s). However, no separation of the effluents occurs between the two types of catalysts: all of the effluent leaving the hydrorefining catalyst bed is injected onto the catalyst bed(s) containing said catalyst(s) and it is only then that the products formed are separated. So-called \u201cone-step\u201d hydrocracking has a variant with recycling of the unconverted fraction to at least one of the hydrocracking catalyst beds for deeper conversion of the feedstock.","In another preferred embodiment, the hydrocracking process according to the invention is implemented in a so-called two-step process. So-called \u201ctwo-step\u201d hydrocracking comprises a first step with the aim, as in the \u201cone-step\u201d process, of carrying out hydrorefining of the feedstock, but also of reaching a conversion of the latter generally of the order of 40 to 60%. The effluent originating from the first hydrorefining step then undergoes separation, generally by distillation, generally called intermediate separation, the aim of which is to separate the products of conversion from the unconverted fraction. In the second step of the two-step hydrocracking process, only the fraction of the feedstock that was not converted in the first step is treated. This separation allows the two-step hydrocracking process to be more selective for middle distillate (kerosene+diesel) than the one-step process. In fact, intermediate separation of the products of conversion avoids \u201cover-cracking\u201d them to naphtha and gases in the second step on the hydrocracking catalyst(s) obtained according to the method of preparation described above in the present description.","Operating Conditions","The hydrocracking process according to the invention is implemented under operating conditions (temperature, pressure, degree of hydrogen recycling, hourly space velocity) that can be very variable depending on the nature of the feedstock, the quality of the desired products and the plant at the refiner's disposal.

By mild hydrocracking is meant hydrocracking leading to moderate conversions, preferably below 40%, and operating at low pressure, preferably comprised between 2 MPa and 10 MPa.
