The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to sulfonated polymer compositions which are suitable in particular for producing polymer electrolyte membranes, electrodes and membrane electrode assemblies for use in fuel cells, in high-performance capacitors, in dialysis equipment and in ultrafiltration and methods of synthesizing polymer compositions. More specifically, the present invention relates to sulfonated polyphenylene polymers, methods of making the same and the use of a sulfonated polyphenylene polymer composition as a polymer electrolyte membrane in hydrogen fuel cells and direct methanol fuel cells and in electrode casting solutions and electrodes.","Polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) have great potential as an environmentally friendly energy source. Fuel cells are electrochemical energy converters which feature in particular a high level of efficiency. Among the various types of fuel cells, PEFCs feature high power density and a low weight to power ratio. The PEFC uses as its electrolyte a polymer membrane.","Fuel cells are electrochemical cells in which a free energy change resulting from a fuel oxidation reaction is converted into electrical energy. Fuel cells are attractive electrical power sources, due to their higher energy efficiency and environmental compatibility compared to the internal combustion engine. The most well-known fuel cells are those using a gaseous fuel (such as hydrogen) with a gaseous oxidant (usually pure oxygen or atmospheric oxygen), and those fuel cells using direct feed organic fuels such as methanol.","The polymer electrolyte membrane or proton exchange membrane (PEM) is an important aspect of any PEFC. PEMs are an excellent conductor of hydrogen ions. The most widely used materials to date consist of a fluorocarbon polymer backbone, similar to Teflon\u00ae, to which are attached sulfonic acid groups. The acid molecules are fixed to the polymer and cannot \u201cleak\u201d out, but the protons on these acid groups are free to migrate through the membrane. With the solid polymer electrolyte, electrolyte loss is not an issue with regard to stack life. The potential power generated by a fuel cell stack depends on the number and size of the individual fuel cells that comprise the stack and the surface area of the PEM.","In many fuel cells, the anode and\/or cathode comprise a layer of electrically conductive, catalytically active particles (usually in a polymeric binder). A polymer electrolyte membrane is sandwiched between an anode and cathode, and the three components are sealed together to produce a single membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The anode and cathode are prepared by applying a small amount of a catalyst for example platinum (Pt) or ruthenium-platinum (Ru\/Pt) in a polymeric binding to a surface that will be in contact with the PEM. Preparation of catalyst electrodes has traditionally been achieved by preparing an ink consisting of an electrocatalyst (either Pt or Ru\/Pt), Nafion\u00ae polymer (5% wt. solution dispersed in lower alcohol). The ink is applied to porous carbon paper using a painting technique or directly depositing the ink upon the membrane surface or pressing it upon the membrane like a decal.","A MEA of a hydrogen fuel cell typically accepts hydrogen from a fuel gas stream that is consumed at the anode, yielding electrons to the anode and producing hydrogen ions which enter the electrolyte. The polymer electrolyte membrane allows only the hydrogen ions to pass through it to the cathode while the electrons must travel along an external circuit to the cathode thereby creating an electrical current. At the cathode, oxygen combined with electrons from the cathode and hydrogen ions from the electrolyte to produce water. The water does not dissolve in the electrolyte and is, instead, rejected from the back of the cathode into the oxidant gas stream.","For the last 30 years the industry standard for the PEM component of a hydrogen or methanol fuel cell has been membranes based on fluorine-containing polymers, for example the Nafion\u00ae material marketed by DuPont.","Nafion material is a perfluorinated sulfonic acid polymers having the following structure",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"19.64mm","wi":"54.78mm","file":"US07301002-20071127-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":"\u22122 "},"The Nafion\u00ae membranes display adequate proton conductivity, chemical resistance, and mechanical strength. Some of the membranes disadvantages are reduced conductivity at high temperatures (>80\u00b0 C.), high methanol permeability in direct methanol fuel cells, relatively thick membranes and membrane dehydration at high elevated temperatures. Further, when Nafion\u00ae membranes are used at temperatures above 80\u00b0 C., they thermally deform. This deformation of the membrane prevents the Nafion\u00ae membrane from coming into sufficient contact with the electrode, thereby reducing fuel cell performance. Additionally, there is a need to reduce the costs associated with such membranes.","Another limitation of Nafion\u00ae membranes occurs in applications in methanol fuel cells. Nafion\u00ae membranes are permeable to methanol. Methanol crossover is inversely proportional to membrane thickness. Direct transport of the fuel (i.e. methanol) across the membrane to the cathode results in losses in efficiency.","Increasing the membrane thickness results in decreased methanol crossover. However, thicker membranes result in Ohmic losses and decreased fuel cell performance.","Membranes that decrease the rate of methanol crossover would allow the use of higher concentrations of methanol-water feed mixtures, which would increase catalyst efficiency, direct methanol fuel cell power out put and potentially fuel utilization.","In general, increasing the operation temperature of fuel cells is advantageous for several reasons. Higher operating temperatures in methanol fuel cells decrease the carbon monoxide poisoning of the electrocatalyst. Higher temperatures increase reaction kinetics of hydrogen oxidation on the anode and oxygen reduction on the cathode. However, as the temperature is increased, it becomes more difficult to keep the membrane hydrated. Dehydration of membranes is exacerbated by relatively thick membranes. Dehydrated membranes lose ionic conductivity and result in poor contact between fuel cell components due to shrinkage of the membrane.","Therefore, improved performance of fuel cells would be achieved by reducing the thickness of membranes and improving the humidification state of solid PEMS since water molecules can promote proton transport and thin membranes can reduce ionic resistance and Ohmic losses.","Additionally, the contact between the membrane and electrode affects the efficiency of a fuel cell. Interfacial resistance between the membrane and electrode causes Ohmic loss thereby decreasing fuel cell efficiency.","Improving the membrane-electrode contact and continuity wherein the membrane and electrode are cast from a composition having the same or similar polymer electrolytes would improve the membrane-electrode interfacial resistance.","What is needed is a composition and nanocomposites from which improved polymer electrolyte membranes, electrodes and electrode casting solutions are made and that have improved performance at temps at about 80\u00b0 C. and above. Operating at these temperatures results in enhanced diffusion rates and reaction kinetics for methanol oxidation, oxygen reduction, and CO desorbtion thereby producing a more efficient fuel cell.","Improved compositions, improved polymer electrolyte membranes and nanocomposites formed there from for use in fuel cells, high performance capacitors and dialysis equipment are described herein. The improved compositions, membranes and nanocomposites overcome limitations of Nafion\u00ae membranes.","High performance polymer electrolyte membranes and nanocomposites for use in fuel cells are produced from the sulfonated polyphenylene polymer compositions.","One aspect of the present invention provides sulfonated polyphenylene compositions from which high-performance polymer electrolyte membranes are produced.","Yet another aspect of the present invention provides sulfonated polyphenylene compositions from which high-performance sulfonated polyphenylene nanocomposites are produced.","One aspect of the present invention provides for a composition that is useful as a polymer electrolyte membrane of a hydrogen fuel cell.","One aspect of the present invention provides for an electrode casting solution comprising a sulfonated polyphenylene dispersed in a solvent in an amount up to about 20% by weight.","Another aspect of the present invention provides for an electrode for a fuel cell wherein an electrode comprises a sulfonated polyphenylene of the present invention.","Another aspect of the present invention provides for a composition that is useful as a polymer electrolyte membrane of a direct methanol fuel cell.","Still another aspect of the present invention provides for a polymer electrolyte membrane made from sulfonated polyphenylene wherein the sulfonation is inhomogenous.","Still another aspect of the present invention provides for a polymer electrolyte membrane made from sulfonated polyphenylene composition wherein the sulfonation is homogenous.","Yet another aspect of the present invention is a sulfonated polyphenylene polymer with reduced segmental mobility of polymer chains.","Another aspect of the present invention provides for a method of making sulfonated polyphenylene polymer compositions having 2 to 6 pendant sulfonic acid groups per polymer repeat.

According to one embodiment of the invention, polyphenylenes are produced through Diels Alder (DA) reactions.","Referring now to , a membrane electrode assembly according to one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. A membrane  is positioned between an anode  and a cathode  where for example at least one of the membrane, anode or cathode is formed of a sulfonated polyphenylene polymer as described in the present invention. At the anode, , hydrogen molecules give up electrons, forming hydrogen ions. This process is made possible by the catalyst at the anode for example Platinum or Ruthenium-Platinum. The polymer electrolyte membrane  allows protons to flow through but not electrons. As a result, the hydrogen ions flow directly through the polymer electrolyte membrane to the cathode , while the electrons flow through an external circuit . As they travel to the cathode  through the external circuit , the electrons produce electrical current. This current can perform useful work by powering any electrical device. At the cathode , the electrons and hydrogen ions combine with oxygen to form water.","A polymer electrolyte membrane of  may be formed by casting an about 20% solution of sulfonated polyphenylene polymer on a clean glass surface which may be coated with hydrophobic groups to produce a film according to one embodiment of the present invention. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the films are further \u201cactivated\u201d through post polymerization protonation of the sufonly groups. One activation procedure includes immersing the film in about 2.0 M HSOfor about 24 hours. The film is rinsed in deionized water baths for about an additional 24 hours to remove most of the inorganic salts. Yet another activation procedure includes immersing the films in HSObath for 1 hour at 100\u00b0 C. followed by a rinse in an about 100\u00b0 C. for about 1 hour. The second procedure increases water uptake levels and proton conductivity by thermally enlarging the hydrophilic domain compared to procedure 1. The sulfonated polyphenylene may be entirely in the acid form, meaning the sulfonic groups are protonated or alternatively, the sulfonated polyphenylene may be entirely in the sodium form where all the sulfonic groups have sodium cations as counter ions or some combination thereof. However other cations may be used and will be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art.","The morphology of the parent polyphenylene provides for up to six (6) sulfonic acid moieties to attach to carbons of the aromatic moieties attached to the phenylene backbone of the repeat units (for example when the aromatic moieties are phenyl groups). The number of repeat units in a polymer ranges from 2 or more where n preferably ranges from about 130 to about 300.","Polyphenylene polymers and sulfonated polyphenylene polymers provide for improved thermal stability, while maintaining organic solubility making it possible to form films with improved mechanical properties when compared to Nafion\u00ae117 films from Dupont.","According to another embodiment of the present invention a composition comprising polyphenylene repeat units of structure I is polymerized to form polyphenylene polymers of between about 130\u20133000 repeat units. Structure I is synthesized by various methods including Diels Alder reactions for example where bis-tetraphenylcyclopetadienone reacts with p-Bis(ethynyl)benzene to yield carbon monoxide and polyphenylene.
