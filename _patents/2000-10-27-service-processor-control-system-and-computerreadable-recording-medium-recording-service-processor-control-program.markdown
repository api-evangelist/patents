Thus, means and methods for effectively overcoming these disadvantages are strongly desired.","As described above, at manufacturers-side, various codes and documents are conventionally generated in a series of processes including a development process, a design process, a manufacturing process, an inspection process, a shipment process, a delivery and installation process and a user-side operation and maintenance process. The various codes relating to firmware includes a source code, an object code, patch data, hardware state setting information on a host (or server, etc.) subjected to a maintenance service for the service processor and the like.","The documents include manuals, specifications, design drawings, EC sheets (a new design notice, a design modification notice) and the like relating to firmware, hardware and the like. It is assumed here that the documents  shown in  include all paper mediums such as the above-described manuals, specifications, design drawings and EC sheets. As shown in , the documents  in great volume are conventionally stored in a warehouse and delivered, if necessary, to an inspection division, a manufacturing division, customers, a maintenance company and the like. Further, the parties which received the documents  read the documents by visual observation.","Likewise, the source codes, object codes relating to firmware, hardware state setting information on a host (or a server, etc.) to which a service processor maintenance service is conducted, and the like are distributed by hand to related divisions, a maintenance company and the like. Further, at the manufacture side, there are installed a host  such as a mainframe used in various processings, a service processor  and a console . The service processor  is a computer serve system independent of the host . The service processor  controls the hardware of the host , provides conversational means for conversation with an operating system, monitors and diagnoses the operation state of the host  and the like.","The console  is a specific terminal for issuing commands to the service processor  and is operated by an operator. A remote maintenance terminal  is installed at a maintenance company side and connected to the console  (service processor ) through a line . The remote maintenance terminal  conducts a remote maintenance through the line .","Meanwhile, it has been conventionally necessary to deliver source codes and object codes of the firmware developed by the design division and the documents  (see ) (which will be referred to as \u201ccomponent information\u201d hereinafter) one by one. Due to this, it disadvantageously takes considerable labor and cost for delivery and maintenance. In case of the documents , in particular, it disadvantageously takes considerable labor and cost for the preparation and creation of materials, the creation of block copies, maintenance, delivery and the like.","Moreover, the console  has been conventionally connected to the service processor  (host ) as a part of the system. For that reason, only the console  can execute control over the service processor , which makes the system disadvantageously less versatile.","It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a service processor control system and a computer-readable recording medium recording a service processor control program capable of delivering and maintaining component information with less labor and lower cost and capable of realizing enhanced versatility relating to service processor control.","To obtain the above object, the invention according to a first aspect comprises, a drawing server , an EC sheet server , a program server  and a manual server  in one embodiment to be described later) storing component information on all of hardware and firmware constituting a product, control information for controlling at least a hardware state of a host and setting information for setting the hardware state, and connected to the Internet; and a client (corresponding to a client  and a client  in one embodiment to be described later) connected to a service processor connected to the host and the Internet, having at least a maintenance service function, as a console function for the service processor, based on the control information and the setting information, and drawing the component information, the control information and the setting information through a browser.","According to this invention, the client having the console function for the service processor and connected to the Internet is provided, and component information, control information and setting information are extracted through the browser. Thus, compared with a conventional case where component information is delivered and maintained by paper mediums and the like, delivery and maintenance can be conducted with less labor and lower cost and latest component information can be easily obtained due to the interactive characteristics of the Internet. Further, according to this invention, it is not necessary to store conventionally-used paper mediums in great volume in a warehouse and it is, therefore, unnecessary to dispose of bad resources of paper mediums.","The invention according to a second aspect is based on the service processor control system according to the first aspect, wherein the client executes control relating to the service processor through the browser, thereby setting and controlling the hardware state of the host based on the control information and the setting information.","According to this invention, the client provided with the browser instead of the conventional console  sets and controls the hardware state of the host.

These pieces of service information are stored in the storage device (not shown).","In a step SD shown in , the client  loads display service information (described in XML) from the storage device. In a step SD, the client  loads DTD relating to the service information from the storage device. This DTD defines a tag for the service information (in XML) and is stored in the storage device in advance. In a step SD, the client  reads DSSSL for service information display from the storage device (not shown). This DSSSL defines a document style corresponding to the service information. In a step SD, the service information loaded in the step SD is displayed on the SVP browser  according to DSSSL.","If \u201cloading browser\u201d is selected, the client  outputs the judgment result of the step SA shown in , \u201cYes\u201d, and executes a loading browser processing shown in .
