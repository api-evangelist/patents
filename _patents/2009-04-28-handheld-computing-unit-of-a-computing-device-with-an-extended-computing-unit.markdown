No. 12\/026,681 and a filing date of Feb. 6, 2008 now abandoned, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and made part of the present U.S. Utility Patent Application for all purposes.","Not Applicable","Not Applicable","1. Technical Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to communication systems and more particularly to computing devices used in such communication systems.","2. Description of Related Art","Communication systems are known to support wireless and wire lined communications between wireless and\/or wire lined communication devices. Such communication systems range from national and\/or international cellular telephone systems to the Internet to point-to-point in-home wireless or wired networks. The wireless and\/or wire lined communication devices may be personal computers, laptop computers, personal digital assistants (PDA), cellular telephones, personal digital video players, personal digital audio players, global positioning system (GPS) receivers, video game consoles, entertainment devices, etc.","Many of the communication devices include a similar basic architecture: that being a processing core, memory, and peripheral devices. In general, the memory stores operating instructions that the processing core uses to generate data, which may also be stored in the memory. The peripheral devices allow a user of the communication device to direct the processing core as to which operating instructions to execute, to enter data, etc. and to see the resulting data. For example, a personal computer includes a keyboard, a mouse, and a display, which a user uses to cause the processing core to execute one or more of a plurality of applications.","While the various communication devices have a similar basic architecture, they each have their own processing core, memory, and peripheral devices and provide distinctly different functions. For example, a cellular telephone is designed to provide wireless voice and\/or data communications in accordance with one or more wireless communication standards (e.g., IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, advanced mobile phone services (AMPS), digital AMPS, global system for mobile communications (GSM), code division multiple access (CDMA), local multi-point distribution systems (LMDS), multi-channel-multi-point distribution systems (MMDS), radio frequency identification (RFID), Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), and\/or variations thereof). As another example, a personal digital audio player is designed to decompress a stored digital audio file and render the decompressed digital audio file audible.","Over the past few years, integration of the some of the communication device functions into a single device has occurred. For example, many cellular telephones now offer personal digital audio playback functions, PDA functions, and\/or GPS receiver functions. Typically, to load one or more of these functions, files, or other applications onto a handheld communication device (e.g., a cellular telephone, a personal digital audio and\/or video player, a PDA, a GPS receiver), the handheld communication device needs to be coupled to a personal computer or laptop computer. In this instance, the desired application, function, and\/or file is first loaded on to the computer and then copied to the handheld communication device; resulting in two copies of the application, function, and\/or file.","To facilitate such loading of the application, function, and\/or file in this manner, the handheld communication device and the computer each require hardware and corresponding software to transfer the application, function, and\/or file from the computer to the handheld communication device. As such, two copies of the corresponding software exist as well as having two hardware components (one for the handheld device and the second for the computer). In addition to the redundancy of software, timing issues, different versions of the software, incompatible hardware, and a plethora of other reasons cause the transfer of the application, function, and\/or file to fail.","In addition to integration of some functions into a single handheld device, handheld digital audio players may be docked into a speaker system to provide audible signals via the speakers as opposed to a headphone. Similarly, a laptop computer may be docked to provide connection to a full size keyboard, a separate monitor, a printer, and a mouse. In each of these docking systems, the core architecture is not changed.","Therefore, a need exists for a computing device that at least partially overcomes one or more of the above mentioned issues.","The present invention is directed to apparatus and methods of operation that are further described in the following Brief Description of the Drawings, the Detailed Description of the Invention, and the claims. Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention made with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","12","16","14"]},"In general, a handheld computing unit  includes the primary processing module (e.g., central processing unit), the primary main memory, and the primary hard disk memory for the computing device . In this manner, when a single handheld computing unit  is coupled to the extended computing unit , its functions as the core of the computing device , which emulates a personal computer (PC) or laptop computer integrated with other functions such as a cellular telephone, a GPS receiver, a personal digital audio player, a personal digital video player, a personal digital assistant, portable television, and\/or any other type of personal handheld electronic device.","In addition, when the handheld computing unit  is docked to the extended computing unit , files and\/or applications can be swapped therebetween. For example, assume that the user of the computing device  has created a presentation using presentation software and both reside in memory of the extended computing unit . The user may elect to transfer the presentation file and the presentation software to memory of the handheld computing unit . If the handheld computing unit  has sufficient memory to store the presentation file and application, then it is copied from the extended computing unit memory to the handheld computing unit memory. If there is not sufficient memory in the handheld computing unit, the user may transfer an application and\/or file from the handheld computing unit memory to the extended computing unit memory to make room for the presentation file and application.","With the handheld computing unit  including the primary components for the computing device , there is only one copy of an application and\/or of a file to support PC functionality, laptop functionality, and a plurality of handheld device functionality (e.g., TV, digital audio\/video player, cell phone, PDA, GPS receiver, etc.). In addition, since only one copy of an application and\/or of a file exists (other than desired backups), special software and corresponding hardware to transfer the applications and\/or files from a PC to a handheld device are no longer needed. As such, the processing module, main memory, and I\/O interfaces of the handheld computing unit  provide a single core architecture for a PC and\/or a laptop, a cellular telephone, a PDA, a GPS receiver, a personal digital audio player, a personal digital video player, etc.","When multiple handheld computing units  are coupled to the extended computing unit , one or more separate computing devices  are created. For instance, when two handheld computing units  (e.g., personal and work handheld (HH) computing units, family members' HH computing units, colleagues HH computing units, video game players' HH computing units, etc.) are coupled to the extended computing unit , the HH computing units, in connection with the extended (EXT) computing unit, may for a single computing device, with one or more user interfaces (e.g., one user interface if the HH computing units are used by a single user and multiple user interfaces if the HH computing units are used by different users). As will be described in greater detail with reference to one or more of , one of the HH computing units will initiate a single EXT computing unit-multiple HH computing unit mode, which, when executed, establishes a single core processing unit, a single main memory, and a single hard disk\/flash memory using the corresponding components of the HH computing units and the EXT computing units.","In another example, a HH computing unit  may initiation a mode where the HH computing units connect to the EXT computing unit, but create separate computing devices . In this instance, the separate computing devices operate independently of one another. In yet another example, an HH computing unit  may initiate a mode where the HH computing units are connected to the EXT computing unit and form semi-separate computing devices . In this instance, the resulting computing units  function independently, but share resources (e.g., applications, memory, processing unit, etc.) of the EXT computing unit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["28","35","36","38","30","32","34","26","28","14"]},"As is also shown, the extended computing unit  is coupled to a monitor , a keyboard , a mouse , and a printer . The extended computing unit  may also be coupled to other devices (not shown) such as a trackball, touch screen, gaming devices (e.g., joystick, game pad, game controller, etc.), an image scanner, a webcam, a microphone, speakers, and\/or a headset. In addition, the extended computing unit  may have a form factor similar to a personal computer and\/or a laptop computer. For example, for in-home or in-office use, having the extended computing unit with a form factor similar to a PC may be desirable. As another example, for traveling users, it may be more desirable to have a laptop form factor.","In this example, two handheld computing units  are docked to the extended computer unit  and function together to provide one or more computing devices . The docking of a handheld computing unit  to the extended computing unit  encompasses one or more high speed connections between the units  and . Such a high speed connection may be provided by an electrical connector, by an RF connector, by an electromagnetic connector, and\/or a combination thereof. When a single handheld computing  is coupled to the extended computing unit, the units  and  collectively function similarly to a personal computer and\/or laptop computer with a WLAN card and a cellular telephone card.","In a single extended (EXT) computing unit-single handheld (HH) computing unit mode, the handheld computing unit  may transceive cellular RF communications  (e.g., voice and\/or data communications). Outgoing voice signals may originate at the VoIP phone  as part of a VoIP communication  or a microphone coupled to the extended computing unit . The outgoing voice signals are converted into digital signals that are subsequently converted to outbound RF signals. Inbound RF signals are converted into incoming digital audio signals and that may be provided to a sound card within the extended computing unit for presentation on speakers or provided to the VoIP phone via as part of a VoIP communication .","Outgoing data signals may originate at the mouse , keyboard , image scanner, etc. coupled to the extended computing unit . The outgoing data signals are converted into digital signals that are subsequently converted to outbound RF signals. Inbound RF signals are converted into incoming data signals and that may be provided to the monitor , the printer , and\/or other character presentation device.","In addition, the handheld computing unit  may include a WLAN transceiver for coupling to the WLAN router  to support WLAN RF communications  for the computing device . The WLAN communications  may be for accessing the internet  via modem , for accessing the entertainment server, and\/or accessing the entertainment receiver . For example, the WLAN communications  may be used to support surfing the web, receiving emails, transmitting emails, accessing on-line accounts, accessing on-line games, accessing on-line user files (e.g., databases, backup files, etc.), downloading music files, downloading video files, downloading software, etc. As another example, the computing device  (i.e., the handheld computing unit  and the extended computing unit ) may use the WLAN communications  to retrieve and\/or store music and\/or video files on the entertainment server; and\/or to access one or more of the entertainment components  and\/or the entertainment receiver .","In a single EXT computing unit-multiple HH computing unit mode, multiple HH computing units  are coupled to the EXT computing unit . The HH computing units  and the EXT computing unit  may collectively function to provide separate computing units , an integrated computing unit , or semi-separate computing units . Each type of computing unit provides its user with the same functionality as a computing device in the single EXT computing unit-single HH computing unit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["12","14","10","10","12","14","18","20","22","24","26","10","12","14"]},"As separate computing devices , each device  includes virtually separate hardware sections, operating system sections, application programming interface (API) sections, and application sections. In this instance, the memory (e.g., main memory, hard disk, and\/or flash memory) is partitioned between the separate computing devices . The operating systems of the separate computing devices  utilize the partitioned EXT memory in combination with the HH memory as the memory for the computing device. Similarly, the processing resources of the EXT computing unit  (e.g., one or more processing modules) are partitioned for separate use. The partitioning may be physical, virtual, or in time. Since the memory is partitioned, the separate computing devices  do not share applications, data, etc. If the separate computing devices  desire to share applications, data, or other, they must do so using conventional means or re-configuring into semi-separate computing devices .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["12","10","10","12","14","18","20","22","24","26","10","12","14"]},"As semi-separate computing devices , each device  includes virtually separate hardware sections, virtually separate operating system sections, at least partially shared application programming interface (API) sections, and at least partially shared application sections.

The wireless connectivity may be via a cellular telephone application, a short messaging application, a texting application, a wireless local area network (WLAN) application, etc. In an example of the operation, a receiver of the RF section  receives an inbound RF signal and amplifies it to produce an amplified inbound RF signal.

Such a conversion includes one or more of: scrambling, puncturing, encoding, interleaving, constellation mapping, modulation, frequency spreading, frequency hopping, beamforming, space-time-block encoding, space-frequency-block encoding, frequency to time domain conversion, and\/or digital baseband to intermediate frequency conversion.","A transmitter of the RF section  receives the outbound symbol stream and converts it into an outbound RF signal that has a carrier frequency within a given frequency band (e.g., 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 1900 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 29 GHz, 57-66 GHz, etc.). In an embodiment, this may be done by mixing the outbound symbol stream with a local oscillation to produce an up-converted signal. One or more power amplifiers and\/or power amplifier drivers amplifies the up-converted signal, which may be RF bandpass filtered, to produce the outbound RF signal. In another embodiment, the transmitter includes an oscillator that produces an oscillation. The outbound symbol stream provides phase information (e.g., +\/\u2212\u0394\u03b8 [phase shift] and\/or \u03b8(t) [phase modulation]) that adjusts the phase of the oscillation to produce a phase adjusted RF signal, which is transmitted as the outbound RF signal. In another embodiment, the outbound symbol stream includes amplitude information (e.g., A(t) [amplitude modulation]), which is used to adjust the amplitude of the phase adjusted RF signal to produce the outbound RF signal.","In yet another embodiment, the transmitter includes an oscillator that produces an oscillation. The outbound symbol provides frequency information (e.g., +\/\u2212\u0394f [frequency shift] and\/or f(t) [frequency modulation]) that adjusts the frequency of the oscillation to produce a frequency adjusted RF signal, which is transmitted as the outbound RF signal.

The method continues at step  where the HH unit executes the single extended computing unit-multiple handheld computing unit operating system program in concert with the other handheld computing unit and the extended computing unit executing corresponding single extended computing unit-multiple handheld computing unit operating system programs.","If, at step , the initiation was not successful, the method continues at step  where the HH unit engages a re-try mechanism (e.g., repeat sending the request message for three times over the next five minutes). If the re-try is successful, the method continues at step . If the re-try was not successful, the method continues at step  where the HH unit remains in the current mode.","If, at step , the mode change is for a standalone mode, the method continues at step  where the HH unit retrieves a standalone operating system boot loader. The method continues at step  where the HH unit executes the standalone operating system boot loader to reboot in the standalone mode.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0141","num":"0140"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":["260","80","12","260","262","264","266","268","270","272"]},"In this example, the HH hard disk\/flash memory  includes an operating system space  and a user space . The OS space  includes a standalone mode operating system program , a first single EXT unit-multiple HH unit mode operating system program  (e.g., integrated computing device), a second single EXT unit-multiple HH unit mode operating system program  (e.g., separate computing devices), a third single EXT unit-multiple HH unit mode operating system program  (e.g., semi-separate computing devices), and may further includes a single EXT unit-single HH unit mode operating system program.","The EXT hard disk\/flash memory  includes an OS space  and a user space , which may be partitioned or shared by the resulting computing devices. The OS space  includes a first single EXT unit-multiple HH unit mode operating system program  (e.g., integrated computing device), a second single EXT unit-multiple HH unit mode operating system program  (e.g., separate computing devices), a third single EXT unit-multiple HH unit mode operating system program  (e.g., semi-separate computing devices), and may further includes a single EXT unit-single HH unit mode operating system program.","In this example, the HH units and the EXT unit are to re-configure into an integrated computing device. As such, the HH units retrieve the first single EXT unit-multiple HH unit mode operating system boot loader section  and execute the boot loader to retrieve the first single EXT unit-multiple HH unit mode operating system program  from memory. In addition, one of the boot loaders  causes the first single EXT unit-multiple HH unit mode operating system program  to be retrieved from the EXT memory . The retrieved OS programs  and  are executed and stored in the main memory of the integrated computing device.","As shown, the main memory  (which includes the main memory of the HH units and of the EXT unit) includes an operating system space , and a user space . The operating system space  stores the current version of the operating system . In this example, the current version of the operating system is the integrated computing device. From this example, it should be fairly apparent how the other modes may be activated.","As may be used herein, the terms \u201csubstantially\u201d and \u201capproximately\u201d provides an industry-accepted tolerance for its corresponding term and\/or relativity between items. Such an industry-accepted tolerance ranges from less than one percent to fifty percent and corresponds to, but is not limited to, component values, integrated circuit process variations, temperature variations, rise and fall times, and\/or thermal noise. Such relativity between items ranges from a difference of a few percent to magnitude differences. As may also be used herein, the term(s) \u201coperably coupled to\u201d, \u201ccoupled to\u201d, and\/or \u201ccoupling\u201d includes direct coupling between items and\/or indirect coupling between items via an intervening item (e.g., an item includes, but is not limited to, a component, an element, a circuit, and\/or a module) where, for indirect coupling, the intervening item does not modify the information of a signal but may adjust its current level, voltage level, and\/or power level. As may further be used herein, inferred coupling (i.e., where one element is coupled to another element by inference) includes direct and indirect coupling between two items in the same manner as \u201ccoupled to\u201d. As may even further be used herein, the term \u201coperable to\u201d or \u201coperably coupled to\u201d indicates that an item includes one or more of power connections, input(s), output(s), etc., to perform, when activated, one or more its corresponding functions and may further include inferred coupling to one or more other items. As may still further be used herein, the term \u201cassociated with\u201d, includes direct and\/or indirect coupling of separate items and\/or one item being embedded within another item. As may be used herein, the term \u201ccompares favorably\u201d, indicates that a comparison between two or more items, signals, etc., provides a desired relationship. For example, when the desired relationship is that signal  has a greater magnitude than signal , a favorable comparison may be achieved when the magnitude of signal  is greater than that of signal  or when the magnitude of signal  is less than that of signal .","The present invention has also been described above with the aid of method steps illustrating the performance of specified functions and relationships thereof. The boundaries and sequence of these functional building blocks and method steps have been arbitrarily defined herein for convenience of description. Alternate boundaries and sequences can be defined so long as the specified functions and relationships are appropriately performed. Any such alternate boundaries or sequences are thus within the scope and spirit of the claimed invention.","The present invention has been described above with the aid of functional building blocks illustrating the performance of certain significant functions. The boundaries of these functional building blocks have been arbitrarily defined for convenience of description. Alternate boundaries could be defined as long as the certain significant functions are appropriately performed. Similarly, flow diagram blocks may also have been arbitrarily defined herein to illustrate certain significant functionality. To the extent used, the flow diagram block boundaries and sequence could have been defined otherwise and still perform the certain significant functionality. Such alternate definitions of both functional building blocks and flow diagram blocks and sequences are thus within the scope and spirit of the claimed invention.
