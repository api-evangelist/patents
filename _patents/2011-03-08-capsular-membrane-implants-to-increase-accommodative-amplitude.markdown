{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of and claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/570,780, filed on Sep. 30, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","The present invention relates to accommodation of the eye and treatment of presbyopia.","The eye has a cornea and a lens. The cornea and lens focus light on a retina such that a person can perceive the image with the retina located on the back of the eye. When the image on the retina is focused, the image appears sharp to the patient. However, when the image is out of focus, the image appears blurred. An eyeglass prescription to correct far vision of the eye can be referred to clinically as a refraction of the eye, and the measured refraction of the eye can include a sphere, a cylinder and an axis of the cylinder. Corrective lenses can be prescribed based on the refraction of the eye such that optical errors of the eye such as nearsightedness, also referred to as myopia, and farsightedness, also referred to as hyperopia, can be corrected. Nearsightedness corresponds to an eye having too much optical power such that objects near the eye appear in focus and distant objects appear blurred. With a nearsighted eye, lenses having negative optical power can be used to correct the refractive error of the eye. Farsightedness can refer to an eye not having enough optical power such that positive lenses placed in front of the farsighted eye can correct near vision.","In the normal healthy eye, the lens of the eye can accommodate to both near and far distances of the object viewed such that the image of the object is focused on the retina and remains sharp to the patient. For far vision, the ciliary muscles of the eye can relax and adjust the lens to focus on a far object that may be several meters away. For near vision, the ciliary muscles of the eye can constrict and adjust the lens to focus on a near object. The near object can be located at a distance suitable for reading, for example. The eye can accommodate with movement of the lens to focus on objects at intermediate distances.","With age the accommodation of the eye can decrease such that a person with good distance vision may benefit from lenses to see near objects clearly. The decrease of accommodation of the eye corresponding to presbyopia may be related to a stiffer crystalline lens that decreases the accommodative amplitude of the lens of the eye in at least some instances. People who are near sighted and wear glasses for distance vision may find glasses that correct sight for far vision do not provide near vision correction in at least some instance. This loss of accommodation of the eye can be referred to as presbyopia.","Although many forms of optical correction and devices have been proposed to treat presbyopia, at least some of these approaches have one or more deficiencies such that the prior correction of presbyopia may be less than ideal in at least some instances. Although reading glasses can be effective when worn, in at least some instances a person may not have reading glasses and need near vision. Also, switching from near vision to far vision with reading glasses can be less than ideal in at least some instances. Although bifocals are available, such corrective lenses may provide less than ideal results in at least some instances such as when a person engages in water sport or sweats such that the correction of the lenses can be at least partially distorted.","Although it has been proposed to treat tissue with energy to correct presbyopia, such tissue treatments can be more invasive than would be ideal and may be somewhat unstable in at least some instances. For example, although it has been proposed to reduce the stiffness of the natural crystalline lens through laser treatment allowing for improvement in the ability of the crystalline lens to change power, it may be possible to create a cataract in at least some instances. Also, treatment of the lens can potentially result in changes in refraction of the eye such that the refraction and uncorrected vision of the eye may be less than ideal in at least some instances. Further, at least some tissue treatments can be unstable in at least some instances such that the treatment may result in no more than a temporary change to the eye in at least some instances. For example, electrocautery of the lens capsule may be related to decreased thickness of the lens capsule that may contribute to cataract formation and may be related to unstable refraction of the eye, in at least some instances.","Patients who receive intra ocular lenses (hereinafter \u201cIOLs\u201d) may have no effective accommodation, and may be considered presbyopic in at least some instances. For example, although IOL surgery to replace a cataract of the natural lens of the eye can be effective in restoring vision of the patient, such patients cannot accommodate effectively in at least some instances. Also, IOL surgery can be somewhat variable in at least some instances, such that the refraction of the eye with the IOL can be less than ideal in at least some instances.","Although multifocal lenses have been proposed, such lenses can result in undesirable visual phenomenon (hereinafter \u201cdysphotopsia\u201d) in at least some instances. Although multifocal lenses may provide a first optical correction for near vision and a second optical power for distance vision, the light rays having the second optical power for near vision may provide visual phenomenon such as halos for a distant object, for example when the patient views a distant object.","One promising approach to treat patients who have received IOLs for cataract surgery has been to introduce an accommodating IOL. However, such IOLs have resulted in less accommodation than would be ideal and can be more difficult to implant in at least some instances. Also, recovery time of accommodating IOLs may be longer than a non-accommodating IOL, in at least some instances. Also, the accommodative abilities may not be restored as would be ideal in at least some instances. Though vision may be improved, the degree of improvement can vary among patients and may be less predictable than would be ideal in at least some instances.","In light of the above, it would be desirable to provide improved methods and apparatus for increased accommodation of the eye that overcome one or more of the above mentioned limitations of the prior approaches. Ideally such methods and apparatus would restore accommodation to provide near and far vision correction with reduced side effects.","Embodiments of the present invention provide improved treatment so as to improve patient accommodation with the natural lens of the eye or an IOL, or combinations thereof. In many embodiments, movement of an intermediate portion of the lens capsule is decreased, for example inhibited, with a support coupled to the intermediate portion so as to increase accommodation. The support may be adjustable, such that patient refraction and accommodation can be adjusted following surgery. The support may comprise rigidity sufficient to decrease radial movement of the intermediate portion of the lens capsule such that accommodation of the eye can be increased and presbyopia mitigated. The support may comprise a biocompatible material capable of stable coupling to the lens capsule following implantation, such that the far distance refraction and accommodation of the eye can be stable following surgery. The support can be coupled to the lens capsule at an intermediate portion of the lens capsule away from the pupil center, such that patient vision can be maintained. The intermediate portion of the lens capsule coupled to the support may be located between the central optical potion of the lens capsule and an elastic peripheral portion of the lens capsule attached to zonules of the eye. As the support can be located away from the central optically used portion of the lens, optics of the eye and vision can be preserved, and the support may comprise an opaque material. The stiffening support can be placed on the intermediate portion to decrease radial stretching and movement of the intermediate portion of the lens capsule. The support can extend substantially around the central portion and may comprise an annular structure such as a ring or oval annular structure, so as to decrease circumferential stretching of the annular support, such that radial movement of the intermediate portion of the lens capsule corresponding to circumferential stretching of the intermediate portion of the lens capsule can be decreased. The stiffening support can increase radial stretching of an outer portion of the lens capsule extending between the zonules and the intermediate portion coupled to the support, such that the accommodative forces of the eye and the amount of accommodation of the eye can be increased. The intermediate portion of the lens capsule coupled to the support may comprise the anterior lens capsule, or the posterior lens capsule, or combinations thereof.","The support can be shaped and coupled to the intermediate portion of the lens capsule in many ways. The support may be coupled to the intermediate portion with one or more of an adhesive, thermal bonding, mechanical coupling, clamping or sutures. The support may be adhered to the intermediate portion with a biocompatible adhesive. Alternatively or in combination, the support may comprise a channel sized to receive the intermediate portion of the lens capsule. The support may comprise one or more of filaments, fibers, a flexible material, a shape memory material, a bendable material or a mesh material. The support may comprise a first folded elongate profile configuration for insertion into the eye through a narrow incision and a second wide profile configuration to improve accommodation when placed on the lens capsule, such that the support extends substantially along the intermediate portion of the lens capsule. For example, the elongate configuration may comprise a folded and\/or flexible configuration sized to fit within a lumen of an insertion device for delivery into the anterior chamber through an incision no more than about 2 mm across, and the expanded configuration may comprise an annular shape, for example a C shaped ring configuration, when positioned on the intermediate portion of the capsule.","The lens may comprise the natural lens of the eye or an artificial lens such as an accommodative IOL. When used to increase accommodation of the natural lens of the eye, the support can be positioned on an outer anterior surface of the anterior lens capsule away from the subcapsular epithelium so as to decrease invasiveness of the procedure. With placement on the anterior surface of the anterior capsule, the support can increase curvature of the central portion of the capsule and central portion of the natural lens during accommodation such that the amount of accommodation of the eye is increased. The support can be used with one or more additional treatments of the eye such as capsulorhexis, laser treatment or an artificial and accommodative IOL. The accommodative IOL may comprise a moveable component such as a haptic that moves the artificial lens to accommodate, or a flexible artificial lens that bends to accommodate, or combinations thereof. The accommodation can be increased with increased force to the IOL from the supported and\/or stiffened intermediate portion of the lens capsule.","The support coupled to the intermediate portion to decrease radial movement can increase radial stretching of an outer portion of the lens capsule, such that the accommodative forces of the eye and the amount of accommodation of the eye are increased. The stretched outer portion of the lens capsule can extend from the intermediate portion coupled to the support to the peripheral portion coupled to the zonules. The support coupled to the intermediate portion can be sized or adjusted such that radial stretching of the outer portion is increased when the ciliary muscles of the eye relax and tension of the zonules moves the peripheral portion of the lens capsule radially outward and away from the intermediate portion having the decreased radial movement. As the amount of stretching of the outer portion can be increased, the amount of force to move the peripheral portion inward can be increased substantially when the eye accommodates.","The support can be adjustable, such that one or more of the accommodation or the far vision refraction of the eye can be adjusted with the support. The stiffness of the support can be adjusted to adjust amount of accommodation. The stiffness of the support may be increased to increase accommodation of the eye. The dimension across the support can be adjusted so as to adjust the refraction of the eye, and an increase in the dimension may correspond to decreased optical power of the eye and a decrease in the dimension may increase the optical power of the eye.","In a first aspect, embodiments provide a method of treating an eye.

A support is placed on an intermediate portion of the capsule to decrease radial movement of the intermediate portion and increase an amount of accommodation of the eye.","In many embodiments, a peripheral portion of the lens capsule is coupled to the intermediate portion of the lens capsule, and radial movement of the peripheral portion is increased when the support is coupled to the intermediate portion.","In many embodiments, a central portion of the lens capsule is coupled to the peripheral portion, and an anterior movement of the central portion is increased when the intermediate portion is coupled to the support.","In many embodiments, the decreased radial movement comprises one or more of a stretching, a bending, a flexing, a translation or a rotation of the intermediate portion.","In many embodiments, the eye has a first amount of accommodation prior to placement of the support on the eye and a second amount of accommodation when the support is placed on the intermediate portion of the capsule, and the second amount is greater than the first amount.","In many embodiments, the capsule comprises one or more of an anterior capsule or a posterior capsule.","In many embodiments, the portion comprises an intermediate portion of the lens capsule located between a peripheral portion of the lens capsule and a central portion of the lens capsule.

When the eye has a \u201crelaxed\u201d configuration for far vision, the ciliary muscle  of the eye is relaxed such that zonules  pull the lens capsule  outward. When the eye accommodates for near vision, the ciliary muscle  contracts such that zonules  allow the lens peripheral portion P of the lens capsule to move radially inward with a radially inward force . When the peripheral portion P moves radially inward, the front portion of the lens capsule moves forward with anterior movement  such that the anterior optical surface of the lens moves forward so as to bring the image of the near object into focus on the retina. In addition, the curvature of the anterior surface of the lens  can increase when the front portion of the lens capsule moves forward so as to increase the optical power of the lens  and bring the image of the object into focus on the retina. When the peripheral portion P moves radially outward, the front portion of the lens capsule moves with posterior movement  such that the anterior optical surface of the lens moves posteriorly and decreases curvature so as to bring the image of the far object into focus on the retina.","With presbyopia, the inner components of the lens such as the cortex  may stiffen, such that the amount of accommodation decreases.

The intermediate portion may comprise an intermediate portion of the anterior capsule, or an intermediate portion of the posterior capsule, or both, for example.","The stiffened intermediate portion of the capsule I can increase accommodation of the eye  in many ways. The accommodation can be increased with one or more of increased radially inward force  of the lens capsule, increase anterior movement  of the lens capsule, increased curvature AC of the lens capsule, or increased curvature CPC of the central portion comprising a protrusion CP (), or combinations thereof. With the stiffened portion I, the radially inward force  can be increased when the ciliary muscles of the eye contract and the zonules allow the peripheral portion of the capsule to move inward. The increased radially inward force  can provide an increased amount of the anterior movement  of the lens capsule. The increased anterior movement  of the lens may provide an increased curvature CAC of the central portion CA when the lens accommodates so as to increase accommodation of the eye. Also, the increased anterior movement  of the lens capsule may provide increased accommodation based at least partially on an increased distance from the central portion C of the lens capsule to the retina.

In: Guthoff R, Ludwig K, eds. Current Aspects of Human Accommodation II. Heidelberg: Kaden Verlag; 2003). Although the material properties of the lens capsule can be at least somewhat non-linear and the Young's modulus of the lens capsule can vary with age, a person of ordinary skill in the art can determine empirically the thickness and corresponding modulus based on the teachings described herein, so as to provide stiffening treatment to the intermediate portion I and increased accommodation.","The support can be coupled to the lens capsule in many ways.
