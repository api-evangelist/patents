{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The client\/server computing environment continues to expand into web services, with the latest iteration of network supported programmatic access to services and data provided by many service providers. Traditionally, applications have been fairly static in nature. But as information technology (IT) infrastructure has both grown in capability and functionality, IT service providers are moving to viable service provider platforms that are highly adaptive, readily prototyped, and readily scaled through hosted web services, such as the so-called \u201ccloud\u201d computing environment.","Service providers have focused on service integration in the traditional space, such as the practice of providing service management functionality to large enterprises by sourcing transformation-based infrastructure. But there is little, if anything available for interfacing the various platforms.","For example, telecommunications service providers have implemented the Enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM) industry standard service management process framework to manage both their own and their client's web-based environments. But these providers have not implemented cross-functionality outside of these types of models.","IT service providers have implemented service management stacks based on the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL). But these are primarily manually-driven systems Others have implemented traditional service integration models, but have not extended these models to comprehend non-traditional environments such as cloud-based computing, web-hosted environments, and other managed services.","Cloud providers have implemented a level of infrastructure technology service management as lightweight single-task processes, such as watchdog services that provide simple monitoring, and other simple availability services. But these do not prove full functionality and lack dynamic provider-driven, multi-client processing, and therefore provide little benefit to traditional systems.","Other providers have implemented so-called \u201cbolt-on\u201d cloud control products, which provide services to control cloud operational models. However, each user has to instantiate their own separate instance of the model to control their own service.","Federation systems and methods are disclosed for information technology service management (ITSM). In an example, the federation system includes an integration layer to provide interoperability among autonomous operational models for a client infrastructure. A client interface provides single point of access visibility across each of the different operational models. The federation is flexible and compliant with multiple service management models, supports a variety of interface types, and can be implemented across multiple platforms and providers, or as part of a single client, multiple-view model for use by an enterprise to have an overall view of the IT infrastructure.","Accordingly, the systems and methods disclosed herein may be used to provide interoperable information technology service management among a variety of different platforms (e.g., cloud-to-traditional platforms). The federation also enables the cloud and traditional IT infrastructure to use ITSM as a bridge for end-to-end coherency. By way of illustration, the federation may be used to give a client an overview of the various components of their IT infrastructure when changing or adding a component to the infrastructure.","Before continuing, it is noted that as used herein, the term \u201cincludes\u201d and \u201cincluding\u201d means, but is not limited to meaning, \u201cincludes\u201d or \u201cincluding\u201d and \u201cincludes at least\u201d or \u201cincluding at least.\u201d The term \u201cbased on\u201d means \u201cbased on\u201d and \u201cbased at least in part on.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","100"]},"The system  may also include suitable communication networks, such as a local area network (LAN) and\/or wide area network (WAN). The network may also provide accessibility for the federation service  to the various infrastructure installations. The federation service  described herein may be provided on the network via a suitable communication connection, such as via an Internet service provider (ISP). In this regard, the federation service  is able to access infrastructure directly via the network, or via an agent, such as another network.","IT infrastructure may be provided by any suitable computer or computing devices capable of implementing the IT services for an enterprise. The infrastructure is not limited to provision by any particular type of devices. Although, it is noted that the operations described herein may be executed by program code residing on a computer system having sufficient processing capability, such as a server computer or plurality of server computers on a network for a client.","In an example, the system  may include both traditional infrastructure -, and cloud-based infrastructure -. Traditional infrastructure may be provided in-house by the client (illustrated by ), and\/or may be outsourced to a third party (as illustrated by ). Similarly, the cloud-based infrastructure may be a private cloud (as illustrated by ), and\/or may be provided by as part of a public cloud (as illustrated by ).","Cloud computing and its tenets of a hyper-automated, hypo-touch (i.e., minimal human operational control) construct has caused a disruptive shift in IT services. As a result, cloud computing has created a new operational model for corporate enterprises, both for the corporate structure and IT departments that implement a cloud model. Cloud computing has also created a new operational model for IT service providers that create multi-client operational models and instantiate hosting services for other enterprises to access. This new methodology and model is a stark contrast to the existing enterprise models and their highly manual, elementally segmented (by hardware and software towers), and associated disjointed IT management approaches.","An IT operational model is the ecosystem that provides the standard framework, architecture, tools, continually refreshing technology components, continual process flow of work within, and people alignment to provide IT services. As new operational models have formed in place of existing IT operational models, concise best practices have been created to harness the layers of a reference cloud operational model. Example best practices include, but are not limited to, infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS).","Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provides the foundational access to pools of computing, storage, and networking resources in physical and\/or virtual form. Resources are exposed to allow clients to provision these resources for their own IT purposes. Infrastructure as a service is highly automated, and used for many enterprise infrastructure needs.","Platform as a service (PaaS) provides the next layer in the standard cloud operational model. Platform as a service is designed to allow application-level capabilities for clients of the cloud. Application-level capabilities include the abstraction of application platform-oriented development tools, and\/or platform-oriented application instantiation methodologies and tools to operate on top of the infrastructure layer of a cloud environment.","Software as a service (SaaS) provides the actual application that is created to run as a custom cloud service using web-based application tenets. Software as a service may also use the infrastructure as a service layer to run the service, and the platform as a service layer to develop and\/or deploy the service for execution and usage by the software as a service clients.","In each of these layers, a management base enable operations, automation, and handling the lifecycle of technology in the respective domain. For example, infrastructure as a service may provide element automation management. That is, the ability to dynamically manage the lifecycle of servers, storage, networking, virtualized resources, and even off-the-shelf applications within the infrastructure layer. In platform as a service, management includes the ability to instantiate complex infrastructure as a service to application relationships for deployment. Management may also include development management functionality to simplify the instantiation of software as a service on a cloud infrastructure as a service layer for continual operation and respective automation by elemental automation functions and processes.","The cloud and its operational model relies on best practices. These best practices have become the staple of visibility for enterprise businesses into IT operations, and include various processes. These processes may include, but are not limited to, security management, service level agreements, configuration management capacity management, event management, and continuity management.","Security management is the creation or exposure of security policy, security best practices and industry controls, but in a cloud-oriented manner. Service level agreements provide the ability to measure and act on client-oriented requests as confronted during the operation of a client cloud service.","Configuration management includes an active prescriptive model of holding reusable configuration items that represent readily automated components of elemental and complex IT components.","Capacity management is a component of applying a usage-based, scaled, and aggregation of chargeback data for a cloud and its operational model. Capacity management within a cloud operational model is more dynamic than when used in traditional IT enterprise architecture.","Event management is the integration of monitoring and metering data from hardware, software, applications and services running within IT environments. Event management is provided in the context of running services, rapidly exposing monitored data and responding to incidents and problems in relationship to policy-driven remediation. As used herein, event management is an enhanced combination of incident and problem management, and also includes positive events that are to be acted on in the service layer.","Continuity management becomes an ingrained part of the overall running model as cloud services scale up and down, or recover dynamically from failure through automation. Continuity management is designed in a manner which allows rapid recovery, and is proactive (e.g., threshold-driven), to accommodate entity loss and preserve service integrity. This is regardless of whether locally or geographically providing continuity management functionality.","The cloud operational models may institute lightweight versions of these processes as best practices, allowing clients and services to either use front-end service management functionality as lightweight, client segmented technologies. The cloud operational model may also itself support engrained, lightweight ITSM services for multiple client usage.","However, clients may have services that operate both in the cloud and outside of the cloud. The client may operate these services using an internal IT department (illustrated in  by reference ), using a traditional IT service provider (reference ), using a private cloud service (reference ), and\/or using a cloud service provider that manages these services on behalf of the client (reference ). Many enterprises have different instantiations or portions of systems and processes. These constructs lead to enterprises having disparate, legacy-based, and non-automated IT environments. In the absence of intrinsic service management, users of cloud service and service providers may use third party front-end tools to provide their own individual management needs. Such a hybrid approach needs to be managed in a cohesive and consistent manner.","The systems and methods disclosed herein support a federation operational model for providing ITSM. The federation has the ability to support client needs in the various sourcing spaces selected by the client. The federation also provides visibility and transparency across each platform. Accordingly, the federation provides a high level of visibility, transparency, operational excellence, and business-to-IT alignment.","By way of illustration, a client may choose to source services to a cloud-based model -, and\/or consume services from the cloud-based model -, while in parallel providing and\/or consuming services from a traditional IT enterprise model -. The traditional model -is operated with existing processes, including some manual and some that are over a decade old. For example, the traditional model -may include a server, mainframe, and legacy applications. The enterprise may rely on traditional management (in-house and\/or outsourced) to provide IT services for the traditional model -. While on the cloud model -, service may be provided using either front-end processing tools or even an integrated cloud service stack.","In this illustration, the client has services and applications running in both traditional and cloud-based models. In many cases, these models are incompatible, processing against each other as an end-to-end system. Meanwhile, the enterprise desires business to IT visibility for all services, both traditional and cloud-based.","The federation service  disclosed herein may be utilized to interface between the multiple infrastructure platforms by aggregating these multiple, discrete, and\/or autonomous models into a single process-to-process federation service . The federation service  \u201ccross-wires\u201d various ITSM functions in the traditional and cloud-based infrastructures, while still allowing the client to differentiate and benefit from using both cloud and traditional enterprise models. The federation service  also provides a reusable, standardized approach.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","210","210","220","210"]},"The federation service  may support multiple service provider interconnects based on enterprise and\/or service provider instantiation needs. The federation service  may support access therebetween via various programmatic and\/or data transport models. These models may include, for example, Web Services (e.g., REST\/SOAP-based protocols), application programming interfaces (APIs) for proprietary implementations (e.g., CLI, XML and derivatives). In addition, the provider and\/or client can implement a viability layer in portal, user interface (UI), or exposed programmatic interfaces to a third party portal.","In an example, the federation service  may provide ITSM-to-ITSM process flow. That is, the federation service  may be based on a provider or enterprise cloud operational model, and interface to another ITSM model (e.g., traditional, private internal cloud, or third party ITSM provider such as a service integrator), and\/or to a third party or client internal traditional ITSM process framework. The federation service  may also provide discrete or composite ITSM process flow to facilitate individual ITSM-to-ITSM process flow data. The federation may also provide full ITSM process framework for system-to-system flow.","In an example, the federation service  supports standardized data expressions and metadata commensurate with the needs of a provider and the provider's clients, or an enterprise and the various sourced customer interfaces. The federation service  may also facilitate communications via provider-to-provider, client-to-provider, intra-provider (e.g., a provider sourcing multiple types of packages for a client), intra-provider-to-client (e.g., two or more provider sourced and internal client interconnected services), and\/or third party provider-to-third party provider-to-client sourced services.","The federation service  may also support real-time data process transport in either proprietary or standardized data interfaces. For example, interfaces may be provided to support standard (e.g., ITIL-based or eTOM-based) enterprise architecture interactions. For example, enterprises that have implemented standard architecture process frameworks can interact within the federation model.","The federation service  is also flexible and can handle various enterprise and service provider implementations. The methodology may be utilized by an enterprise that creates its own federation model. The methodology may also be utilized by service providers that implement the federation for multiple clients within its own ecosystem and sourcing offerings.","In the example shown in , the client has an established service layer within a corporate enterprise  (e.g., using ITIL, eTOM, or combination of permuted process functionality from derivatives or relative representations thereof). As such, the client implements typical processes (e.g., problem, incident, change, and configuration) or higher level functions (e.g., capacity, continuity, and security) to manage internal IT and provide business-to-IT coherency.","Additionally, the enterprise may have outsourced a portion (or all of the IT environment) to an IT service provider , or even to multiple IT service providers (referred to herein as \u201cmulti-sourcing\u201d). The provider(s)  may also provide service management functions for the sourced components on behalf of the enterprise. The IT service providers  may operate a traditional service model that is implemented for multiple clients, and may have multiple service interfaces for their clients which include the enterprise's sourced components. Also in this example, the IT service providers may use primarily manual practices due to the nature of the traditional sourcing model (e.g., highly non-standardized, transformational) because the nature of partial sourcing models inhibit automated services.","The client may also desire to establish a private dedicated cloud  (implemented solely for the client). The client may implement processes integral to the private cloud model. For example, the client may have acquired a vendor package that is implemented within the enterprise. The client may also have architected a set of processes and implemented those processes using infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and\/or other layers converged or as a combination thereof.","A third party cloud service provider may also offer the enterprise cloud services , along with an intrinsic service model that is cloud-ready. This cloud model may operate at a higher automation and standardization rate than a traditional IT operations model, and even the private cloud . That is, the model is \u201cmulti-tenant,\u201d offering service management for multiple client services simultaneously for other clients. Therefore, the federation service  needs to understand the dynamic interaction between management layers and business reporting layers as well.","It can be seen by the example described above with reference to , that the client can have varying permutations in sourcing requirements. To summarize, the client in this example has sourced an IT environment  to a traditional IT provider, and sourced cloud  needs via another (e.g., public) IT provider. The client also has a traditional IT environment  on site, while also running a private dedicated cloud model . The federation bus  provides interoperability among the different models, by aggregating output via the federation program code  for output to a user at a visibility layer .","In other example, the client may source an IT environment to multiple traditional IT providers, and source cloud needs to other IT provider(s) that offer cloud services. The client may also source an IT environment to several traditional IT providers, where at least one of those providers creates\/runs a private dedicated cloud, and sources go-to-market software as a service to another provider (or one of the traditional IT providers that also offers cloud services).","These and other examples, are all in line with existing scenarios in the IT industry at present, and will continue to be emerging scenarios with the addition of the cloud. The program code described herein may be used to manage these and other scenarios. An example of the program code can be better understood with reference to  and the following discussion of various example functions of the federation system. However, the operations described herein are not limited to any specific implementation with any particular type of program code.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"300"},"The program code executes the function of the architecture of machine readable instructions as self-contained modules. These modules can be integrated within a self-standing tool, or may be implemented as agents that run on top of an existing program code. In an example, the architecture of machine readable instructions may include an integration layer  to provide interoperability and an orchestration engine among autonomous operational models for a client infrastructure. The machine readable instructions may also include a client interface  to provide single point of access visibility across each of the different operational models.","The integration layer  may include a poly-ITSM federation bus . In an example, the federation bus  is implemented to pass data bi-directionally within the cloud model between various ITSM processes and frameworks. An orchestration model may be deployed by the federation bus  to orchestrate data and process flows throughout the functions in real-time. The federation bus  may be lightweight and enable fast ITSM functions, commensurate with discrete processes (e.g., configuration management-to-configuration management, event management-to-problem, incident management, and capacity management-to-capacity management). The federation bus  may also enable composite process framework mapping (e.g., full client-specific ITSM data flow from subordinate framework systems in the ecosystem to the omniscient ITSM at the ultimate client visibility layer).","The integration layer  may also include a federation aggregation layer  connected to, or extended from, the federation bus  exposure and data flows. In an example, the federation aggregation layer  may be implemented as a portal, user interface, or Web Service. The federation aggregation layer  can be implemented in the program code by a service provider, enterprise, and\/or may be created by an independent software vendor as a sold package.","It is noted that the federation aggregation layer  may operate in native formats. That is, the federation aggregation layer  interoperates with the intersection of workflows for the various autonomous operational modules for the client infrastructure, and the underpinning data, but without having to translate processes and communications of each of the autonomous operational modules into any particular format or business defined steps for output to the client.","The client interface  may be implemented as an API-based interface, and provides integrated views into all the forms of data from the federation. The client interface  provides ITSM data correlation based on the associated data from an ITSM providing source. The correlation may be a single process that represents service management data from an end-to-end service hosted by multiple different providers. For example, event management process dataflow from software as a service may be sourced by a third party cloud provider coupled with the event management dataflow from a backend system, which in turn is sourced by a traditional IT provider. In another example, a full service management process flow feeds from a third party provider performing the federation on behalf of the client.","The client interface  may include a Northbound\/Southbound API\/Web Service interface . The interface  establishes electronic API and Web Service interfaces into the federation model. The interface  also exposes programmatic and data flow functions to the client and other providers in the federation.","For purposes of illustration, client-to-federation interactions may include the client shown in , having an outsourcing arrangement with a traditional IT service provider, a cloud IT provider, and\/or an in-house IT department. In addition, the client may utilize a private-dedicated cloud operational model to service corporate and interdepartmental needs.","The program code shown in  may be interoperable with each model via an associated ITSM. In an example, the traditional IT provider may use a multi-client ITSM for transformational IT outsourcing, and the technology services the client has contracted for. The cloud IT provider uses intrinsic services for the client's cloud sourcing needs, such as a software as a service or scalable compute and storage infrastructure as a service resources. The client has an internal ITSM that is managing a large portion of the IT environment, established using the ITIL process framework. The client may also utilize rudimentary functions for a private cloud model, such as monitoring, change management, capacity management for scaling, and chargeback services for department usage.","In this example, the federation model is implemented between the operational model instantiations, providing the client visibility across all models. The client has direct visibility from any of the models individually as the models each provide direct ITSM access via a portal or Web Service API). Accordingly, the client has visibility into the lifecycle operations of the various direct models.","The client can also use the federation model for end-to-end visibility between the models, to services that span across the models. For example, the software as a service may process transactions from a traditional model system housed in the client's outsourced environment or internal environment. Such visibility provided by the federation provides the client a macro view of the services being operated, as the services are processed.","It is noted that the client can use the federation system to change infrastructure. For purposes of illustration, the federation may determine what needs to happen to effect a change, and each autonomous operational model feeds back to the federation system for determining how to effect the change. The federation system may report to the client what is done, and what still has to be done (e.g., which protocols, datatypes, and interconnections are modified for the change), so that the multiple autonomous operational models will continue to work together in the client infrastructure. The federation system may also analyze sourcing relations, hierarchies, and applications, to name only a few examples.","Still other examples are also contemplated. The systems and methods described herein are not limited to any particular infrastructure(s) and may be utilized with infrastructures, and\/or components thereof, which are now known or are later developed.","Before continuing, it should be noted that the examples described above are provided for purposes of illustration, and are not intended to be limiting. Other devices and\/or device configurations may be utilized to carry out the operations described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"400"},"Operation  includes interfacing with each of the autonomous operational models. The autonomous operational models have independent information technology service providers. Operation  includes providing a single point of access for client visibility across each of the different operational models.","The operations shown and described herein are provided to illustrate various implementations. It is noted that the operations are not limited to the ordering shown. Still other operations may also be implemented.","Further operations may include providing end-to-end visibility between the autonomous operational models to services spanning across the autonomous operational models. Further operations may also include providing a viability layer to a third-party portal.","In addition, further support operations may be provided. Example operations may include supporting various supporting inter-process flow across the autonomous operational models, supporting multiple service provider interconnects for the autonomous operational models. Example operations may include supporting different programmatic and data transport platforms for the autonomous operational models. Example operations may include supporting process-to-process flows for the autonomous operational models. Example operations may include supporting full process framework-to-process flows for the autonomous operational models. Examples operations may include supporting multi-provider interconnects for the autonomous operational models.","It is noted that in an example, the operations may be implemented at least in part using an end-user interface (e.g., web-based interface). The end-user is able to make predetermined selections, and the operations described above are implemented on a back-end device to present results to a user. The user can then make further selections. It is also noted that various of the operations described herein may be automated or partially automated.","The example embodiments shown and described are provided for purposes of illustration and are not intended to be limiting.
