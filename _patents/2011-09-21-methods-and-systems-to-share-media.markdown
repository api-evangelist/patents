{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The disclosure is related to digital content and, more particularly, to methods and systems to share media.","Technological advancements have increased the accessibility of music content, as well as other types of media, such as television content, movies, and interactive content. For example, a user can access audio, video, or both audio and video content over the Internet through an online store, an Internet radio station, an online music service, an online movie service, and the like, in addition to the more traditional avenues of accessing audio and video content.","In addition, the drawings are for the purpose of illustrating example embodiments, but it is understood that the present disclosure is not limited to the arrangements and instrumentality shown in the drawings.","I. Overview","Certain embodiments disclosed herein enable media sharing in a social context. Certain embodiments disclosed herein enable improved integration of users who may subscribe to different online media services. Certain embodiments disclosed herein provide music sharing in a social network. Certain embodiments disclosed herein make use of networked audio systems in two or more households to allow media sharing amongst those two or more households via the networked audio systems. Certain embodiments described herein provide cross-service linking amongst media providers. Certain embodiments described herein provide route-to-best media searching. Additional embodiments are described herein.","For example, in an embodiment such as described more below, media such as, for example, music can be shared amongst users who might not otherwise have access to the same file on a shared storage medium and\/or do not have access to the same online music service (Rhapsody\u2122, MOG, Napster\u2122, and Spotify\u2122 are all current examples of an online music service). Online music services may be free or based on a paid subscription. Most often, if not every time, an online music services requires a user to register with the service.","Assume for this example that a music playlist of a first user is made available to or shared with a second user. The music playlist may contain a list of track titles and the artist and\/or album associated with the track title. The music playlist may contain one or more track titles. Additionally, in this example, the first and second users do not have access to the same file on a shared storage medium and do not have access to the same online music service.","The music playlist may be made available to, or shared with, the second user in a number of ways, such as by making the playlist available on a social site like Facebook or via a social service system made available by a consumer electronics company to improve the social experience of music through its many households of networked audio systems (e.g., Sonos manufactures and sells networked audio systems and such a system may offer a social portal for connecting households though the sharing of media), sending it via email, text, instant messaging and\/or Twitter, posting the playlist in a digital magazine or website where the second user can access it and\/or providing the playlist to the second user through some other known or future developed method or system.","To play one or more songs selected from the playlist by the second user, the system or some aspect thereof, such as described more below, may search for the music file that best pertains to (or matches) the selected track title in the second user's local library of music and\/or initiate a search at an online music service subscribed to by the second user, if any and which can be a different online music service from the first user.","Subsequent to a successful search, the second user's system may retrieve and play the music at that time or add the music (e.g., with a proper pointer to a source of the second user) to a queue or holding place to be played at a later time. If the system cannot successfully locate the music, then it may indicate that result to the second user and\/or provide an option on how to obtain the music (e.g., providing a URL link to purchase the music). Note that in some embodiments, a software application written for the online music service (the program may be referred to as a \u201cmedia player\u201d), subscribed to by the second user, may be the program that enables playback of the music via computer speakers or an audio system in communication with the program. The media player may be automatically launched upon determining that the second user is a subscriber to the music service or at some time later to enable music playback.","Depending on the search and the system configuration, the actual track played by the second user may be from the same or different album as the track title from the playlist. In one example, the recommended song and the song retrieved by the second user might both be digital copies from the same album. In another example, the recommended song might be a digital copy from the original album, whereas the song retrieved by the second user may be a digital copy from a greatest hits album.","Additionally, depending on the search and the system configuration, the actual track played may be determined based in part on the quality of the music file. That is, in some embodiments, the higher quality music file may be played, if two or more music files pertaining to the selected track are found. In an alternative embodiment, the lower quality music file is played, if two or music files are found, so that less bandwidth may be consumed.","Moving on from the above illustration, an example embodiment of a method of sharing or matching music includes reading a music reference from a first user for a second user. The first user using a first music access service to access music. The example method also includes identifying a music file associated with the music reference and identifying a second music access service different than the first music access service used by second user to access the music. In addition, the example method includes using the second music access service to at least one of play, point to, or queue the music file.","In some embodiments, a \u201creference\u201d from a user may be an active reference or recommendation (e.g., the user offers a particular recommendation). In some embodiments, a \u201creference\u201d may be based on some other defined criteria (e.g., the user's listening or watching habits). In some embodiments, a \u201creference\u201d is a comment, an opinion, or a suggestion. In other examples, the \u201creference\u201d may be a gift such as, for example, where a first user purchases a music track for a second user.","Some example methods also include receiving a music request from the second user in response to the music reference prior to using the second music access service to at least one of play, point to, or queue the music file.","In some example methods, using the second music access service to at least one of play, point to, or queue the music file comprises searching online and\/or in a local storage for the music file.","Also, some example methods include using a third music access service used by the second user to access music in place of the second music access service to at least one of play, point to, or queue the music file where the third music access service provides at least one of less expensive access to the music than the second music access service or higher quality music files than the second music access service.","An example apparatus implemented in accordance with the present disclosure includes an interface to receive a file recommendation by a first user recommending a file and a verifier to detect a first service used by the first user and to detect a second service used by a second user. The example system also includes an encoder to associate a first service identification code with the file recommendation based on the first service used by the first user. In addition, the example system includes a searcher to search one or more of a local library or a network-accessible database for a second service identification code associated with the file based on the second service. In the system the encoder is to associate the second service identification code with the file, as well. In addition, the example includes a playback engine to provide the file recommendation with the first service identification code to the second user where the second service and the first service are the same service or to provide the file recommendation with the second service identification code to the second user where the second service and the first service are different services. The example system further includes a database to store a record associating one or more of the first service identification code or the second service identification code with the file recommendation.","In some embodiments, a \u201crecommendation\u201d from a user may be an active reference or recommendation (e.g., the user offers a particular recommendation). In some embodiments, a \u201crecommendation\u201d may be based on some other defined criteria (e.g., the user's listening or watching habits). In some embodiments a \u201crecommendation\u201d is synonymous with a \u201creference\u201d described above.","In some embodiments, the first user specifies the second user in the file recommendation and the searcher automatically searches for the second service identification code associated with the file. In some examples, the service identification codes include information related to one or more of the specific service or the specific file. For example, a service identification code for Michael Jackson's song \u201cBeat It\u201d on Spotify may include information related to one or more of the Spotify service itself, the song title \u201cBeat It\u201d, the artist Michael Jackson, the album \u201cThriller\u201d and\/or any of the genres pop, R&B, rock and\/or funk.","In some embodiments, the file is a music file. Also, in some embodiments, the music file is one or more of a track, an artist, an album, a playlist, a station or a genre. In other embodiments, the file is a video and audio file (e.g., a movie or television show).","In some embodiments, the encoder is to associate metadata with the file recommendation and the searcher is to locate the file based on the metadata when the second user does not use a second service.","In some embodiments, the database is to store a list of connections for the first user to form a social network. Also, in some embodiments, the example system includes an updater to dynamically inform the first user of additional file recommendations recommended by the connections.","In some embodiments, the playback engine automatically adds the file with the second service identification to a playlist at a playback device of the second user. In addition, in some embodiments, the playlist is currently playing.","In some embodiments, one of the first service or the second service is one or more of a music service, radio service, an online radio service or an online streaming music service.","In some embodiments, the interface is to receive an indication of the enjoyment level of the second user with respect to the file and the searcher to search for additional file recommendations based on the enjoyment level.","Another example method implemented in accordance with the present disclosure includes verifying a first service used by a first user upon receipt of a file recommendation by a first user recommending a file and encoding a first service identification code with the file based on the first service. The example method also includes verifying a second service used by a second user upon one or more of receipt of a file request by the second user or detection of a mention of the second user in the file recommendation. In addition, the example method includes searching one or more of a local library or a network-accessible database for a second service identification code associated with the file based on the second service. Furthermore, the example method includes encoding the second service identification with the file. The example method also includes providing the file recommendation with the first service identification code to the second user where the second service and the first service are the same service or providing the file recommendation with the second service identification code to the second user where the second service and the first service are different services. In addition, the example method includes storing a record associating one or more of the first service identification code or the second service identification code with the file.","In some embodiments, the example method includes encoding metadata with the file recommendation and locating the file based on the metadata when the second user does not use a second service.","In some embodiments, the method includes storing a list of connections for the first user to form a social network. Also, in some embodiments, the method includes dynamically informing the first user of additional file recommendations recommended by the connections","In some embodiments, the method includes automatically adding the file with the second service identification to a playlist at a playback device of the second user.","In some embodiments, the method further includes receiving an indication of the enjoyment level of the second user with respect to the file and searching for additional file recommendations based on the enjoyment level.","An example tangible machine-readable medium has instructions stored thereon implemented in accordance with the present disclosure that when executed, cause a machine to at least verify a first service used by a first user upon receipt of a file recommendation by a first user recommending a file and encode a first service identification code with the file based on the first service. The instructions, when executed, further cause the machine to verify a second service used by a second user upon one or more of receipt of a file request by the second user or detection of a mention of the second user in the file recommendation and search one or more of a local library or a network-accessible database for a second service identification code associated with the file based on the second service. The example instructions also cause the machine to encode the second service identification with the file. In addition, the example instructions cause the machine to provide the file recommendation with the first service identification code to the second user where the second service and the first service are the same service or providing the file recommendation with the second service identification code to the second user where the second service and the first service are different services. The example instructions further cause the machine to store a record associating one or more of the first service identification code or the second service identification code with the file.","In some embodiments, the example instructions cause the machine to encode metadata with the file recommendation and locate the file based on the metadata when the second user does not use a second service.","In some embodiments, the example instructions cause the machine to store a list of connections for the first user to form a social network. Also, in some embodiments, the example instructions cause the machine to dynamically inform the first user of additional file recommendations recommended by the connections","In some embodiments, the example instructions cause the machine to automatically add the file with the second service identification to a playlist at a playback device of the second user.","In some embodiments, the example instructions cause the machine to receive an indication of the enjoyment level of the second user with respect to the file and search for additional file recommendations based on the enjoyment level.","In some embodiments, a user can choose to \u201crecommend\u201d an artist and\/or album and\/or track. By choosing to recommend the media, an internal, service-specific identifier is encoded with the recommendation in a database for a set of users, such as friends. For example, if a user recommends a track using the online music service, Rhapsody, the system would encode a Rhapsody ID in the recommendation, so that when other users (e.g., his or her friends) see what is recommended the system will play if the other users happen to also have a Rhapsody account. In addition, the address book (e.g., a list of friends) could be stored on a centralized server and accessible through an audio system controller, such as described in  below, for example.","In some embodiments, the system could also allow for tracks on one music service to be played on another, by utilizing a search function. When the system gets an ID for a shared track, and discovers that the user does not have a subscription to that service, the system could then request the metadata (album\/artist\/title) for the track and run a search on whatever music service (and local library) is presently available. The actual list of artists\/albums\/tracks that the friends have recommended is treated by the system as a library item, so that the recommendations can be dynamically updated.","Although the following discloses example methods, apparatus, systems, and articles of manufacture including, among other components, firmware and\/or software executed on hardware, it should be noted that such methods, apparatus, systems, and\/or articles of manufacture are merely illustrative and should not be considered as limiting. For example, it is contemplated that any or all of these firmware, hardware, and\/or software components could be embodied exclusively in hardware, exclusively in software, exclusively in firmware, or in any combination of hardware, software, and\/or firmware. Accordingly, while the following describes example methods, apparatus, systems, and\/or articles of manufacture, the examples provided are not the only way(s) to implement such methods, apparatus, systems, and\/or articles of manufacture.","When any of the appended claims are read to cover a purely software and\/or firmware implementation, at least one of the elements in at least one example is hereby expressly defined to include a tangible medium such as a memory, DVD, CD, Blu-ray, etc., storing the software and\/or firmware.","These embodiments and many additional embodiments are described more below. Further, the detailed description is presented largely in terms of illustrative environments, systems, procedures, steps, logic blocks, processing, and other symbolic representations that directly or indirectly resemble the operations of data processing devices coupled to networks. These process descriptions and representations are typically used by those skilled in the art to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. Numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. However, it is understood to those skilled in the art that certain embodiments of the present disclosure may be practiced without certain, specific details. In other instances, well known methods, procedures, components, and circuitry have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring aspects of the embodiments.","Reference herein to \u201cembodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment can be included in at least one example embodiment of the invention. The appearances of this phrase in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment, nor are separate or alternative embodiments mutually exclusive of other embodiments. As such, the embodiments described herein, explicitly and implicitly understood by one skilled in the art, may be combined with other embodiments.","II. Example Environment","Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals may refer to like parts throughout the figures.  shows an example system configuration  in which one or more of the method and\/or apparatus disclosed herein may be practiced or implemented. By way of illustration, the system configuration  represents a home with multiple zones. Each zone, for example, represents a different room or space, such as an office, bathroom, bedroom, kitchen, dining room, family room, home theater room, utility or laundry room, and patio. While not shown here, a single zone may cover more than one room or space. One or more of zone players - are shown in each respective zone. A zone player -, also referred to as a playback device, multimedia unit, speaker, etc., provides audio, video, and\/or audiovisual output. A controller  (e.g., shown in the kitchen for purposes of illustration) provides control to the system configuration . The system configuration  illustrates an example whole house audio system, though it is understood that the technology described herein is not limited to its particular place of application or to an expansive system like a whole house audio system  of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A","FIGS. 2A","FIG. 1","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["2","2","200","204","200","204","2","2","102","124","200","208","208","200","200","200"]},"The example zone player  of  includes a built-in amplifier (not shown in this illustration) to power a set of detached speakers . The speakers  of  may include, for example, any type of loudspeaker. The zone player  of  can communicate a signal corresponding to audio content to the detached speakers  via wired and\/or wireless channels. Instead of receiving and generating audio content as in , the zone player  of  receives the audio content and transmits the same (e.g., after processing the received signal) to the detached speakers . Similar to the example zone player  of , in some embodiments the zone player  can transmit a second signal to, for example, other zone player(s) in the same or different zone(s), speaker(s), receiver(s), etc.","The example zone player  of  does not include an amplifier, but allows a receiver , or another audio and\/or video type device with built-in amplification, to connect to a data network  of  and to play audio received over the data network  via the receiver  and a set of detached speakers . In addition to the wired couplings shown in , the detached speakers  can receive audio content via a wireless communication channel between the detached speakers  and, for example, the zone player  and\/or the receiver . In some embodiments the zone player  can transmit a second signal to, for example, other zone player(s) in the same or different zone(s), speaker(s), receiver(s), etc.","Example zone players include a \u201cSonos\u00ae S5,\u201d \u201cSonos Play:5,\u201d \u201cZonePlayer 120,\u201d and \u201cZonePlayer 90,\u201d which are offered by Sonos, Inc. of Santa Barbara, Calif. A zone player may also be referred to herein as a playback device, and a zone player is not limited to the particular examples illustrated in , B, and C. For example, a zone player may include a wired or wireless headphone. In another example, a zone player might include a subwoofer. In an example, a zone player may include or interact with a docking station for an Apple iPod\u2122 or similar device. In some embodiments, a zone player may relay one or more signals received from, for example, a first zone player to another playback device. In some embodiments, a zone player may receive a first signal and generate an output corresponding to the first signal and, simultaneously or separately, may receive a second signal and transmit or relay the second signal to another zone player(s), speaker(s), receiver(s), etc. Thus, an example zone player described herein can act as a playback device and, at the same time, operate as a hub in a network of zone players. In such instances, media content corresponding to the first signal may be different from the media content corresponding to the second signal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","302","300","130","300","304","300","100","300","100","100","300","128","128"]},"Referring back to the system configuration  of , a particular zone may contain one or more zone players. For example, the family room of  contains two zone players  and , while the kitchen is shown with one zone player . Zones may be dynamically configured by positioning a zone player in a room or space and assigning via the controller  the zone player to a new or existing zone. As such, zones may be created, combined with another zone, removed, and given a specific name (e.g., \u201cKitchen\u201d), if so programmed. The zone players  to  are coupled directly or indirectly to a data network, such as the data network  shown in . The data network  is represented by an octagon in the figure to stand out from other components shown in the figure. While the data network  is shown in a single location, it is understood that such a network may be distributed in and around the system configuration .","Particularly, the data network  may be a wired network, a wireless network, or a combination of both. In some embodiments, one or more of the zone players - are wirelessly coupled to the data network  based on a proprietary mesh network. In some embodiments, one or more of the zone players - are wirelessly coupled to the data network  using a non-mesh topology. In some embodiments, one or more of the zone players - are coupled via a wire to the data network  using Ethernet or similar technology. In addition to the one or more zone players - connecting to the data network , the data network  may further allow access to a wide area network, such as the Internet.","In certain embodiments, the data network  may be created by connecting any of the zone players -, or some other connecting device, to a broadband router. Other zone players - may then be added wired or wirelessly to the data network . For example, a zone player (e.g., any of zone players -) may be added to the system configuration  by simply pressing a button on the zone player itself, which enables a connection to be made to the data network . The broadband router may be connected to an Internet Service Provider (ISP), for example. The broadband router may be used to form another data network within the system configuration , which may be used in other applications (e.g., web surfing). The data network  may also be used in other applications, if so programmed. Further, in certain embodiments, the data network  is the same network used for other applications in the household.","In certain embodiments, each zone can play from the same audio source as another zone or each zone can play from a different audio source. For example, someone can be grilling on the patio and listening to jazz music via zone player , while someone is preparing food in the kitchen and listening to classical music via zone player . Further, someone can be in the office listening to the same jazz music via zone player  that is playing on the patio via zone player . In some embodiments, the jazz music played via zone players  and  is played in synchrony. Synchronizing playback amongst zones allows for someone to pass through zones while seamlessly listening to the audio. Further, zones may be put into a \u201cparty mode\u201d such that all associated zones will play audio in synchrony.","In certain embodiments, a zone contains two or more zone players. For example, the family room contains two zone players  and , and the home theater room contains at least zone players , , and . A zone may be configured to contain as many zone players as desired, and for example, the home theater room might contain additional zone players to play audio from a 5.1 channel or greater audio source (e.g., a movie encoded with 5.1 or greater audio channels). If a zone contains two or more zone players, such as the two zone players  and  in the family room, then the two zone players  and  may be configured to play the same audio source in synchrony, or the two zone players  and  may be paired to play two separate sounds in left and right channels, for example. In other words, the stereo effects of a sound may be reproduced or enhanced through the two zone players  and , one for the left sound and the other for the right sound. In certain embodiments, paired zone players may play audio in synchrony with other zone players.","In certain embodiments, three or more zone players may be configured to play various channels of audio that is encoded with three channels or more sound. For example, the home theater room shows zone players , , and . If the sound is encoded as 2.1 channel audio, then the zone player  may be configured to play left channel audio, the zone player  may be configured to play right channel audio, and the zone player  may be configured to play bass frequencies. Other configurations are possible and depend on the number of zone players and the type of audio. Further, a particular zone may be configured to play a 5.1 channel audio in one instance, such as when playing audio from a movie, and then dynamically switch to play stereo, such as when playing audio from a two channel source.","In certain embodiments, two or more zone players may be sonically consolidated to form a single, consolidated zone player. A consolidated zone player (though made up of multiple, separate devices) may be configured to process and reproduce sound differently than an unconsolidated zone player or zone players that are paired, because a consolidated zone player will have additional speaker drivers from which sound may be passed. The consolidated zone player may further be paired with a single zone player or yet another consolidated zone player. Each playback device of a consolidated playback device is preferably set in a consolidated mode.","According to some embodiments, one can continue to do any of: group, consolidate, and pair zone players, for example, until a desired configuration is complete. The actions of grouping, consolidation, and pairing are preferably performed through a control interface, such as using controller , and not by physically connecting and re-connecting speaker wire, for example, to individual, discrete speakers to create different configurations. As such, certain embodiments described herein provide a more flexible and dynamic platform through which sound reproduction can be offered to the end-user.","Sources of audio content to be played by zone players - are numerous. Music from a personal library stored on a computer or networked-attached storage (NAS) may be accessed via the data network  and played. Internet radio stations, shows, and podcasts may be accessed via the data network . Music services that let a user stream and download music and audio content may be accessed via the data network . Further, music may be obtained from traditional sources, such as a turntable or CD player, via a line-in connection to a zone player, for example. Audio content may also be accessed through AirPlay\u2122 wireless technology by Apple, Inc., for example. Audio content received from one or more sources may be shared amongst the zone players  to  via the data network  and\/or the controller .","Regardless of where a user of the system configuration  obtains access to his or her audio, the user may share his or her listening experience with a user of a different system configuration, such as a different household. As such, an account holder on a subscription service may share songs with account holders of other subscriptions services. In addition, search capabilities allow songs to be shared across music services or in a local library, by searching for the artist, album, and\/or title.","III. Example Media Share System","Referring now to , there is shown an example functional block diagram of a file or media share or match system  in accordance with an embodiment. The file share system  may be used, for example, by a user operating any of the zone players - of . The file share system , or aspects thereof, may be used, for example, by a user of a social networking service that may be independent of the system configuration  of .","The example system  includes a plurality of users, e.g., a first user  and a second user  that are communicatively coupled to an intermediary . The first user , the second user  and the intermediary  are coupled via communication lines , which may be, for example, any suitable cable or wireless based communication lines. The first user , second user  and intermediary  may communicate in accordance with any suitable communications protocol including, for example, the Music Open Application Programming Interface (MOAPI). Also, though two users ,  are shown in  any number of users may be communicatively coupled to the intermediary .","The example intermediary  may be, for example, an online social network and\/or file sharing service system that is interconnected between the plurality of users , . The intermediary  may be a web-based subsystem and\/or may be applications installed at the users , . In the example of , the intermediary  includes an interface , which is used to communicate with the first user , the second user  and a network database  as described in more detail below. In addition, the first user  includes a first interface , and the second user  includes a second interface , which are used to facilitate interaction between each of the first user  and the second user  and the system , respectively.","In the example system , the first user  has a playback device , which is any type of device that is used to view, hear, handle, operate, consume or otherwise utilize a file. An example playback device  may be the controller  described above and\/or a computer, a mobile phone, an MP3 player, a tablet, a stereo, a radio, a television or any other suitable device. The file may be, for example, a musical file, a video, a newspaper article, a book, a magazine or any other media. Example musical files include a musical track, an artist, an album a playlist or a genre. The first user includes a library or local database  that may store the file. However, in some example, the local database  stores an identification of the file and the file is located elsewhere including, for example, on the network database , which may be, for example, the Internet. The first user is coupled to the network database  via the communication lines  discussed above. Also, the second user  includes a second playback device  and second local database , which correlate with features described with respect to the first playback device  and first local database .","The example playback device  operates a service to provide the first user access to the file. For example, the playback device  may operate one or more free or paid subscription-based services such as, for example, Spotify\u2122 or Rhapsody\u2122 online streaming music services, Pandora\u00ae or Last.fm Internet radio music recommendation services or other radio services. The playback device  may also operate using files from the local database  such as, for example, iTunes or any other media player computer program. In addition, the playback device  may obtain and display files from any website including, for example, YouTube or any other online file sharing website or repository. Also, the playback device  may interact with online vendors to obtain files including, for example iTune Store or Napster\u2122.","In an example operation of the example system , the first user  uses the playback device  to consume a first file (e.g., listen to a music track). The first user  may wish to recommend the file to the second user  or generally recommend the file to any other user in his network or anyone in the public. For example, the first user  may wish to recommend a specific music, an entire album, the work of an artist, a particular playlist of music tracks and\/or a specific genre of music. In some embodiments, the first user  enters an indication that he wants recommend the file, which is transmitted via the interface  and communication line  to the intermediary , which receives the recommendation at the interface . The intermediary  includes a verifier  that detects the service used by the first user. When the service has been detected, an encoder  associates a service identification code with the file recommendation based on the service used by the first user .","If the recommendation does not name a specific user to whom the recommendation was made, the intermediary  may communicate the recommendation for a period of time or perpetually generally to the public or a network of friends of the first user . If a user (e.g., the second user ) wants to investigate the recommendation, i.e., download and consume the file, the second user  can send a request for the file via the interface  and communication line  to the intermediary , which is received at the interface . The verifier  then investigates the second user  to determine what service the second user operates to access files. Additionally or alternatively, if the recommendation included a specifically named user (e.g., the second user ), the verifier  could automatically investigate the second user  to determine what service the second user operates without waiting for a file request from the second user .","The intermediary  includes a playback engine  to provide the file recommendation with the first service identification code to the second user  where the second service and the first service are the same service. Thus, if the first user  uses First Service A (e.g., Spotify\u2122) and the second user  also uses First Service A (i.e., Spotify\u2122) then the intermediary , via the playback engine , will pass the file recommendation with the First Service A identification encoded therein to the second user , who can then obtain the file via First Service A and consume the file upon receipt.","When the verifier  determines that the second user  uses Second Service B (e.g., Rhapsody\u2122), the intermediary  takes steps to connect the second user  with the file because the First Service A encoded file recommendation will not translate to Second Service B. That is, the Second Service B will not recognize the file recommendation because of the First Service A identification. In this example, a searcher  searches a local library (e.g., the local database ) or a network-accessible database (e.g., the Internet) for a second service identification code to associate with the file based on the Second Service B. When located, the encoder associates the second service identification code with the file. In addition, the playback engine  provides the file recommendation with the Second Service B identification code to the second user . With the recommendation and a recognizable code, Second Service B can locate and present the file to the second user . In some examples, the searcher  searches the local library (e.g., the local database ) or the network-accessible database (e.g., the Internet) for the file based on metadata related to the file such as for example, data identifying the title, artist and\/or album, regardless of the Second Service B.","When the verifier  determines that the second user  does not use any service, the intermediary  takes steps to connect the second user  with the file because the First Service A encoded file recommendation will not translate to a serviceless media player at the second user . In this example, the searcher  obtains metadata related to the file such as for example, data identifying the title, artist and\/or album. With the appropriate metadata, the intermediary  can locate the file in the network database , obtain the file and present it to the second user .","The example intermediary  also includes a central database  to store a record associating the first service identification code, the second service identification code and\/or the metadata with the file recommendation. Thus, in some examples, if the first user  and the second user  user different services, the intermediary  can check the central database  to determine if a translation between the different service identification codes was previously mapped, which will save the searcher  from having to access the network database .","The database may also include a mapping of a list of friends or connections for each user ,  and, therefore, host a social network for the users , . Furthermore, the example intermediary  may include an updater  that dynamically informs the users ,  of additional file recommendations recommended by any of the connections in the users' respective networks. The updater  periodically checks the connections for new recommendations or receives the recommendations in real time.","Each user ,  can also search inside and outside of their respective social networks for recommendations and\/or for further members as potential connections. For example, a user could browse for members and, for each member, manage the connection (e.g., invite the member to be a connection, ignore an invitation or delete a connection), view the member's file (e.g., track, artist, album and\/or genre) recommendations. Each user can also browse for file recommended by a specific connection or by all their connections in general. In addition, the users can browse for file recommendations by the entire community, i.e., even those member to whom the user is not connected. The file recommendation searches can be particular to a specific type of file such as, for example, track, artist, album and\/or genre. In addition, the searching hierarchy may include a browse node that is a no-op. For example, when an affirmation is made to connect with a member, the intermediary  could act to search for recommendations through the new connection's history or otherwise take no other action.","In some examples, when a recommendation citing a specific user is received at the intermediary , the playback engine  can automatically add the file, via the service identification and recommendation, to a playlist at a playback device of the specified user. In some examples, the playlist is currently playing. That is, in some examples, if a first user  recommends a file (e.g., a song) for the second user , the playback engine  will queue the song for immediate play at the playback device  of the second user .","In addition, as described in below, the interfaces , ,  receive an indication of the enjoyment level of the users ,  with respect to the file, or any other file. The searcher  may search for additional file recommendations based on the enjoyment level.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 7","FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","406","410","426","428","432","430","434","436","712","700","712","712","400","406","410","426","428","432","430","434","436"]},"As mentioned above, the example processes of  may be implemented using coded instructions (e.g., computer readable instructions) stored on a tangible computer readable medium such as a hard disk drive, a flash memory, a read-only memory (ROM), a compact disk (CD), a digital versatile disk (DVD), a cache, a random-access memory (RAM) and\/or any other storage media in which information is stored for any duration (e.g., for extended time periods, permanently, brief instances, for temporarily buffering, and\/or for caching of the information).

For example, the user may explicitly offer a particular recommendation (e.g., \u201cJohn likes \u2018Our Love is Here to Stay\u2019 by Bill Evans\u201d). In some embodiments, a \u201creference\u201d or \u201crecommendation\u201d may be based on some other defined criteria, if the user allows such information to be shared. For example, the user's listening habits using a device of the sort described with respect to the system configuration  might be tracked and offered as a user specific recommendation (e.g., \u201cJohn listens to \u2018Seal it With a Kiss\u2019 by Britney Spears\u201d) or a general public-type recommendation. That is, the system may track what the user is actually listening to through the system (a benefit of this embodiment can include a wider range of listening data, because the audio may come from a number of different sources and be played through the system) and provide that information in the form of a reference recommendation. Regardless of whether the reference or recommendation is an active or not, the reference or recommendation may be made in real-time (as the user is listening to the music) if so desired.","The example method  determines if a second user (e.g., the second user ) is mentioned in the file recommendation by the first user (block ). If the second user is mentioned by the first user in the file recommendation, the process  continues to verify the second service used by the second user to access files (block ). The process  determines if the second service is the same as the first service (block ). If the second service is the same as the first service, i.e., if both the first user and the second user use the same service to access files (e.g., play streaming music), the file recommendation with the first service ID (which would be the same as or substantially similar to the second service ID in this example) is sent to the second user and the file is queued for consumption (e.g., play) by the second user (block ). The first service identification code may include a URL, tinyURL and\/or any other suitable pointer to the file. The process  then ends (block ) until the next recommendation is received or another recommendation is processed.","If, when the second service of the second user is verified (block ), it is determined that the second service of the second user is not the same as the first service used by the first user (block ), the process determines if any second service exists, i.e., if the second user uses any particular service for accessing files (block ). If the second user does not use or subscribe to a second service (or the first service), the process  searches for the recommended file via metadata that is associated with or encoded with the file recommendation by, for example, the encoder  of  (block ) so that the process  can connect the second user with the recommended file by matching the file recommended by the first user using the first service with the file as hosted by an alternative service. In some examples, the process  searches using, for example, a music track title, on a free music access service. When the recommended file is located, the file is downloaded and\/or a link to the file is sent to the second user, and the file is queued for consumption by the second user (block ). The process  then ends (block ) until the next recommendation is received or another recommendation is processed.","If, when the second service of the second user is verified (block ), it is determined that the second service of the second user is not the same as the first service used by the first user (block ) and the second service exists, i.e., the second user uses a second, different, service to access files (block ), the process  searches (e.g., with the searcher ) for a second service identification code for the recommended file (block ). The second service identification code may include a URL, tinyURL and\/or any other suitable pointer to the file. The file recommendation is encoded with the second service identification (block ) using, for example, the encoder  so that the process  can connect the second user with the recommended file by matching the file recommended by the first user using the first service with the file as hosted by the second service. In addition, the file recommendation with the second service identification is stored (block ) in, for example, the database . In some examples, the database  may serve as a translator between two services to match files between the two services if, for example, the database  includes service codes for two services related to the same recommended file. The process  then sends the second service identification and associated file recommendation to the second user and queues the recommended file for consumption by the second user (block ). The process  then ends (block ) until the next recommendation is received or another recommendation is processed.","In some examples, the process  does not search for a second service identification code even though the second user uses a second service to access files. In such embodiments, the process  may identify the file from the file recommendation such as, for example, via the first service identification or metadata, and the process  may use the second service to access the file. Thus, after determining that the second service exists (block ), the example process  may search for the file or a pointer to the file using metadata (block ). For example, after reading the file recommendation for a music track, the process  may determine the title, author and\/or album of the recommended music track. With this information, the process  can access the second service to obtain or locate the recommended music track so that the process  can connect the second user with the recommended file by matching the file recommended by the first user using the first service with the file as hosted by the second service without obtaining or employing a second service identification code. In this example, the process  may also search for the file or a pointer to the file on a free service, regardless of the presence of the second service.","In some examples, the process  determines that the second user is not mentioned in the file recommendation (block ). For example, the first user may indicate that he likes a certain file, he may recommend the file to no other user in particular but, rather, to the network or community at large, or the user's currently used files (e.g., currently played music tracks) are automatically mentioned in a file recommendation. When no second user is identified in a file recommendation (block ), the example process  determines if a second user (or third user, fourth user, etc.) requests the recommended file (block ). If a second user requests the recommended file, control of the example process  returns to block  where the second service of the second user is verified. If a second user does not request the recommended file, the process  will sit idle (for this particular file recommendation) (block ) until it is determined that a second user requests the recommended file (block ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","418","422","402","404","300","600","602","604","606","608","610"]},"The control panel  includes buttons or keys to control the use of a file including, for example, playing, stopping or pausing of a music track, skipping to the next track, repeating a track and controlling a volume.","Current status panel  shows a file that is currently being used. The current status panel  also includes an icon or button  that the user can activate to indicate that a file is enjoyed. The current status panel  also includes an icon or button  to indicate that the user would like to recommend the current file. If the user activates the recommend button , the user may be prompted to provide additional information such as, for example, a specific user to whom the user wants to recommend the file.","The queue panel  shows other files that are in position for being used. The queue may change dynamically, for example, based on the acceptance or receipt of a recommended file as detailed above. In addition, the queue panel  includes icons  to indicate that a user likes a specific file and recommend buttons  to recommend the file, though the file is not currently being used or consumed.","The network update panel  shows recent activity of connections in the user's network. Though only one activity is shown in the graphical user interface  of , any number of activities including, for example, a scrolling thread may appear as well. The network update panel  in this example shows that a friend or connection (e.g., Friend ) likes a certain file (e.g., X music track). The user is prompted in the network update panel  to request the file if desired by activating the request icon . The network update panel  may include information related to recommendation made specifically to the user or any other activity in the user's network or that is otherwise public including, for example, activity between two of the user's connections.","The network list panel  shows a list of the friends or connections in the user's network. In the example, friends F-F are shown, but the network list panel  could include a scrolling list. In addition, the user may interact with or view history activity of the connections listed in the network list panel  by selecting a particular connection. In addition, the user may provide recommended files for a particular connection by dragging a file name and dropping on the connection's name.

Traditional social networks such as, for example, Twitter or Facebook, are directed to sharing textual information, i.e., a text string that indicates what a user is doing, what a user enjoys, what music a user is listening to, etc. The examples disclosed herein allow the actual music file to be shared and\/or allow a music file to be matched between different music access services. These examples may be implemented using web-accessible systems including, for example, the systems of , described above. In these examples, one account holder or user using a first music service including subscription-based services (e.g., Rhapsody) may share songs with other account holder, and the systems described herein include search capabilities that enable sharing and\/or matching of music across music services or in a local library by searching, for example, an artist, a title and\/or an album.","In certain embodiments, a MOAPI (Music Open Application Programming Interface) based music service is established. Users that wish to join the service request an account. In some examples, there is no initial web page to go to first to create credentials, a user can choose a username and password from a controller, which, if available, becomes the user's account. In some examples, a standard like Open Auth (Initiative for Open Authentication) may be employed.","In some examples, on a \u2018Now Playing\u2019 screen (e.g., the interface  of ), a user can choose to \u201crecommend\u201d media (e.g., an artist\/album\/track). The recommendation initiates one or more transactions including, for example, adding or encoding a service-specific identifier to a database for the user's connections. Thus, if a user recommends a file in from one service (e.g., a Rhapsody track), the example systems and methods described herein encodes the first service identification code (e.g. Rhapsody ID) in the recommendation, so that when any of the user's connections sees what the user recommended, the recommended file (e.g., music track) will play if the connection happens to have the same file access service (i.e., in this example, Rhapsody). Firmware adaptations may be used to execute web-based searches and\/or to decode any encoded service identification codes.","In some examples, as described above, the system boasts an address book, which includes a list of the connections of a user. In some examples, the address book is stored at a central server (e.g., at the central database ).","In some examples, a user's connections may not use the same service to access files that the user uses. For example, one connection of the user may use the Spotify service to access and\/or play music tracks while the user uses the Rhapsody service. In some examples, the example system allows for files (e.g., music tracks) on one service to be played on another via one or more of the searches described herein. For example, when system (e.g., the intermediary ) receives an identification for a shared track (e.g., a recommended music track) from the user and discovers (e.g., via the verifier ) that the connection (i.e., second user) does not have a subscription to the first service (e.g., the connection does not subscribe to Rhapsody), the system may request metadata (e.g., album, artist and\/or title) for the music track and conduct a search on whatever service the connection uses (in this example, Spotify) and\/or also search the connection's local library.","In addition, in some examples, a list of files (e.g., artists\/albums\/tracks) that the connections of a user have recommended is treated by the system (e.g., by the intermediary ) as a library item. This facilitates the dynamic updating of what a user's connections have recommended as the recommendations occur.

In some examples, the example intermediary  may act as a Twitter receiver to allow the recipient (e.g., the user) to directly add a recommended track or album to his or her library or queue.","Also, as detailed above, in some examples, users opt-in to a system\/service by publishing a username and profile and adding other users to a connections\/friends list, which includes a feature or process for finding friends, approving adding a friend, and syncing or updating friend lists.","In some examples, when a user plays a track, the systems described herein provide a feature or process to share the music with one or more friend(s). Also, in some examples, the systems described herein obtain music the user's friends shared with the user. In some examples, the user may press or click a button on his or her controller to \u201crecommend\u201d a track, album, artist, station (e.g., Pandora, Last.FM, or other radio station) to his or her friends (i.e., connections or followers). For example, if a user is listening to a track on Rhapsody and presses the \u201crecommend\u201d button, a menu may appears that offers the user additional options for instigating and\/or customizing the recommendation including, for example, an indication to choose to recommend the track, an indication to choose to recommend the album, an indication to choose to recommend to artist, an indication to choose to recommend the station, etc. The user could also choose to send a customize message with the recommendation throughout the network, to a particular other user and\/or to another network (e.g., Facebook or Twitter) such as, for example one or more tweets that broadcast the recommendation (e.g., \u201cI'm enjoying the track \u2018Knock 'Em Out\u2019 on the Album \u2018Alright, Still\u2019 by Lily Allen on my Sonos system.\u201d; \u201cI'm enjoying the Album \u2018Alright, Still\u2019 by Lily Allen on my Sonos system.\u201d; \u201cI'm enjoying listening to Lily Allen on my Sonos system.\u201d; and\/or \u201cI\u2032m enjoying listening to Bruce Springsteen Radio on my Sonos system.\u201d).","In some examples, the example systems include an interface to enable the user to input account information for other social network sites (e.g., for the user to enter Twitter or Facebook account information). Also, in some examples, the example system includes a user interface button on, for example, a \u201cNow Playing\u201d screen that guides the user through menu options, as described above. In addition, in some examples, the example system includes a common code that takes the request arguments or recommendation and sends an API to the other social networks coupled to the user's account. Also, in some examples, an option is included for the user to provide a preference to indicate which of any other social networks coupled to the user's account to send recommendations (e.g., to Twitter, Facebook, or both).","In some examples, the example system adapts the recommendation to a format associated with any other social network including, for example, limiting recommendations to 140 characters or less for Twitter. Also, in some examples, the example system automatically, includes URLs for the recommended track\/station streams and\/or tinyURLs (e.g., for Twitter).","The example systems and methods described herein also enable users across various geographic territories including, for example, different countries to share files. For example, a user in the US could recommend a music track to a user in Sweden (regardless of the services each user uses to access music, as detailed above), and the user in Sweden could use the recommendation to queue, point to, obtain, download, play or comment about the music track. In some examples, the example system enables the sharing or matching of files despite licensing agreements containing territory-specific restrictions on the files (e.g., songs) because the example system uses the second service used by the recipient\/second user to match the recommended file with a file in the second service and, thus, in accordance with the user license obtained by the second user with the second service. Thus, in such examples, a global mapping system is applied.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["700","400","406","410","426","428","432","430","434","436","700"]},"The computer  of the instant example includes a processor . For example, the processor  can be implemented by one or more Intel\u00ae microprocessors from the Pentium\u00ae family, the Itanium\u00ae family or the XScale\u00ae family. Of course, other processors from other families are also appropriate.","The processor  is in communication with a main memory including a volatile memory  and a non-volatile memory  via a bus . The volatile memory  may be implemented by Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM), Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), RAMBUS Dynamic Random Access Memory (RDRAM) and\/or any other type of random access memory device. The non-volatile memory  may be implemented by flash memory and\/or any other desired type of memory device. Access to the main memory ,  is typically controlled by a memory controller (not shown).","The computer  also includes an interface circuit . The interface circuit  may be implemented by any type of interface standard, such as an Ethernet interface, a universal serial bus (USB), and\/or a PCI express interface.","One or more input devices  are connected to the interface circuit . The input device(s)  permit a user to enter data and commands into the processor . The input device(s) can be implemented by, for example, a keyboard, a mouse, a touchscreen, a track-pad, a trackball, isopoint and\/or a voice recognition system.","One or more output devices  are also connected to the interface circuit . The output devices  can be implemented, for example, by display devices (e.g., a liquid crystal display, a cathode ray tube display (CRT), a printer and\/or speakers). The interface circuit , thus, typically includes a graphics driver card.","The interface circuit  also includes a communication device (e.g., the request servicer) such as a modem or network interface card to facilitate exchange of data with external computers via a network  (e.g., an Ethernet connection, a digital subscriber line (DSL), a telephone line, coaxial cable, a cellular telephone system, etc.).","The computer  also includes one or more mass storage devices  for storing software and data. Examples of such mass storage devices  include floppy disk drives, hard drive disks, compact disk drives, and digital versatile disk (DVD) drives. The mass storage device  may implement the storage database , , .","The coded instructions of  may be stored in the mass storage device , in the volatile memory , in the non-volatile memory , and\/or on a removable storage medium such as a CD or DVD.","Various inventions have been described in sufficient detail with a certain degree of particularity.
