The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to a nanofluid that contains carbon nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles and a surfactant in a thermal transfer fluid. The present invention also relates to processes for producing such a nanofluid with enhanced thermal conductive properties.","Conventional heat transfer fluids such as water, mineral oil, and ethylene glycol play an important role in many industries including power generation, chemical production, air conditioning, transportation, and microelectronics. However, their inherently low thermal conductivities have hampered the development of energy-efficient heat transfer fluids that are required in a plethora of heat transfer applications. It has been demonstrated recently that the heat transfer properties of these conventional fluids can be significantly enhanced by dispersing nanometer-sized solid particles and fibers (i.e. nanoparticles) in fluids (Eastman, et al., . (2001), 78(6):718-720; Choi, et al., . (2001), 79(14):2252-2254). This new type of heat transfer suspension is referred to herein as a nanofluid. In particular, carbon nanotube-containing nanofluids provide several advantages over conventional fluids, including thermal conductivities far above those of traditional solid\/liquid suspensions, a nonlinear relationship between thermal conductivity and concentration, strongly temperature-dependent thermal conductivity, and a significant increase in critical heat flux. Each of these features is highly desirable for thermal systems and together, they make nanofluids good candidates for the next generation of heat transfer fluids.","The observed substantial increases in the thermal conductivities of nanofluids can have broad industrial applications and can also potentially generate numerous economical and environmental benefits. Enhancement in the heat transfer ability could translate into high energy efficiency, better performance, and low operating costs. The need for maintenance and repair can also be minimized by developing a nanofluid with a better wear and load-carrying capacity. Consequently, classical heat dissipating systems widely used today can become smaller and lighter, thus resulting in better fuel efficiency, less emission, and a cleaner environment.","Nanoparticles of various materials have been used individually to make heat transfer fluids, including copper, aluminum, copper oxide, alumina, titania, and carbon nanotubes (Keblinski, et al, , (2005), 36-44). Of these nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes show the greatest promise due to their excellent chemical stability and extraordinary thermal conductivity. Carbon nanotubes are macromolecules having the shape of a long thin cylinder and thus have a high aspect ratio. There are two main types of carbon nanotubes: single-walled nanotubes (\u201cSWNT\u201d) and multi-walled nanotubes (\u201cMWNT\u201d). The structure of a single-walled carbon nanotube can be described as a single graphene sheet rolled into a seamless cylinder with ends that are either open, or capped by either half fullerenes or more complex structures such as pentagons. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes contains two or more nanotubes that are concentrically nested, like rings of a tree trunk, with a typical distance of approximately 0.34 nm between layers.","Carbon nanotubes are one of the most thermally conductive materials known today. Basic research over the past decade has shown that carbon nanotubes have a thermal conductivity an order of magnitude higher than copper (3,000 watts per meter Kevin (W\/mK) for multi-walled carbon nanotubes and 6,000 W\/mK for single-walled carbon nanotubes). Therefore, the thermal conductivities of nanofluids containing carbon nanutubes are significantly enhanced when compared with conventional fluids. A 150% increase in conductivity of oil that contains about 1% by volume of multi-walled carbon nanotubes has been reported recently (Choi, et al., ., (2001), 79(14):2252-2254).","Several additional studies of carbon nanotube suspensions in various heat transfer fluids have also been reported. However, only moderate enhancements in thermal conductivity have been observed. Xie, et al., reported that a carbon nanotube suspension in an aqueous solution of organic liquids results in only 10-20% increases in thermal conductivity at 1% by volume of carbon nanotubes (Xie, et al., ., (2003), 94(8):4967-4971). Similarly, Wen and Ding found an about 25% enhancement in the conductivity at about 0.8% by volume of carbon nanotubes in water (Wen and Ding, ., (2004), 18:481-483). Even at these levels, carbon nanotubes still hold great promise as being the next generation of efficient thermal transfer fluids.","Despite the extraordinarily promising thermal properties exhibited by carbon nanotube suspensions, it remains to be a serious technical challenge to effectively and efficiently disperse carbon nanotubes into aqueous or organic media to produce a nanoparticle suspension with a sustainable stability and having consistent thermal properties. Due to the hydrophobic nature of graphitic structure, unmodified carbon nanotubes are not soluble in any known solvent. They also have a very high tendency to form aggregates and extended structures of linked nanoparticles, thus leading to phase separation, poor dispersion within a matrix, and poor adhesion to the host. However, stability of the nanoparticle suspension is essential for practical industrial applications. Otherwise, the thermal properties of a nanofluid, such as thermal conductivity, will constantly change as the solid nanoparticles gradually separate from the fluid. Unfortunately, these early studies on carbon nanotube-containing nanofluids have primarily focused on the enhancement of thermal conductivity, and very little experimental data is available regarding the stability of these nanoparticle suspensions.","Accordingly, there is a need for the development of a stable nanoparticle-containing fluid and methods for efficiently dispersing carbon nanoparticles into a desired heat transfer fluid to produce a nanofluid with a sustainable stability and consistent thermal properties. Hence, the present invention provides a nanofluid, which comprises a conventional heat transfer fluid, carbon nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles and a surfactant. The metal oxide nanoparticles in combination with the surfactant are used to facilitate the dispersion of the carbon nanoparticles and to increase the stability of the nanofluid. The present invention also provides methods for preparing such carbon nanoparticle-containing fluid with enhanced thermal conductive properties.","The present invention provides a nanofluid with enhanced thermal conductive properties, which comprises a conventional thermal transfer fluid, and carbon and non-carbon nanoparticles.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the nanofluid comprises a hydrophilic thermal transfer fluid, carbon nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles and a surfactant. The hydrophilic nanofluid may further comprise other chemical additives to enhance the characteristics of the nanofluid.","Accordingly, in one embodiment, the nanofluid of the present invention is a composition comprising carbon nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles having a pHpzc, and at least one surfactant having a net negative charge in a hydrophilic thermal transfer fluid, wherein the composition has a pH below the pHpzc of the metal oxide nanoparticles.","The nanoparticles of the present invention may include, for example, diamond nanoparticles, graphite nanoparticles, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and carbon fibers. The carbon nanotubes may be single walled (SWNTs) or multi-walled (MWNTs.)","The hydrophilic thermal transfer fluid may be, for example, water, alkyl alcohols, alkylene glycols, and combinations thereof. Further the alkylene glycol can be ethylene glycol or diethylene glycol.","Exemplary metal oxides are MgO, CuO and AlO.","Exemplary surfactants are sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).","In a specific example, the nanofluids comprise SWNTs, along with metal oxide (MgO, CuO or AlO) nanoparticles, and SDS or SDBS, at a pH of between 7 and 9.","The present invention also includes a method for making a nanofluid comprising the steps of: mixing together carbon nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles having a pHpzc, and at least one surfactant having a net negative charge into a hydrophilic thermal transfer fluid; and adjusting the pH below the pHpzc of the metal oxide nanoparticles.","Other aspects of the present invention are found throughout the specification.","The present invention relates to nanofluids that comprise carbon nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles and a surfactant in a thermal transfer fluid. Additionally, the nanofluid may further comprise chemical additives to provide other desired chemical and physical characteristics, such as anti-wear, corrosion protection and thermal oxidative properties.","While not wishing to be bound by any particular scientific theory, it is believed that there is a charge attraction between the nonpolar region of the surfactant molecules and the carbon nanoparticles. This interaction forms a shell around the carbon nanoparticles, with the charged head region of the surfactant molecules oriented towards the outside. This facilitates the dispersion of the carbon nanoparticles in the fluid thus preventing precipation from the fluid, which in turn enhances thermal conductivity. To further enhance thermal conductivity, metal oxide nanoparticles are also added to the thermal transfer fluid. These positively charged metal oxide nanoparticles repel one another and further enhance stability and thermal conductivity of the nanofluid.","As used in this disclosure, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, and \u201cthe\u201d may refer to plural articles unless specifically stated otherwise.

The pHpzc can be measured by any known method, such as the one described by Bourikas, et al., Environ. Sci. Technol., 39(11): 4100-4108 (2005).","The term \u201csurfactant\u201d refers to a molecule having surface activity, including wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers, detergents, and foaming agents, etc.","Carbon Nanoparticles:","Carbon nanoparticles have a high heat transfer coefficient and high thermal conductivity, which often exceed these of the best metallic material. The carbon nanoparticles for use in the present invention comprise elemental carbon. Many forms of carbon nanoparticles are suitable for use in the present invention, including carbon nanotubes, diamonds, fullerenes, graphite, carbon fibers, and combinations thereof.","Carbon nanotubes (\u201cCNT\u201d) are macromolecules in the shape of a long, thin cylinder, often with a diameter of a few nanometers. The basic structural element in a carbon nanotube is a hexagon, which is the same as that found in graphite. Based on the orientation of the tube axis with respect to the hexagonal lattice, a carbon nanotube potentially has three different configurations: armchair, zigzag, and chiral (also known as spiral). In armchair configuration, the tube axis is perpendicular to two of six carbon-carbon bonds of the hexagonal lattice. In zigzag configuration, the tube axis is parallel to two of six carbon-carbon bonds of the hexagonal lattice. Both these two configurations are achiral. In chiral configuration, the tube axis forms an angle other than 90 or 180 degrees with any of six carbon-carbon bonds of the hexagonal lattice. Nanotubes with these three configurations often exhibit different physical and chemical properties. For example, an armchair nanotube is always metallic, whereas a zigzag nanotube may be metallic or semiconductive, depending on the diameter of the nanotube. All three types of different configurations of nanotubes are expected to be very good thermal conductors along the tube axis, exhibiting a property known as \u201cballistic conduction,\u201d but are also good insulators laterally to the tube axis.","In addition to the common hexagonal structure, the cylinder of a carbon nanotube may also contain other sized rings, such as pentagons and heptagons. Replacement of some regular hexagons with pentagons and\/or heptagons may cause cylinders to bend, twist, or change diameter, and thus lead to some interesting structures such as \u201cY-,\u201d \u201cT-,\u201d and \u201cX-junctions,\u201d and different physical and chemical properties. These structural variations and configurations can be found in both SWNT and MWNT. The present invention is not limited to any particular configuration and structural variation. The carbon nanotubes used in the present invention may be in the configuration of armchair, zigzag, chiral, or combinations thereof. The carbon nanotubes may also contain structural elements other than hexagon, such as pentagon, heptagon, octagon, or combinations thereof.","Another structural variation, which is specific for MWNT molecules, is the arrangement of multiple tubes in a MWNT molecule. A perfect MWNT is like a stack of graphene sheets rolled up into concentric cylinders, with each wall parallel to the central axis. However, the tubes may also be arranged so that an angle between the graphite basal planes and the tube axis is formed. Such MWNTs are known as a \u201cstacked cone\u201d, \u201cChevron,\u201d \u201cbamboo,\u201d \u201cice cream cone,\u201d or \u201cpiled cone structure.\u201d A stacked cone MWNT may reach a diameter of about 100 nm. In spite of these structural variations, all MWNTs are suitable for the present invention, as long as they have excellent thermal conductive properties.","Carbon nanotubes used in the present invention may also encapsulate other elements and\/or molecules within their enclosed tubular structures. Such elements include Si, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Y, Zr, Mo, Ta, Au, Th, La, Ce, Pr, Nb, Gd, Th, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Mo, Pd, Sn, and W. Such molecules include alloys of these elements such as alloys of Cobalt with S, Br, Pb, Pt, Y, Cu, B, and Mg, and compounds such as the carbides (i.e. TiC, MoC, etc.) The present of these elements, alloys and compounds within the core structure of fullerenes and nanotubes may enhance the thermal conductivity of these nanoparticles, which then translates to a nanofluid with a higher thermal conductivity when these nanoparticles are suspended in a heat transfer fluid.","Carbon nanoparticles used in the present invention may also be chemically modified or functionalized. Covalent functionalization of carbon nanoparticles, especially carbon nanotubes and fullerenes, has commonly been accomplished by three different approaches, namely, thermally activated chemistry, electrochemical modification, and photochemical functionalization. The most common method of thermally activated chemical functionalization is an addition reaction on the sidewalls. For example, the extensive treatment of a nanotube with concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids leads to the oxidative opening of the tube caps as well as the formation of holes in the sidewalls. This produces a nanotube decorated with carboxyl groups, which can be further modified through the creation of amide and ester bonds to generate a vast variety of functional groups. The nanotube molecule may also be modified through addition reactions with various chemical reagents, such halogens and ozone. Unlike thermally controlled modification, electrochemical modification of nanotubes may be carried out in a more selective and controlled manner. Interestingly, a SWNT can be selectively modified or functionalized either on the cylinder sidewall or the optional end caps. These two structurally distinct moieties often display different chemical and physical characteristics. The functional groups on functionalized carbon nanoparticles may be attached directly to the carbon atoms of a carbon nanoparticle or via chemical linkers, such as alkylene or arylene groups. To increase hydrophilicity, carbon nanoparticles may be functionalized with one or more hydrophilic functional groups, such as sulfonate, carboxyl, hydroxyl, amino, amide, urea, carbamate, urethane, phosphate, and\/or functionalized alkyl and aryl groups (e.g., sulfonated p-aminophenyl group). To increase hydrophobicity, carbon nanoparticles may be functionalized with one or more hydrophobic alkyl or aryl groups. The functionalized carbon particle may have no less than about 2, no less than about 5, no less than about 10, no less than about 20, or no less than about 50 functional groups on average.","Carbon nanotubes are commercially available from a variety of commercial sources. SWNTs may be obtained from Carbolex (Broomall, Pa.), MER Corporation (Tucson, Ariz.), and Carbon Nanotechnologies Incorporation (\u201cCNI\u201d, Houston, Tex.). MWNTs may be obtained from MER Corporation (Tucson, Ariz.) and Helix material solution (Richardson, Tex.). However, the present invention is not limited by the source of carbon nanotubes. In addition, many publications are available with sufficient information to allow one to manufacture nanotubes with desired structures and properties. Currently, the most common techniques are arc discharge, laser ablation, chemical vapor deposition, and flame synthesis. In general, the chemical vapor deposition has shown the most promise in being able to produce larger quantities of nanotubes at lower cost. This is usually done by reacting a carbon-containing gas, such as acetylene, ethylene, ethanol, etc., with a metal catalyst particle, such as cobalt, nickel, or ion, at temperatures above 600\u00b0 C. The present invention is also not limited by the manufacturing method of the carbon nanotubes.","The selection of a particular carbon nanoparticle depends on a number of factors. The most important one is that the nanoparticle has to be compatible with an already existing base fluid (i.e., a thermal transfer fluid) discussed elsewhere herein. Other factors include heat transfer properties, cost effectiveness, solubility, dispersion and settling characteristics. The carbon nanoparticule-containing nanofluid may contain predominantly SWNTs, MWNTs, or mixtures thereof. The carbon nanoparticles in the nanofluid may also be chemically functionalized. The functionalized carbon nanoparticles may be soluble in a hydrophilic thermal transfer fluid, and are thus suitable for preparing a hydrophilic nanofluid. Alternatively, they may be soluble in a hydrophobic thermal transfer fluid, and are thus suitable for preparing a hydrophobic nanofluid.","In general, carbon nanotubes are characterized by physical and chemical properties, such as a carbon content, diameter, length, aspect ratio, and thermal conductivity. The carbon nanotubes suitable for use in the present invention may have a carbon content of no less than about 60%, no less than about 80%, no less than about 90%, no less than about 95%, no less than about 98%, or no less than about 99%. The carbon nanotubes may have a diameter of from about 0.2 to about 100 nm, from about 0.4 to about 80 nm, from about 0.5 to about 60 nm, or from about 0.5 to about 50 nm. The carbon nanotubes may have a length of no greater than about 200 micrometers, no greater than 100 micrometers, no greater than about 50 micrometers, or no greater than 20 micrometers. Furthermore, the carbon nanotubes may have an aspect ratio of no greater than 1,000,000, no greater than 100,000, no greater than 10,000, no greater than 1,000, no greater than about 500, no greater than about 200, or no greater than about 100. Alternatively, the carbon nanotubes may have a thermal conductivity of no less than 10 W\/m\u00b7K, no less than 100 W\/m\u00b7K, no less than 500 W\/m\u00b7K, or no less than 1,000 W\/m\u00b7K.","For a functionalized carbon nanotube, it may be further characterized by its solubility in a thermal transfer fluid. The carbon nanotubes used in the present invention may have a solubility of no less than 0.01 g\/L, no less than 0.05 g\/L, no less than 0.1 g\/L, no less than 0.5 g\/L, no less than 1 g\/L, no less than 2 g\/L, no less than 5 g\/L, or no less than 10 g\/L in a desired thermal transfer fluid, either hydrophilic or hydrophobic.","The carbon particles suitable for use in the present invention may be diamond nanoparticles, graphite nanoparticles, fullerenes, or carbon fibers. Furthermore, the carbon nanoparticles may be a combination of two or more selected from diamond nanoparticles, graphite nanoparticles, fullerenes, carbon fibers, and carbon nanotubes. A combination may be a mixture of two or more nanoparticles of the same type or of different types. For examples, a combination of two nanoparticles can be a mixture of SWNT and MWNT, a mixture of two SWNTs with different properties, a mixture of two MWNT with different properties, a mixture of carbon nanotubes with graphite nanoparticles, a mixture of carbon nanotubes with diamond particles, and a mixture of carbon nanotubes with fullerenes.","Metal Oxide Nanoparticles:","A metal oxide nanoparticle is a nanoscale particle that comprises one or more metal oxides. Such metal oxides include, for example, those formed from metal and\/or metalloid, either in elemental form and\/or in compounds. Suitable metal\/metalloid oxides include but are not limited to AlO, CuO, MgO, SiO, GeO, BO, TeO, VO, BiO, SbO, TiO, ZnO, FeO, FeO, FeO, and CrO. As used herein, the chemical formula for a metal oxide nanoparticle refers to the chemical with that formula that is a component, usually the principal component, of the nanoparticle. The chemical may be a major or minor component of the nanoparticle. As such, the nanoparticle may not have the same chemical composition as the chemical formula. Furthermore, unless specified, the chemical formula of a nanoparticle represents any of the possible crystalline forms. For example, the chemical formula AlOmay represent alpha-, beta-, or gamma-aluminum oxide, or combinations thereof.","Suitable metal oxide nanoparticles for use in the present invention may have, for example, a pHpzc of between 6 and 10, 7 and 10, 8 and 10, and 9 and 10, etc. For example, the exemplary metal oxides, MgO, CuO and AlOhave a pHpzc between 9 and 10.","Thermal Transfer Fluid:","In the present invention, the major component of the nanofluid is a hydrophilic thermal transfer fluid. The hydrophilic thermal transfer fluid of the present invention includes a hydrophilic liquid that is miscible with water, including water, aliphatic alcohols, alkylene glycols, di(alkylene)glycols, monoalkyl ethers of alkylene glycols or di(alkylene)glycols, and various mixtures thereof. Suitable aliphatic alcohols contain no greater than 6 carbons and no greater than 4 hydroxyls, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and glycerol.

Particularly, the hydrophilic thermal transfer fluid comprises ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and mixtures thereof. Ethylene glycol and propylene glycol are excellent antifreeze agents and also markedly reduce the freezing point of water. Suitable di(alkylene)glycols contain no greater than 10 carbons, such as diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, and dipropylene glycol. Commercial antifreeze coolants often contain more than one glycol compounds. For example, PRESTONE\u2122 antifreeze (Honeywell Consumer Products Group, Danbury, Conn.) contains 95 to 100% of ethylene glycol and no greater than 5% of diethylene glycol. The mixture as used herein refers to a combination of two or more hydrophilic liquids. As used herein, the term \u201calkylene glycol\u201d refers to a molecule having glycol functional moiety in its structure in general, including alkylene glycol, alkylene glycols, di(alkylene)glycols, tri(alkylene)glycols, tetra(alkylene)glycols, and their various derivatives, such as ethers and carboxylic esters.","Surfactant:","A variety of surfactants may alternatively be included in the present invention as a dispersant to facilitate uniform dispersion of nanoparticles in a desired thermal transfer fluid, and to enhance stabilization of such a dispersion as well. Typically, the surfactants used in the present invention contain an lipophilic nonpolar hydrocarbon group and a polar functional hydrophilic group.

The positive charge group can be quaternary ammonium, phosphonium, or sulfonium, whereas the negative charge group can be carboxylate, sulfonate, sulfate, phosphate or phosphonate. Similar to other classes of surfactants, the hydrophobic moiety may contain one or more long, straight, cyclic, or branched, aliphatic chains of about 8 to 18 carbon atoms. Specific examples of zwitterionic surfactants include alkyl betaines such as cocodimethyl carboxymethyl betaine, lauryl dimethyl carboxymethyl betaine, lauryl dimethyl alpha-carboxyethyl betaine, cetyl dimethyl carboxymethyl betaine, lauryl bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)carboxy methyl betaine, stearyl bis-(2-hydroxypropyl)carboxymethyl betaine, oleyl dimethyl gamma-carboxypropyl betaine, and lauryl bis-(2-hydroxypropyl)alphacarboxy-ethyl betaine, amidopropyl betaines; and alkyl sultaines such as cocodimethyl sulfopropyl betaine, stearyidimethyl sulfopropyl betaine, lauryl dimethyl sulfoethyl betaine, lauryl bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)sulfopropyl betaine, and alkylamidopropylhydroxy sultaines.","The surfactants for use in the present invention may be amphoteric. Examples of suitable amphoteric surfactants include ammonium or substituted ammonium salts of alkyl amphocarboxy glycinates and alkyl amphocarboxypropionates, alkyl amphodipropionates, alkyl amphodiacetates, alkyl amphoglycinates, and alkyl amphopropionates, as well as alkyl iminopropionates, alkyl iminodipropionates, and alkyl amphopropylsulfonates.

A combination of two or more surfactants of the same type, e.g., a mixture of two anionic surfactants, is also included in the present invention.","Other Chemical Additives:","The nanofluids of the present invention may also contain one or more other chemicals to provide other desired chemical and physical properties and characteristics, depending on whether they are hydrophobic or hydrophilic. In addition to the chemicals discussed separately below for hydrophilic and hydrophobic thermal transfer fluids, many other known types of additives such as dyes and air release agents, can also be included in finished compositions produced and\/or used in the practice of the present invention. In general, the additive components are employed in nanofluids in minor amounts sufficient to enhance the performance characteristics and properties of the base fluid. The amounts will thus vary in accordance with such factors as the viscosity characteristics of the base fluid employed, the viscosity characteristics desired in the finished fluid, the service conditions for which the finished fluid is intended, and the performance characteristics desired in the finished fluid.","Suitable additional chemical additives include, but are not limited to, buffering agents, corrosion inhibitors, defoamers, and scale inhibitors.","The buffering agents may be selected from any known or commonly used buffering agents. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that selected buffering agents can exhibit both anti-corrosion and buffering properties. In certain formulations, for example, benzoates, borates, and phosphates can provide both buffering and anti-corrosion advantages. In addition a base can be used to adjust the pH value of a nanofluid. Illustrative examples of bases for use with this invention include commonly known and used bases, for example, inorganic bases such as KOH, NaOH, NaHCO, KCO, and NaCO. Therefore, the buffering system and base can be adapted to provide a nanofluid composition with a pH level between 7.5 and about 11.","The corrosion inhibitors may be either an organic additive or an inorganic additive. Suitable organic anti-corrosive additives include short aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as maleic acid, succinic acid, and adipic acid; triazoles such as benzotriazole and tolytriazole; thiazoles suchs as mercaptobenzothiazole; thiadiazoles such as 2-mercapto-5-hydrocarbylthio-1,3,4-thiadiazoles, 2-mercapto-5-hydrocarbyldithio-1,3,4-thiadiazoles, 2,5-bis(hydrocarbylthio)-1,3,4-thiadiazoles, and 2,5-(bis)hydrocarbyldithio)-1,3,4-thiadiazoles; sulfonates; and imidazolines. Suitable inorganic additives include borates, phosphates, silicates, nitrates, nitrites, and molybdates.","Suitable defoamers include components such as silicon defoamers, alcohols such as polyethoxylated glycol, polypropoxylated glycol or acetylenic glycols.","Suitable scale inhibitors include components such as phosphate esters, phosphino carboxylate, polyacrylates, polymethacylate, styrene-maleic anhydride, sulfonates, maleic anhydride co-polymer, and acrylate-sulfonate co-polymer.","The basic composition of the nanofluids of the present invention can be routinely optimized for selective applications. For example, nitrates and silicates are known to provide aluminum protection. Borates and nitrites can be added for ferrous metal protection, and benzotriazole and tolytriazole can be added for copper and brass protection.","Physical Agitation:","The nanofluid of the present invention is prepared by dispersing a mixture of the appropriate carbon nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles and surfactant(s), and other optional chemical additives, using a physical method to form a stable suspension of nanoparticles in a thermal transfer fluid. A variety of physical mixing methods are suitable for use in the present invention, including a conventional mortar and pestle mixing, high shear mixing, such as with a high speed mixer, homogenizers, microfluidizers, high impact mixing, and ultrasonication methods.","Among these methods, ultrasonication is the least destructive to the structures of carbon nanoparticles. Ultrasonication can be done either in the bath-type ultrasonicator, or by the tip-type ultrasonicator. Typically, tip-type ultrasonication is for applications which require higher energy output. Ultrasonication at a intermediate intensity for up to 60 minutes, and usually in a range of from 10 to 30 minutes is desired to achieve better homogeneity. Additionally, the mixture is ultrasonicated intermittently to avoid overheating. It is well known that overheating can cause covalent bond breakage in a carbon nanotube, which cause the nanotube to lost its beneficial physical properties. As such, the carbon nanoparticle-containing mixture is generally energized for a predetermined period of time with a break in between. Each energizing period is no more than about 30 min, no more than about 15 min, no more than 10 min, no more than 5 min, no more than 2 min, no more than 1 min, or no more than 30 sec. The break between ultrasonication pulses provides the opportunity for the energized carbon nanoparticles to dissipate the energy. The break is typically no less than about 1 min, no less than about 2 min, no less than about 5 min, or between about 5 to about 10 min.","The raw material mixture may also be pulverized by any suitable known dry or wet grinding method. One grinding method includes pulverizing the raw material mixture in the fluid mixture of the present invention to obtain a concentrate, and the pulverized product may then be dispersed further in a liquid medium with the aid of the dispersants described above. However, pulverization or milling often reduces the carbon nanotube average aspect ratio.","It will be appreciated that the individual components can be separately blended into the thermal transfer fluid, or can be blended therein in various subcombinations, if desired. Ordinarily, the particular sequence of such blending steps is not critical. Moreover, such components can be blended in the form of separate solutions in a diluent. It is preferable, however, to blend the components used in the form of an additive concentrate, as this simplifies the blending operations, reduces the likelihood of blending errors, and takes advantage of the compatibility and solubility characteristics afforded by the overall concentrate.","Physical agitation methods particularly suitable for making nanogrease are those employing relatively high shearing or dispersing devices, including, but not limited to, Morehouse mills, Buxton knife mills, Gaulin homogenizers, colloid mills, rotating knife-edge mills, rotor-stator mills, and three-roll mills. In an exemplary embodiment, after a final grease composition is achieved, the resulting grease is generally passed one or more times through one of these shearing or dispersing devices to enhance the characteristics (e.g., smoothness, shear stability, oil separation and bleed properties) and to maximize the thickening power of a grease thickener, such as carbon nanotubes.","Formulation:","The nanofluid of the present invention is a dispersion of carbon nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles and at least one surfactant with a net negative charge in a thermal transfer fluid. In general, the nanofluid contains no less than about 80%, no less than about 85%, no less than about 90%, or no less than about 95% by weight of a thermal transfer fluid. The nanofluid contains no greater than about 30%, no greater than 15%, no greater than 10%, no greater than about 5%, no greater than about 2.5%, or no greater than about 1%, no greater than about 0.5%, no greater than about 0.2%, no greater than about 0.1%, or no greater than about 0.05% by weight of carbon or non-carbon nanoparticles.","The nanofluid includes one or more surfactants with a net negative charge to stabilize the nanoparticle dispersion. The nanofluid contains from about no greater than 10%, no greater than 1%, no greater than 0.5%, no greater than 0.2%, from 0.1 to about 30%, from about 1 to about 20%, from about 1 to about 15%, or from about 1 to about 10% by weight of a surfactant.","The nanofluid may further comprise other additives to improve chemical and\/or physical properties. Typically, the amount of these additives together is no greater than 10% by weight of the nanofluid. Nevertheless, the total amount of all the ingredients of the nanofluid together should equal to 100%.","The metal oxide nanoparticles of the present invention exhibit a positive surface charge. In addition, such metal oxides all have a characteristic pH point of zero charge, or \u201cpHpzc\u201d at which pH the metal oxide nanoparticle surface is neutral. In the practice of the present invention, the pH of the nanofluid is adjusted to below this pHpzc. This forms an additional positively charged ionic barrier around the metal oxide nanoparticles that facilitates inter-particle repulsion between particles, which further enhances the stability of the dispersion. In one example, when the metal oxide nanoparticles have a pHpzc of between 9 and 10, the pH of the nanofluid is usually between 7 and 9. In a specific example, the nanofluids comprise SWNTs, along with metal oxide (MgO, CuO or AlO) nanoparticles and SDS or SDBS at a pH of between 7 and 9.","By providing a transfer fluid having an appropriate pH, a charge effect between the surfactant molecules and the non-carbon nanoparticles can be maintained. Carbon nanoparticles can then be maintained in suspension due to the charge effect between the head groups on the surfactant molecules.","As mentioned above, the net charge of the surfactant(s) is(are) negative, and the metal oxide nanoparticles have a positive charge. This allows a small network of metal oxide nanoparticles to form, thereby orienting and connecting the carbon nanoparticle, which in turn allows heat to flow along the length of the carbon nanoparticle such as a carbon nanotube, thereby significantly increasing the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid.","Such nanofluids can be exhibited microscopically to form large rope structure comprising many carbon nanotubes that have been partially exfoliated into smaller ropes through the use of the surfactants, such as NaDDBS. In other examples individual carbon nano-tubes that are obtained by the addition of MgO at pH 7 with the surfactant NaDDBS may be coated with what is believed to be a random assortment of surfactant on the surface of the carbon nano-tubes. These nanofluids can exyibit ring formations.","The hydrophilic thermal transfer fluid may contain one or more hydrophilic molecules. For example, the hydrophilic thermal transfer fluid may contain water, aliphatic alcohols, alkylene glycols, or various mixtures thereof. The hydrophilic thermal transfer fluid may be a two-component mixture which contains water and ethylene glycol in various proportions. The hydrophilic thermal transfer fluid may contain about 0.1 to about 99.9%, about 20 to about 80%, about 40 to about 60%, or about 50% by volume of water.","The hydrophilic thermal transfer fluid may be a three-component mixture. For example, the hydrophilic thermal transfer fluid contains water, ethylene glycol, and diethylene glycol in various proportions. The hydrophilic thermal transfer fluid may contain about 0.1 to about 99.9% by volume of water, about 0.1 to 99.9% by volume of ethylene glycol, and about 0.1 to 99.9% by volume of diethylene glycol; and about 20 to about 80%, about 40 to about 60%, or about 50% by volume of water or ethylene glycol. Typically, diethylene glycol constitutes a minor component of the hydrophilic thermal transfer fluid, in no greater than about 20%, no greater than about 10%, or no greater than about 5% of the total volume. Nevertheless, the total amount of all the components in a hydrophilic thermal transfer fluid together equals to 100%.","The hydrophilic nanofluid may be prepared by dispersing carbon nanoparticles and metal oxide nanoparticles, along with the surfactant(s) directly into a mixture of a hydrophilic thermal transfer fluid and other additives with a physical agitation, such as ultrasonication. However, the order of addition of the individual components is not critical for the practice of the invention.","The hydrophilic nanofluid of carbon nanoparticles thus produced has enhanced thermal properties and physical and chemical characteristics. Addition of solid carbon nanoparticles, in particular, carbon nanotubes, enhances both thermal conductivity and lowers the freezing point of the thermal conductive fluid. Incorporation of about 0.05% by weight of carbon nanotubes, the thermal conductivity is increased from 0.45 to about 0.48-0.50, which is an about 6 to 11% increase. In addition, the freezing point of the thermal transfer fluid is also lowered significantly.","Carbon nanotubes from several commercial sources were used in the following examples and their information is summarized in Table 1. Specifically, SWNT-CNI and SWNT-RIC were produced using a chemical vapor deposition process (\u201cVCD\u201d), whereas SWNT-CAR was produced via an arc discharge method.","Often, several grades of carbon nanotubes are available from each company. For instance, CNI supplies \u201cD\u201d grade, HiPCO purified, and fluorinated carbon nanotubes. The \u201cD\u201d grade carbon nanotubes contain roughly 35% ash content along with some metal catalysts impurities. HiPCO purified and fluorinated carbon nanotubes contain less than 10% ash. Fluorinated carbon nanotubes have their end cap functionalized with fluorine. The carbon nanotubes from Carbolex (SWNT-CAR) are AP grade without purification. The carbon nanotubes from Rice University have been functionalized with sulfonated aryl groups, allowing them to be more easily dispersed in polar solvents such as water and methanol.","Metal oxide nanoparticles used in the present invention are magnesium oxide (MgO) with an average diameter of 12 nm, aluminum oxide (AlO) with an average diameter of 40 nm, copper oxide (CuO) with an average diameter of 33 nm, and magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)) with an average diameter of 26.8 nm. These metal oxide nanoparticles were all obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.).","In the following examples, thermal conductivity was measured using a Hot Disk\u2122 Thermal Constant Analyzer (Uppsala, Sweden). The senor was a 2 mm nickel double spiral sensor covered by a thin kapton layer. After each measurement, the sample was allowed to sit for 15 min before the next measurement. Both particle size and zeta-potential were determined using NICOMP 380 ZLS by Particle Sizing Systems. Zeta potential was measured by using the electrophoretic light scattering method (ELS). Particle size is obtained by use of the multi-angle dynamic light scattering technique (DLS). Ultrasonication was performed using a Branson model 450 ultrasonicator with a half-inch disruptor horn. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using the Hitachi H-7000FA Electron Microscope.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Carbon Nanotubes"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Commercial"]},{"entry":["Abbreviation","Product Information","Source"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["MWNT-HMSI","MWNT with a diameter of 10-20","Helix Material"]},{"entry":[{},"nm and a length of 0.5-40","Solution Inc"]},{"entry":[{},"micrometers"]},{"entry":["MWNT-MER","MWNT with a diameter of","Materials and"]},{"entry":[{},"140 \u00b1 30 nm, a length of 7 \u00b1 2","Electrochemical"]},{"entry":[{},"micrometers, and a purity of","Research"]},{"entry":[{},"over 90%.","Corporation"]},{"entry":["MWNT-RAO","MWNT with diameter 20-25 nm,","RAO"]},{"entry":["SWNT-MER","SWNT 0.7-1.2 nm in diameter, 10-50","MER"]},{"entry":[{},"micron lengths."]},{"entry":["SWNT-CAR","Purified CAR SWNT (AP CAR)","CarboLex"]},{"entry":["SWNT-D-CNI","Grade-D SWNT","CNI"]},{"entry":["F-SWNT-CNI","Purified F-SWNT","CNI"]},{"entry":["SWNT-H-CNI","HiPco SWNT","CNI"]},{"entry":["SWNT-RIC","Functionalized SWNT","Rice University"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"For comparison with carbon nanoparticle-containing nanofluids, the thermal conductivities of hydrophilic thermal fluids used in the present invention were measured.

The SDS-containing nanofluid shows a thermal conductivity of 0.6565\u00b10.007 W\/mK, which is similar to that of the SDBS-containing nanofluid as described herein above.

Due to the polar sulfonated aryl group attached to the sidewall of the SWNT, SWNT-RIC was readily dispersed into water, a 50-50 water and ethylene glycol mixture, and ethylene glycol. The dispersions were stable over long time periods. Dispersions of the SWNT-RIC were obtained through stirring with a glass rod, or via a few second ultrasonication (10 seconds or less).","The thermal conductivity of a nanofluid that comprises 0.5% by weight of SWNT-RIC in water was determined to be 0.6397\u00b10.0006 W\/mK.

It is interesting to note that the solution is stable at a pH of 10, but if the pH is changed to 7, the solution of SWNT-RIC started to agglomerate and the dispersion worsens considerably, leading to decrease in thermal conductivity.","The examples set forth above are provided to give those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the preferred embodiments of the compositions and the methods, and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention.
