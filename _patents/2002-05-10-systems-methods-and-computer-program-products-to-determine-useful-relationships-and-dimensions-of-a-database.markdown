No. 10\/144,347 entitled \u201cSystems, Methods, and Computer Program Products to Browse Database Query Information,\u201d filed on the same date herewith, by Christian Andersch et. al, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference, there is described a method of efficiently determining how columns, tables, and queries associated with a database are related to each other. Although not limited thereto, the present invention employs such a method in one of its preferred embodiments.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention is directed to the field of database browsing and information mining. It is more particularly directed to accessing and browsing database information associated with queries that may mine information associated with a database.","2. Description of the Background Art","A database is a collection of data, organized in the form of tables. A table typically consists of columns that represent attribute types and records that represent specific instances of data associated with the table, and the table has attribute instances associated with the columns. A relational database is a database that may be a set of tables containing information that is manipulated in accordance with the relational model associated with the data. The product marketed under the trademark IBM DB2 stores the data associated with the database in tables, and each table has a name.","On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) is a computing technique for summarizing, consolidating, viewing, analyzing, applying formulae to, and synthesizing data according to multiple dimensions. OLAP software enables users, such as analysts, managers, and executives, to gain insight into performance of an enterprise through rapid access to a wide variety of data dimensions that are organized to reflect the multidimensional nature of the enterprise performance data typically by means of hypotheses about possible trends in the data. More particularly, OLAP may be used to analyze corporate data from different viewpoints by identifying interesting associations in the information in a database.","Data mining is a technique employing computer-based techniques to enable users to query structured data stored in computers in forms such as: multidimensional databases, conventional databases, or flat computer files. More particularly, data mining involves extracting computer-based information and enables a user to discover trends about the computer-based information. OLAP is a decision support technique used in data management for the purpose of modeling and analyzing business information, and by means of comparison On-Line Transaction Processing (OLTP) is a technique that may be used to process a computer task immediately upon request, and may employ data from a database. Data mining may be used during OLTP or OLAP processing.","An increasingly popular data model for OLAP applications is the multidimensional database (MDDB). MDDBs are often used by a data analyst for interactive exploration of performance data for finding regions of anomalies in the data that may otherwise be characterized by trends. Problem areas and new opportunities associated with the enterprise are often identified when an anomaly in the enterprise data is located. However, the creation of MDDBs requires computer resources, and it would be useful to be able to efficiently determine relationships and dimensions associated with a database, without relying on a MDDB, when employing OLAP processing techniques.","Each database typically has a set of tables, such as system catalog tables, which are automatically maintained by the computer system and contain information about the tables and other objects that are stored in the database, and about the user of the database and the user's access privileges. Information about the database can be retrieved from the system catalog tables using structured query language (SQL) queries.","SQL is a standardized language for defining and manipulating data in a relational database and may be used during data mining. A query may be an expression whose result is a table. A query searches the records stored in specified tables to find the answer to a question. A query is a request for information from the database based on specific conditions such as, which subset of the data should be retrieved and how the data is to be presented. For example, a request for a list of all departments in a DEPARTMENT table whose budget is greater than $10,000 is an example of a query. It would be useful to understand how database tables and columns, and SQL queries are related to each other when OLAP procedures are employed. Such procedures may analyze, from a hierarchical perspective, data that is above and below the data associated with the query request, and may aggregate the resulting information. Further, the SQL query may analyze the metadata associated with a database. Metadata is information that describes the characteristics of stored data. For instance, data in a database may be described by metadata such as the name of associated database tables and columns.","A browser may be considered a text extender function that enables a user to display text on a computer monitor. Browsing is typically used to examine records in a file, such as a database. By means of example, a browser may operate on one computer, such as a client computer and initiate requests to a second computer, such as a server computer so that information from the second computer may displayed via the first computer. When a user attempts to browse information during OLAP processing, the amount of information may be so large that it is difficult to determine useful dimensions. For example, if a user attempts to browse a database and uses SQL queries it may be difficult to determine how columns, tables, and queries are related to each other.","Given a relational database, it can be difficult to determine useful dimensions when employing OLAP processing. Further, given a set of SQL queries, it can be complicated and time consuming to determine how columns, tables, and queries are related to each other. This is especially true when there are a large number of queries, such as when a user is employing OLAP processing techniques. From the foregoing it will be apparent that there is still a need to improve the determination of a useful set of dimensions and of relationships of database information when employing OLAP processing techniques and to improve the determination of how columns, tables, and queries of a database are related to each other.","An embodiment of the present invention relates to systems, methods, and computer products that efficiently determine useful dimensions and relationships associated with a database when employing data processing techniques, such as OLAP, and that efficiently determine how columns, tables, and queries associated with a database are related to each other. Further, by operation of the present invention improving the determination of how columns, tables, and queries of relational or multidimensional databases are related to each other, users can navigate quickly between different views of database information, such as query information. Techniques of the past have not been able to efficiently determine useful dimensions when employing OLAP processing and to determine how columns, tables, and queries associated with a database are related to each other.","The present invention improves the analysis of metadata in a database. The present invention enables a user to take advantage of heuristics for OLAP processing of data. Heuristics are defined herein as user-specific criteria, such as a set of rules, intended to increase the probability of solving a problem associated with a database. The preferred embodiment of the present invention employs a query miner module to analyze query objects based on heuristics that are embodied in SQL statements. For instance, the query miner module may identify and rate queries according to their level of satisfaction of heuristic rules, and show statistics associated with the result of the queries. In one embodiment of the present invention, the query miner module may collect information about the frequency of combinations of table and column information associated with a query so that the user may assess the relationship between the tables and columns of data in a database. Further, the results of searches driven by heuristic rules may be analyzed and reported in a variety of ways that may be used to generate additional user-specific heuristics. For example, heuristic rules may be based on information about various owners of the data, the last used data, or key words in SQL statements. Alternatively heuristic rules may be based on all search fields in the SQL statement. The metadata information about attributes associated with a query, such as tables and columns, and the result of statistical information about the data that is based on heuristic rules, advantageously enables a user to determine useful relationships and attributes, such as dimensions, from a database. The terms \u201cdimensions \u201d and \u201cviews\u201d will be used interchangeably herein.","The present invention allows easy browsing of queries, tables, and columns, and enables a user to see at a glance in which queries certain columns and tables are used. The present invention may be implemented with a query browser module that improves browsing through queries and their components over the past. The preferred embodiment of the present invention provides an easy to use graphical interface showing query objects associated with queries, tables, and columns in a tree structure. Further, the preferred embodiment of the present invention operates efficiently and presents information about columns, tables, and queries to the user without discernable lag time between the user's request and the generated information.","According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention the table and column information is complete thereby ensuring accurate browsing. Therefore, data collection associated with browsing, such as browsing metadata, and in the preferred embodiment of the present invention is performed against all queries by the query miner module.","An embodiment of the present invention is achieved by systems, methods, and computer products that improve the determination of useful relationships and dimensions associated with a database when employing OLAP processing techniques; and that improve the determination of how columns, tables, and queries of a database are related to each other. The method comprises: (a) creating and propagating a database; (b) executing a query object with the query miner module that may operate in conjunction with the product marketed under the trademark IBM QMF (Query Management Facility) and that is directed to a database; this execution further includes (i) applying user-specific heuristics as rules used by the query miner module via the query object; (ii) applying a data-mining statistical tabulation against the data in the database and metadata associated with the database and therefore collecting statistical information about the query object based on the user-specific heuristics; and (iii) determining useful information by analyzing the statistical information; (c) retrieving at least one view of the statistical information that satisfies the user-specific heuristics; (d) rating the statistical information that satisfies the user-specific heuristics; and (e) presenting the rated statistical information, such as views of table, column, or query information optionally as a user-specific report; the optional presentation further includes (i) determining if the user wants to use new heuristics and if not; (ii) optionally creating at least one user-specific report and exporting the user-specific report to final report documents, such as XML files; and (iii) if the user wants to use new heuristics repeating the process of executing a query object.","Other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.","In the following detailed description and in the several figures of the drawings, like elements are identified with like reference numerals.","As shown in the drawings and for purposes of illustration, the embodiment of the invention novelly determines useful relationships and dimensions associated with a database when employing OLAP processing techniques, and determines how columns, tables, and queries associated with a database are related to each other. Existing systems have not been able to provide users with a technique to efficiently determine dimensions associated with a database, and to determine the relationship between columns and tables of a database, and queries directed to a database. The present invention enables users to navigate quickly between different views of database information, such as query information. This is especially true when there are a large number of queries.","The present invention improves the analysis of metadata in a database that may contain database information aspects. For example, the query miner module may collect information on the frequency of combinations of table and column information associated with a query for use during the analysis of the metadata. The information generated by the query miner module advantageously enables a user to determine useful attributes, such as dimensions, from a database for OLAP processing. By means of further example the query miner module may provide information about heuristic rules that search for items such as: specific owners of database information, naming conventions, SQL statement data, the time the query was created or modified, or the last execution of the query.","Further, an embodiment of the present invention efficiently generates information about columns, tables, and queries associated with databases and enables a user to see at a glance which columns and tables are used in certain queries. The present invention may be implemented with a query miner module and a query browser module that improves browsing through queries and their components over the past. The preferred embodiment of the present invention provides an easy to use graphical interface showing the associated queries, tables, and columns in a tree structure. Further, the preferred embodiment of the present invention presents information about the relationship between columns, tables, and queries to the user without discernable lag time between the user's request and the generated information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B"],"b":["1","100","102","104","104","106","128","120","102","104","106","104","102","117","128","110","120","152","150","110","117","119","118","110","558","102","104","106","110","122","150","152","558","5"]},"According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention the query browser module  operates during the operation of the query miner module , and may operate in conjunction with the product marketed under the trademark IBM QMF  (Query Management Facility).
