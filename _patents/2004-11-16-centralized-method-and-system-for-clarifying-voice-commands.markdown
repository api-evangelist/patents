{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention generally pertains to user interaction with a computing device. More specifically, the present invention pertains to user interactions with a centralized interface in the context of speech recognition.","Much attention, lately, has been directed towards the improvement of speech recognition technology. One such challenge in speech recognition technology lies in user interaction with a computing device using voice commands. Frequently, a voice command needs further clarification before the computing device can execute such a command.","A computing device can often interpret a voice command in multiple ways. In one aspect, a computing device may not understand which application the voice command is directed towards. For example, a voice command can include terms that are used across a plurality of application modules. In another aspect, an application may not understand what the user would like to execute because the voice command contains ambiguous information. For example, a voice command can include \u201cplay the Beatles\u201d when there are multiple Beatles albums that the application could play. In still another example, the voice command can contain a misrecognition error. For example, the user may recite the command \u201cinsert ice cream\u201d while the speech recognition system recognizes the command as \u201cinsert I scream\u201d.","Making guesses at what the user meant or taking action without consulting the user can lead to frustration for a user. There is a need to provide the user with the tools to control the clarification of voice commands and clarification of misrecognition errors without causing undue frustration and sacrificing speech recognition efficiency.","A method and system is provided for facilitating centralized interaction with a user. The method and system includes providing a recognized voice command to a plurality of application modules. A plurality of interpretations of the voice command are generated by at least one of the plurality of application modules. A centralized interface module visually renders the plurality of interpretations of the voice command on a centralized display. An indication of selection of an interpretation is received from the user.","A centralized interface module that visually renders a list of interpretations to a user when there is otherwise ambiguity in a voice command avoids the arbitrary guessing of a command with which the user is referencing. In addition, a centralized display panel provided by a central interface module can allow generic user interaction.","The present invention is described in the context of a computer-implemented system which uses speech recognition to recognize voice commands from a user. Before describing aspects of the present invention, however, it may be useful to describe suitable computing environments that can incorporate and benefit from these aspects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.

Computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by computer  and includes both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media includes both volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by computer . Communication media typically embodies computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media.","The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM . RAM  typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently being operated on by processing unit . By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data .","The computer  may also include other removable\/non-removable volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media.

The hard disk drive  is typically connected to the system bus  through a non-removable memory interface such as interface , and magnetic disk drive  and optical disk drive  are typically connected to the system bus  by a removable memory interface, such as interface .","The drives and their associated computer storage media discussed above and illustrated in , provide storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computer . In , for example, hard disk drive  is illustrated as storing operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Note that these components can either be the same as or different from operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data  are given different numbers here to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies.","A user may enter commands and information into the computer  through input devices such as a keyboard , a microphone , and a pointing device , such as a mouse, trackball or touch pad. Other input devices (not shown) may include a joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video interface . In addition to the monitor, computers may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers  and printer , which may be connected through an output peripheral interface .","The computer  is operated in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be a personal computer, a hand-held device, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) , but may also include other networks. Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, Intranets and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer  is connected to the LAN  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, the computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the WAN , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, may be connected to the system bus  via the user input interface , or other appropriate mechanism. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates remote application programs  as residing on remote computer . It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","204","206","208","210"]},"Memory  is implemented as non-volatile electronic memory such as random access memory (RAM) with a battery back-up module (not shown) such that information stored in memory  is not lost when the general power to mobile device  is shut down. A portion of memory  is preferably allocated as addressable memory for program execution, while another portion of memory  is preferably used for storage, such as to simulate storage on a disk drive.","Memory  includes an operating system , application programs  as well as an object store . During operation, operating system  is preferably executed by processor  from memory . Operating system , in one preferred embodiment, is a WINDOWS\u00ae CE brand operating system commercially available from Microsoft Corporation. Operating system  is preferably designed for mobile devices, and implements database features that can be utilized by applications  through a set of exposed application programming interfaces and methods. The objects in object store  are maintained by applications  and operating system , at least partially in response to calls to the exposed application programming interfaces and methods.","Communication interface  represents numerous devices and technologies that allow mobile device  to send and receive information. The devices include wired and wireless modems, satellite receivers and broadcast tuners to name a few. Mobile device  can also be directly connected to a computer to exchange data therewith. In such cases, communication interface  can be an infrared transceiver or a serial or parallel communication connection, all of which are capable of transmitting streaming information.","Input\/output components  include a variety of input devices such as a touch-sensitive screen, buttons, rollers, and a microphone as well as a variety of output devices including an audio generator, a vibrating device, and a display. The devices listed above are by way of example and need not all be present on mobile device . In addition, other input\/output devices may be attached to or found with mobile device  within the scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","302","304","306","310","312","302","304","302","306"]},"To recognize a voice command, speech recognizer  accesses a grammar  containing a plurality of recognizable commands. A grammar generator module  is configured to generate grammar  based on input received from installed and operating application modules . The input received from application modules  populate grammar  and are the executable commands with which the application modules can process and execute various actions. Thus, each recognizable command located in grammar  corresponds to a command that executes an action in one of the plurality of application modules .","Grammar generator module  can also populate grammar  with alternative forms of various commands. These alternative forms of commands typically are received from application modules . For example, if a user desires to play the Beatles on a computing device, the user should utter \u201cplay the Beatles\u201d. It is possible, however, that the user may instruct the computing device to \u201cstart the Beatles\u201d instead of properly instructing the computing device to \u201cplay the Beatles\u201d, which would accomplish the same task.","In some embodiments, grammar generator module  is further configured to determine which of application modules  are operational at any given time. For example, grammar generator module  can determine that five application modules are running on the operating system. The operational application modules include two instances of a web browser, an email application, a word processing application and a spreadsheet application. When grammar generator module  generates grammar , it compresses the commands such that only one set of commands for the web browsing application populate grammar . Grammar generator , however, retains the notion that there are two instances of the web browser that are operational. Therefore, grammar generator  realizes that ambiguity exists at the time of generating grammar .","In other embodiments, grammar generator  does not retain the notion that there are two instances of the web browser that are operational. In this embodiment, centralized interface module  can perform a status check on the operation system to determine if different instances of the same application are operational and, thus, ambiguous.","After speech recognizer  recognizes the voice command, the recognized voice command is communicated to the plurality of application modules . The recognized voice command can either be communicated to the plurality of application modules via centralized interface module  or by speech recognizer . Regardless of the path of communication, the plurality of application modules  process the recognized voice command.","In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, some or all of the application modules  determine that they can execute the recognized voice command. For example, a user utters the command \u201cstart settings\u201d. However, many of the application modules  that are installed in system  could have application aspects that include the term \u201csettings\u201d. Therefore the recognized command  is ambiguous. It is unclear as to which application the user is referring.","In this embodiment, centralized interface module  gathers the set of possible interpretations of the recognized voice command from the plurality of application modules . Centralized interface module  then visually renders the set of interpretations in a list. The list of interpretations are viewed by the user on a centralized panel of display . An example screenshot  of a centralized panel visually rendering a list of possible interpretations  is illustrated in .","In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, only one of the plurality of application modules  determines that it can execute the recognized voice command. For example, a user utters the command \u201cplay the Indigo Girls\u201d. Only one application module , such as a media application, has a menu item that includes \u201cplay the Indigo Girls\u201d. However, upon the media application attempting to execute the command, it discovers that there are four possible Indigo Girls albums that can be played. Therefore, the recognized command is ambiguous. It is unclear to the media application what album the user meant to play.","In this embodiment, centralized interface module  gathers the set of possible interpretations of the recognized voice command from the application module . Centralized interface module  visually renders the set of interpretations in a list. The list of interpretations are viewed by the user in a centralized panel located on display . Example screenshot  of a centralized panel visually renders a list of possible interpretations with reference to the described example is illustrated in .","In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention and as previously discussed, there can be ambiguity in what instance or application module of a particular application the user is referencing. For example, a user is using a spreadsheet application and utters the command \u201cswitch to the Internet browser\u201d. However, besides system  running one instance of the spreadsheet application, system  is also running two instances of the Internet browser application. Therefore, the recognized command is ambiguous. It is unclear which instance of the Internet browser the user is referring.","In this embodiment, speech recognizer  can supply centralized interface module  with a set of possible interpretations of the voice command based on grammar generator  retaining the notion that there are more than one instance of an operational web browser. In the alternative, centralized interface module , after performing a status check of the operating system, can supply a set of possible interpretations of the voice command. Centralized interface module  visually renders the set of interpretations in a list. The list of interpretations are viewed by the user in a centralized panel located on display .","Each interpretation in the list of interpretations  and  are annotated with an identifier (i.e. \u201c\u201d, \u201c\u201d, \u201c\u201d, etc.). In the  and  embodiment, identifiers  and  are numeric symbols, although any form of symbol can be used. Upon viewing the list of interpretations  and , the user can determine which of the interpretations is the interpretation that corresponds to what the user meant. In one embodiment, the user can select the correct command by speaking the corresponding numeric symbol. In another embodiment, the user can select the correct command by using an input device  (illustrated in ) to select desired interpretations. Input device  can be, but is not limited to, a selection apparatus, such as a mouse. Input device  can also be a keypad. Regardless of how the correct interpretation is selected, selection of an interpretation induces system  to execute the corresponding command by forwarding the command to the corresponding application.","In another embodiment, the user can indicate, in reference to , that playing all of the Indigo Girls albums is desired. Communication line  indicates that the user can either select an interpretation from the plurality of interpretations  or the user can utter \u201cPlay all\u201d to play all of the albums. Regardless of what the user desired, selection of the correct interpretation induces system  to take action by providing the command information to the corresponding application.","Using a centralized interface module that visually renders a list of interpretations to a user when there is otherwise ambiguity in a voice command provides a way for system  to avoid arbitrarily guessing an appropriate command. A centralized interface module also provides a simple centralized panel for graphically representing possible user interactions, provides a highly efficient means of determining what the user meant and provides a consistent interface that is located outside of the plurality of application modules. In other words, each of the screenshots of a centralized panel illustrated in ,  and - (discussed below), look and operate similarly and can, therefore, be displayed in a consistent location. For example,  illustrates a screenshot  of a media player that is operating on an operating system. The user asks to \u201cplay Indigo Girls\u201d. As discussed above, there is more than one album of Indigo Girls that could be played. The centralized interface or panel  appears in the lower right hand corner of the screen and prompts the user to select what the user meant. In this manner, the user is less confused as to how to operate with the display even though the centralized panel can be used with one or more application modules .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 3"],"b":["700","700","702","700","704","706","306"]},"At step , the recognized command is conveyed to a plurality of application modules. At step , a plurality of interpretations are received upon at least one of the plurality of application modules determining that the recognized command is ambiguous. The plurality of interpretations are visually rendered to the user at step . For example, the plurality of interpretations can be listed with a corresponding identifier on a centralized panel of a display. An indication of the user selection of one of the plurality of interpretations is received at step . For example, by audibly indicating the identifier, the desired interpretation can be identified as the correct command.","In addition to clarifying voice commands by interacting with centralized interface module  in , a user can also interact with centralized interface module  to correct recognition errors while the user is dictating to an application module, such as a word processing application. To correct recognition errors, the user can highlight a term that has been transcribed incorrectly by using an input device. After highlighting, the application module transmits a plurality of alternatives to centralized interface module . The alternatives contain phrases that sound similar to the voice utterance. Centralized interface module  receives and visually renders the alternative phrases on the centralized panel of display . Each of the alternative phrases includes a corresponding identifier. Centralized interface module  receives an indication of selection from the user via speech or input device  in the form of an identifier and conveys the selection to the application module.","In some instances, the centralized interface module  fails to visually render an alternative that is the correct alternative. Failure to render a correct alternative can occur if either speech recognizer  made a misrecognition error or if the alternative is not recognizable because the user has never used the utterance with system . With these types of occurrences, centralized interface module  is configured to present further alternatives in addition to the alternatives previously presented. One such alternative includes presenting an option to respeak the original utterance. Another such further alternative includes presenting an option to allow the user to create a new alternative that is otherwise unfamiliar to system .","For example,  illustrates a screenshot  of a centralized panel that is visually rendering a list of alternatives in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The list of alternatives include a list of alternative phrases  generated by a word processing application and a list of further alternatives  generated by centralized interface module . Each of the further alternatives  includes a corresponding identifier such that the user can make an indication of selection in the form of an identifier.","If the user selects identifier \u201c\u201d, then the centralized interface module  visually renders a screenshot  in a centralized panel as illustrated in . The communication line  of screenshot  prompts the user to respeak the utterance. Upon respeaking the utterance, centralized interface module  will visually render a refreshed list of alternatives. Selecting identifier \u201c\u201d is useful if system  has made a recognition error. If the user selects the identifier \u201c\u201d in , then centralized interface module  visually renders screenshot  in a centralized panel as illustrated in . Communication line  of screenshot  prompts the user to spell the utterance aloud. As the user spells the utterance, the letters will appear in block . In addition, it is possible that a user could also type the correct spelling of the utterance in block  using an input device.","In another embodiment of the present invention,  is a block diagram illustrating a method  for manipulating characters displayed on a centralized panel, such as screenshot  of a centralized panel illustrated in , after the user audibly spells a new alternative. For example, in , the user spells the following phrase, \u201cintent\u201d. However, the speech recognizer  () has \u201cheard\u201d the series of entered text  as \u201ci\u201d, \u201cn\u201d, \u201cv\u201d, \u201ce\u201d, \u201cn\u201d, \u201ct\u201d and thus, displays the word \u201cinvent\u201d on panel . The word \u201cinvent\u201d needs to be corrected to be \u201cintent.\u201d","Referring to , in order to correct this, the user invokes a spelling command to vocally communicate a command to modify \u201cinvent\u201d. Upon the system  receiving the spelling command, the selected word is identified and an appended word  is created by appending at least one space  to the selected word, wherein the appended word  includes at least one character  to be modified, as shown in operational block  (). Each of the characters  in the appended word are then assigned and correlated with a unique numerical value , as shown in operational block . The appended word  is then displayed via screenshot  of a centralized panel to visually communicate the correlation between each of the characters  in the appended word  and their assigned unique numerical value . This correlation may be visually communicated by drawing a box  around the appended word  on screenshot  and displaying each of the unique numerical values  adjacent their assigned character  in the appended word . As such, each of the characters  is \u201cassigned\u201d a unique numerical value  to which each character  is correlated. For example, a user who wants to change the word \u201cinvent\u201d  to \u201cintent\u201d, would vocally enter a command to speech recognizer . This would cause a box  to be displayed on screenshot  around the word \u201cinvent\u201d . This also causes each letter in the word \u201cinvent\u201d  to be assigned a unique numerical value  which is displayed adjacent its corresponding character , both of which is shown in . This will allow the user to change and\/or correct any letter in the word \u201cinvent.\u201d","At this point, a selection command and a modification command may be received by system , wherein the selection command is the unique numerical value  corresponding to a selected character, as shown in operational block . This indicates to system  which character in the appended word  is to be changed. Once system  receives the modification command a modified word is generated by modifying the selected character responsive to the modification command, as shown in operational block . It should be appreciated that the user may enter in a plurality of modification commands, such as \u201cdelete\u201d, \u201cinsert\u201d, or the letter\/character to be added, wherein each of these situations are discussed below.","For example, referring to , consider the case above where the user would like to delete the letter \u201cv\u201d  in the appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d  displayed on a screenshot  of a centralized panel. As discussed herein, the user communicates the unique numerical value corresponding to the character to be change to system . It should be appreciated that although these unique numerical values  start with the number 1 and increase by 1, any unique numerical values  and increments may be assigned. As can been seen, the letter \u201cv\u201d  in the appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d  is assigned a unique numerical value  of \u201c3\u201d. As such, the user would vocally communicate the number \u201c3\u201d to system . This selects the letter corresponding to and correlated with the number \u201c3\u201d as indicated by the caret , which in this case is the letter \u201cv\u201d  in the appended word \u201cinvent\u201d . The user may then enter the desired modification command, such as \u201cdelete\u201d which will cause the letter \u201cv\u201d  to be deleted from the appended word \u201cinvent\u201d , leaving the resultant \u201cinent\u201d , as shown in screenshot  of a centralized panel of . Thus, the modification command \u201cdelete\u201d will remove the selected letter and its corresponding space from the appended word and the selection caret  will select the next subsequent character, i.e. \u201ce.\u201d","On the other hand, referring to , consider the case where the user wants to insert a character, such as a letter or space, between the letter \u201cn\u201d  and the letter \u201cv\u201d  in the word \u201cinvent\u201d displayed on screenshot  in a centralized panel. In essence, the user wants to insert a character into the spot corresponding to the unique numerical value \u201c3\u201d. As discussed herein, the user may vocally communicate a command. This causes a space to be appended to the word \u201cinvent\u201d to create an appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d  and a box  to be displayed around the appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d  and unique numerical values  to be assigned and displayed adjacent each of the characters in the appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d . As can be seen, the letter \u201cv\u201d  in the appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d  is assigned a unique numerical value  of \u201c3\u201d. As such, the user can vocally communicate the number \u201c3\u201d to system  to \u201cselect\u201d the letter corresponding to and correlated with the number \u201c3\u201d as indicated by the caret , which in this case is the letter \u201cv\u201d  in the appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d . The user may then enter in a modification command, causing system  to respond in an appropriate manner. For example if the user communicates the modification command \u201cinsert\u201d and then communicates the word \u201cspace\u201d, then a space will be inserted between the letter \u201cn\u201d  and the letter \u201cv\u201d , effectively changing the appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d  to \u201cin_vent_\u201d , as shown in screenshot  in a centralized panel illustrated in . In this case the caret  would remain in place to indicate that the space correlated with the unique numerical value \u201c3\u201d has been selected. However, if the user communicates the command \u201cinsert\u201d and then communicates the letter \u201cp\u201d, then the letter \u201cp\u201d will be inserted between the letter \u201cn\u201d  and the letter \u201cv\u201d , effectively changing the appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d to \u201cinpvent_\u201d , as shown in screenshot  of a centralized panel illustrated in , and the selection caret  will shift to the following character to indicate that the following character (i.e. the character corresponding to the unique numerical value \u201c4\u201d) has been selected.","Similarly, referring to , consider the case where the user simply wants to change a letter in the word \u201cinvent\u201d displayed on screenshot  of a centralized panel. As discussed herein, the user may vocally communicate a command. This causes a space to be appended to the word \u201cinvent\u201d to create an appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d  and a box  to be displayed around the appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d  and unique numerical values  to be assigned and displayed adjacent each of the characters  in the appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d . As can been seen, the letter \u201cv\u201d  in the appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d  is assigned a unique numerical value  of \u201c3.\u201d As such, the user can vocally communicate the number \u201c3\u201d to system . This causes the letter corresponding to and correlated with the number \u201c3\u201d to be selected as indicated by the caret , which in this case is the letter \u201cv\u201d  in the appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d . The user may then enter in a modification command (in this case the command is simply a letter) causing system  to respond in an appropriate manner. For example if the user communicates the modification command \u201ct\u201d after the number \u201c3\u201d, then the letter \u201cv\u201d  will be replaced with the letter \u201ct\u201d, effectively changing the appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d  to the word \u201cintent\u201d , as shown in screenshot  of a centralized panel illustrated in . At this point the selection caret  will shift to the following character to indicate that the following character (i.e. the character corresponding to the unique numerical value \u201c4\u201d) has been selected.","It should be appreciated that once a user enters the unique numerical value corresponding to the letter to be changed, a menu of suggested modification commands may be displayed, such as a dropdown menu, where each suggested action would be assigned is own unique numerical value. For example, referring to , consider the case where the user wants to change a letter in the word \u201cinvent\u201d displayed on screenshot  of a centralized panel. The user vocally communicates a command. This causes a space to be appended to the selected word \u201cinvent\u201d to create an appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d  and a box  to be displayed around the appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d  and unique numerical values  to be displayed adjacent each of the letters in the appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d . As can been seen, the letter \u201cv\u201d  in the appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d  is assigned a unique numerical value  of \u201c3.\u201d As such, the user would vocally communicate the number \u201c3\u201d to system  to \u201cselect\u201d the character corresponding to and correlated with the unique numerical value \u201c3\u201d as indicated by the caret , which in this case is the letter \u201cv\u201d  in the appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d . Referring to , a menu  may be displayed on centralized panel shot  giving the user a number of modification command choices, each of which is assigned a second unique numerical value . The user may then enter a modification command which is the second unique numerical value  correlated with the desired modification command causing the speech recognition software application to respond in an appropriate manner. For example, if the user communicates the numerical value \u201c4\u201d after the number \u201c3\u201d then the letter \u201cv\u201d  will be replaced with the letter \u201cd\u201d , effectively changing the appended word \u201cinvent_\u201d  to the word \u201cindent\u201d , as shown in screenshot  of a centralized panel in . As above, the selection caret  will shift to the following character to indicate that the following character (i.e. the character corresponding to the unique numerical value \u201c4\u201d) has been selected.","It should be appreciated that the menu  of suggested modification commands may include any modification commands suitable to the desired end purpose, such as a menu of characters\/words that are acoustically similar to the selected letter or word, e.g. if \u201cv\u201d is selected, then the menu  will contain \u201cd\u201d, \u201ct\u201d, \u201ce\u201d, \u201cg\u201d, \u201c3\u201d. Additionally, the menu  may also contain the capitalized form of the characters, e.g. \u201cV\u201d, as well as an auto-complete list from a spell checker. As such, for this example the menu  may include the words \u201cindent\u201d, \u201cintent\u201d, \u201camend.\u201d Furthermore, it should be appreciated that the present invention may include voice commands that performing multiple functions simultaneously, e.g. \u201cChange 3 to \u201ce\u201d as in eagle,\u201d or \u201cChange t to g\u201d may change the letter \u201ct\u201d to the letter \u201cg\u201d if there were only one letter \u201ct\u201d in the selected word. If there were two letters \u201ct\u201d in the selected word, feedback may be provided to the user to be more precise. Moreover, other commands may also be provided such as \u201cundo\u201d which may revert previously changed characters to their previous state, e.g. if the user says \u201ccap that\u201d (to capitalize the selected letter), but the input is recognized as \u201ccaret\u201d, then the user may say \u201cundo\u201d to revert the letter to the previous state.","With reference to , these figures are discussed in the context of a user dictating to a word processing application. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that the embodiments discussed in  can also apply to a user uttering a voice command to system . If a voice command is ambiguous, centralized interface module  will visually render a list of interpretations and also visually render a list of further alternatives. The list of further alternatives include an alternative to respeak the command and an alternative to create a new command. For example, if the user would like to send email to David White, the user can audibly issue the command \u201cinsert the name David\u201d. However, if the user has previously sent email to David Black and David Green, but never has sent email to David White, there is an ambiguity as to what David to insert. Centralized interface module  visually renders a list of David interpretations. The list of interpretations includes David Black and David Green. In addition, centralized interface module  visually renders a list of further alternatives that includes an alternative to respeak the voice command and an alternative to create a new voice command. In this example, the user would choose to create a new command because the user desires to email David White, which is unfamiliar to system .","In addition to clarifying commands and correcting misrecognition errors by interacting with a centralized interface module , a user can also interact with centralized interface module  to receive feedback from the plurality of application modules . Centralized interface module  is configured to visually render what system  is listening for. For example, the centralized panel can display that system  is listening for nothing because microphone  is turned off. In addition, centralized interface module  is also configured to visually render the status of system . For example, the centralized panel can display the last command recognized by system . In another embodiment, the centralized panel can display that a particular application module is opening or closing.","Although the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 23"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
