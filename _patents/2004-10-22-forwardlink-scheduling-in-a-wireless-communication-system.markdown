title: Forward-link scheduling in a wireless communication system
abstract: A method and apparatus for selecting a favored transmission slot for communicating non-voice data in conjunction with a voice-data communication. The slot, reflecting a favored power level and transmission rate for transmitting the non-voice data on a supplemental channel, is selected based upon the transmission power levels for voice-data transmitted by a base station to a remote station on a fundamental channel. The favored transmission slot is selected without the remote station messaging information to the base station concerning frequency channel or interference information for the supplemental channel. A method of performing forward-link scheduling in a wireless communication system includes determining the available base station power at the beginning of a frame, predicting the required transmit power at the beginning of the frame for each supplemental channel, determining rates sustainable with the predicted transmit power, dividing by throughput over a recent window to obtain a supplemental channel priority index, and allowing the supplemental channel with the highest priority index to transmit over the next frame.

No. 10\/972,198, filed on Oct. 22, 2004, assigned to the assignee hereof, and expressly incorporated by reference herein.","1. Field","The present invention relates to wireless communications. More particularly, the present invention pertains to methods and apparatus for performing forward-link scheduling in a wireless communication system.","2. Background","Traditionally, wireless communication systems were required to support a variety of services. One such communication system is a code division multiple access (CDMA) system which conforms to the \u201cTIA\/EIA\/IS-95 Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d hereinafter referred to as IS-95. The use of CDMA techniques in a multiple access communication system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307, entitled \u201cSPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS,\u201d and U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,459, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM,\u201d both assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/382,438, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS USING A MULTI-CARRIER FORWARD LINK IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM,\u201d each of which is incorporated by reference herein.","More recently, wireless systems such as the CDMA systems mentioned above have offered hybrid services, such as providing both wireless voice and data communications. To coordinate the implementation of such services, the International Telecommunications Union requested the submission of proposed standards for providing high-rate data and high-quality speech services over wireless communication channels. A preliminary proposal was issued by the Telecommunications Industry Association, entitled \u201cThe cdma2000 ITU-R RTT Candidate Submission,\u201d incorporated by reference herein and hereafter referred to as cdma2000. Various methods for transmitting non-voice data over fundamental and supplemental channels are disclosed in cdma2000.","In a CDMA system, a user communicates with the network through one or more base stations. For example, a user on a remote station (RS) may communicate with a land-based data source, such as the Internet, by transmitting data to a base station (BS) via a wireless link. This link between the RS and the BS is commonly referred to as the \u201creverse link.\u201d The BS receives the data and routes it through a base station controller (BSC) to the land-based data network. When data is transmitted from the BS to the RS, it is transmitted on the \u201cforward link.\u201d In CDMA IS-95 systems, the forward link (FL) and the reverse link (RL) are allocated to separate frequencies.","The remote station communicates with at least one base station during a communication. However, CDMA RSs are also capable of communicating with multiple BSs simultaneously, such as during soft handoff. Soft handoff is a process of establishing a new forward and reverse link with a new base station before breaking the old links with the previous base station. Soft handoff minimizes the probability of dropped calls, that is, where a call is inadvertently disconnected from the system. A method and apparatus for providing communications between an RS and more than one BS during the soft handoff process is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,267,261, entitled \u201cMOBILE ASSISTED SOFT HANDOFF IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM,\u201d assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein.","Given the growing demand for wireless data applications, the need for very efficient voice and data wireless communication systems has become increasingly significant. One method for transmitting data in code channel frames of fixed size is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,773, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE FORMATTING OF DATA FOR TRANSMISSION,\u201d assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein. In accordance with the IS-95 standard, non-voice data or voice data is partitioned into code channel frames that are 20 msec wide with data rates as high as 14.4 kbps.","A significant difference between voice services and data services is the fact that voice services have stringent fixed delay requirements. Typically, the overall one-way delay of voice services must be less than 100 msec. In contrast, selectively planned data service delays, even above 100 msec, can be used to optimize the efficiency of the communication system. For example, error correction coding techniques that require relatively long delays can be used with data service transmissions.","Some parameters that measure the quality and effectiveness of data transmissions are the transmission delay required for transferring a data packet, and the average throughput rate of the system. As explained above, a transmission delay does not have the same impact in data or \u201cnon-voice\u201d communication as it does for a voice or \u201cvoice-data\u201d communication. Still, delays cannot be ignored because they are an important metric for measuring the quality of the data communication system. The average throughput rate is reflective of the efficiency of the data transmission capability of the communication system.","Further, in a wireless communication system, capacity is maximized when the transmission energy for a signal is kept to a minimum value while satisfying the quality performance requirements for the signal. That is, the quality of transmitted voice-data or non-voice data cannot be significantly degraded when received. One measure of the quality of a received signal is the carrier-to-interference ratio (C\/I) at the receiver. Thus, it is desirable to provide a transmission power control system that maintains a constant C\/I at a receiver. Such a system is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,056,109 entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Controlling Transmission Power in a CDMA Cellular Telephone System,\u201d assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein.","It is well known that in cellular systems the C\/I of any given user is a function of the location of the RS within a coverage area. In order to maintain a given level of service, TDMA and FDMA systems resort to frequency reuse techniques, i.e. not all frequency channels and\/or time slots are used in each base station. In a CDMA system, the same frequency channel allocation is reused in every cell of the system, thereby improving the overall efficiency. The C\/I associated with an RS determines the information rate that can be supported on the forward link from the base station to the user's RS. An exemplary system for transmitting high rate digital data in a wireless communication system is disclosed in issued U.S. Pat. No. 6,574,211, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HIGHER RATE PACKET DATA TRANSMISSION,\u201d issued on Jun. 3, 2003, assigned to the assignee of the present application and incorporated by reference herein.","Because the C\/I associated with a RS determines the information rate that can be supported on the forward link, it is useful to know transmission information for each frequency channel used and historic C\/I information. This information is commonly collected at the RS and messaged to the BS. But this messaging uses valuable system resources. What is needed is an invention that would eliminate such messaging requirements. Preferably, the BS transmission power levels on a first channel would be used to predict favorable slots for transmitting additional data on a second channel.","It is well known in the art that knowledge of a communication channel can be used to increase capacity in a CDMA system by transmitting mostly at times when channel conditions are good. See, e.g., S. W. Kim & A. Goldsmith, \u201cTruncated Power Control in Code Division Multiple Access Communications,\u201d Globecom (1997); R. Knopp & P. Humblet, \u201cMultiple-Accessing over Frequency-Selective Fading Channels,\u201d PIMRC (1995); A. Goldsmith & P. Varaiya, \u201cIncreasing Spectral Efficiency Through Power Control,\u201d ICC (1993). This technique is commonly referred to as \u201cwaterfilling.\u201d An issue that arises in cellular or PCS CDMA systems is fairness in that users nearer to a given BS may be favored in a waterfilling approach. Accordingly, there is a tradeoff between total throughput and fairness among users.","An algorithm based on priority given just by the carrier-to-interference ratio (C\/I) would always give all the of power to the user close to the BS with the best channel. This would maximize system throughput but be unfair to users that are far from the BS. One solution, recently introduced by D. Tse and entitled \u201cForward-Link Multiuser Diversity Through Rate Adaptation and Scheduling\u201d (not yet published), attempts to compromise between throughput and fairness by including throughput monitoring that introduces fairness by raising the priority of users who do not transmit overly long. Nevertheless, a need exists in the art to provide an improved forward-link scheduling technique that compromises between fairness and system throughput and is suitable for multiple users.","Broadly, the present invention solves a new technical challenge posed by the increasing demand for wireless communication services. The invention concerns a method and apparatus for selecting a favored transmission \u201cslot\u201d for non-voice data that is transmitted in conjunction with a voice-data communication. The slot, reflecting a desirable power level and transmission rate for the non-voice data, is selected based upon the transmission power levels for voice-data transmitted by a base station to a remote station.","In one embodiment, the invention may be implemented to provide a method for predicting a favored slot for transmitting non-voice data on a supplemental channel used in a wireless communication system. Generally, metrics reflecting the quality of voice-data signals sent by a base location are measured at a remote station. One or more of the metrics, or a value representing the quality of the received signal, is messaged from the remote station to the base location. If desirable, the base location may adjust the voice-data transmission power in consideration of the messages or values. Concurrently, the forward link voice-data transmission power levels are monitored at the base location. The voice-data is transmitted to the remote station using the first channel, more specifically referred to herein as a fundamental channel.","In one embodiment, a dynamic transmission power value is computed using various voice-data transmission power levels transmitted on the first channel. This value is then used to select a desired slot for transmitting additional data. This additional data is transmitted on a second channel such as a supplemental channel, shared or not shared, using a desired transmission power level and data rate for transmitting the additional data.","In another embodiment, the invention provides an article of manufacture containing digital information executable by a digital signal-processing device. In yet another embodiment, the invention yields an apparatus used to practice the methods of the invention. The apparatus may comprise a remote station and at least one base station that has, amongst other things, a transceiver used to communicate information signals to the remote station. Obviously, to receive signals, the remote station also includes a transceiver communicatively coupled to the base station, and possibly satellites where applicable. The apparatus will also include at least one digital data processing apparatus, such as a microprocessor or application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), that is communicatively coupled to the network or one of its component parts.","The invention provides its users with numerous advantages. One advantage is that it allows power control of a supplemental channel to be established based upon the base location transmitted power for voice-data. Another advantage is that the invention reduces system resource costs currently experienced by communication networks. These networks rely on messages received from a remote station regarding the quality of the supplemental channel signal as received at the remote station. Yet another advantage is that the invention allows a favorable transmission slot in any channel carrying non-voice data to be selected using historic base location transmission power levels for voice data. The invention also provides a number of other advantages and benefits that should become even more apparent after reviewing the following detailed descriptions of the invention.","In one aspect of the invention, a method of scheduling transmit rates and transmit powers of data users of a first type of channel on a forward-link of a wireless communication system, the wireless communication system including a plurality of base stations and a plurality of data users, each data user configured to communicate with any base station by sending frames to the base station and receiving frames from the base station, is provided. The method advantageously includes the steps of determining an available base station power level at the beginning of a frame; predicting a required transmit power level at the beginning of the frame for each data user; determining transmission rates for each data user that are sustainable with the predicted required transmit power level; generating a priority index for each data user; and controlling an order of transmission for the data users so that the data user having the highest priority index transmits first over the next frame.","In one embodiment the step of generating the priority index for each data user comprises dividing the transmission data rates for each user by a throughput value for each user.","In one embodiment the step of predicting the required transmit power level at the beginning of the frame for each data user comprises predicting transmit power levels for each data user of a second type of channel, wherein all of the data users use the first type of channel and the second type of channel, and multiplying the predicted transmit power levels for the second channel by gain factors to convert the predicted transmit power levels to transmit power levels for the first type of channel.","In one embodiment the step of predicting a required transmit power level at the beginning of the frame for each data user further comprises multiplying the predicted transmit power levels for the first type of channel by a margin value to ensure an appropriate average power over the frame.","In one embodiment the method further comprises allowing another data user to transmit if a sufficient remaining base station power level exists.","In another aspect of the invention, an infrastructure element of a wireless communication system wherein a plurality of infrastructure elements communicate with a plurality of data users by exchanging frames on a first type of channel, is provided. The infrastructure element advantageously includes a processor; and a processor-readable storage medium coupled to the processor and containing a set of instructions executable by the processor to determine an available power level for the infrastructure element at the beginning of a frame, predict a required transmit power level at the beginning of the frame for each data user, determine transmission rates for each data user that are sustainable with the predicted required transmit power level, generate a priority index for each data user, and control an order of transmission for the data users so that the data user having the highest priority index transmits first over the next frame.","In another aspect of the invention, an infrastructure element of a wireless communication system wherein a plurality of infrastructure elements communicate with a plurality of data users by exchanging frames on a first type of channel, is provided. The infrastructure element advantageously includes means for determining an available power level for the infrastructure element at the beginning of a frame; means for predicting a required transmit power level at the beginning of the frame for each data user; means for determining transmission rates for each data user that are sustainable with the predicted required transmit power level; means for generating a priority index for each data user; and means for controlling an order of transmission for the data users so that the data user having the highest priority index transmits first over the next frame.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIGS. 1\u20139"},"IS-95 supports medium data (MDR) transmission of data by allowing a base location (BS) to communicate with a remote station (RS) using up to eight (8) forward links and up to eight (8) reverse links. Further advances have been made allowing for even higher data rate (HDR) transmissions using somewhat similar systems. Generally, data can be more efficiently communicated between a BS and a RS if it is transmitted at the lowest possible power level required for maintaining the quality of the communication.","Transmission of voice-data generally relies on the large number of uncorrelated users communicating with a base station and well-behaved Markov voice statistics to balance both RF capacity and RF stability. These large numbers of uncorrelated users result in a forward link RF transmit power distribution that is predictably stationary and log-normal. Without this forward link RF power predictability, forward link power control and mobile assisted handoff would be unstable.","However, transmission of non-voice data, such as downloading data from the Internet, is not as well behaved. Data traffic often comes in bursts, resulting in relatively long periods of maximum rate transmission followed by relatively long periods of minimum rate transmission. With the advent of MDR and HDR networks, these effects become even more pronounced. Unlike correlated voice links, these links switch between maximum rate and minimum rate together and power control together. This can cause the forward link power distribution as a whole to be decidedly non-stationary and non-log-normal.","In a typical communication network, RS users (users) have different radio frequency (RF) requirements depending upon their location relative to the base station or stations with which they are in communication. The worse a user's RF environment, the more power a base station requires to deliver a fixed amount of data. Therefore, users experiencing a poor RF environment use more network capacity. For example, users in different physical locations will experience different fading conditions, such as a user passing into the RF shadow of a building, whereas another user may be passing into the RF shadow of a tree. These conditions will reduce the strength of the received signals, resulting in a poorer quality received signal than if the fade had not occurred. To overcome fading, transmission power may be increased.","As shown in , the transmission power level for voice-data transmitted from a BS to a RS may vary with time. For example, at time  the power level used to transmit voice-data to a user # from a BS is at a maximum. At time , the power level required to transmit voice-data to a user # is at a minimum. At time , the average voice-data transmission power level for users # and # is at a minimum. In one embodiment of the invention, the slot  shown in  is a favorable time, or slot, to transmit additional data on the data channel of user #. This determination is made using the voice-data transmission power levels as measured at the base location. Selecting non-voice data to be transmitted to a user on a second channel based on predicted BS power levels for voice-data transmissions on a first channel maximizes overall data through-put and does not require any quality metric messaging from the RS to the BS regarding the second channel.","This basic method assures that voice-data transmissions are guaranteed: 1) a minimum bandwidth; 2) a maximum delay window; and, 3) a given data rate. However, non-voice data users generally have less stringent communication quality requirements so the transmission data rate can be varied. However, the invention can also be used for solely non-voice data transmissions. In this embodiment, non-voice data is communicated using one or more forward link channels, but having an overall fixed total transmission power. The communication transmits at data rates that ensure the transmission power level is below the total allowable transmission power level. This is accomplished first by using a full-rate fundamental channel and then adding supplemental channels for transmitting. The transmission power used to transmit on the supplemental channels is determined from the transmission power measured at the BS for transmissions on the fundamental channel. Regardless, the transmission power levels for the channels used to transmit the non-voice data aggregate to a value below the total allowable transmission power.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304"]},"As voice-data transmissions occur, the RS receiving the transmission measures pre-selected metrics reflective of the quality of the communication received. These metrics can include bit error rate as well as other commonly used metrics. If the quality of the received signal falls off and remains poor, the RS messages a representative value to the BS in task . This message may indicate that an increase, decrease, or no change in transmission power for data transmitted on the first channel is required. If necessary, the transmission power level may be adjusted in task .","As the BS transmits data on the fundamental channel, the transmission power levels are monitored at the BS in task . A dynamic value reflecting the aggregated transmission levels and distributions is determined in task . In this embodiment, the dynamic value may reflect the momentary average transmission power level. In other embodiments, the dynamic value may be determined in a multitude of ways known in the art, so long as the dynamic value represents the lowest transmission power value at a selected point in time for first channel transmissions. Using these dynamic values, the most favored slot for transmission of data on a second channel may be predicted in task . Non-voice data for a RS user in need of the data may be selected and the data transmitted. If the non-voice data communication is complete, then the method ends in task . However, if the communication is not complete, or if a transmissions intended for another user are desired, then the method repeats itself in task .","In addition to the various method embodiments described above, a different aspect of the invention concerns apparatus embodiments used to perform the methods.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"i":["a ","b "],"b":["401","401","401","401","403","403","405"]},"The encoder  receives the signal and builds a redundancy into the signal for error-correcting purposes. Different \u201ccodes\u201d may be used to determine how the redundancy will be built into the signal. These encoded bits are called symbols. The repetition generator  repeats the symbols it receives a predetermined number of times, thus allowing part of the symbols to be lost due to a transmission error without affecting the overall quality of the information being sent. Block interleaver  takes the symbols and jumbles them. The long code generator  receives the jumbled symbols and scrambles them using a pseudorandom noise sequence generated at a predetermined chip rate. Each symbol is XOR-ed with one of the pseudorandom chips of the scrambling sequence.","The information may be transmitted using more than one carrier (channel) as explained with regards to the method, above. Accordingly, a demultiplexer (not shown) may take an input signal \u201ca\u201d and split it into multiple output signals in such a way that the input signal may be recovered. In one embodiment the signal \u201ca\u201d is split into three separate signals, each signal representing a selected data-type, and is transmitted using one FL channel per data-type signal. In another embodiment, the demultiplexer may split signal \u201ca\u201d into two components per data-type. Regardless of the arrangement, the present invention contemplates that distinct signals generated from a parent signal can be transmitted using one or more channels.","Further, this technique can be applied to multiple users whose signals are transmitted using completely or partially the same FL channels. For example, if the signals from four different users are going to be sent using the same three FL channels, then each of these signals is \u201cchannelized\u201d by demultiplexing each signal into three components, where each component will be sent using a different FL channel. For each channel, the respective signals are multiplexed together to form one signal per FL channel. Then, using the technique described herein, the signals are transmitted. The demultiplexed signal is then encoded by a Walsh encoder (not shown) and spread into two components, components I and Q, by a multiplier (also not shown). These components are summed by a summer and communicated to a remote station (not shown).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"i":["a ","b "],"b":"500"},"In the exemplary embodiment of the wireless communication device transmits a plurality of distinct channels of information which are distinguished from one another by short orthogonal spreading sequences as described in the U.S. patent application Ser.
