Each claimed business has at least one chat channel, and a claimed business may define a plurality of channels, wherein each channel can be assigned to a category of communication with the business. Moreover, each channel can be provided with a label that is visible to a user, so that the user can select a desired channel of the claimed business over which to engage in chat.","A \u201cchat session\u201d is a specific connection between at least one user who has been subscribed to a chat channel and at least one seat operator of the claimed business.","A \u201cset\u201d includes at least one member.","A \u201cseat\u201d is a chat node that can be staffed by an individual or robot (sometimes herein called an \u201cinstalled application\u201d) representing a given business in chat. Accordingly, when a user seeks to chat with a business having a plurality of seats, it is possible for the chat management server to subscribe the user to chat with a seat of the business that is not currently engaged in chat (or which currently has sufficient capacity to engage in chat) with the user (assuming of course that the seat is being occupied by an individual representing the business in chat).","A seat is \u201cbusy\u201d if the number of concurrent chat sessions associated with the seat reaches a pre-specified threshold.","A \u201cseat operator\u201d is an individual or robot occupying a seat and representing the claimed business.","A \u201cchat host\u201d is an individual or group for which there has been established a personal account to host chat and for which there is at least one assigned seat.","A \u201ccomputer process\u201d is the performance of a described function in a computer using computer hardware (such as a processor, field-programmable gate array or other electronic combinatorial logic, or similar device), which may be operating under control of software or firmware or a combination of any of these or operating outside control of any of the foregoing. All or part of the described function may be performed by active or passive electronic components, such as transistors or resistors. In using the term \u201ccomputer process\u201d we do not necessarily require a schedulable entity, or operation of a computer program or a part thereof, although, in some embodiments, a computer process may be implemented by such a schedulable entity, or operation of a computer program or a part thereof. Furthermore, unless the context otherwise requires, a \u201cprocess\u201d may be implemented using more than one processor or more than one (single- or multi-processor) computer.","A \u201cuser device\u201d is a computer that is used by a user and implemented as a desktop unit, a laptop unit, a tablet, a smartphone, or as any other computer having access to a network.","A \u201csearch signal\u201d is a signal originating from a user device to indicate that the user device is running a process configured to support a chat session managed in accordance with embodiments described herein and it includes data characterizing criteria for a business with which the user seeks to chat.","When a device of a particular user is \u201clogged in\u201d, the device is authorized by the chat management server to send communications from, and receive communications to, the particular user.","An \u201cinstalled application\u201d is an application, provided by a claimed business, that is configured to run, under conditions established by the business, after a user has been subscribed to a chat channel in order to provide to provide communication functionality, between the business and the user, that is enhanced in comparison to simple chat. The application may be stored on the chat management server or on a server of the business.","\u201cBusiness administrator\u201d is a role assigned to a business user affiliated with a claimed business in which the business user is empowered by the chat management server to configure chat management settings pertinent to the claimed business.","\u201cLocation administrator\u201d is a role assigned to a business user affiliated with a claimed business, as to a specific location of the claimed business, in which the business user is empowered by the chat management server to configure chat management settings pertinent to the claimed business solely with respect to the specific location.","\u201cBusiness operator\u201d is a role assigned to a business user affiliated with a claimed business in which the business user is not empowered by the chat management server to configure chat management settings for any other business user.","\u201cChat metadata\u201d is data characterizing chat activity on the chat management server other than the specific content of the chat itself.","\u201cRESTful\u201d a set of architectural principles that govern operation of an application programming interface (API) for the chat management server described herein. These principles define structures that pertain to communication between clients and servers and are applicable, among other things, to how resource states are addressed and transferred over HTTP by a wide range of clients written in different languages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0121"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"11"},"In process  of , responsive to the search signal, the server identifies a set of businesses meeting the criteria, and for each business in the set of businesses, the server determines availability status data for each location. In process , the server transmits, to the device, availability status data for the set of businesses for display on the user's device. In process  of , the server receives over the first network a request message originated by the user on the device to enter a chat channel established for a selected one of the set of businesses. In process , responsive to the request message, the server subscribes the user device to the chat channel for the selected one of the set of businesses, and in process , the server transmits to the device, over the first network, a launch-chat command.","As we show in further detail below, although the processes have been described in connection with a single business with which the user of the device wishes to chat, embodiments herein support chatting of the user with a plurality of businesses. Also, although the processes have been described in connection with a single user device, embodiments herein support making chat history, and further chat, available to the user simultaneously on a plurality of devices. Of course, the processes illustrated with respect to a given user can be replicated with any number of other users who would use their own devices for engaging in chat with businesses of their own selection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0124"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["21","22","21","23","24","25","21","23","24","25"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0125"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"31"},"In various embodiments of the present invention, when a user seeks to enter into chat with a business, the business may itself have established a structure for handling chat of various different types. For example, the business may assign one set of seats to handling chat relating to product returns, another set of seats to handling technical questions concerning product usage, and another set of seats to handle order inquiries. Each set of seats is a different \u201ctype\u201d of seat. Each different type of seat we call in this description and in the accompanying claims a \u201cchannel\u201d. Embodiments of the present invention therefore accommodate a plurality of seat types (that is, a plurality of channels) that can be assigned and configured by the business (namely, by the \u201cbusiness administrator\u201d) according to its own needs. Moreover, the user need not be presented with a monolithic icon representing the entire business for purposes of chat. Instead, the business may choose to have the user experience a different icon for each channel\u2014in other words, the user may press one icon to chat with the business about a product return, another icon to chat with the business about technical questions concerning product usage, and yet another icon to chat with the business about an order inquiry. Moreover, when a user seeks to review chat history (discussed below, for example, in connection with ), the chat history will reflect the user's chat experience for the channel (as opposed to simply chat with a given business operator), and the chat history will also show the name of the business operator in each chat session.","Returning now to , in process , the server receives a request message from a user device to enter a chat channel for a selected business and a seat type selected by the user. In process , responsive to the request message, the server determines the logical status for each seat operator, that is, determines whether an individual representing the business is currently occupying each seat. In process , the server determines physical availability status and device status for the user's device. In process , the server selects one operator from a list of available operators, using a suitable algorithm, such as round-robin or first-come-first served. If an operator is available, then in process , the server subscribes the user device to a chat channel for the selected business and the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0128"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["41","42","43","44"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0129"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["51","52","53","54","53","55","56"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0130"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 3 and 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["61","62","63","64","64","68","67","64","616","69","610","615","617","617","619","55","619","620","621","611","614","621","64","621","613","612"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0131"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["71","72","73","72","77"]},"In another case in , in process , the business is currently offline, and the availability data already sent in process  has notified the user that the business is currently offline.
