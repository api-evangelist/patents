{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/171,535, filed on Apr. 22, 2009. The disclosures of the above application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This application is related to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/190,471, filed on Aug. 28, 2008 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/173,785, filed on Apr. 29, 2009.","The present invention relates to engine control systems and more particularly to coordinated torque control based techniques for multi-pulse direct injection operation.","The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.","Traditional engine control systems are limited in accurately controlling engine torque output. The traditional engine control systems are also slow to respond to received control signals and limited in coordinate engine torque control with respect to various devices that affect engine torque output.","Powertrain control systems include various modules that require a certain amount of engine torque to operate properly. For example, an automatic transmission control module may need to momentarily reduce torque from the engine in order to change transmission gears. Another example is an air conditioning clutch control module that needs a momentary increase in engine torque before engaging an air conditioning compressor clutch. The engine torque increase helps maintain a constant engine speed when the compressor clutch engages, such as when the engine is idling.","Traditionally, the various modules affect torque actuators directly. For example, the automatic transmission control module may retard a spark advance to the engine to reduce the engine torque during the shift. Similarly, the air conditioning clutch control module may increase the spark advance to increase the engine torque during the moment prior to engaging the compressor clutch.","As vehicle powertrain systems include more modules and more actuators that affect torque, the architecture of the prior art becomes cumbersome to maintain and undesirably difficult to troubleshoot. As an example of more actuators, hybrid vehicles include an engine and an electric motor that provide torque. Integrating the hybrid vehicle powertrain to existing torque-modifying modules can be undesirably cumbersome with traditional powertrain control architectures.","Coordinated torque control (CTC) systems have been developed to accurately control engine output torque. An example torque control system is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 7,021,282 (\u201cCoordinated Engine Torque Control\u201d). CTC systems provide a rapid response to control signals and coordinate engine torque control based on various devices that affect engine torque output.","In one embodiment, a coordinated torque control system is provided that includes a catalyst module that generates a multi-mode enable signal based on a catalyst light off enable signal. A torque reserve module generates a torque reserve signal based on the multi-mode enable signal, an engine speed signal and an air per cylinder signal. The torque reserve module operates in a multi-pulse mode that is associated with injecting N pulses of fuel into a combustion chamber during a combustion cycle of the engine based on the multi-mode enable signal, where N is an integer greater than or equal to 2.","In other features, a method of determining a corrected torque reserve for a coordinated torque control system is provided. The method includes generating a multi-mode enable signal based on a catalyst light off enable signal. A torque reserve module is operated in a multi-pulse mode that is associated with injecting N pulses of fuel into a combustion chamber during a combustion cycle of the engine based on the multi-mode enable signal. N is an integer greater than or equal to 2. A torque reserve signal is generated based on the multi-mode enable signal, an engine speed signal and an air per cylinder signal.","Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.","In the following description, different fuel injection pulse modes are described. Transitions between the fuel injection pulse modes may be performed based on performance of a catalyst light off (CLO). Catalyst light off refers to the quick heating of a catalyst of an exhaust system. A catalyst has an associated temperature operating range in which the catalyst is effective in reducing tailpipe hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen emissions. By quickly heating the catalyst up to a temperature within the temperature operating range, tailpipe emissions are minimized.","A first fuel injection pulse mode, referred to as a single pulse mode, includes the injecting of a single pulse of fuel into a combustion chamber during a combustion cycle. A combustion cycle may, for example, in a 4-stroke engine, refer to a single sequencing through the 4 strokes (intake, compression, ignition, and exhaust). A single pulse mode may be used when an engine is not requiring maximum CLO.","A second fuel injection pulse mode, referred to as a multi-pulse mode, includes the injecting of two or more pulses of fuel into a combustion chamber during a combustion cycle. In one embodiment, two pulses of fuel are injected into a combustion chamber during a combustion cycle. The use of the multi-pulse mode allows for emission output control without the use of an air pump. An air pump is commonly used to inject oxygen-rich air into an exhaust system to support oxidation of exhaust gas and thus heating of a catalyst. For a double-pulse mode, a first injection may be provided at normal crankshaft angles to provide an initial homogeneous lean mixture. A second injection may be provided late in a compression stroke. For example only, the first pulse may provide a lean homogeneous mixture and the second pulse may provide additional fuel near the spark plug for strong ignition resulting in a more complete combustion of the combined charge.","The multi-pulse mode in combination with retarded spark (ignition) timing allows an engine to emit low hydrocarbon emissions while the catalyst is cold and inactive while transferring energy from a burning charge into thermal energy in the exhaust. This heats up the catalyst quickly with minimal passing of unburned hydrocarbons into the catalyst while the catalyst is operating in an inefficient state.","Coordinated torque control systems have been developed for spark ignition direct injection (SIDI) engines for a single pulse-based combustion cycle. An example coordinated torque control system is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 7,021,282 (\u201cCoordinated Engine Torque Control\u201d). To support coordinated torque control, other systems have been developed, such as for torque estimation and torque based speed control. Examples of the torque estimation and torque based speed control systems are disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,704,638 and 7,463,970. The following embodiments may be performed in both speed and torque control modules.","The following described embodiments provide a coordinated torque control architecture for operation in single and\/or multi-pulse modes. Control techniques are also described for the transitioning between the single and multi-pulse modes.","The following description of the preferred embodiments is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify the same elements.","The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.","As used herein, the term module may refer to, be part of, or include an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and\/or memory (shared, dedicated, or group) that execute one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and\/or other suitable components that provide the described functionality.","In addition, although the following embodiments are described primarily with respect to example internal combustion engines, the embodiments of the present disclosure may apply to other internal combustion engines. For example, the present invention may apply to spark ignition, homogenous spark ignition, homogeneous charge compression ignition, stratified spark ignition, and spark assisted compression ignition engines.","In the below-described embodiments, displacement on demand and\/or cylinder deactivation may refer to the disabling of spark and\/or fuel injection into a cylinder. When a cylinder is disabled spark and\/or fuel may be disabled for that cylinder. This prevents combustion within that cylinder. The disabling of a cylinder may also or alternatively include retarding spark of a cylinder. Retarding spark refers to the delaying of spark timing such that spark for a cylinder occurs after top-dead-center (TDC).","Referring now to , a CTC system  that incorporates fuel injection mode transitioning for CLO is shown. The CTC system  may be configured for a hybrid electric vehicle and\/or for a SIDI engine. Although the following embodiment is directed to a hybrid vehicle, the embodiments disclosed herein may be applied to non-hybrid vehicles. The CTC system  includes an engine  that combusts an air\/fuel mixture to produce drive torque for a vehicle based on a driver input module . Air is drawn into an intake manifold  through a throttle valve . A CTC module , which may be referred to as an engine control module, commands a throttle actuator module  to regulate opening of the throttle valve  to control the amount of air drawn into the intake manifold .","Other example CTC systems are shown and described with respect to the embodiments of  and B. The CTC system  and\/or the CTC module  of  may include one or more of the modules of  and B.","Air from the intake manifold  is drawn into cylinders of the engine . The engine  may include any number of cylinders. The CTC module  may instruct a cylinder actuator module  to selectively deactivate some of the cylinders to improve fuel economy.","Air from the intake manifold  is drawn into the cylinder  through an intake valve . The CTC module  controls the amount of fuel injected by a fuel injection system  that includes one or more fuel injectors . The fuel injection system  may inject fuel into the intake manifold  at a central location or may inject fuel into the intake manifold  at multiple locations, such as near the intake valve of each of the cylinders. Alternatively, the fuel injection system  may inject fuel directly into the cylinders, as shown.","The injected fuel mixes with the air and creates the air\/fuel mixture in the cylinder . A piston (not shown) within the cylinder  compresses the air\/fuel mixture. Based upon a signal from the CTC module , a spark actuator module  energizes a spark plug  in the cylinder , which ignites the air\/fuel mixture. The timing of the spark may be specified relative to the crankshaft angle when the piston is at its topmost position, referred to as to top dead center (TDC), the point at which the air\/fuel mixture is most compressed.","The combustion of the air\/fuel mixture drives the piston down, thereby driving a rotating crankshaft (not shown). The piston then begins moving up again and expels the byproducts of combustion through an exhaust valve . The byproducts of combustion are exhausted from the vehicle via an exhaust system . Exhaust passes through a catalyst .","The intake valve  may be controlled by an intake camshaft , while the exhaust valve  may be controlled by an exhaust camshaft . In various implementations, multiple intake camshafts may control multiple intake valves per cylinder and\/or may control the intake valves of multiple banks of cylinders. Similarly, multiple exhaust camshafts may control multiple exhaust valves per cylinder and\/or may control exhaust valves for multiple banks of cylinders. The cylinder actuator module  may deactivate cylinders by halting provision of fuel and spark and\/or disabling their exhaust and\/or intake valves.","A CTC module  may regulate the position of the intake valve  and\/or the exhaust valve  to regulate the quantity of air ingested and inert residual gases retained in the cylinder(s) . The CTC module  may also adjust operation of the fuel injector(s) , such as ON time or size of injector openings, to increase the amount of fuel injected into the cylinder(s) . The CTC module  may also adjust the timing of the exhaust camshaft(s) corresponding to the change in the A\/F mixture.","The crankshaft angle at which the intake valve  is opened may be varied with respect to piston TDC by an intake cam phasor . The crankshaft angle at which the exhaust valve  is opened may be varied with respect to piston TDC by an exhaust cam phasor . A phasor actuator module  controls the intake cam phasor  and the exhaust cam phasor  based on signals from the CTC module .","The CTC system  may include a boost device that provides pressurized air to the intake manifold . For example,  depicts a turbocharger . The turbocharger  is powered by exhaust gases flowing through the exhaust system , and provides a compressed air charge to the intake manifold . The turbocharger  may compress air before the air reaches the intake manifold .","A wastegate  may allow exhaust gas to bypass the turbocharger , thereby reducing the turbocharger's output (or boost). The CTC module  controls the turbocharger  via a boost actuator module . The boost actuator module  may modulate the boost of the turbocharger  by controlling the position of the wastegate . The compressed air charge is provided to the intake manifold  by the turbocharger . An intercooler (not shown) may dissipate some of the compressed air charge's heat, which is generated when air is compressed and may also be increased by proximity to the exhaust system . Alternate engine systems may include a supercharger that provides compressed air to the intake manifold  and is driven by the crankshaft.","The CTC system  may include an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve , which selectively redirects exhaust gas back to the intake manifold . In various implementations, the EGR valve  may be located after the turbocharger . The CTC system  may measure the speed of the crankshaft in revolutions per minute (RPM) using an engine speed sensor . The temperature of the engine coolant may be measured using an engine coolant temperature (ECT) sensor . The ECT sensor  may be located within the engine  or at other locations where the coolant is circulated, such as a radiator (not shown).","The pressure within the intake manifold  may be measured using a manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor . In various implementations, engine vacuum may be measured, where engine vacuum is the difference between ambient air pressure and the pressure within the intake manifold . The mass of air flowing into the intake manifold  may be measured using a mass air flow (MAF) sensor . The MAF sensor  may be located in a housing that includes the throttle valve .","The throttle actuator module  may monitor the position of the throttle valve  using one or more throttle position sensors (TPS) . The ambient temperature of air being drawn into the CTC system  may be measured using an intake air temperature (IAT) sensor . The CTC module  may use signals from the sensors to make control decisions for the CTC system .","The CTC module  may communicate with a transmission control module  to coordinate shifting gears in a transmission (not shown). For example, the CTC module  may reduce torque during a gear shift. The CTC module  may communicate with a hybrid control module  to coordinate operation of the engine  and an electric motor . The electric motor  may also function as a generator, and may be used to produce electrical energy for use by vehicle electrical systems and\/or for storage in a battery. In various implementations, the CTC module , the transmission control module , and the hybrid control module  may be integrated into one or more modules.","To abstractly refer to the various control mechanisms of the engine , each system that varies an engine parameter may be referred to as an actuator. For example, the throttle actuator module  can change the blade position, and therefore the opening area, of the throttle valve . The throttle actuator module  can therefore be referred to as an actuator, and the throttle opening area can be referred to as an actuator position.","Similarly, the spark actuator module  can be referred to as an actuator, while the corresponding actuator position is an amount of spark advance. Other actuators include the boost actuator module , the EGR valve , the phasor actuator module , the fuel injection system , and the cylinder actuator module . The term actuator position with respect to these actuators may correspond to boost pressure, EGR valve opening, intake and exhaust cam phasor angles, air\/fuel ratio, and number of cylinders activated, respectively.","While electric motor  may provide torque in series and\/or in parallel with the torque output of engine , it should be appreciated that other configurations are also contemplated to be within the scope of this description. For example, electric motor  may be implemented as one or more electric motors that provide torque-directly to wheels  instead of passing through a transmission .","The combined torque of engine  and electric motor  is applied to an input of transmission . Transmission  may be an automatic transmission that switches gears in accordance with a gear change command from the CTC module . An output shaft of transmission  is coupled to an input of a differential gear . Differential gear  drives axles and wheels . Wheel speed sensors  generate signals that indicate a rotation speed of their respective wheels .","The CTC module  estimates an engine output torque to provide based on received sensor signals and other parameters described herein. The CTC module  may adjust position of the throttle, air-fuel ratio, valve timing, fuel injection, etc. to provide the estimated engine output torque. Based on a desired engine output torque, the CTC module  controls engine devices such that a desired air flow, a desired fuel injection, and\/or a desired spark timing is achieved. The desired engine output torque may be based on a vehicle operator (driver) request and\/or may be controller based, such as a torque output request from a cruise control system. In particular, the CTC module  controls the torque output of the engine based on the coordinated torque control methods and systems of the present disclosure.","The sensor signals that are received by the CTC module  may include sensor signals from: the MAP sensor , the MAF sensor , the throttle position sensor , the IAT sensor , an accelerator pedal position sensor , or other sensors, such as the engine coolant temperature sensor , the engine speed sensor , an ambient temperature sensor , an oil temperature sensor , and a vehicle speed sensor , an exhaust or catalyst temperature sensor .","The CTC module  communicates with the throttle actuator module  and a cruise control module. An example of a cruise control module is shown and described with respect to the embodiment of .

The CTC module  may control the throttle  using a throttle actuator based on a position of an accelerator pedal . The throttle actuator module  may include a motor or a stepper motor, which provides limited and\/or coarse control of the throttle position.","The CTC module  may also control the throttle  using the throttle actuator based on input from the cruise control module, such as an axle torque request. The CTC module  also generates an effective pedal position signal, which represents a throttle position regardless of whether the vehicle operator is depressing the accelerator pedal  or the cruise control module is controlling the amount of throttle.","Air mass, volume, and pressure per cylinder may be determined and\/or estimated based on signals from the sensors , . The CTC control module  may determine a throttle area based on a desired MAP and a desired MAF, and may generate a control signal to control the throttle based on the throttle area. The desired MAP and MAF may be determined based on engine speed and torque request signals.","The engine system  may further include a barometric pressure sensor . The barometric pressure sensor  may be used to determine environmental conditions, which may be further used to determine a desired throttle area. The desired throttle area may correspond to a specific throttle position.","The CTC system  may also include various tables , which may be used when performing arbitration and\/or when performing various functions associated with the modules of the CTC module . Example modules of the CTC  are shown and described with respect to the embodiment of . The tables  may include single-pulse mode tables  and multi-pulse mode tables . The tables may each be associated with one or more of the steps described with respect to the embodiment of .","Referring now also to , a CTC system  is shown. The CTC system  may be part of the CTC system  of . The CTC module  may include modules of the CTC system . The CTC system  includes a CLO enable module  an arbitrator transition control module  and an engine torque control module . The CLO enable module  enables and disables a multi-pulse mode based on various inputs and when CLO is enabled. The arbitrator transition control module  provides a torque predicted final signal Tand a torque immediate final signal T. The torque request signals T, Tmay be based on inputs received from a driver (vehicle operator) interpretation module , an engine capacity module , and a CLO torque reserve module .","The term immediate may refer to torque that is available through adjustment in, for example, spark advance (gas engines) or fuel timing (diesel engines). The term immediate refers to a quick response in torque where the term predicted may refer to torque that is provided slower, such as through the adjustment in throttle control, boost control, egr control, phasor control, etc (manifold based). The engine torque control module  controls a phasor control module , a throttle control module  and a spark control module  based on inputs from the arbitrator transition control module , an engine torque estimator , and an air\/fuel ratio module .","In operation the CLO enable module  receives a CLO enable signal CLO, a torque estimate signal T, an engine speed signal RPM, a torque predicted signal T, a torque immediate signal T, a torque capacity predicted signal T, and a torque immediate capacity signal T.

Minimum spark Smay be a predetermined value and refers to a minimum spark value or minimum spark advance value when operating an engine in a multi-pulse mode, such as when operating in a double-pulse mode. Spark base Srefers to spark advance that provides a minimum amount of hydrocarbons when operating in a multi-pulse mode.","There is a direct relationship between spark advance and hydrocarbon production HC of an engine.

Torque request backbone module  determines the propulsion torque demand based on inputs from various torque requesting modules - that are described below in more detail. The torque requesting modules - include modules that generate signals to affect the control of one or more of actuators (i.e. actuators ), which alter engine torque. The propulsion torque demand represents the torque desired from an engine in order to satisfy requests from the torque requesting modules -.","As an example, a CTC system may generate a throttle control signal based on an engine torque request and a throttle position signal generated by a throttle position sensor (TPS). The engine torque request may be based on a vehicle operator input, such as an accelerator pedal position. The CTC system commands one or more devices based on the engine torque request and the throttle position signal.
