No. 08\/470,224, filed on Jun. 6, 1995, abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08\/316,909, filed on Oct. 3, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,822,735, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07\/947,285, filed on Sep. 17, 1992, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,353,218.","This invention relates generally to computer systems and methods for generating coupons to provide discounts for purchases and, in particular, to delivery techniques for delivering coupons assigned to a particular household. The invention is particularly adapted for delivering targeted coupons to a household. Targeted coupons are coupons which are assigned to a household on the basis of attributes of that household.","Retail establishments, in particular grocery establishments, have attempted to use various technologies to assist in increasing sales at its stores, or retail outlets. One technique is to provide rewards in the form of discounts to regular customers who purchase significant amounts from that chain. This led to a frequent shopper system in which point-of-sale, or checkout, systems are used in conjunction with frequent shopper cards in order to provide instant discounts to customers presenting a frequent shopper card to the cashier. Such frequent shopper card may be bar-coded, wherein the identity of the household possessing the card may be scanned with the bar code scanner used to input purchases to the point-of-sale system. One difficulty with such instant discounts is that they are provided to every customer who presents a frequent shopper card to the cashier. This invites \u201ccherry picking\u201d in which certain customers obtain frequent shopper cards from multiple chains and plan purchases in order to purchase items from each chain which are discounted. Such \u201ccherry picking\u201d reduces the profit margin of the retail establishment, which, particularly for grocery establishments, tends to be low to begin with.","In order to discourage such \u201ccherry picking,\u201d computer systems have been developed which take the discounting function away from the point-of-sale system, which is inflexible and must provide discounts to all parties possessing a frequent shopper card and, instead, utilize information obtained by the point-of-sale system in order to target coupons to particular households. In one such system, households are divided into clusters, such as deciles, according to the amount of purchases made by each household in a given period of time. Thus, infrequent shoppers would fall in the first decile, more frequent shoppers in the second decile, and the like, with shoppers doing the heaviest purchasing falling in the tenth decile. The targeting system then assigns coupons to particular households based upon the cluster, or deciles, in which that particular household is situated. In this manner, all households in a particular cluster, or decile, are assigned the same coupons. However, households in one decile may be assigned coupons different from households in a different decile. Each coupon assigned to a household represents a negative price or \u201ccents off\u201d value. A print file is generated by the targeting system and forwarded by the retail establishment to a commercial printer. The commercial printer prints, folds, and mails to each household the coupons assigned to that household based upon the output print file of the targeting system. Each of the coupons typically includes a bar code, or other coding technique, which is scanned at the point-of-sale system and provides a pointer to a location in a product lookup (PLU) table. The PLU table contains a listing of negative prices, or discounts, which are applied to the total purchase when the coupon is redeemed. The targeted coupon typically includes a text field made up of, for example, three lines of text, which describes an offer statement for that coupon. The offer statement may be, for example, a number of cents off of a particular item, buy-one get-one free, $5 off of $50 of purchases, and the like. In addition to the offer statement, the text field includes any information with respect to an expiration date of the coupon. As a result, substantially the entire text field is typically devoted to describing the offer statement and expiration information. Any additional information must be squeezed into any remaining portions of the text field that are not used by the offer statement and expiration information.","The targeted coupon print file is typically sent by the retail establishment to the commercial printer periodically, such as every month, every two months, or the like. All of the targeted coupons assigned to a household are printed on sheets, with multiple coupons on a sheet. Therefore, the number of coupons assigned to each household is fixed. Once the coupons are printed, folded, and inserted in an envelope, the coupons are mailed typically utilizing bulk mail rates. The printing and mailing process is relatively expensive. Therefore, it is typical for the retail establishment to exclude all but the highest level clusters, or deciles, from the system. Therefore, infrequent shoppers are not mailed coupons. The households which do receive coupons may receive them up to approximately two (2) weeks after printing because of the delays inherent in bulk rate tariffs.","Such mailed targeted coupon system has many drawbacks. In addition to the high costs, which limit the number of frequent shoppers who receive coupons, the delay in the cycle between assigning coupons to households and the receipt of those coupons in the mail by the households, often results in the coupons either already being expired when they arrive or the merchandise discounted by the coupons no longer being available from the manufacturer resulting in the necessity to hand out rain checks. The coupons are often delivered to households on vacation or who have changed addresses, resulting in wasted production and mailing costs, as well as the creation of additional junk mail which must be discarded. The lengthy planning cycle of assigning coupons to households and printing and mail delivery of the coupons to the households precludes responding to any fast changes in market conditions. Furthermore, receipt of the coupons in the mail greatly diminishes any impulse-buying because of delay between the time the household receives the coupons and the next shopping trip to the issuing retail establishment.","Although the mailing of targeted coupons to a household could provide the opportunity for directing specific information to the household, the mailed targeted coupon packets are not utilized for that purpose. Because of the excessively long planning cycle, it is not feasible to utilize mailed targeted coupon packets to inform the households of information which changes frequently. They additionally do not provide an opportunity for dialog with customers of the retail establishment. Furthermore, customers get coupons without requesting them, which may further reduce the impact that the coupons have on the purchasing habits of the household.","Retail establishments, such as grocery stores, often develop promotional campaigns designed to encourage increased purchases among its frequent shopper members. An example of such a campaign is a program which gives away a valuable item, such as a turkey or ham, to a frequent shopper member who purchases a given amount of merchandise within a predefined period of time. While such campaign has proven successful at increasing purchases by frequent shoppers, it can create administrative difficulties. One difficulty is that members desire to keep track of their qualifying accumulated purchases in order to gauge how much additional purchases must be made to qualify for the prize. This desire for information increases as the cutoff date for the qualifying period approaches. In order to learn their accumulated purchase value, households tend to approach the customer service counter resulting in an increased distraction to customer service personnel, especially as the campaign deadline approaches.","The present invention provides a computer system and method which generates coupons to provide discounts for purchases which is efficient, flexible, and dynamic and which is capable of increasing profit margins of the participating retail establishment. Such computer system not only generates and dispenses targeted coupons, which are assigned to particular households on the basis of at least one attribute of that household, it also has the capability of enhancing a dialog between a retail establishment and its customers.","A computer-implemented method of generating coupons to provide discounts for purchases, according to an aspect of the invention, includes providing a computer-based kiosk at a retail establishment. A user identification of a household is received at the kiosk. The kiosk outputs a series of targeted coupons which have been assigned to the individual household on the basis of at least one attribute of that household. Because the coupons are dispensed by a kiosk at the retail establishment, a very short planning cycle, between assigning of the coupons to the particular households and the availability of the coupons to the households, is provided. This short of planning cycles makes the kiosk dispense coupons more responsive to market conditions. For example, a notification by the manufacturer that a promotional discount program is being terminated as a result of lack of availability of merchandise, can be immediately responded to by disabling of the associated coupon offers. Additionally, items which are subject to rapidly changing market conditions, such as fresh produce and direct store delivery items, can be discounted, according to the invention, because coupon offers can be created or changed frequently, even daily, if desired. Advantageously, coupons are provided to a household by the kiosk only upon request by the household user who obtains coupons assigned to that household by entering a user identification at the kiosk, such as by passing a frequent shopper card past a scanner or the like. This avoids the problem of coupons being mailed to an incorrect address or to a household on vacation. Coupons may be available to users based upon users'frequency of shopping rather than a fixed mailing cycle. Indeed, coupon assignments may be \u201cstacked up\u201d for households so that a coupon assignment is always ready even for households that make frequent shopping trips. Furthermore, the shorter planning cycle ensures that coupons will not be delivered to households at, or beyond, the expiration date. If coupons in a coupon assignment are at or near the expiration date when the user requests coupons from the kiosk, the expired or about-to-expire coupons can be deleted.","According to a more-detailed aspect of the invention, a computer-implemented method of generating coupons to provide discounts for purchases includes providing a computer coupon database and a computer household database. The coupon database includes a plurality of coupon records, each providing a definition of a coupon offer. The household database includes a plurality of household records, each providing at least one attribute of a particular household. A record for a particular household is retrieved from the household database and at least one targeted coupon is assigned to the particular household. The targeted coupon is selected from the coupon database as a function of an attribute of that household in the household record for that household. Assignment of targeted coupons to households may occur remotely from the kiosk, or kiosks, with a communication link, such as a local area network or a wide area network utilized to link the kiosk, or kiosks, with the computer assigning the targeted coupons which may, for example, be a network server. When a user household is identified at one of the kiosks, any coupons assigned to the identified household are formatted and outputted by the kiosk.","This formatting of coupons assigned to a household in response to receipt of the user identification of the particular household may be accomplished, according to another aspect of the invention, by including in each coupon record an identification of an offer type and at least one offer value. An image of an offer statement is formatted for each of the coupons assigned to the identified household as a function of the offer type and the at least one offer value. Advantageously, such offer statement, such as a given number of cents off of a particular product, two for the price of one, or the like, may be placed at a prominent place on the coupon separate from text field. This allows the text field to be utilized for additional information regarding the particular offer. For example, a particular item may be identified in the text field to which a buy-one get-one free offer applies. The formatted coupon may additionally include an expiration statement separate from the test field. The image of the expiration statement is formatted from information contained in a validity date field on the coupon record. Likewise, any text to be applied to the coupon is in a separate text field. By formatting images of coupons \u201con the fly\u201d from parameters set forth in a coupon record, coupon offers can be created and modified readily without a requirement for mass storage of a coupon image.","According to another aspect of the invention, at least one triggered coupon may be assigned to a particular household. The triggered coupon is selected by the computer from the coupon database, based upon an attribute of that household, and assigned to that household. When the user is identified at the kiosk, the user is prompted to select whether the user wishes to receive the triggered coupon, or not. If the user indicates a wish to obtain the triggered coupon, the triggered coupon is formatted and outputted by the kiosk. This aspect of the invention is especially useful with promotional programs that award coupons for large items to the user. The triggered coupon is only generated when the user qualifies for the item. However, the coupon is not automatically generated in response to identification of the user at the kiosk. Rather, the user is allowed to decline receipt of the triggered coupon at that time. When the user, again, accesses the kiosk, or another kiosk, at a later date, the consumer will, again, be notified that a triggered coupon is available and allowed to determine whether to receive the triggered coupon at that time, or not.","According to another aspect of the invention, the kiosk is capable of formatting messages which incorporate key words. The key words are derived from an attribute of the household from the household file for the user identified at the kiosk. This not only allows messages to be personalized to the particular user, but also allows specialized communication with the user. For example, the user may be notified of the accumulative purchases made by that user for the purposes of an award program. This allows the user to remain apprised of the amount of purchases necessary in order to receive the award without the necessity for the user being serviced at the customer service counter. This greatly enhances the productivity of customer service personnel. The messages may be displayed on a display device, such as a TV monitor, or may be printed and dispensed with the coupons. Other messages may be displayed to the user, such as a greeting message, a survey prompting series of questions, and the like.","According to another aspect of the invention, the number of coupons dispensed to particular households may be set at a particular number which may vary from household to household. This allows the system to vary the number of coupons assigned to a household as a function of attributes of the household, such as accumulative purchases by that household. In this manner, the heaviest shoppers may be awarded more coupons than less frequent shoppers. Coupons assigned to each household may include not only targeted coupons, but also mandatory coupons which are assigned to all households. Mandatory coupons are typically provided by manufacturers and assigned to the households prior to assignment of any targeted coupons. If the mandatory coupons and targeted coupons to do not fill the coupon number allotted to that household, default coupons may be assigned to that household until the assigned number is reached.","A coupon-generating system, according to an aspect of the invention, includes a computer system defining a computer database and a household database. The coupon database includes a plurality of coupon records, each providing a definition of a coupon offer. The household database includes a plurality of household records, each providing at least one attribute of a particular household. The computer system is programmed to assign at least one coupon from the coupon database to a particular household as a function of at least an attribute of that household. One or more computer-based kiosks are provided, each having a user identification device, a display device, and a printer, and all are controlled by a computer. Each kiosk computer is programmed to format images of coupons assigned to a particular household and to output the coupon images in response to the user identification device receiving a user identification of a particular household. The computer system is preferably a network server interconnected with a plurality of kiosks by either a local area network or a wide area network. If the communication link between one or more of the kiosks and the computer system is non-functional, the kiosk computer is programmed to format images of a set of default coupons. This allows users to receive coupons from the kiosk even if the network server or network is non-functional, in order to avoid disappointment to the customer. The coupon-generating system may additionally include at least one point-of-sale system having a scanner device and a point-of-sale computer. The point-of-sale computer is responsive to codes scanned by the scanner device in order to provide data which is fed to the computer system in order to determine at least in part the attribute, or attributes, of the household identified at the point-of-sale computer. The scanner preferably also provides for scanning of coupons printed by the kiosk.","The system is additionally capable of dispensing coupons to new members who may be added to the system by responding to questions prompted at the kiosk followed by dispensing of a default selection of coupons to that user. This provides an instant reward for becoming a frequent shopper member of the retail establishment.","These and other objects, advantages, and features of this invention will become apparent upon review of the following specification in conjunction with the drawings.","Referring now specifically to the drawings, and the illustrative embodiments depicted therein, a coupon-generating system  may be organized around a host computer  which maintains a coupon database of coupon offer records, a household database of member households, and software which performs numerous functions including assigning coupons to particular households (FIG. ). Host computer  may be located on the premises of one of the retail outlets of the retail chain utilizing the coupon-generating system or may be located at a headquarters operation or at another remote site. Coupon-generating system  includes a coupon management computer  which is utilized by a system operator of the retail chain to enter in the system various system parameters, as will be described in more detail below. Data files on computer  may be communicated over any convenient communication system link  to host computer . A network server , typically located at the same premises as host computer , receives coupon offer records and communicates the records over a communication link, such as public telephone system , or a leased line, or the like, to an in-store processor . In-store processor  communicates with a point-of-sale master terminal , which, in turn, communicates with a plurality of point-of-sale terminals . Host computer  downloads to in-store processor  files of valid coupon records, including a coupon identification code assigned to each coupon record. Each point-of-sale terminal  supports a scanner (not shown), such as a bar code reader, in order to scan codes, such as a one-dimensional or two-dimensional bar code, on merchandise packages and on coupons. Point-of-sale master terminal  maintains a database of coupon records and product codes in order to decode the data scanned through each terminal  and thereby construct a transaction set. Each transaction set may include products purchased by a consumer, total value of a transaction, and each coupon redeemed by a consumer. Each transaction set is associated with a particular purchasing entity, such as a user household, and is uploaded through in-store processor  to host computer . The transaction set may be associated with a particular purchasing entity by any means for entering the identity of the purchasing entity in POS terminal , such as by scanning a machine-readable user identification code provided on a frequent shopper card. Alternatively, POS terminal  may identify the purchasing entity by scanning a combined coupon identification and household identification bar code on a coupon as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,353,218 issued to James P. DeLapa et al. for a FOCUSED COUPON SYSTEM, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

No. 08\/470,224 filed Jun. 6, 1995, by DeLapa et al. for a COMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR IDENTIFYING PRODUCTS THAT ARE OF LIKELY INTEREST TO PURCHASERS IN A RETAIL ESTABLISHMENT, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","Another network server  physically located with host computer  receives files containing targeted coupons generated by host computer . Network server  passes the targeted coupon records on through a communication link, such as public telephone system , or a leased line, or the like, to an in-store controller, such as a network server  located in a retail outlet of the retail chain. In-store controller  may be a network server which provides communication with a plurality of kiosks  located within the retail outlet. Network servers  and  may be separate units or may be combined in a single unit and may be combined with host computer .","Each kiosk  includes a kiosk computer , a display device, such as a touch-screen monitor , which is capable of displaying messages to the user and receiving input selections from a user, a printer , which prints coupons, and a user identification device, such as a scanner , which identifies users. In the illustrated embodiment, scanner  scans the bar code on a frequent shopper card, the bar code being unique to a particular household to whom the card has been issued. However, alternate means may, be provided to identify the user\/household, such as by receiving an identification number, such as a telephone number through touch screen , a magnetic strip reader, an optical character recognition reader, a Smart Card reader, a voice recognition device, a handprint recognition device, a mechanical keypad, or any such device capable of providing user identification. In the illustrated embodiment, kiosk  is a commercially available kiosk marketed by Kiosk Information Systems, Inc., located in Broomfield, Colo. Scanner  is a commercial scanner marketed by Symbol Technology, Inc., printer  is a commercially available printer marketed by Magnateck, and touch screen  is a commercially available monitor marketed by Magnavox. However, as will be described in more detail below, kiosk computer  is programmed with additional software which formats coupon images as well as formatting various messages and the like for communication with the user. Kiosk computer  is programmed with software supplied with kiosk  in order to control the components of the kiosk in a coordinated fashion. The software is provided with the kiosk and is proprietary to Kiosk Information Systems, Inc. Kiosk computer  is an IBM PC-compatible computer supplied by Gateway Computer Corporation having a Pentium processor marketed by Intel Corporation.","Although, in the illustrated embodiment, host computer  is illustrated as communicating with the network server in each retail outlet through the public telephone system, a wide area network or other dedicated communication link may be utilized. Additionally, especially in a single outlet establishment, the functions of host computer  may be carried out in the network server  for that establishment. The particular hardware configuration is outside the scope of the present invention and may be selected by the skilled artisan according to the particular application.","A coupon-generating system  according to the invention, in the illustrated embodiment, utilizes a targeting system  of the type marketed by RMS Corporation located in Stamford, Conn. (FIGS.  and ). The host-targeting system resides on host computer  and receives inputs from in-store processor  and management computer  in order to establish a coupon offer definition database , a household database  of frequent shopper members and particular attributes regarding that household. Such attributes tracked in the host tracking system may include accumulative purchases by that household within a particular period of time, whether the household is a member of a particular promotional campaign, and the like. A coupon offer database and household database are established in database software marketed by Microsoft, Inc., located in Redmond, Wash. under the brand name SQL Server. Host-targeting system  is programmed to assign coupon offers to particular households based upon an attribute of the household. In the illustrated embodiment, the attribute utilized for assigning coupons is the decile of accumulative purchases by the household within a given period of time. Coupons are assigned to households based upon the household decile and coupon-assigning parameters entered through management computer . Coupons are assigned using techniques specific to the targeting system but may be assigned using the method disclosed in the DeLapa et al. application Ser. No. 08\/470,224 filed Jun. 6, 1995. Host-targeting system  produces a print file  containing information regarding the coupons assigned to each household, including details on the coupon offer. The print file produced by targeting system  is conventionally supplied by the retail establishment or chain to a commercial printer in order to print, fold, and mail coupons to households. According to the present invention, the print file of host-targeting system  is provided to a targeting promotion delivery system  which transliterates the print file at  in order to arrange the data in a format which facilitates further processing in a manner which will be described below. Coupon-generating process  further includes an enhancement module , which receives, via input screens, various setup information to augment that produced by host-targeting system . This includes a database  of coupon types. Coupons are formatted at a kiosk  \u201con the fly,\u201d utilizing a dynamic coupon creation process , in a manner which will be described in more detail below. The kiosk prints the dynamically formatted coupons at  utilizing coupon page definition data in a database . Coupon definition database  and coupon page definition database  are established in database software marketed by Microsoft Corporation located in Redmond, Wash. under the brand name Access.","The benefit of the coupon-generating method process, as illustrated in , is that it utilizes the existing host-targeting system installed on the retail chain's host computer. Alternatively, the function of host-targeting system  and enhancement system  may be provided according to the principles disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,353,218 issued to DeLapa et al. for a FOCUSED COUPON SYSTEM and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/470,224 filed Jun. 6, 1995, by DeLapa et al. for a COMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR IDENTIFYING PRODUCTS THAT ARE OF LIKELY INTEREST TO PURCHASERS IN A RETAIL ESTABLISHMENT, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference (hereinafter commonly referred to as the \u201cfocused coupon system\u201d). The focused coupon system may assign targeted coupons to households on the basis of attributes of the household which are dynamically developed and maintained by the focused coupon system. Such attributes may be determined initially by a consumer survey in order to obtain basic information regarding the household. Thereafter, household attributes are dynamically updated by monitoring which targeted coupons the household redeems and which targeted coupons the household does not redeem. The focused coupon system may additionally take into account other data in updating the household attributes, such as accumulative purchases, purchases of particular items, item categories, and the like. It should be understood that the term \u201ctargeted coupon\u201d applies to any technique which assigns a coupon to a household based upon any attribute of that household.","Because host-targeting system  is commercially available, it will not be described in detail herein. Suffice it to say, host-targeting system  produces for each offer a basic offer description, text, bar code, and a single value stating the number of cents the offer is valued at. Enhancement system  provides the ability to define each coupon offer as a targeted coupon, a default coupon, or a mandatory coupon, as will be described in more detail below. Enhancement system  additionally provides the ability to enable and disable coupon offers individually. Enhancement system  additionally provides the ability to create printable messages targeted at particular households, including key words which are generated as a function of particular attributes of the household, as will be explained in more detail below. Enhancement system  additionally creates screen messages for greeting, informing, thanking, and surveying customers. Enhancement system  additionally controls, for each particular household, the number of coupons that may be received by that household for each visit. In the illustrated embodiment, the number of coupons that may be received by each household with each visit is preferably a function of accumulative purchases by the household within a particular period of time. However, other factors may be included in establishing the number of coupons which the household may receive with each visit, including the frequency of visits by that household, the time since the last visit, and the like.","Other functions performed by enhancement module  include developing and appending an offer type and its constituent parameters, as will be described in more detail below, and a valid data range. The enhancement system  additionally provides the capability of defining an offer as a triggered coupon offer which provides the user with the ability to choose whether to receive the offer at that time or not. The enhancement system may additionally provide the ability to limit the number of times a household may receive a given offer. Additionally, enhancement system  may provide various administrative-reporting functions, such as reporting what offers were given to which households, as well as responses of households to survey questions, and the like.","Enhancement system  provides a facility to transliterate extracted data from offer-targeting system  into a form where it may be supplemented with data for further targeting and delivery of the coupon by a kiosk . In order to accomplish this function, enhancement system  includes a menu selection calling program  which displays on management computer  a menu of system management functions which may be selected by the system operator (FIG. ). Menu selection program  provides an import file definition selection , which calls an import file definition program ; an import-targeted\/default\/mandatory offer file selection , which calls an import offer file program ; an import miscellaneous file selection , which calls an import file program ; a targeted\/default\/mandatory offer setup selection , which calls an offer setup program ; a targeted\/default\/mandatory offer maintenance selection , which calls an offer maintenance program ; a targeted\/default\/mandatory offer enable\/disable selection , which calls an offer able\/disable program ; a printed message maintenance selection , which calls a printed message maintenance program ; a printed message release selection , which calls a printed message release program ; a printed message enable\/disable selection , which calls a printed message enable\/disable program ; a screen message maintenance selection , which calls a screen message maintenance program ; a screen message release selection , which calls a screened message release program ; a screen message enable\/disable program , which calls a screen message enable\/disable program ; a characteristic maintenance selection , which calls a characteristic maintenance program ; and a key word maintenance selection , which calls a key word maintenance program . After a program is called from menu selection call program , control returns to the menu selection after completion of the function by the system operator.","The import file definition function , which is called by import file definition selection , allows the operator to set up the enhancement system so that the system knows how to interpret files imported from the host-targeting system and to organize the file definitions in a manner suitable to the operator (FIG. ). The import file definition function determines which fields in each record go in the enhancement system. When selected, import file definition program  prompts the user to select an import-type and the file name to be imported at . The import type is selected from: (a) card number to household affiliation files, (b) coupon files, (c) household-triggering coupon files, (d) household characteristic files, (e) household key word value files, and (f) coupon dispense limit files. If only one import type is selected, the program prompts the user at  to enter the start and length of each column in the incoming record and a corresponding column that the data is to be applied in a table being constructed by the operator. Some files have multiple records. If multiple record types are selected at , the operator is prompted at  to match a table with each record type and enter a value for each record type that defines the record type. For the first file, the format is edited at  by entering the start and length of each column in the incoming record and the corresponding column in the table being constructed by the operator in which that data is to be placed. After the operator is satisfied, the program then returns to  for selection of the next file to be processed. After the operator has imported and formatted all of the desired import files, the program returns to calling menu  at .","When the import offer file program is selected by the operator choosing the import targeted\/default\/mandatory offer file selection, the operator is provided with the tools to import coupon offer files by entering or selecting a file name at  (). The operator is additionally prompted to identify coupons by batch and to assign a name to the batch at . Batches allow the operator to subsequently process offers in batches which are set up for the convenience of the operator, such as by store assignment or the like. When the operator is completed with importing coupon offer files, control returns to the calling menu  at . When the operator chooses the import miscellaneous file selection , a function is selected which allows the operator to import other files by entering a file name or a batch name at  (). When the operator has imported all of the files desired, control returns to the calling program  at .","After the operator has defined and imported all of the necessary files from the host-targeting system, the operator may then choose functions which allow the operator to set up the offers. This may be accomplished by choosing the offer setup function  using targeting\/default\/mandatory offer-setup selection , which prompts the operator to select between processing a targeted offer at  or processing default and mandatory offers at  (FIG. ). Targeted offers are coupons which are assigned to a household on a basis of an attribute of the household. In a host-targeting system supplied by RMS, the attribute of the household is the accumulative purchases by that household at the retail establishment. In a host-targeting system supplied according to the teachings of the DeLapa et al. '218 patent, the attribute of the household may be related to the makeup and ages of the family, presence or absence of particular types of pets, and the like. Such attributes may be determined initially from a household survey and updated as a result of coupons issued to that household which the household either redeems or does not redeem. However, other attributes may be utilized. These may include, for example, particular items which are purchased by the household, or categories of items purchased by the household, such as laundry soap, ketchup, and the like, without regard to the particular brand, size, or the like, as disclosed in the DeLapa et al. pending patent application for a COMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR IDENTIFYING PRODUCTS THAT ARE OF LIKELY INTEREST TO PURCHASERS. Other targeting schemes will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art. Default offers are coupons which are assigned to all customers of a particular store or outlet. Default offers may additionally include coupons issued by the kiosk when communication between host computer  and kiosks  is malfunctioning.

The offer definition record includes: (a) validity date range, (b) offer parameters, (c) text, and (d) offer type. The program then inserts the household name, validity date, and text onto the coupon at . Because individual fields are provided on the coupon for the household name, validity date, and text, no additional formatting is required to insert this information onto the coupon image.

The offer-type records and offer parameters allow the program to construct the offer statement  () of a coupon image . Referring to , a text field  and validity date field  are established in coupon image  of a size that allows the coupon text and validity dates to be inserted therein. Likewise, a household name field  receives the household name information and directly generates the image thereof.","In order to construct the offer statement , the offer statement is broken down into a plurality of variable-size offer statement fields -. The program formats the image of offer statement , field-by-field, by combining data in each offer element with an offer parameter or with text contained in the offer element. In the illustrated embodiment, the first offer statement field , beginning from the left as viewed in , is a numerical value determined from the offer parameter. This numerical value may be a number of cents off or may be the 1 in a \u201cbuy-one get-one free\u201d offer statement. Typically, if the coupon is a number of cents off of a particular item, the description of the item will appear in text field  and the only value in the offer parameters will be the number of cents off. The second offer statement field , beginning from the left as viewed in , will typically contain text which is included with the offer element. Such text may be \u201coff with this coupon\u201d or the \u201cget\u201d from the buy-one get-one free offer statement. The third offer statement field , beginning from the left as viewed in , if present, will typically include a second numeric value obtained from a second offer parameter included with the offer. For example, the third offer statement field may include a dollar amount, such as $50. Therefore, with 300 as the first offer parameter and 5,000 as the second offer parameter, the program can construct the image of the offer statement  by offer elements which apply the first offer parameter to the first offer statement field , a second offer element applies the text \u201coff\u201d to the second offer statement field , and a third offer element applies the second offer parameter to create the numeric value of $50 in the third offer statement field . By this process of building an offer statement field from offer parameters contained in a coupon offer definition record and from offer elements contained in offer-type records associated with an offer type, the program is capable of creating the images of coupons \u201con the fly.\u201d Each offer element, in addition to establishing the content of each offer statement field, additionally establishes the area and position of the offer statement field along with type font and the like in order to provide an offer statement which is pleasant in appearance and easy to comprehend. Although four offer statement fields -are illustrated, the number used may be selected by the practitioner.","Reference is made to  in which different offer fields  are generated by the program \u201con the fly\u201d and combined with text fields  and validity date fields  in order to provide a complete coupon image . An-optional household name field  may be generated, if desired. Each coupon additionally includes a bar code  which, when read by the scanner of a point-of-sale terminal , produces a product lookup number (PLU) which is applied by the point-of-sale terminal to a PLU lookup table in order to determine a price. Because the coupon is in order to provide a discount to the user, the price in the PLU lookup table will be a negative price corresponding to the discount of the coupon. In the illustrated embodiment, there is no validity checking and the cashier must determine that the customer purchased any product receiving a discount or accumulative purchases greater than an amount stated in the offer. However, the invention may additionally be utilized to encode bar code  with a more complex coupon definition in order to allow validity checking by including in the bar code a definition of the discounted item or other event which must occur to obtain the discount.","In order to construct the image of the offer statement from the offer-type records and the offer parameters, the program determines at  whether there are any offer-type records (). If so, the program looks at the first offer-type record at  and determines at  if the offer-type in the record is a value. If not, the text included in the offer-type record is retrieved at  and inserted into the offer statement field defined in the offer-type record. If it is determined at  that the offer type is a value, the amount of the value is retrieved from the offer parameters and inserted into the corresponding offer statement field at . The program then determines at  whether the last offer-type record had been processed. If not, the next offer-type record is processed at  and . When it is determined at  that the last offer-type record has been processed, the formatted coupon image is sent to the printer at . It is then determined at  if the last coupon in the selected coupon set has been formatted. If not, the next coupon in the selected coupon set is processed at . If it is determined at  that no offer-type records are retrieved for a coupon offer, then the program proceeds to  in order to process the next coupon. This provides a failsafe exit from the coupon-formatting process if an incomplete coupon definition occurs.","After the coupons have been selected, formatted, and are being printed, the program retrieves () the printed messages, which have an enabled status, and determines at  if any printed messages were retrieved (). If so, the first record is tested at ,  in order to determine if the triggering characteristic matches the corresponding characteristic for the identified household. If it is determined at  that the triggering characteristic matches and there is a value associated with the printed message, the program retrieves all of the key words from the message at  and substitutes each key word with the key word value from the given household. The message is then formatted and printed at  in accordance with format specifications. It is then determined at  if this was the last message. If it is determined at  that this was not the last message, then the next printed message is retrieved at  and tested at . When it is determined at  that the last printed message has been processed, the program then determines if there are valid survey screens available at  (). If not, the kiosk displays the \u201cthank-you\u201d screen until all printing is complete at . If there are any valid survey screens available, the program moves to the first survey screen at  and displays the message with YES and NO response buttons . The program then stores a response from the user at . If a response is not received within a predetermined period, it is determined at  that the response has timed out and the program is exited. If a response is received before the response is timed out, it is then determined at  whether the last survey screen has been processed. If so, the program is exited. If not, the program moves to the next survey screen at  and displays the message at . Although kiosk program  functionally operates a kiosk , it may reside on the kiosk computer or another computer.","Thus, it is seen that the present invention provides a unique coupon delivery system which allows targeted coupons to be generated \u201con the fly\u201d and dispensed at a kiosk on demand by a household user upon identification of the household. Because the coupons are dispensed at the retail establishment, they create a greater impulse purchase effect. Furthermore, consumers obtain coupons when desired rather than when the coupons are printed and mailed by the commercial printer. Because of the rapid cycle time available with the present invention, coupon offers can be created to respond to rapidly changing market conditions, such as direct store purchases as well as notification by a manufacturer that a promotional program is being prematurely ended. The present invention further provides many unique characteristics which take advantage of the kiosk technology in order to enhance a dialog with customers of the retail establishment and to implement, in an efficient fashion, numerous promotional programs, the variations of which are only limited by the imagination of the system operator and management of the retail establishment. This is all accomplished in a cost-effective manner because the cost of mailing coupons is eliminated.","Changes and modifications in the specifically described embodiments can be carried out without departing from the principles of the invention, which is intended to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims, as interpreted according to the principles of patent law including the doctrine of equivalents."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 6","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 6","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIGS. 18","i":["a","h "],"b":"18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 20"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
