title: Identifying selected elements in dynamic content
abstract: Selectable elements in dynamic content may be identified. Analytics data may be received that may include a hierarchical position identifier corresponding to a location of a selectable element in the content. A current selectable element of a current version of the network content may be matched to the analytics data. Analytics data, which may include hierarchical position identifier, may be generated in response to a first selection of a selectable element of content. The hierarchical position identifier may be usable to match to the same corresponding current selectable element of a current version of the content.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Network content (e.g., website) providers often wish to collect data that describes usage and visitation patterns for their websites and for individual webpages within the sites. This data is often referred to as web analytics data. Such information can be extremely valuable in developing usage statistics for various purposes, including, for example, estimating server load, determining advertising rates, identifying areas of websites that are in need of redesign, and the like.","Web analytics data is often collected via logfile analysis or page tagging. Logfile analysis includes reading logfiles that store a web server's transactions. Page tagging uses executable code on each webpage, such as Java Script, to notify a third party when a webpage is rendered by a browser. For example, the webpage may include a request to a web analytics provider that is embedded within the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) code. When the webpage is rendered by a browser at a user's computer, the request is transmitted to the web analytics, thereby notifying the web analytics provider of the rendering of the webpage. In some instances, the request includes a request for an image, and the web analytics provider simply returns a single transparent pixel for display by the browser, thereby fulfilling the request.","The request itself often includes web analytics data, such as data about the user, the user's computer, the content of the webpage, or any other web analytics data that is accessible and of interest. The web analytics provider may parse the request to extract web analytics data contained within the request. The collected web analytics data may be processed and provided to a website administrator for use in assessing and optimizing their website.","The webpage including the embedded request is typically provided via a content server operated, or at least under the direction of a content provider, such as an on-line vendor, media portal, or news website. In some instances, a webpage may include dynamic content that changes often (e.g., daily, hourly, upon a news event, etc.). And in some of those cases, a region of the webpage containing the dynamic content can be relatively static. For example, a webpage may have a top story region that includes the top stories at a given time. Thus, at one time, the top story may be directed to one selectable element (e.g., link, button, etc.) while at another time, the top story may be directed to another selectable element. In some cases, individual selectable elements or links on a webpage may move or relocate to a different part of a webpage over time. For example, a link that was in the top news story location at 1:00 pm may move to a side news story location at 3:00 pm and completely off the webpage the following day. Similarly, duplicate links may exist on a webpage, such as a webpage that duplicates the top news story link in another portion of the page, such as a side portion.","Traditional web analytics techniques suffer in performance for such dynamic content in terms of reliability, storage requirements, and compatibility. As a result, information collected for dynamic content by typical web analytics techniques is less useful.","This disclosure describes techniques and structures for identifying selectable elements in dynamic content. In one embodiment, analytics data may be received that may include a hierarchical position identifier corresponding to a location of a selectable element in the content. A current selectable element of a current version of the network content may be matched to the analytics data. In some embodiments, matching may include comparing data corresponding to a plurality of selectable elements of the current version of the network content with the analytics data. At least a portion of a hierarchical position identifier of the current data may match at least a portion of the hierarchical position identifier of the analytics data. In some embodiments, second analytics data may be received that may include a second hierarchical position identifier corresponding to the location of the same selectable element in the content, wherein at least some of the network content changed from a time of the analytics data generation to a time of the second analytics data generation. The current selectable element of the current version of the network content may be matched to the second analytics data. In various embodiments, an indication of the matching may be overlaid on a display of the current version of the network content.","In various embodiments, first analytics data, which may include a hierarchical position identifier, may be generated in response to a first selection of a selectable element of a version of content. Second analytics data, which may include a second hierarchical position identifier, may be generated in response to a second selection of the same selectable element of an updated version of the content. In some embodiments, the version and updated version of the content are different. Both the first and second hierarchical position identifiers may be usable to match to the same corresponding current selectable element of a current version of the content.","While the disclosure is described herein by way of example for several embodiments and illustrative drawings, those skilled in the art will recognize that the disclosure is not limited to the embodiments or drawings described. It should be understood, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the embodiments to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. The headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not meant to be used to limit the scope of the description. As used throughout this application, the word \u201cmay\u201d is used in a permissive sense (i.e., meaning having the potential to), rather than the mandatory sense (i.e., meaning must). Similarly, the words \u201cinclude\u201d, \u201cincluding\u201d, and \u201cincludes\u201d mean including, but not limited to. As used throughout this application, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural referents unless the content clearly indicates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to \u201can element\u201d includes a combination of two or more elements.","In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of claimed subject matter. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, methods, apparatuses or systems that would be known by one of ordinary skill have not been described in detail so as not to obscure claimed subject matter.","Some portions of the detailed description which follow are presented in terms of algorithms or symbolic representations of operations on binary digital signals stored within a memory of a specific apparatus or special purpose computing device or platform. In the context of this particular specification, the term specific apparatus or the like includes a general purpose computer once it is programmed to perform particular functions pursuant to instructions from program software. Algorithmic descriptions or symbolic representations are examples of techniques used by those of ordinary skill in the signal processing or related arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and is generally, considered to be a self-consistent sequence of operations or similar signal processing leading to a desired result. In this context, operations or processing involve physical manipulation of physical quantities. Typically, although not necessarily, such quantities may take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared or otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to such signals as bits, data, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, numerals or the like. It should be understood, however, that all of these or similar terms are to be associated with appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels. Unless specifically stated otherwise, as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout this specification discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing,\u201d \u201ccomputing,\u201d \u201ccalculating,\u201d \u201cdetermining\u201d or the like refer to actions or processes of a specific apparatus, such as a special purpose computer or a similar special purpose electronic computing device. In the context of this specification, therefore, a special purpose computer or a similar special purpose electronic computing device is capable of manipulating or transforming signals, typically represented as physical electronic or magnetic quantities within memories, registers, or other information storage devices, transmission devices, or display devices of the special purpose computer or similar special purpose electronic computing device.","\u201cFirst,\u201d \u201cSecond,\u201d etc. As used herein, these terms are used as labels for nouns that they precede, and do not imply any type of ordering (e.g., spatial, temporal, logical, etc.). For example, in network content having eight selectable elements, the terms \u201cfirst\u201d and \u201csecond\u201d selectable elements can be used to refer to any two of the eight selectable elements. In other words, the \u201cfirst\u201d and \u201csecond\u201d selectable elements are not limited to logical links 0 and 1.","\u201cBased On.\u201d As used herein, this term is used to describe one or more factors that affect a determination. This term does not foreclose additional factors that may affect a determination. That is, a determination may be solely based on those factors or based, at least in part, on those factors. Consider the phrase \u201cdetermine A based on B.\u201d While B may be a factor that affects the determination of A, such a phrase does not foreclose the determination of A from also being based on C. In other instances, A may be determined based solely on B.","Various embodiments of methods and apparatus for analytics data collection and analytics data matching are described. Some embodiments may include a means for collecting analytics data or a means for matching analytics data. For example, a data collection module may generate analytics data that includes a hierarchical position identifier and\/or region identifier. Or, an analytics data matching module may match analytics data to elements and\/or regions of a current version of content by utilizing a hierarchical position identifier or region identifier of the analytics data. The data collection module and analytics data matching module may, in some embodiments, be implemented by program instructions stored in a computer-readable storage medium and executable by one or more processors (e.g., one or more CPUs or GPUs) of a computing apparatus. The computer-readable storage medium may store program instructions executable by the one or more processors to cause the computing apparatus to perform collecting and\/or matching analytics data, as described herein. Other embodiments may be at least partially implemented by hardware circuitry and\/or firmware stored, for example, in a non-volatile memory.","Although certain embodiments are described with respect to a webpage and\/or website, it will be appreciated that the techniques disclosed herein may be employed with other forms of network content sites, such as documents with a traversable tree-like hierarchy (e.g., XML, HTML, etc.).","Turning now to the figures,  is a block diagram that illustrates an analytics system  (e.g., web analytics, network analytics), according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. In the illustrated embodiment, system  includes content provider , client  and analytics provider . Each of content provider , client  and analytics provider  may be communicatively coupled to one another via a network . Network  may include any channel for providing effective communication between each of the entities of system . In some embodiments, network  includes an electronic communication network, such as the internet, a local area network (LAN), wireless LAN (WLAN), WiMAX network, cellular communications network, or the like. For example, network  may include an internet network used to facilitate communication between each of the entities (e.g., content provider , client  and analytics provider ) of system .","Content provider  may include source of information\/content (e.g., a file defining display information for one or more content items, such as a website) that is provided to client . For example, content provider  may include media portals or dynamic websites used to present media and\/or dynamic content (e.g., news). As another example, content provider  may include vendor websites used to present retail merchandise to a consumer. For instance, the vendor website may include a dynamic portion for featured merchandise that may change frequently (e.g., daily specials). In some embodiments, content provider  may include content server (e.g., network content server, web content server) . Content server  may include content , such as network and\/or website content (e.g., web pages), stored thereon that are accessed and loaded by client  when viewing respective webpages of content provider . Content  may include analytics data collection code , as described in detail below, among other components.","Client  may include a computer, mobile device (e.g., cellular phone, tablet device, etc.), or similar device used to access content provided by content provider . In some embodiments, client  may include a computer employing a browser application  that is used to interact with webpages and websites provided by content provider . For example, browser application  may render a webpage of content provider . Rendering may include executing HTML code for the webpage provided by content provider . As a result, browser may also generate appropriate request for data from various servers of system  to assemble the webpage for display on client . Webpage  may be viewed by a user via a monitor or similar presentation device at client .","Analytics provider  may include a system for the collection and processing of analytics data (e.g., network analytics, web analytics, etc.). Analytics provider  may include a third-party website traffic statistic service that is a physically separate entity from content provider . Analytics provider  may reside on a different network location from content providers  and client . Analytics data may include data that describes usage and visitation patterns for websites and for individual webpages within the website. Analytics data may include a user identifier, for example, as well information describing the webpages visited, which selectable elements have been selected, and the dates and times of the visits. According to some embodiments, web analytics data may also include data regarding regions of a webpage from which selectable elements have been selected. Further, in some embodiments, web analytics data may include a hierarchical position identifier, as described herein.","In the illustrated embodiment, analytics provider  includes analytics server , analytics database , and analytics report module . Analytics server  may service requests from one or more clients. For example, upon loading\/rendering of a webpage by browser  of client , browser  may generate a request to analytics server  via network . Analytics server  may process the request by returning appropriate content (e.g., an image) to browser  of client . In some embodiments, the request includes a request for an image, and analytics provider  simply returns a single transparent pixel for display by browser  of client , thereby fulfilling the request. The request itself may also include embedded analytics data. Some embodiments may include embedding a pointer to a resource, known as a \u201cweb bug\u201d in HTML code. The resource may be invisible to the user, such as a transparent one-pixel image. The pointer may direct browser  of client  to request the resource from analytics server . Analytics server  may record the request, and record additional information associated with the request, such as the date and time, and\/or identifying information that may be encoded in the resource request. In some embodiments, an image request embedded in the HTML code of the webpage may include codes\/strings that are indicative of analytics data, such as data about the user, the user's computer, the content of the webpage, or any other analytics data that is accessible and of interest. A request for an image may include, for example, \u201cimage.gif\/XXX . . . \u201d wherein the string \u201cXXX . . . \u201d is indicative of the analytics data. Analytics provider  may parse the request (e.g., at server  or report module ) to extract the analytics data contained within the request. The analytics data may be stored in analytics database , or a similar storage\/memory device. In some embodiments, analytics data may be stored in a remote location from analytics provider . In some embodiments, analytics report module  may receive or retrieve analytics data from analytics server  and\/or database . Analytics report module  may process the analytics data to generate one or more analytics reports. For example, analytics report module  may filter the raw analytics data received at analytics server  to generate concise and complete analytics reports , as may be requested by a website administrator of content provider  or other party. Analytics report , for example, may include overviews and statistical analyses describing the relative frequency with which various site paths are being followed through the content provider's website. In some embodiments, analytics report  may include a visual indication overlaid on top of a current version of the content provider's website. For example, the visual indication may indicate a frequency of selection or activation of a selectable element or region of a webpage. The frequency may represent the frequency of selection of the same selectable element from a dynamic webpage, for example. For instance, if a selectable element A is located in the middle of the webpage at one time and is selected three different times at that location and then selectable element A is moved to a right-hand portion of the webpage and selected five times from that location, analytics report  may include an overlay on top of the current version of the website, or some other representation of the content, indicating that selectable element A has been clicked a total of eight times.","In some embodiments, analytics report module  and analytics report  may not reside in analytics provider  and content provider , respectively, as shown in . For example, analytics report module  and analytics report  may be co-located at content provider  or at some third party location. Or, as described in more detail at , report generator code  may process the analytics data from analytics provider . Report generation may occur in a stand-alone application or may occur as part of a browser plug-in.","In some embodiments, a user  interacts with a device at client , to execute a software application, such as browser application  of client , for accessing and displaying one or more webpages . In response to a user command, such as clicking on a link or typing in a uniform resource locator (URL), browser application  may issue a webpage request  to web content server  of content provider  via network  (e.g., via the Internet). In response to request , content server  may transmit the corresponding webpage code  (e.g., HTML code corresponding to webpage ) to browser application . Browser application  may interpret the received webpage code to display the requested webpage to user  at client . Browser application  may generate additional requests for content (not shown in ) from the server, as needed.","In some embodiments, client  also transmits webpage visitation tracking information to analytics provider . For example, webpage code  may include executable code to initiate a request for data from web analytics server such that execution of webpage code  and\/or selection of selectable elements of browser  causes browser  to generate a corresponding request  for the data to analytics server . In some embodiments, request  may itself have analytics data contained therein or associated therewith, such that transmitting request  causes transmission of analytics data from client  to analytics provider . For example, as described above, request  may include an image request having an embedded string of data therein. Analytics provider  may process (e.g., parse) request  to extract analytics data  contained in or associated with request . Where request  includes a request for an image, analytics server  may simply return an image  (e.g., a single transparent pixel) to browser , thereby fulfilling request . In some embodiments, analytics server  may transmit analytics data  and\/or a corresponding report  to content provider , or other interested parties. For example, analytics data  (e.g., raw data) and\/or analytics reports  may be forwarded to site administrators or owners of content provider .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["200","200","200","112","104","110","102","112","112","104"],"i":"a "},"In the illustrated embodiment, webpage code  includes webpage data , a resident web analytics provider request (\u201cresident request\u201d) , request assembler , and data collection code . In some embodiments, webpage data  may include traditional code for providing content of a webpage for viewing by a user. For example, webpage data  may include a definition of text to be displayed and\/or images to be retrieved for display on the webpage. Further, webpage data  may include selectable elements (e.g., links, buttons, clickable elements (having an on click attribute), elements with anchor tags, etc.).","Resident request  may include a portion of webpage code  that, upon execution, initiates sending a request to a web analytics provider that includes web analytics data. In some embodiments, resident web analytics provider request  may generate a request similar that of request  described above with respect to . For example resident web analytics provider request  may generate an image request having web analytics data embedded therein. In some embodiments, additional requests to the analytics provider may be generated and sent in response to selection of a selectable element of content . For example, a user clicking on a link of a webpage may cause a request to be generated and sent to analytics provider .","Request assembler  may include a portion of webpage code  that, upon execution, assembles web analytics data in accordance with one or more requests to the web analytics provider. In some embodiments, request assembler  includes logic that compiles the web analytics data into a string that is embedded within a request similar that of request  described above with respect to . For example, request assembler  may generate an image request to be provided to a web analytics server, the image request including, for example, \u201cimage.gif\/XXX . . . \u201d wherein \u201cimage.gif\u201d is indicative of an image and the string \u201cXXX . . . \u201d is indicative of the web analytics data. In some embodiments, request assembler may also include logic capable of assembling multiple requests into a single request that is to be transmitted to the web analytics provider.","Data collection code  may allow for the generation of analytics data. In some embodiments, analytics data may be generated in response to selection of a selectable element of content . The analytics data may include multiple identifiers that identify the selectable element. In some embodiments, one of the identifiers may be a primary-tag type (e.g., link anchor tag, image, button, action, etc.). Other identifiers may be a hierarchical position identifier and, in some cases, a native browser identifier (e.g., sourceindex property). In some embodiments, identifiers such as the primary-tag type or an ID attribute (e.g., element ID attribute, region ID attribute, etc.) may be predefined. A region ID attribute may be defined with a container. An example of a region ID attribute may be <div onclick=\u201cs_regionID=\u2018myregion\u2019;\u201d>. In such cases, the generation of the identifiers may be derived from the content.","In one embodiment, data collection code  may generate analytics data including a hierarchical position identifier in response to a selection of a selectable element from the content. The content may be dynamic in that one or more selectable elements may be moved within a hierarchical data structure (e.g., html file) of the content. In some embodiments, data collection code  may generate second analytics data including a second hierarchical position identifier in response to a second selection of the same selectable element. In some cases, the first and second hierarchical position identifiers may be the same. In other instances, the least significant portion of the first and second hierarchical position identifiers may be different while the remaining portion may be the same. As described in detail below regarding the matching code, the hierarchical position identifiers may allow selectable elements within dynamic content to be matched so as to accurately track selection of selectable elements, with reduced cardinality and storage requirements, and greater reliability.","The hierarchical position identifiers may include tag names for a number of parent nodes located above the selectable element in a hierarchical data structure of the content at the time of generation of the identifier. In some instances, the number of parent nodes for which tag names may be included in the hierarchical position identifiers may be limited to a number of parent nodes (e.g., 4, 6, 8, etc.). In determining the number of parent nodes, and corresponding length of the hierarchical position identifier, a trade-off may exist between accuracy\/reliability versus storage requirements such that a larger number of parent nodes may increase accuracy but may require greater storage. Likewise, a fewer number of parent nodes may decrease accuracy but may require less storage.","The respective hierarchical position identifiers may include information on the corresponding selectable element's respective order among peer nodes in a hierarchical data structure below a closest common parent node. For instance, a selectable element may be the fifth selectable element under its closest parent node. Therefore, the hierarchical position identifier may include data indicating that the corresponding selectable element is fifth. As an example, assume the hierarchical identifier is \u201chtml,body,div#mydiv[3], p[4],a[5]\u201d, the final [5] may indicate that the corresponding selectable element is fifth below its closest parent node. As another example, a hierarchical position identifier for the selectable element beneath the aforementioned selectable element may be \u201chtml,body,div#mydiv[3], p[4],a[6]\u201d.","In one embodiment, analytics data generated by data collection code  may include a region identifier that may identify a region of content from which a selectable element was selected. For example, in a website having dynamic content, first analytics data may be generated in response to a selection of a selectable element located within a region of the content. Second analytics data may be generated in response to a selection of a different selectable element located within the same region of content. Each of the first and second analytics data may include the same region identifier. In some embodiments, a region may be defined for a selectable element. As a result, generation of the region identifier may include deriving the region from the actual definition of the selectable element from the content. For example, upon selection of a selectable element, data collection code  may search the content for regions and determine if the selected selectable element is contained within a region. If it is, the region identifier may be included as part of the analytics data.","In some embodiments, data collection code  may determine if region tracking is enabled. If region tracking is enabled, a hierarchical data structure of the content (e.g., html file) may be searched until finding a closest parent node with a region identifier. The found region identifier may be stored as part of the analytics data.","In one example of an implementation of data collection code , data collection code  may be called with its result stored to a variable. Data collection code  may generate a partial string for the selectable element in question. For example, a selectable element's string may include: \u201cdiv[@id=\u2018unique_div\u2019]\/p[5]\/a\u201d. In one embodiment, data collection code  may walk up the document object model and save each parent node until either it finds a node with an ID attribute or until it reaches the root node \u201c<html>\u201d. Thus, the respective hierarchical position identifiers may include an ID attribute of one of the selectable element's director ancestors. In such cases, the hierarchical position identifier for a selectable element may only include information up to the ancestor having an ID attribute. Moreover, data collection code  may determine, for a given selectable element, how many others of the same type of element precede it under the same parent node. In the example string \u201cdiv[@id=\u2018unique_div\u2019]\/p[5]\/a\u201d, the selectable element is a child of the fifth paragraph tag under the div.","In some embodiments, if the selectable element includes an ID attribute, data  collection code  may generate analytics data without including a hierarchical position identifier. In other embodiments, however, analytics data may include a hierarchical position identifier even if the selectable element includes an ID attribute. For instance, analytics data generated for a selectable element may be located within a region having a region identifier may nevertheless include a hierarchical position identifier.","Data collection code  may be cross-browser compatible (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, etc.) and standards compliant in that data collection code  may produce the same hierarchical position identifier for a particular selectable element regardless of the browser executing the code. As described below, report generator code  may likewise be cross-browser compatible, for example, in a browser plug-in embodiment, so that its matching code may accurately match a selectable element to analytics data regardless of the browser used.","In some embodiments, a website may include a similar layout for various webpages throughout the website. For instance, a news website may have three different sections: sports, entertainment, and domestic news. Each separate section may have a similar or same layout. As shown in , the content may include a main story portion as well as a side story portion. Data collection code  may generate the same region identifier across various webpages of a website. For example, a selection of a main story on the sports webpage of a website may generate analytics data that includes a region identifier corresponding to the main region of the webpage. Selection of the main story on the entertainment webpage of the website may generate analytics data that includes the same region identifier corresponding to the main region of the webpage. This may allow for tracking of the popularity of sections (e.g., main story, side story) across a website in addition to tracking sections for a particular webpage.","Analytics data generated by data collection code  may include one or both of region identifiers and hierarchical position identifiers (and may include other identifiers, as described herein). If region tracking is enabled, data collection code  may use both types of identifiers whereas if region tracking is not enabled, data collection code  may generate hierarchical position identifiers but not region identifiers.","Data collection code , or another portion of content code , may, upon execution, provide the analytics data (e.g., the first and second analytics data) to a remote analytics site (e.g., analytics provider ). The data may be provided upon generation or may be aggregated and provided upon some other request (user , content provider , analytics provider , etc.).","It will be appreciated that each of these elements of content code  may be implemented within a single document\/file\/module, or may be provided in separate documents\/files\/modules.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIGS. 8 and 10","FIG. 2B"],"b":["210","210","210","112","210","210","212","214"],"i":"a "},"Matching code  may allow analytics data to be reconciled such that the existence of duplicate data is minimized. In one embodiment, matching code  may match one or more selectable elements to corresponding stored analytics data. Matching code  may use a current version of network content from which to determine the selectable elements that are to be matched to the stored analytics data.","In various embodiments, a hash table may be created from an application programming interface (API) request string corresponding to a selectable element from a current version of network content. A hash table for each element the analytics database returns a record for may also exist. For ease of explanation, let the hash table created from the API request string be called req_hash and the other hash table be called data_hash. In addition, two empty arrays: click_data and unmatched_data may also exist. Matching code  may loop through the req_hash table and, for each element, loop through the data_hash to attempt to find a match by tag and action (e.g., \u201cA:http:\/\/www.examplematch.com\u201d). If a unique match is found between req_hash and data_hash, the element key may be added to the click_data array and its references in req_hash and data_hash may be removed. If no match is found in the data_hash for an element in the req_hash, it may be removed from the req_hash. If multiple matches are found for a given element, it stays in the lists and matching code  continues to the next element in the req_hash.","In some embodiments, once matching code  has looped through the entire req_hash, added matches to the click_data array, and removed references in the req_hash and data_hash, matching code  proceeds to a second matching attempt. In the second matching attempt, matching code  may again loop through the entire req_hash, assuming some elements remain in req_hash, attempting to match tag, action, and the hierarchical position identifier (e.g., \u201cA:http:\/\/www.adobe.com:a|p[2],div#mydiv\u201d). As was the case with the tag and action matching example (first matching attempt) described above, when matches are found, the elements may be removed from both hash tables and added to the click_data array. For any remaining elements in the req_hash after the second matching attempt (e.g., resulting from multiple matches in the first matching attempt but no match in the second matching attempt), matching code  may utilize incremental stripping to try to find additional matches.","Incremental stripping may include making the position numbers generic or wildcards (e.g., changing a[3] to a[\\d] in a regular expression where a[\\] means a[any]) starting with the youngest node and continuing to the oldest node until a single match is found. As a result, the hierarchical position identifier may be made more generic with each iteration until a match is found. As one example, given \u201ca,p[4],div#mydiv[3]\u201d for the req_hash element, matching code  may try to match to \u201ca[\\d],p[4],div#mydiv[3]\u201d. If still no match is found, matching code  may try to match the above identifier to \u201ca,p[4],div#mydiv[\\d]\u201d. If still no match is found, the position number for the next youngest node may be changed. In some embodiments, a default or user-defined search range may be used by modifying an element's positioner within the search range limits. If multiple matches are found at any point, matching code  may determine the absolute value of the difference of the position of the req_hash element and those of the matches in the data_hash and match to the one with the lowest absolute value. If no matches are found at any point, the req_hash element may be considered to not have any matching data and may be dropped. If multiple matches are found, even after determining the absolute value, the data may be considered duplicate data and may be rendered accordingly (e.g., graphical overlay indicating multiple selections of the element).","Consider the following example of the operation of matching code .

Any remaining elements in the data_hash may be added to the unmatched_data array. Unmatched_data may be presented in the analytics report  as elements not found in the current version of network content. For example, such data may correspond to elements that no longer exist in the network content, such as an old, no longer relevant news story from a news website, or a product no longer available for sale on a retailer's website.","In various embodiments, matching code  may perform element position variation matching. Element position variation matching extends a search to neighboring element positions. For example, if a string \u201cdiv,p,a[3]\u201d is being searched for, element position variation matching may attempt to match the string to \u201cdiv,p,a[4]\u201d and\/or \u201cdiv,p,a[2]\u201d.","In some embodiments, matching code  may search the analytics database for direct matches of an attribute ID of a current element of the current version of the network content. This may be done before or after performing any incremental stripping or position variation matching. For example, one or more current elements of the current version of the network content may include a region ID attribute. Matching code  may search the analytics database, or data_hash, for elements that include the same region ID attribute, e.g., <div onclick=\u201cs_regionID=\u2018myregion\u2019;\u201d>.","Matching code  may include some of the above described features and not others, in various embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, matching code  may not perform element position variation while in other embodiments, it may perform element position variation. Still in other embodiments, ID attributes may also be incrementally stripped from the analytics data, in addition to, or instead of, incrementally stripping element positioners from the HPIs.","Analytics report  may include a visual or non-visual display of analytics data resulting from matching code . For example, analytics report  may be a visual overlay of analytics information on top of a current version of the network content form which analytics data is sought. In one embodiment, one or more of analytics report , matching code , and report generator code  may be in the form of a browser plug-in such that actual content is loaded in a browser with analytics data overlaid on top of the actual content. Analytics data may be overlaid on top of each selectable element or region upon execution of report generator code  or in response to user input (e.g., hovering over or clicking on a selectable element). The latter example is illustrated in . The arrow in  is hovering over a selectable element and region, respectively, upon which an indication of the analytics data  is overlaid on top of the content. In the examples shown, the indication is a frequency of the number of selections (e.g., 36 clicks in ) of the respective selectable element or region. In other embodiments, generator code  may be a standalone implementation that may be installed locally, from which network content can be loaded, and overlays may be inserted apart from any browser. In some examples, an indication of more than one selectable element may be displayed at a time. The indication may be a shade or darkness of a color to indicate a frequency of selection (e.g., darker for more frequent, lighter for less frequent) to differentiate between different selectable elements.","Analytics report  may be capable of reporting analytics data on a selectable element basis, region basis, or a combination of the two. Combination reporting may be provided at different times or at the same time. For instance, an indication of element selection may be provided in one color while an indication of selection of an element within a region may be provided in another color such that the different data can be distinguished even if showing at the same time. The different reporting capabilities may be user-selectable. Further, region reporting may provide an indication of a region across multiple webpages of a website. For example, region reporting may provide indication of a frequency of selection of any selectable element within the main regions of a sports webpage, entertainment webpage, and domestic news webpage, respectively, of the same website. As a result, popularity of a region or section across an entire website may be tracked.","Using a hierarchical position identifier may offer many advantages. For example, by utilizing a hierarchical position identifier, cross-browser compatibility may be supported that may allow for more accurate matching of selectable elements with analytics data without having to emulate browser specific properties that are native to one browser but not others. Further, such an identifier may be less susceptible to changes in dynamic network content than other identifiers and may help distinguish between duplicate links. Moreover, using a hierarchical position identifier may also decrease cardinality in a database, which may lead to more accurate matching and less memory requirements.","Using a region identifier may offer similar advantages. For example, using a region identifier may allow for tracking of a region of network content or, in some cases, of a region for various pages of content across a network content site. In such cases, individual element tracking may or not be as relevant as tracking a particular region of interest.","Turning now to , one embodiment of analytics data collection is illustrated. While the blocks are shown in a particular order for ease of understanding, other orders may be used. In some embodiments, the method of  may include additional (or fewer) blocks than shown. Blocks - may be performed automatically or may receive user input.","As illustrated at , first analytics data may be generated. First analytics data may be generated in response to a first selection of a selectable element (e.g., a link, button, anything with an anchor tag or onclick attribute, etc.) from a version of content (e.g., network content, website, FTP site, etc.). The first analytics data may include a first hierarchical position identifier.","At , second analytics data may be generated. Second analytics data may be generated in response to a second selection of the selectable element from an updated version of content. Like the first analytics data, the second analytics data may also include a hierarchical position identifier. The content may be an updated\/different version because the content is dynamic. For example, the content could be a news website or media portal that changes frequently. In various examples, the content may be updated in the sense that elements are moved from the time of the first analytics data generation to the second analytics data generation. Updated content may also include situations where elements have been added and\/or subtracted from the content. Referring to  for an example, first analytics data may be generated in response to a selection of the selectable element, Element D, from . Second analytics data may be generated in response to a selection of the selectable element, Element D, from . Note that the content is updated from  to  in that additional Elements F and G have been added in  and Element C has been removed.","The respective hierarchical position identifiers of the first and second analytics data may be the same, or in some embodiments, may be different, even though each correspond to the same selectable element. Each may include tag names for a plurality of parent nodes located above the selectable element in a hierarchical data structure of the content at the time of generation of the respective analytics data. Each may also include information on the corresponding selectable element's respective order among peer nodes in the hierarchical data structure below a closest common parent node. As an example, a hierarchical position identifier may be \u201chtml,body,div#mydiv[3],p[4],a[2]\u201d. In such an example, the example selectable element's respective order among peer nodes may be 2, from \u201ca[2]\u201d meaning that one peer node precedes it under the closest common parent node.","As illustrated at , each of the first and second hierarchical position identifiers may be usable to match to a same corresponding current selectable element of a current version of the content. In various embodiments, the actual matching may be performed at a remote location from the point of generation of the analytics data. For example, as described herein, generation may be executed by a data collection code embedded in network content while matching may be performed at a later time by a different computing device. In some embodiments, the first and second analytics data may be provided to a remote analytics site, where the analytics data may be stored for later use.","Turning now to , another embodiment of analytics data collection is illustrated. While the blocks are shown in a particular order for ease of understanding, other orders may be used. In some embodiments, the method of  may include additional (or fewer) blocks than shown. Blocks - may be performed automatically or may receive user input. The method of  may be used in conjunction with the method of . Accordingly, a combination of some or all of the blocks of  may be used in some embodiments.","As illustrated at , first analytics data may be generated. First analytics data may be generated in response to a selection of a selectable element (e.g., a link, button, anything with an anchor tag or onclick attribute, etc.) located within a region of content (e.g., network content, website, FTP site, etc.). The first analytics data may include a region identifier that corresponds to the region of the content from which the selectable element was selected. For instance, in an example of a news website, the news site may include a top news region and a side news region. Thus, in some embodiments, if a selection of the selectable element was from the top news region or a news website, the first analytics data may include a region identifier corresponding to the top news region.","At , second analytics data may be generated. Second analytics data may be generated in response to a selection of a different selectable element from the same region of content. Like the first analytics data, the second analytics data may also include the same region identifier that corresponds to the same region of the content from which the different selectable element was selected. Continuing the example from above and referring to  for illustration, consider that the first analytics data was generated from a selection of Element A of , from Region A. The second analytics data may be generated from a selection of Element B or C of  or of Elements F, G, or H, of  as each of those elements are located in Region A of the example content of .","In various embodiments, generating analytics data may include searching a data structure of the content for a region identifier associated with the selected element. For example, a data structure of the content (e.g., an html file) may include a region identifier associated with a selectable element or a parent node of a selectable element. In some embodiments, generating analytics data may include determining that region tracking is enabled (e.g., a flag or some indicator in the content). Generating analytics data may also include searching the hierarchical data structure of the content until finding a closest parent node of the selected element with a region identifier. The region identifier may then be stored as part of the analytics data. As described herein, analytics data may also include one or more element identifiers, in addition to, or instead of a region identifier. Moreover, the first and second analytics data may be provided to a remote analytics site.","The first and second analytics data may be generated from selections of different pages of network content. For instance, the example content of  may be separate webpages of a website.  may be the sports webpage of the website while  may be the domestic news webpage of the website. The top story region of each webpage, e.g., Region A from , may include the same region identifier such that a selection of a selectable element from either of the webpage's top story region may generate analytics data that includes the same region identifier. As a result, a region of a website across various webpages may be tracked, in addition to regions of individual webpages. In one embodiment, an element on a page of network content may include multiple region identifiers so that the region could be tracked in different ways.","Turning now to , one embodiment of matching analytics data is illustrated.

The matching may be performed in a browser plug-in with the current version of the content loaded in the browser or as a stand alone application. For example, the current version of the content may be a simulated version of the current content.","Matching may include comparing data corresponding to a plurality of selectable elements of the current version of the network content with the analytics data. The plurality of selectable elements may include the current selectable element. The data corresponding to the plurality of selectable elements of the current version may include current data corresponding to the current selectable element. Matching may also include determining that at least a portion of a hierarchical position identifier of the current data matches at least a portion of the hierarchical position identifier of the analytics data.","In various embodiments, matching may include determining that the analytics data and current data corresponding to the current selectable element of the current version of the network content each include a common other identifier (e.g., tag and action identifier). Matching may further include determining that the hierarchical position identifier of the analytics data is different than the hierarchical position identifier of the current data. In some embodiments, matching may include incrementally removing a portion of each of the respective hierarchical position identifiers of the analytics data and the current data until the remaining portion of each of the respective hierarchical position identifiers of the analytics data and current data match.
