No. 61\/542,515 filed Oct. 3, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and made a part hereof. This application also claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/561,502 filed Nov. 18, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and made a part hereof.","The management of a patent portfolio involves multiple stages. Initially, a decision must be made as to what inventions are worth the investment of filing a patent application. Then, each filed patent application goes through prosecution with the patent office. Finally, for each patent that is allowed, maintenance fees are usually payable at a variety of intervals to keep the patent in force.","The life cycle of a patent may include multiple stages. These stages generally include invention, filing a patent application on the invention, prosecuting the patenting application to allowance or abandonment, determining whether to file any continuing applications, and paying maintenance fees on the allowed patent.","At each stage, one or more parties determine the best course of action to take with respect to the invention. For example, when determining whether or not to file a patent, the inventor may know what products are out in the technology area of the invention, a business manager may know how the invention fits in with a company's goals, and a patent attorney may have researched existing patents or application in the technology area of the patent. These parties will ultimately decide whether it is worth the initial investment of filing an application on the invention and then determine the next course of action at each future stage.","In some instances, an inventor, business manager, or portfolio manager may wish to monitor the patent activities of one or more competitors. The provision of up-to-date information relating to cited references or technology trends in the art to which a user's or competitor's patent portfolio relates may be particularly helpful in devising patenting strategy or making informed business decisions.","In various embodiments, a patent management system includes tools to help the parties involved in the patenting process make decisions at each stage in the life of a patent. These tools may also be used for general research by parties not immediately involved with the patenting of the invention. These tools may be used as standalone tools, in combination with other tools, and in combination with other patent management systems. Examples of tools include, but are not limited to, prosecution analytics, patent analysis, reference management, prior art analytics, docketing management, claim mapping, claim analytics, portfolio analytics, external database (e.g., PAIR) analytics, annuity management, and strategic monitoring.","The systems, methods and tools of the present disclosure set forth in this specification are described in relation to a patent management system and patent matters, but it will be understood that embodiments of the present invention could equally be applied to other forms of intellectual property (trademarks, copyright, registered designs, and the like). Moreover, the term \u201cpatent\u201d is not intended to be limited to an issued patent, but may include a pending patent application or un-filed application or invention disclosure. The term \u201cuser\u201d is intended to cover any person interacting with the patent management system. A user may be an inventor, portfolio manager, business manager or patent attorney, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","102","108","110","114","116","118","102","102","102","108","118","114"]},"Network  may include local area networks (LANs), WANs, wireless networks (e.g., 802.11 or cellular network), the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTNs) network, ad hoc networks, personal area networks (e.g., Bluetooth) or other combinations or permutations of network protocols and network types. The network  may include a single LAN or WAN, or combinations of LANs or WANs, such as the Internet. The various devices coupled to network  may be coupled to network  via one or more wired or wireless connections.","Web server  may communicate with file server  to publish or serve files stored on file server . Web server  may also communicate or interface with the application server  to enable web-based presentation of information. For example, application server  may consist of scripts, applications, or library files that provide primary or auxiliary functionality to web server  (e.g., multimedia, file transfer, or dynamic interface functions). In addition, application server  may also provide some or the entire interface for web server  to communicate with one or more of the other servers in the patent portfolio and annuity management system  (e.g., database management server ). Web server , either alone or in conjunction with one or more other computers in patent portfolio and annuity management system , may provide a user-interface. The user-interface may be implemented using a variety of programming languages or programming methods, such as HTML (HyperText Markup Language), VBScript (Visual Basic\u00ae Scripting Edition), JavaScript\u2122, XML\u00ae (Extensible Markup Language), XSLT\u2122 (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations), AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), Java\u2122, JFC (Java\u2122 Foundation Classes), and Swing (an Application Programming Interface for Java\u2122).","User terminal  may be a personal computer (PC) or mobile device. In an embodiment, user terminal  includes a client program to interface with the patent portfolio and annuity management system . The client program may include commercial software, custom software, open source software, freeware, shareware, or other types of software packages. In an embodiment, the client program includes a thin client designed to provide query and data manipulation tools for a user of user terminal . The client program may interact with a server program hosted by, for example, application server . Additionally, the client program may interface with database management server .","Operations database  may be composed of one or more logical or physical databases. For example, operations database  may be viewed as a system of databases, which when viewed as a compilation, represent an \u201coperations database.\u201d Sub-databases in such a configuration may include a matter database, portfolio database, user database, patent reference document or prior art database, product database, watch database, and mapping database. Operations database  may be implemented as a relational database, a centralized database, a distributed database, an object oriented database, or a flat database in various embodiments.","Data stored in a first database may be associated with data in a second database through the use of common data fields. For example, consider entries in the patent database formatted as [Patent ID, Patent Number] and entries in the product database formatted as [Product ID, Product Name, Patent ID]. In this manner, a product entry in the product database is associated with a patent in the patent database through the Patent ID data field. In various embodiments, a product may be associated with more than one patent by creating multiple entries in the product database (one for each patent the product is associated with). In other embodiments, one or more patent reference documents may be associated with a patent by creating multiple entries in the patent database, for example. The formats and data field titles are for illustration purposes, and other names and formats may be used. Additionally, further associations between data stored in the databases may be created as discussed further herein.","During operation of patent portfolio and annuity management system , data from multiple data sources (internal and external) is imported into or accessed by the operations database . Internal sources may include data from portfolio management and annuity payment services affiliated with patent portfolio and annuity management system . External sources  may include websites or databases associated with foreign and domestic patent offices, assignment databases, WIPO, and INPADOC. In various embodiments, the data is scraped and parsed from the websites if it is unavailable through a database. The data may be gathered using API calls to the sources when available. The data may be imported and stored in the operations database on a scheduled basis, such as weekly, monthly, quarterly, or some other regular or periodic interval. Alternatively, the data may be imported on-demand.","After data importation, the data may be standardized into a common format. For example, database records from internal or external sources may not be in a compatible format with the operations database. Data conditioning may include data rearrangement, normalization, filtering (e.g., removing duplicates), sorting, binning, or other operations to transform the data into a common format (e.g., using similar date formats and name formats).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","102","200","200","106","104","200","102"]},"The user interface elements may include my matters , patent watches , company watches , and prior art . These elements may be used to select a context\/view of the portfolio and annuity management system. For example, my matters  lists the patents included within a portfolio of a user, patent watches  lists information on patents that the user has indicated the management system is to watch, and company watches  lists information on companies that the user has indicated the system should watch. Prior art element  allows a user to perform analysis on prior art. Further details of each of these are included herein.","Date boxes  and  are user elements that allow a user to select a time period. Amount due box  displays the amount due with respect to annuities for patents in the portfolio of the user within the period indicated by date boxes  and . Upon activating (e.g., clicking) one of the date boxes, a user may be presented with a calendar, which allows the selection of a date. Upon selecting a date, the date boxes will update to reflect the user's choice.","Drop-down menu  includes a list of portfolios that a user of the patent portfolio and annuity management system  is authorized to view. For example, before user interface  is displayed, a login screen requesting a user ID and password may be presented to the user. In various embodiments, the user ID is associated with one or more portfolios. In turn, each portfolio is associated with one or more matters. Matters may include US and foreign issued patents, pending patents, abandoned patents, and not yet filed applications. Thus, upon selection of a portfolio using drop-down menu , user interface  is populated with matters associated with the portfolio.","Checkbox  is an option to only display matters that currently have an annuity due. Drop-down menu  allows further filtering of matters. For example, the matters may be filtered by US patents only, US patent applications, and foreign only.","In various embodiments, activation of button  updates user interface  to reflect the choices made by the user with respect to date boxes  and , checkbox , and drop-down menu . For example, the amount due box  will be updated to reflect the amount due within the new period, and the matters listed under column headings  may be filtered. In various embodiments, user interface  is updated as the user selections are made with respect to elements  to  without activating button .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["102","302","304","306","308","310","312","314","316","318","320","322","324","326","302","304","306","308","310","304","102","102"]},"In an example embodiment, user database  stores data representing users of patent portfolio and annuity management system . The data may include data fields of user credentials including a user ID and password and access rights with respect to the management system . The user ID may be the same as the user ID of other systems associated with patent portfolio and annuity management system . For example the user ID may be used in a portfolio management system. In this manner, access rights of the user with respect to the portfolio management system may follow to the patent portfolio and annuity management system . In various embodiments, each user ID is associated with one or more portfolio IDs. Thus, when a user logs into the patent portfolio and annuity management system , the user is presented with access to only the portfolios that have been associated with the user ID. More or fewer data fields associated with a user may be included in a user entry stored in user database .","Portfolio database , in an example embodiment, stores data representing portfolios of one or more matters. A matter may include foreign or domestic issued patents in addition to applications. Data stored in portfolio database  may initially have been generated in a portfolio management system and imported into patent portfolio and annuity management system  through the use of one or more API calls or direct access to the data in the portfolio management system. In various embodiments, a portfolio may be generated by a user using the patent portfolio and annuity management system . For example, a user interface may be presented to the user requesting a portfolio name and the identifiers of matters to be included in the portfolio. In an embodiment, a portfolio entry in portfolio database  includes the data fields of portfolio ID and portfolio name. Additionally, a data field for matter ID may also be included in an entry in the portfolio database. Thus, each portfolio may be associated with one or more matters through the use of the matter ID data field. More or fewer data fields associated with a portfolio may be included in a portfolio entry of portfolio database .","In an embodiment, matter database  stores data representing matters. Each matter may be associated with one or more portfolios as well as one or more watches. In some embodiments, a matter is associated with no portfolios or watches. In an embodiment, a matter entry includes data fields representing a matter ID, title (e.g., the name of the patent or application), type of the matter (e.g., application, issued patent, PCT application), status of the matter (e.g., issued, abandoned, allowed), a link to the patent office where the matter was filed, a link to a PDF download of the matter, abstract of the matter, inventors of the matter, current owner of the matter, cited references on the face of the matter, filed date, issue date, docket number, and annuity information (e.g., due date, country, and amount due). In some embodiments, other patent reference documents or prior art in any form may be stored and associated with one or more matters. More or fewer data fields associated with a patent may be included in a matter entry stored in matter database . In an example embodiment, matter database  may store a patent matter database, wherein this database includes data about the patent matters. The data may include, for at least one patent matter, a claim set or statement of invention and a priority date for the claim set or statement of invention. Matter database  may also store a database of prior art documents (also known as \u201creferences\u201d), wherein the prior art database includes data about the prior art documents. The data may include, for at least one prior art document, a priority date or publication date of the document. One or more of the prior art documents may be associated with a first patent matter in the patent matter database.","In various embodiments, a matter is associated with one or more other matters as a family with a family ID. Family members may be priority documents, continuation patents\/applications, divisional patents\/applications, and foreign patent\/application counterparts. In an embodiment, family information is determined according to an external source such as INPADOC. Patent reference documents and\/or other prior art may be manually or automatically stored, cross-cited, and associated with related family matters, for example.","In an embodiment, watch database  stores data representing user preferences with respect to objects that the user wants to track (e.g., watch). In an embodiment, an object is a company or a matter. With respect to matters, a user may indicate a preference to track the matter for any forward citations within a time period (e.g., 60 days, 3 months, etc.). Thus, watch database  may store entries with a watch ID that is associated with a user ID and a matter ID. With respect to companies, a user may indicate a preference to watch for publications or issued patents with an associated time period. Thus, watch database  may store entries with a watch ID, a user ID, and a company name. In various embodiments, the watches are user ID specific such that no matter what profile the user is viewing, the watches do not change.","In an embodiment, product database  stores data representing products. The products may be actual products manufactured by the user, products yet to be released, planned products, products covered in a licensing agreement, or a fictional product. In various embodiments, product database  stores entries with a product ID and product name which are associated with a user ID. In various embodiments, a user may tag a product as associated with a matter. Thus, an entry in the product database may also be associated with a matter ID.","In various embodiments, analytics database  stores data representing information on matters and companies associated with patent portfolio and annuity management system . This information may be organized according to an individual matter, a portfolio, a family, or company. The information may be gathered from internal or external sources of patent portfolio and annuity management system  or may be generated by examining the data stored in one or more databases of the management system .","In various embodiments, information for an individual matter may include status (e.g., disclosure received, drafting, filed, completed-waiting examination, in prosecution, allowed, issued), cited prior art, list and type of rejections (e.g., 35 U.S.C. \u00a7101, 102, 103), number of claims allowed, office action count, interviews held, IDS statements filed, attorney fees to date, and PTO fees to date. Further metrics for an individual matter stored in analytics database  may include, time waiting for examiner, total time in examination, time waiting for PTO while in examination, and time on appeal. An additional prosecution details formatter may include upcoming docket dates (e.g., due dates for office action, IDS due dates, etc.). A claim prosecution history chart may also be stored in analytics database  for each matter. The prosecution history may include a history of claim amendments and arguments made in prosecution.","In various embodiments, analytics for an individual matter may also include data representing a claim chart. The claim chart may include one or more scope concepts on one axis and claims on the other axis. In an embodiment, a scope concept is a textual description of what a patent claim is at least limited to. Thus, if a claim comprises A, B, and C, a scope concept may be A. In various embodiments, a scope concept for the claim may be broader than A because the claim will still be limited to the broader scope concept. In an embodiment, the claim charts store mappings between claims and scope concepts. The claim chart may include a variety of levels of granularity of scope concepts. Some claims may be mapped to all of the scope concepts while others may not be mapped to any scope concepts. In various embodiments, the mappings may have already been generated in a program external to the management system (e.g., a portfolio mapping system). In various embodiments, claim charts may be combined at the portfolio level. Thus, a portfolio level chart may include scope concepts for all the claims (or in some examples only the independent claims) in the portfolio.","In various embodiments, portfolio and family analytics information may be stored in analytics database  based on aggregating the metrics for an individual matter. In an embodiment, the analytics of a family may differ from those in a portfolio since not all family member matters may be part of a portfolio. Additionally, the analytics may be stored for multiple time periods such that comparisons may be made between current metrics and metrics from a year ago (or other time period).","Aggregated metrics may include total patents and applications, pending and waiting for examination, in prosecution with no claims allowed, in prosecution with some claims allowed, appealed, notice of allowance received, and issued. These metrics may be compiled for both US and international matters in the portfolio. Additional information may include the international portfolio distribution by country. An age distribution of the portfolio may also be compiled. For example, the portfolio may be broken down by less than one year old, 1 to 3 years old, 3 to 5 years old, 5 to 10 years old, 10 to 20 years old, and 20 or more years old. Recent filing and issue activity as well as upcoming Ford filing deadlines may be stored in analytics database .","In various embodiments, prosecution metrics across a portfolio or family are determined and stored in analytics database . This data may include matters waiting for examination, matters in examination, matters appealed, and cases allowed but not yet issued. Analytics with respect to office actions may also be compiled and stored. For example, success of allowance after a first office action response, a second response, and the like, may be stored in analytics database . Additional prosecution analytics may include allowance rate (e.g., 10%) after a telephone interview, allowance after an in-person interview, percentage of interviews with response, number and type of rejections, average time in prosecution (e.g., in months), average time to file a response, and average time to next office action. Further, the list of recently allowed cases, recently appealed cases, stalled cases, and recently abandoned cases may also be stored for each portfolio and family in analytics database .","In various embodiments, data stored in the database for a group of matters in a portfolio or family is analyzed to determine the top (e.g., ten) most cited patents, the top most cited inventors, top most cited prior art owners (e.g., according to assignment documents or the face of the patent), newly (e.g., within the last 60 days) cited prior art owners, and top most cited prior art inventors. This information may be stored in analytics database .","In various embodiments, annuity cost information regarding cost projections for both US issued patents and international patents may also be stored. Upcoming foreign filing deadlines with respect to annuities may also be stored in analytics database .","In various embodiments, the results of keyword analysis on one or more matters and\/or prior art references may be stored in analytics database . The keyword analysis may be based on the occurrences of the keywords in the matter or references to derive a score or keyword overlap.","In various embodiments, input module  receives data from multiple sources where it may be further processed by one or more other modules and stored in one or more of databases -. For example, input module  may be configured to utilize one or more APIs to collect data from one or more external patent data stores  (e.g., public PAIR, private PAIR, INPADOC, foreign patent offices, patent docketing systems, portfolio management systems, etc.). The data may include published patent documents (for example, published claims of a patent), issued patent documents (for example, granted claims of a patent), patent applications, office actions or other patent office correspondence, prior art references, claim mappings, dockets dates, and annuity payment data.","In various embodiments, input module  is configured to receive input from one or more user interface elements. For example, the patent portfolio and annuity management system  may present multiple user interfaces to users. These user interfaces may enable users to input data directly into databases -, instruct the management system to retrieve data from patent data stores, and instruct the management system to perform various operations on the data in databases -.","Additionally, input module  may be configured to determine the selection of one or more user interface elements by a user and initiate the action associated with the selected user interface element. For example, a user interface element may include a drop-down menu to select a portfolio. Input module  may be configured to receive a selection of the portfolio and a drop-down menu. Then, input module  may pass the selection to one or more other modules for further processing. For example, display module  may update the drop-down menu to indicate the selection of a portfolio.","In various embodiments, parsing module  takes the data that has initially been inputted by input module  and formats it according to the data fields of databases - as discussed above. For example, consider a patent publication that is been inputted by input module . Parsing module  may use a combination of automatic image recognition and text analysis to determine the filing date, issue date, title, abstract, and claims of the patent. In some embodiments, parsing module  may flag certain pieces of data that had been determined to be potentially inaccurate (e.g., a number could not be read). A user of patent portfolio and annuity management system  may then examine the flagged data and manually enter in the information.","The resulting data that has been parsed by parsing module  may then be entered as an entry in one or more of databases -. This may be accomplished by, for example, formulating an SQL query with the parsed information. In various embodiments, parsing module  may parse multiple piece of information before generating a database entry. For example, input module  may receive a docket number for an issued patent. The docket number may be combined with the information parsed from the issued patent to form an entry in matter database .","In various embodiments, analytics module  is configured to examine and run calculations on the data stored in the databases - to generate the analytics discussed previously. For example, analytics module  may formulate an SQL query that retrieves the number of times that a prior art reference has been cited within a portfolio. This query may be run for each prior art cited within the portfolio to determine a list of the most cited (e.g., the top ten) prior art references within a portfolio. In an embodiment, the queries are formulated and run as requested by a user. In an embodiment, once the analytics information has been determined, it is stored within analytics database . In various embodiments, queries are formulated and run on a period basis (e.g., nightly) and entries in analytics database  may be updated to reflect any changes.","In various embodiments, the analytics module  is configured to receive input identifying a pool of keywords for a first patent matter and associated prior art documents in matter database . The term keyword is intended to include individual keywords as well as a number of keywords grouped together (making up a key phrase, for example). The analytics module  may be further configured to perform a keyword analysis on the first patent matter and associated prior art documents based on occurrences of the keywords in the first patent matter and associated prior art documents. The analytics module  may be further configured to identify, based on the analysis, keywords occurring uniquely in the first patent matter. In view of their uniquely occurring nature, these keywords may be regarded as claim elements that potentially differentiate the claim set or statement of invention over the disclosures contained in the one or more prior art documents.","The analytics module  may be further configured to perform the keyword analysis automatically on the first patent matter and the one or more prior art documents simultaneously. Prior art element  shown in  may be selected by a portfolio manager to enter further user displays and start the automatic keyword analysis. The analytics module may be further configured to receive synonyms of the keywords to add to the pool of identified keywords. In this way, the keyword analysis may be enhanced.","The analytics module  may be further configured to automatically rank the prior art documents based on the degree of differentiation between the first patent matter and the one or more prior art documents, based on the keyword analysis. The analytics module may be further configured to rank the prior art document with the highest degree of differentiation as lowest ranked in potential relevance to the claim set or statement of invention of the first patent matter. Similarly, the analytics module may be further configured to rank the prior art document with the lowest degree of differentiation as highest ranked in potential relevance to the claim set or statement of invention of the first patent matter.","The analytics module  may be further configured to derive a keyword differentiation score, based on the keyword analysis, for the one or more prior art documents. The analytics module may be further configured to derive a keyword overlap score, based on the keyword analysis, for the one or more prior art documents.","The analytics module  may be further configured to identify the cited inventors or assignees of the prior art documents and automatically rank the prior art documents by the inventor or assignee having the most keywords occurring in one or more of the prior art documents.","In an embodiment, display module  is configured to display user interfaces and information retrieved from one or more databases -. For example display module  may generate user interface  of . If a user is accessing patent portfolio and annuity management system  remotely (e.g., through a web browser), display module  may be configured to transmit data representing a user-interface through a network to a user terminal. In various embodiments, display module  is configured to generate one or more charts of data stored in databases -. For example, display module  may generate a pie chart of the top 10 inventors within a portfolio.","With reference to the keyword analysis described above, display module  may be configured to display a user interface visually presenting the ranking of the one or more prior art documents in the user interface. The display module  may be further configured to provide, in the user interface, a visual indication of the ranking in a time line.","The display module  may be further configured to visually provide, in the user interface, a time line representing the priority date of the first patent matter, and the priority or publication dates of the or each prior art document. The display module may be further configured to provide a visual indication of the degree of differentiation of the one or more prior documents in the time line.","The display module  may be further configured to provide, in the user interface, a visual indication of the technology class and\/or subclass of the first patent matter and the one or more prior art documents. In an example embodiment, the display module may be further configured to provide, in the user interface, a time line or chart indicating when one or more of the identified keywords first appeared in one or more of the prior art documents.","In various embodiments, filtering module  is configured to filter a set of matters according to a user preference. For example, a user may activate a check box that indicates only pending matters should be shown in a user interface. Filtering module  may formulate a query consistent with retrieving only pending matters. The results of the query may then be shared with display module , where the user interface may be updated.","In various embodiments, mapping module  is configured to receive or generate mappings from a product to a matter. This may be accomplished, for example, by receiving a selection of a product by user and a matter by the user. In various embodiments, mapping module  is configured to present an automated mapping of the product to a matter for the user to confirm or deny. For example, mapping module  may present a claim chart for an issued patent to a user. As discussed, the claim chart includes one or more scope concepts to which one or more the claims of the patent are limited. In conjunction with input module , mapping module  may receive selections of the user of one or more of the scope concepts that are potentially affiliated with the product. Thus, a comparison may be made between what the claims are limited to and what the product may be. For example, if a product, as defined by the selection of one or more scope concepts by the user, is affiliated toward scope concepts A, B, and C and claim  of the patent has been mapped to scope concepts A, B, and C, the mapping module  may present an option to map the product to the patent. In various embodiments, the user may override this recommendation and select to not map the product to the patent. Similarly, a user may indicate that a product is affiliated with the patent even if the scope concepts do not match.","In various embodiments, the mapping module  is configured to receive or generate mappings from prior art to a matter. This may be accomplished, for example, by receiving a selection of prior art and a matter by the user. The selection of the prior art may be based on cited references or though other external prior art search. The selections may be conducted manually by a user, or automatically by analytics module , for example. In various embodiments, mapping module  is configured to present an automated mapping of the prior art to a matter for the user to review. In various embodiments, the mapping module can be configured to carry out any of the keyword analysis described above in relation to analytics module .","In an embodiment, once the product or prior art mapping information has been determined, it is stored within analytics database  or matter database . In various embodiments, queries are formulated and run on a periodic basis (e.g., nightly), and entries in analytics database  or matter database  may be updated to reflect any changes.","In various embodiments, payment module  is configured to receive selections by the user of which annuities to pay for matters in a portfolio. Additionally, payment module  may receive user preferences related to the payment of the annuities. Payment module  may receive payment information from a user and forward the payment information to the appropriate agency\/office. In some embodiments, the annuity management system  organizes payment of the annuity on behalf of the user, and the user pays patent portfolio and annuity management system .","In various embodiments, a patent portfolio and annuity management system  for determining a potential point of novelty of an identified patent may comprise any one or more of the modules - herein described operating or configured to perform at least a portion of one or more of the following: retrieve at least one independent claim of the patent in the claim form as issued; retrieve at least one independent claim of the patent in the claim form as published; and automatically compare the issued claim to the published claim, by identifying unique keywords present in the issued claim but not present in the published claim, and flag the unique keywords to a user.","In various embodiments, at least one or more of the modules - is further to receive input from a user identifying prior art, retrieve the prior art, and perform a keyword analysis on the prior art using the unique keywords. In some embodiments, at least one or more of the modules - is further to identify common keywords present in both the published and issued claims and perform a keyword analysis on the prior art using the common keywords.

The patent may be selected and entered by a user, identified by the system through patent search, or identified in any other way. The patent may be a known key patent for a competitor, for example, and might be \u201cin the way\u201d of the user's planned product launch, for example. The user might quickly want to know what point(s) of novelty (if any) can be ascribed to the granted claims to assist in identifying design-around opportunities or compiling an invalidity attack.

Modules may constitute either software modules (e.g., code embodied (1) on a non-transitory machine-readable medium or (2) in a transmission signal) or hardware-implemented modules. A hardware-implemented module is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client, or server computer system) or one or more processors may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware-implemented module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.","In various embodiments, a hardware-implemented module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a hardware-implemented module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations. A hardware-implemented module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware-implemented module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.","Accordingly, the term \u201chardware-implemented module\u201d should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired) or temporarily or transitorily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner and\/or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware-implemented modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware-implemented modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware-implemented modules comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware-implemented modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor, for example, to constitute a particular hardware-implemented module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware-implemented module at a different instance of time.","Hardware-implemented modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware-implemented modules. Accordingly, the described hardware-implemented modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware-implemented modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connect the hardware-implemented modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware-implemented modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware-implemented modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware-implemented modules have access. For example, one hardware-implemented module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware-implemented module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware-implemented modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).","The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise processor-implemented modules.","Similarly, the methods described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor-implemented modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the processor or processors may be located in a single location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment, or as a server farm), while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.","The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a \u201ccloud computing\u201d environment or as a \u201csoftware as a service\u201d (SaaS). For example, at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers (as examples of machines including processors), with these operations being accessible via a network (e.g., the Internet) and via one or more appropriate interfaces (e.g., Application Program Interfaces (APIs).)","Example embodiments may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, or software, or in combinations of them. Example embodiments may be implemented using a computer program product, e.g., a computer program tangibly embodied in an information carrier, e.g., in a machine-readable medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus, e.g., a programmable processor, a computer, or multiple computers.","A computer program can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.","In example embodiments, operations may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. Method operations can also be performed by, and apparatus of example embodiments may be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry (e.g., a FPGA or an ASIC).","The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In embodiments deploying a programmable computing system, it will be appreciated that both hardware and software architectures usually require consideration. Specifically, it will be appreciated that the choice of whether to implement certain functionality in permanently configured hardware (e.g., an ASIC), in temporarily configured hardware (e.g., a combination of software and a programmable processor), or a combination of permanently and temporarily configured hardware may be a design choice. Below are set out hardware (e.g., machine) and software architectures that may be deployed, in various example embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"700"},"The example computer system  includes a processor  (e.g., a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU) or both), a main memory  and a static memory , which communicate with each other via a bus .

The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d shall accordingly be taken to include, but not be limited to, solid-state memories and optical and magnetic media. Specific examples of machine-readable media include non-volatile memory, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices (e.g., Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EPROM), Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), and flash memory devices); magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks.","The instructions  may further be transmitted or received over a communications network  using a transmission medium.
