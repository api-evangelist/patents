{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60\/366,323 filed Mar. 20, 2002, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The invention relates in general to coordinate measurement machines (CMMs) and in particular to a method and system for assisting a user taking measurements using a CMM.","The manufacturing\/industrial marketplace took on a new face during the 1980's with the introduction of computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM). While CAD allowed engineers to produce 3-D images in the front end of the design process, which shortened the production cycle and led to tremendous gains in productivity, CAM software and equipment increased the efficiency and quality of machined single parts. In essence, these new technologies revolutionized the marketplace by increasing productivity, improving quality, and reducing costs. Despite these technological advances in design and manufacturing, something important was missing from the production cycle: a highly accurate, efficient, and convenient measurement methodology for ensuring that the products and components\u2014both on and off the production line\u2014met the original CAD specifications. The design process, with the help of CAD, had become innovative and sophisticated; so too, had the machining process through CAM. Yet measuring the assemblies made of these parts against the CAD model, for the most part, has continued to remain unwieldy, expensive, and unreliable.","Traditionally, the measurement and quality inspection function in the manufacturing process has been time-consuming and limited in size, scope, and effectiveness for a number of reasons. Manual measurement tools, such as calipers and scales may be slow, imprecise, and always one-dimensional. Analog test fixtures are costly and inflexible. And standard stationary CMMs while providing a high degree of precision, are generally located in quality control labs or inspection departments at a distance from the manufacturing floor. Parts must be removed one at a time and transported to the lab for inspection. As a result, CMMs measure only small, readily-moved subassemblies and components\u2014which often translates into significant \u201cdown time\u201d for the production line. In essence, traditional measurement techniques\u2014also known as metrology\u2014have lagged far behind in the technological advance of the production process.","The CAD\/CAM and metrology markets, as well as a worldwide emphasis on quality in all aspects of the manufacturing process, are driving the need for an extension of the CAD\/CAM techniques, which the inventor refers to as computer-aided manufacturing measurement. Computer-aided manufacturing measurement is CAD-based total quality assurance technology. This last phase of the CAD revolution has remained incomplete because of the significant technical demands for adaptive measurement hardware and usable CAD-based measurement software for the difficult manufacturing environment. Computer-aided manufacturing measurement takes conventional metrology from a single-parts-only, high-level precision testing methodology\u2014behind the door of the quality control lab\u2014to a whole products, intermediate-level precision measurement system at every step of the manufacturing process\u2014at any location on the factory floor. Measurements of part dimensions and\/or characteristics may be made on the production floor to determine compliance with specifications and ensure quality.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00007","num":"00007"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","18","12","16","18"]},"An improvement to the three dimensional coordinate measuring system of  is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,978,748, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. This patent discloses a system in which a controller is mounted to the arm and runs an executable program which directs the user through a process such as an inspection procedure. In such a system, a host computer may be used to generate the executable program. The controller mounted to the arm is used to run the executable program but cannot be used to create executable programs or modify executable programs. By way of analogy to video gaming systems, the host computer serves as the platform for writing or modifying a video game and the arm mounted controller serves as the platform for playing a video game. The controller (e.g., player) cannot modify the executable program. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,978,748, this results in a lower cost three dimensional coordinate measurement system by eliminating the need for a host computer for each articulated arm.","A coordinate measurement system application may perform operations against CAD models to compare the actual part being measured to the nominal CAD values. Since CAD models may be generated in numerous formats that are unique from vendor to vendor and sometimes protected by encryption, translation from one format to another is difficult, unreliable, time consuming and\/or costly. The majority of the market is currently dominated by at least six CAD formats. In the normal course of performing operations, CAD data must be translated from its original CAD format to the coordinate measurement system application and stored internally in its disassociated format. This process requires translation of the data. Translation of data often results in certain data imperfections, and may not be possible at all due to translator idiosyncrasies and changes in CAD engine formats. Such a result is undesirable because the translated data may be unreliable and unusable.","This problem has been addressed through the creation of specific coordinate measurement system applications that integrate into the CAD engine. Although this may address the translation issues, it creates a problem because a software provider is forced to serve only the users of the particular CAD engine, or to rely on translators written for the specific CAD engine. In the later instance, the translation problem is again an issue.","There is a need, therefore, for a method and system for a CAD engine independent tool for users of coordinate measurement systems. Such a method and system would render the coordinate measurement system more versatile and readily adaptable to computer-aided manufacturing measurement.","An exemplary embodiment is a system and method for CAD engine independence. The system includes an interface between a coordinate measurement system application and a CAD engine application. The interface is specific to the CAD engine application and allows for a single (e.g., generic) coordinate measurement system application to be interfaced to one or more CAD engines without the dependency of hard coding to a particular CAD engine.","An embodiment for a method and system for CAD engine independence includes software formatted to be independent of a CAD engine. This allows a coordinate measurement system application to be compiled with an OPEN interface. Note that a NON-OPEN interface requires hard coding to a particular CAD engine. Thus, in such a NON-OPEN system, a measurement interface for a different CAD engine would require a different hard code. However, an embodiment having an OPEN interface does not require hard coding to a CAD engine. For example, the OPEN interface measurement application does not require a particular version of a CAD engine to operate. In the OPEN system, an interface may be created between the CAM application and the CAD engine. This allows the coordinate measurement system application to be operated directly on the CAD files. CAD engine independence allows the coordinate measurement system application to operate independently from the CAD engine, so that any CAD engine may be used as the coordinate measurement system application's engine.","Referring to , in one embodiment, the coordinate measurement system application (shown as CAM Measure) may communicate to an intermediary application (referred to herein as CADCOM). Thus, only one version of the coordinate measurement system application is used along with customized CADCOM components that are for individual CAD systems. Thus, only a single code base is designed, developed and maintained. In another embodiment, the coordinate measurement system application may be compiled into an engine, for example, a coordinate measurement system measure engine. In this example, the coordinate measurement system measurement application may interface directly to an ACIS CAD engine without translation, because the engine is compiled from an ACIS toolkit and requires no intermediary application (e.g., CADCOM.dll).","Referring to , when the coordinate measurement system application () is interfaced to a new CAD engine (), the details of the CAD engine's interface () are obtained. This interface () may be specific to each CAD Engine (). Interface requirements () (also referred to herein as open measure interface) are reviewed. While the CAD engine () and its interface () are unique to each implementation of the system for a target CAD engine, coordinate measurement system application () and the open measure interface () remain the same. Next code is created for the intermediary application () (also referred to herein as CADCOM) between the coordinate measurement system application () and the CAD engine ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00021","num":"00021"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["3","1","5","5","3","5","1"]},"As described above, an intermediary application  may be created for each CAD engine format providing the coordinate measurement system application independence from the CAD engine formats. Although a coordinate measurement system application directed to measurement has been described as an exemplary application, it is understood that the intermediary application may be used regardless of the coordinate measurement system function being performed. For example, the coordinate measurement system application may be a reporting function that requires CAD data for providing visual reports of parts and statistical measurements. The intermediary application  would serve to interface the coordinate measurement system reporting application  with the CAD engine  as needed.","The intermediary application  may be created by a programmer creating a translation table of commands in the coordinate measurement system application to commands in the CAD engine format. The coordinate measurement system application  commands that require some action by the CAD engine  are indexed to the appropriate CAD engine  command. When a command is received from the coordinate measurement system application , the appropriate CAD engine  command is retrieved and forwarded to the CAD engine .","Most CAD engines provide an application programming interface (API) that allows other programs to interact with the CAD engine. However, the manner of accessing each API and the commands used vary across CAD engines. This information is contained in each intermediary application  defining an entry point to the CAD engine API. As shown in , the intermediary application  also contains the commands in the coordinate measurement system format and the corresponding command in the CAD engine format. Thus, the intermediary application submits the appropriate CAD engine command to the appropriate CAD engine API based on the coordinate measurement system command.","An exemplary embodiment for functions that may be implemented in the intermediary application  are described below. The function calls from the coordinate measurement system application  to the CAD engine  may be varied. For example, measurement functions request measurement of some feature on a CAD part. Viewing functions request a change in the current view of a CAD part. Construction functions allow for the creation and\/or deletion of CAD elements. Exemplary functions supported by the coordinate measurement system application and the intermediary application are listed below.\n\n","The description applying the above embodiments is merely illustrative. As described above, embodiments in the form of computer-implemented processes and apparatuses for practicing those processes may be included. Also included may be embodiments in the form of computer program code containing instructions embodied in tangible media, such as floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, hard drives, or any other computer-readable storage medium, wherein, when the computer program code is loaded into and executed by a computer, the computer becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention.

When implemented on a general-purpose microprocessor, the computer program code segments configure the microprocessor to create specific logic circuits.","While the invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention.
