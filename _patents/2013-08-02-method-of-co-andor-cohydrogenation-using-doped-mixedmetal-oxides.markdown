In an embodiment, the metal site is a deposited metal and the mixed-metal oxide supports the metal site. The metal site comprises a transition metal, an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, or mixtures thereof, and the mixed-metal oxide comprises a perovskite, a pyrochlore, a fluorite, a brownmillerite, or mixtures thereof. The method of hydrogenation utilizes a reactant gas mixture comprising a carbon oxide such as CO or COand a hydrogen agent such as Hfor the generation of various hydrogenated products, including alcohols, olefins, aldehydes, ketones, esters, oxo-products, and others.","Hydrogenation catalysts which enhance reactions between hydrogen and other compounds are a topic of significant interest. In particular, catalysts for CO\/COhydrogenations into higher oxygenates (C, i.e. ethanol, etc.) are of specific interest. These higher oxygenates are widely used as solvents, intermediates, fuel additives, and neat fuels, and producing these products selectively requires catalysts with specific properties. Typically, major byproducts from CO\/COhydrogenations are single carbon compounds, so a major challenge is the development of catalysts with higher selectivity towards the higher alcohols and oxygenates. There is particular emphasis on high selectivity catalysts for CO\/COhydrogenations acting in environments of CO, CO, and H, such as syngas, which require relatively high stability in the presence of a reducing environment. Generally a variety of catalysts, particularly the Group 6 through 11 metals, have been employed in CO\/COhydrogenations, but in many cases these catalysts generate broad, complex mixtures of hydrocarbons, oxygenated hydrocarbons, and carbon dioxide. Thus, there is a need for CO\/COhydrogenation catalysts that selectively generate higher alcohols\/oxygenated hydrocarbons products.","Certain metals such as Rh have been extensively studied because of their generally high hydrogenation activities. For example, these catalysts have been shown to be the most active and selective for higher alcohol synthesis compared to alternatives based on modified copper, cobalt-molybdenum, or promoted Fischer-Tropsch catalysts. The activity and selectivity of the active metal catalysts can be increased by various factors, such as the presence of promoters, the choice of support, the synthesis method, the use of specific precursors, and other factors. Generally, optimum higher alcohols\/oxygenated hydrocarbons formation requires a balance among the rates of CO dissociation, hydrogenation, and CO insertion. For example, promoters such as rare earth metals, alkali metals, and other transition metals play an important role in these elementary steps. Typically the promoters activate the oxygen atom of an absorbed CO molecule and weaken the C\u2014O bond, leading to CO dissociation followed by a hydrogenation step to form CHspecies. The mechanism for C\u2014C bond formation leading to higher alcohols\/oxygenated hydrocarbons also requires the atomic proximity of an activated, associatively adsorbed CO that can react with the CHspecies. Subsequent hydrogenation of this initial Cintermediate leads to higher alcohols or oxygenated hydrocarbons synthesis. The two sites where one forms CHand the other an activated CO are catalytically distinct, but need to be atomically adjacent. As a result, the hydrogenation of CO to produce Coxygenates such as ethanol is thought to require the atomic proximity of catalytic sites that activate CO in two ways: (i) dissociative adsorption of CO to produce surface carbon that is hydrogenated to form a surface CHspecies and (ii) associative adsorption of CO, which is activated by the catalyst and couples with the CHspecies to form the critical C\u2014C bond.","Catalytic metals have also been substituted into certain crystalline oxides such as perovskites and pyrochlores in an effort to promote selectivity in CO\/COhydrogenations. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,312,955 to Bartley; and see U.S. Pat. No. 4,126,580 to Lauder; and see U.S. Pat. No. 4,863,971 to Broussard et al.; and see Tien-Thao et al., \u201cEffect of alkali additives over nanocrystalline Co\u2014Cu-based perovskites as catalysts for higher-alcohol synthesis,\u201d 245 (2007); and see Tien-Thao et al., \u201cCharacterization and reactivity of nanoscale La(Co,Cu)Operovskite catalyst precursors for CO hydrogenation,\u201d 181 (2008), and see Bourzutschky et al., \u201cConversion of synthesis gas over LaMnCuOperovskite and related copper catalysts,\u201d 124 (1990). Additionally, CO\/COhydrogenation catalysts have involved catalytic metals such as Co, Cu, and Rh supported by various structures such as LaZrO, LaFeO, LaO, TiO, SiO, and AlO. See Kieffer et al., \u201cHydrogenation of CO and COtoward methanol, alcohols and hydrocarbons on promoted copper-rare earth oxides catalysts,\u201d 36 (1997); and see Chu et al., \u201cConversion of syngas to C1-C6 alcohol mixtures on promoted CuLaZrOcatalysts,\u201d 121 (1995); and see Fujiwara et al., \u201cHydrogenation of carbon dioxide over copper-pyrochlore\/zeolite composite catalysts,\u201d 29 (1996); and see Fang et al., \u201cLaFeO3-supported nano Co\u2014Cu catalysts for higher alcohol synthesis from syngas,\u201d 397 (2011); and see Chuang et al., \u201cMechanism of C2+ oxygenate synthesis on Rh catalysts,\u201d 32 (2005). The efforts are generally aimed toward adjustment of the CO dissociation and insertion abilities of the Co, Cu, or Rh through varying promoter and support compositions. Variations in selectivities are typically attributed to the specific properties of the support, the promoter, the morphology of the metal, and the impact of the support on the reducibility of the metal.","Recently, the presence of an atomically adjacent ionic and metallic species (M-M) has been reported to enhance the coupling between undissociated CO and CHand the selective formation of ethanol via ketene (HC\u2550C\u2550O) or acetyl (HC\u2014C\u2550O) intermediates. The higher oxygenated hydrocarbon selectivity is postulated to occur via the formation of a \u201ctilted\u201d CO species in which both the carbon and oxygen atoms are bound to the surface. One way in which these types of sites needed to produce higher alcohols\/oxygenated hydrocarbons can be prepared is to use particular crystalline oxides such as a perovskite, pyrochlore, fluorite, or brownmillerite with particular catalytic metal sites, where catalytic metals are also doped into the perovskite, pyrochlore, fluorite, or brownmillerite and will have the M-Mcoordination. Additionally, such perovskite, pyrochlore, fluorite, and brownmillerite materials allow various metals to be isomorphically substituted into the oxide structures providing, for example, basic sites that act to activate adsorbed CO. Further oxygen conductivity of these materials may enhance the ionic and metallic (M-M) species coordination. This property has also been shown to reduce undesired carbon formation. The use of such crystal oxides with the doped catalytic metal sites also promote a high degree of thermal stability in environments which may be highly reducing. Further, atomically adjacent ionic and metallic species (M-M) can be achieved by depositing the catalytically active metal(s) (M) on the surface of the doped mixed-metal oxides.","Provided here is a method of hydrogenation utilizing a reactant gas mixture comprising a carbon oxide and a hydrogen agent, and a hydrogenation catalyst comprising a mixed-metal oxide with a metal site supported by and\/or incorporated into the lattice. In an embodiment, the metal site is a deposited metal and the mixed-metal oxide supports the metal site.

Contact between the carbon oxide, hydrogen agent, and hydrogenation catalyst under appropriate conditions of temperature, pressure and gas flow rate generate a hydrogenation reaction and produce a hydrogenated product made up of carbon from the carbon oxide and some portion of the hydrogen agent. The carbon oxide may be CO, CO, or mixtures thereof and the hydrogen agent may be H. In a particular embodiment, the hydrogenated product comprises an alcohol, an olefin, an aldehyde, a ketone, an ester, an oxo-product, or mixtures thereof.","These and other objects, aspects, and advantages of the present disclosure will become better understood with reference to the accompanying description and claims.","The method generally entails contacting a reactant gas mixture comprising a carbon oxide and a hydrogen agent with a hydrogenation catalyst, where the hydrogenation catalyst comprises a mixed-metal oxide containing metal sites that can be supported and\/or incorporated into the lattice.

In additional embodiments, the metal site comprises a deposited metal deposited on the mixed-metal oxide and comprises a noble metal.","Contact between the carbon oxide, hydrogen agent, and hydrogenation catalyst generates a hydrogenation reaction and produces a hydrogenated product made up of carbon from the carbon oxide and some portion of the hydrogen agent. In a particular embodiment, the hydrogenated product comprises an alcohol, an olefin, an aldehyde, a ketone, an ester, an oxo-product, or mixtures thereof.","The various mixed-metal oxides described interact with the metal sites to form products from reactant gas mixtures such as syngas with a high degree of selectivity. A feature of the mixed-metal oxides utilized here is the ability to isomorphically substitute into the structure various catalytically active elements that can interact at the surface with clusters of metal atoms. Small clusters of metallic sites in proximity to the mixed-metal oxide-bound atoms promote the formation of bimolecular M\/M structures, providing significant advantage over other structures. Additionally, the ability to provide multiple dopants into the mixed-metal oxides described allow advantageous use of the bifunctional base-hydrogenation catalysts generally used for CO\/COhydrogenations. The basic sites may act to catalyze the condensation reaction by activating adsorbed CO, e.g., by enhancing the formation of the formate intermediate which leads to alcohol formation.","The materials can be processed via a number of synthesis methods including but not limited to solid state diffusion, polymeric precursor method (e.g. Pechini Method), combustion synthesis, co-precipitation, hydrothermal, solgel, citric acid method, chemical vapor deposition, atomic layer deposition, and other means known in the art for synthesis of metal sites with mixed-metal oxides as described herein.","The novel process and principles of operation are further discussed in the following description.","The following description is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to use the invention and sets forth the best mode contemplated by the inventors for carrying out the invention. Various modifications, however, will remain readily apparent to those skilled in the art, since the principles of the present invention are defined herein specifically to provide a method of conducting a hydrogenation process with a carbon oxide, a hydrogen agent, and a hydrogenation catalyst comprising a mixed-metal oxide and metal sites as described herein to produce a hydrogenated product comprising carbon from the carbon oxide and some portion of the hydrogen agent.","The method generally entails contacting a reactant gas mixture comprising a carbon oxide and a hydrogen agent with a hydrogenation catalyst, where the hydrogenation catalyst comprises a mixed-metal oxide containing metal sites supported by and\/or incorporated into the lattice. The mixed-metal oxide comprises a perovskite, a pyrochlore, a fluorite, a brownmillerite, or mixtures thereof, typically doped at an A-site or B-site of the mixed-metal oxide crystal structure. In certain embodiments, the metal sites comprise a deposited metal supported by the mixed-metal oxide, and the deposited metal is a transition metal, an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, or mixtures thereof. Contact between the carbon oxide, hydrogen agent, and hydrogenation catalyst under appropriate conditions of temperature, pressure and gas flow rate generate a hydrogenation reaction and produce a hydrogenated product made up of carbon from the carbon oxide and some portion of the hydrogen agent. The carbon oxide may be CO, CO, or mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, the hydrogen agent is H. In a particular embodiment, the hydrogenated product comprises an alcohol, an olefin, an aldehyde, a ketone, an ester, an oxo-product, or mixtures thereof.","In general embodiments, the mixed-metal oxide is doped with an A-site dopant, a B-site dopant, or a combination of A-site and B-site dopants. The A-site and B-site dopants are present at lattice points of the crystal structure of the mixed-metal oxide, and coordinated with oxygen atoms in the crystal structure of the mixed-metal oxide.

In another embodiment, the metal site comprises a noble metal, and in a further embodiment, the deposited metal comprises a noble metal.","The structure of the various mixed-metal oxides described interacts with the metal sites to form products from reactant gas mixtures such as syngas with a high degree of selectivity. Generally and without being bound by theory, the effectiveness of catalysts based on metals such as Rh for the formation of products such as C and higher oxygenates are greatly improved through interaction with the mixed-metal oxide and atomically adjacent promoters. For example, comparison of Rh supported on a lanthanum zirconate pyrochlore to Rh doped lanthanum zirconate shows that there is a fundamental difference in the selectivity to C oxygenates, leading to higher ethanol and lower methanol selectivity over the Rh simply supported by a Rh-doped lanthanum zirconate pyrochlore. The doped pyrochlore appears to interact with supported Rh atoms to produce significantly more of the unique types of sites needed for the formation of Coxygenates. See e.g., Abdelsayed et al., \u201cSynthesis, characterization, and catalytic activity of Rh-based lanthanum zirconate pyrochlores for higher alcohol synthesis,\u201d 207 (2013).","A feature of the mixed-metal oxides utilized here is the ability to isomorphically substitute into the structure various elements that can interact at the surface with clusters of metal atoms. The properties of the mixed-metal oxide can be used to tailor the degree and type of interaction with an active metal comprising the metal site to catalyze the conversion of syngas to specific end products. Small clusters of metallic sites in proximity to the mixed-metal oxide-bound catalytic metal atoms promote the formation of bimolecular M\/Mstructures, providing significant advantage over other supported metal structures. Additionally, the ability to provide multiple dopants into the mixed-metal oxides described allow advantageous use of the bifunctional base-hydrogenation catalysts generally used for CO\/COhydrogenations. The basic sites may act to catalyze the condensation reaction by activating adsorbed CO, e.g., by enhancing the formation of the formate intermediate which leads to alcohol formation. The perovskite, pyrochlore, fluorite, and brownmillerite materials described here have the ability to incorporate both functionalities by substituting a base at the A-site and hydrogenation catalyst at the B-site","These catalysts, comprising a metal site with a typically doped perovskite, pyrochlore, fluorite, brownmillerite, or mixtures thereof, can be utilized in a variety of forms including but not limited to powders, pellets, foam catalysts, monolithic catalysts, wall-deposited (tubular or planar), deposited fiber, or any other geometric shape catalyst system.

See U.S. Pat. No. 3,330,697 issued to Pechini, issued Jul. 11, 1967. Sources of the metal cations A, A\u2032, B, or B\u2032 include compounds of those cations and mixtures thereof. An exemplary preparation method follows.","Pyrochlore Synthesis:","Metal nitrate precursors and citric acid are dissolved separately into deionized water. The citric acid\/metal molar ratio may be from 1.0-1.5, preferably about 1.2. The aqueous metal salts are then combined into one beaker and stirred. The aqueous citric acid is then added to the combined metal salt solution. This solution is heated to 60-80\u00b0 C., preferably about 70\u00b0 C., with continuous stirring. Ethylene glycol (EG) is then added to the heated solution. The ethylene glycol\/citric acid molar ratio may be from 1.0-4.0, preferably about 1.0. The solution is stirred continuously at the desired temperature for several hours to evaporate the majority of the water and to accelerate polymerization between metal-chelated citric acid and ethylene glycol. A clear viscous gel is obtained, which is further heated at 130\u00b0 C. in a heating mantle until an amorphous polyester-type resin is obtained. The solid material is collected and calcined at 700-1200\u00b0 C., preferably about 1000\u00b0 C., for 4-12 hours, preferably about 8 hours, to breakdown the organic polymer and burns the carbon off leading to a highly crystalline mixed metal oxide.","Rh-Deposited Pyrochlores:","Microwave-assisted chemical reduction method is used to deposit 2 wt % Rh on the surface of either pure or Rh-substituted lanthanum zirconate (LZ)-pyrochlore catalysts (prepared by modified Pechini method mentioned under pyrochlore synthesis). In a typical procedure, rhodium nitrate is dissolved in a 100 ml of a HO:EtOH (1:2) mixture such that the Rh metal content is equivalent to 2 wt % Rh. The LZ powder is dispersed in the above mentioned solution for 3 hours. Next hydrazine monohydrate (500 \u03bcl) is added quickly under vigorous stirring at room temperature. The solution is kept under stirring for another hour before being transferred into a sealed Teflon vessel and placed on a turntable tray of an Anton Paar microwave reaction system (Synthos 3000) equipped with pressure and temperature sensors. The dispersion is microwaved for 5 min under continuous stirring and 800 W of microwave power. After cooling the dispersion, the particles are separated by centrifuge, washed with ethanol, and dried under vacuum at 10Torr for 48 hours. After drying, the Rh-deposited pyrochlore catalyst is calcined at 400-600\u00b0 C., preferably about 500\u00b0 C., in air for 2-5 hours, preferably about 3 hours.","Microwave-assisted chemical reduction method, which is very different from conventional impregnation methods, offers fast and size-controlled particle nucleation and deposition on catalytic supports. Microwave irradiation (MWI) provides a fast dielectric heating to the reaction mixture, due to the difference in the reactant and solvent dielectric constants, leading to enhancement in the reduction rate of Rh nitrate by hydrazine hydrate. A microwave-induced homogeneous nucleation of metal clusters is intended to produce a narrow size distribution of Rh on the catalyst support.","It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the foregoing preparation methods are presented by way of example only. Various alterations, improvements, and modifications to the presented preparation methods are within the scope and spirit of the present disclosure.","Catalyst Testing:","Catalysts synthesized by the exemplary methods are tested for CO hydrogenation to oxygenated hydrocarbons. The catalyst testing took place in a fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor, shown in . Table 1 shows the reaction conditions used in the CO hydrogenation reaction. Mass flow controllers , , and  are used to deliver N, CO, and Hto the system. N(inert) is used as an internal standard to quantify the product stream. Fixed bed  containing the catalyst is positioned in the center of an 19 mm i.d. tubular catalytic reactor section and diluted with quartz sand of the same particle size as the catalyst to minimize temperature gradients and channeling throughout the bed. Heat is supplied via a split tube furnace  encapsulating catalytic reactor . Bed temperature is measured by an axially centered thermocouple  and is controlled by a programmable controller. Reactor pressure is maintained by back pressure regulator  and pressure gauge  provided pressure indications.","Compositions of oxygenated hydrocarbons and olefins in the reactor effluent are analyzed using a gas chromatograph . Then liquid products are condensed out of the gas stream by a sample conditioner . Dry gas stream is sent to a mass spectrometer  to analyze H, CO, CO, and CH. Carbon balances for all experiments are 100\u00b15%.","CO Hydrogenation:","CO hydrogenation results from catalysts prepared by the exemplary methods are presented in Table 2. Methane, methanol, ethanol, and n-propanol values in Table 2 are values taken after 1 hour time on stream during the CO hydrogenation reaction. The main products are methane, methanol, ethanol, and n-propanol. Only trace amounts of other oxygenates such as butanol, acetone, and acetaldehyde are detected, and collectively account for less than 1% selectivity. For lanthanum zirconate, the results show no selectivity for alcohols. Methane and COare the major products observed with lanthanum zirconate catalyst. The absence of oxygenate formation on lanthanum zirconate confirms the essential role that Rh plays as an active catalyst for CO catalytic hydrogenation into alcohols and other oxygenates. For Rh-doped lanthanum zirconate and Rh-supported on lanthanum zirconate, methanol, ethanol, and n-propanol are observed. The product selectivity is calculated based on carbon efficiency and is defined as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"S","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"%"}},{"mn":"100","mo":"\u00d7","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":["n","i"]},{"mi":["c","i"]}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"mi":"\u03a3","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["n","i"]},{"mi":["c","i"]}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}]}}],"mo":"="}}}},"where nand Cis the number of carbon atoms and molar concentration of the iproduct, respectively.","Thus, presented here is a method of hydrogenation where a reactant gas mixture comprising a carbon oxide and a hydrogen agent is contacted with a hydrogenation catalyst, where the hydrogenation catalyst comprises a mixed-metal oxide containing metal sites supported and\/or incorporated into the lattice.
