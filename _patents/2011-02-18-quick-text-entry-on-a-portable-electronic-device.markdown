{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure relates to computing devices, and in particular to a method for quick text entry on a portable electronic device and a portable electronic device configured for the same.","Electronic devices, including portable electronic devices, have gained widespread use and may provide a variety of functions including, for example, telephonic, electronic messaging and other personal information manager (PIM) application functions. Portable electronic devices include, for example, several types of mobile stations such as simple cellular telephones, smart telephones, wireless personal digital assistants (PDAs), and laptop computers with wireless 802.11 or Bluetooth\u2122 capabilities.","Portable electronic devices such as PDAs or smart telephones are generally intended for handheld use and ease of portability. Smaller devices are generally desirable for portability. Smaller devices have smaller displays which cannot display as much information as larger displays. Designing a graphical user interface (GUI) for portable electronic devices such that the appropriate information is displayed or readily available to the user at any given time, and a size which is appropriate for the user, remains an ever-present issue.","To add new data, such as a new contact or other data item, on a portable electronic device typically requires the user to navigate through the GUI to locate the relevant application, launch the application, select a menu option to add the new data, input the data, and store the new or changed data item. This process is time consuming and cumbersome due to the menu navigation. A more efficient method for text entry on a portable electronic device is desirable.","For simplicity and clarity of illustration, reference numerals may be repeated among the figures to indicate corresponding or analogous elements. Numerous details are set forth to provide an understanding of the embodiments described herein. The embodiments may be practiced without these details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, and components have not been described in detail to avoid obscuring the embodiments described. The description is not to be considered as limited to the scope of the embodiments described herein.","The disclosure generally relates to a portable electronic device such as a handheld electronic device. Examples of handheld electronic devices include wireless communication devices such as, for example, pagers, mobile telephones, smartphones, tablets, slate computers, wireless organizers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and so forth. The portable electronic device may also be a handheld electronic device without wireless communication capabilities such as, for example, an electronic gaming device, digital photograph album, digital camera, or other device.","The present disclosure provides a method of text entry on a portable electronic device which avoids, or at least reduces, menu navigation and other processing steps required to add new data on a portable electronic device. In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a method for quick text entry, comprising: displaying a text entry user interface within a graphical user interface, the text entry user interface element including a text entry field; receiving text in the text entry field; storing the text received in text entry field in memory in response to corresponding input.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a portable electronic device comprising: a processor; a display and memory coupled to the processor; wherein the processor is configured for performing the method(s) set forth herein.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a portable electronic device comprising: a display; a processor coupled to the display; wherein the processor is configured for performing the method(s) set forth herein.","In accordance with a further embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a computer program product comprising a computer readable medium having stored thereon computer program instructions for implementing a method on an electronic device, the computer executable instructions comprising instructions for performing the method(s) set forth herein.","A block diagram of an example of a portable electronic device  is shown in . The portable electronic device  includes multiple components, such as a processor  that controls the overall operation of the portable electronic device . Communication functions, including data and voice communications, are performed through a communication subsystem . Data received by the portable electronic device  is decompressed and decrypted by a decoder . The communication subsystem  receives messages from and sends messages to a wireless network . The wireless network  may be any type of wireless network, including, but not limited to, data wireless networks, voice wireless networks, and networks that support both voice and data communications. A power source , such as one or more rechargeable batteries or a port to an external power supply, powers the portable electronic device .","The processor  interacts with other components, such as Random Access Memory (RAM) , memory , a display  (such as a liquid crystal display (LCD)) with a touch-sensitive overlay  operably connected to an electronic controller  that together comprise a touch-sensitive display , a navigation device , one or more auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , a data port , a speaker , a microphone , short-range communications subsystem , and other device subsystems . User-interaction with the GUI is performed through the touch-sensitive overlay . The processor  interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay  via the electronic controller . Information, such as text, characters, symbols, images, icons, and other items that may be displayed or rendered on a portable electronic device , is displayed on the touch-sensitive display  via the processor .","The navigation device  may be a depressible (or clickable) joystick such as a depressible optical joystick, a depressible trackball, a depressible scroll wheel, or a depressible touch-sensitive trackpad or touchpad.  shows the navigation device  in the form of a depressible optical joystick. The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may include other input devices such as a keyboard and\/or keypad (neither of which is not shown). In some embodiments, a conventional a non-touch-sensitive display, such as an LCD screen, may be provided instead of the touch-sensitive display  along with a keyboard and\/or keypad.","The portable electronic device  also comprises a motion detection subsystem (not shown) comprising at least one motion sensor  which is coupled to the processor  and which is controlled by one or a combination of a monitoring circuit and operating software. The motion sensor  has a sensing element which detects acceleration from motion and\/or gravity. The sensor generates and outputs an electrical signal representative of the detected acceleration. Changes in movement of the portable electronic device  results in changes in acceleration which produce corresponding changes in the electrical signal output of the sensor. The motion sensor  may be an accelerometer such as a three-axis accelerometer having three mutual orthogonally sensing axes. The accelerometer detects changes in the acceleration of the portable electronic device . Other types of motion sensors, such as a proximity sensor and\/or gyroscope, may be used by the motion detection subsystem in addition to, or instead of, the accelerometer.","Changes in acceleration, proximity and orientation detected by the accelerometer, proximity sensor and\/or gyroscope may be interpreted by the portable electronic device  as motion of the portable electronic device . When the changes in acceleration, proximity and orientation are within threshold tolerance(s) of regularity or predictability, when the changes in acceleration, proximity and orientation match predetermined motion criteria (e.g., stored in the memory ), the changes may be interpreted by the portable electronic device  as a pattern of motion. Multiple patterns of motion may be recognized by the portable electronic device .","To identify a subscriber for network access, the portable electronic device  uses a Subscriber Identity Module or a Removable User Identity Module (SIM\/RUIM) card  for communication with a network, such as the wireless network . Alternatively, user identification information may be programmed into memory .","The portable electronic device  includes an operating system  and software applications or programs  that are executed by the processor  and are typically stored in a persistent, updatable store such as the memory . Additional applications or programs  may be loaded onto the portable electronic device  through the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the data port , the short-range communications subsystem  or any other suitable subsystem . The applications  may include, but are not limited to, any one or combination of the following: a contacts application (also known as an electronic address book), a calendar application for scheduling appointments, a browser for browsing Web content or other content, a calculator, an email application for email messaging, an instant messaging (IM) application for instant messaging, a text messaging application for text messaging such as SMS (Short Message Service) or Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) messaging, a device-to-device messaging application (sometimes known as PIN (personal identification number) messaging application), a phone application, task application or notepad application. A PIM application which integrates some of the above applications, such as the messaging applications, calendar applications, task and notepad applications, may be provided instead of individual applications in some embodiments.","The memory  also includes a text entry control , a number of databases  each containing data objects of the same type, each associated with the same application  or both, and a parsing function , the functions of which are described more fully below. The text entry control  and parsing function  may each be part of the operating system  or may be separate applications . The text entry control  provides a text entry user interface on the display  for user interaction. The GUI, which may be part of the operating system , generates user interface screens comprising user elements and displays the user interface screens on the display in response to instructions from the operating system  and applications .","A received signal such as a text message, an e-mail message, or web page download is processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the processor . The processor  processes the received signal for output to the display  and\/or to the auxiliary I\/O subsystem . A subscriber may generate data items, for example e-mail messages, which may be transmitted over the wireless network  through the communication subsystem . For voice communications, the overall operation of the portable electronic device  is similar. The speaker  outputs audible information converted from electrical signals, and the microphone  converts audible information into electrical signals for processing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","200","118","118","100","118","100","100"]},"The touch-sensitive display  may be any suitable touch-sensitive display, such as a capacitive, resistive, infrared, surface acoustic wave (SAW) touch-sensitive display, strain gauge, optical imaging, dispersive signal technology, acoustic pulse recognition, and so forth, as known in the art. A capacitive touch-sensitive display includes a capacitive touch-sensitive overlay . The overlay  may be an assembly of multiple layers in a stack including, for example, a substrate, a ground shield layer, a barrier layer, one or more capacitive touch sensor layers separated by a substrate or other barrier, and a cover. The capacitive touch sensor layers may be any suitable material, such as patterned indium tin oxide (ITO).","One or more touches, also known as touch contacts or touch events, may be detected by the touch-sensitive display . The processor  may determine attributes of the touch, including a location of a touch. Touch location data may include an area of contact or a single point of contact, such as a point at or near a centre of the area of contact. The location of a detected touch may include x and y components, e.g., horizontal and vertical components, respectively, with respect to one's view of the touch-sensitive display . For example, the x location component may be determined by a signal generated from one touch sensor, and the y location component may be determined by a signal generated from another touch sensor. A signal is provided to the controller  in response to detection of a touch. A touch may be detected from any suitable object, such as a finger, thumb, appendage, or other items, for example, a stylus, pen, or other pointer, depending on the nature of the touch-sensitive display . Multiple simultaneous touches may be detected. The centre of the area of contact of each touch is commonly referred to as the touch point or centroid. It will be appreciated that during a touch event the touch point moves as the object detected by the touch-sensitive display  moves.","The actuator(s)  may be depressed by applying sufficient force to the touch-sensitive display  to overcome the actuation force of the actuator . The actuator  may be actuated by pressing anywhere on the touch-sensitive display . The actuator  may provide input to the processor  when actuated. Actuation of the actuator  may result in provision of tactile feedback.","The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  could include other input devices such as one or more control keys, a keyboard or keypad, navigation device, or any combination thereof. The navigation device may be a depressible\/clickable trackball, a depressible\/clickable scroll wheel, a touch-sensitive optical trackpad, or a touch-sensitive touchpad.","A flowchart illustrating one example embodiment of a method  for text entry on a portable electronic device is shown in . The method  may be carried out by software executed, for example, by the processor . Coding of software for carrying out such a method  is within the scope of a person of ordinary skill in the art provided the present disclosure. The method  may contain additional or fewer processes than shown and\/or described, and may be performed in a different order. Computer-readable code executable by at least one processor  of the portable electronic device  to perform the method  may be stored in a computer-readable medium such as the memory .","The portable electronic device  displays a text entry user interface on the display  () for user interaction. The text entry user interface includes a text entry field which may be populated with text by a user. Text input in the text entry field is processed by the text entry control . The text entry user interface is an element of the GUI of the portable electronic device  which allows text to be quickly entered and stored on the portable electronic device . The text entry user interface may be a widget in some embodiments. A widget is a GUI building-block which, when called by an application  or the operating system , processes and manages available interactions with the particular type of data or information. A text entry widget provides a single interaction point for quick text entry for a number of applications . Typically, all applications  on the portable electronic device  which allow for quick text entry may utilize a shared widget and invoke the same widget. The text entry user interface may be a permanent part of the home screen of the portable electronic device , or may be invoked and closed on demand.","In some embodiments, the text entry user interface may be invoked at any time when any application  is active on the portable electronic device . The text entry user interface may be invoked in response to designated input such as, for example, a designated button or designated key in a keyboard (e.g., a \u201chot key\u201d), a designated touch gesture, a touching a designated onscreen item, a designated motion gesture or other suitable input. The text entry user interface may, in some embodiments, be invoked when the home screen is displayed on the display  by starting to type any text using a keyboard of the portable electronic device , or possibly a virtual keyboard of the portable electronic device .","The processor  causes the text entry user interface to be displayed on the display  in response to detecting the designated input when the text entry user interface is not currently displayed. Conversely, the processor  causes the text entry user interface to be hidden in response to detecting the designated input when the text entry user interface is currently displayed. The designated input acts as a display\/hide toggle for the text entry user interface. When the text entry user interface is displayed, the text entry user interface is typically a pop-up or overlay user interface which overlays the current user interface screen which was displayed on the display  when the text entry user interface was invoked.","Alternatively, when the text entry user interface is part of the home screen, invoking the text entry user interface causes the home screen to be displayed and the text entry user interface to become the active element of the GUI of the portable electronic device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","402","402","162","400","410","100","410","100","410","148","100"]},"The text entry user interface  occupies only a portion of a display area of the display . The text entry user interface  may be located anywhere on the display  and may be of varying size. Typically, the text entry user interface  is located for convenient navigation, for example, by corresponding input via the touch-sensitive display  or navigation device . The text entry user interface  is provided along with other content of the home screen  such as a status bar  and icon menu . The status bar  displays information such as the current date and time, icon-based notifications, device status and\/or device state. The icon menu  displays a plurality of icons  (only one of which is labelled in ).","The GUI elements on the home screen , such as the icons , are each selectable to cause an associated action be performed. The action may be, for example, launching an associated command, function, application  or menu, or opening an associated folder. The icons  may be used, for example, to select the contacts application, email application, calendar application, notepad application, or other application . A user may select a GUI element, such as an application  to be launched, by highlighting or focusing the GUI element, such as an icon  associated with the respective application , by touching the touch-sensitive display  at a location corresponding to the GUI element, or by moving an onscreen position indicator, commonly referred to as a caret, cursor or focus, using the navigation device  to the location corresponding to the GUI element.","Double tapping the touch-sensitive display  at the location corresponding to the GUI element (e.g., icon ), or clicking on or depressing the navigation device  when the GUI element (e.g., icon ) is highlighted or focussed by the onscreen position indicator causes the action logically associated with the GUI element to be performed. If the GUI element (e.g., icon ) represents an application , the processor  causes the application  logically associated with the icon  to be launched, for example, the email application.","Referring again to , the text entry field  of the text entry user interface  receives text in the form of an input string of one or more characters (), such as alphanumerical characters and symbol characters. The text entry user interface  is caused to be the active GUI element before any text will be received by the text entry field . Invoking the text entry user interface  automatically causes the text entry user interface  to be the active GUI element without further input. Otherwise, when the text entry user interface  is part of the home screen , designated input selecting the text entry user interface  causes the text entry user interface  to be the active GUI element. The text entry user interface  may be selected by highlighting or focusing the text entry user interface  by touching the touch-sensitive display  at a location corresponding to the text entry user interface , or by moving the onscreen position indicator to the location corresponding to the text entry user interface . When the text entry user interface  is the active GUI element, a cursor is located within the text entry field . The cursor  is an onscreen indicator used to navigate between character positions within the text entry field  and delete characters in response to backspace input from a corresponding key of a mechanical or onscreen keyboard.","Alternatively, when the text entry user interface  is a permanent aspect of the home screen  the text entry user interface  may be set as the active GUI element by default such that, any key input from a keyboard of the portable electronic device  while the home screen  is displayed on the display  is automatically input into the text entry field . When the portable electronic device  has a touch-sensitive display  but no keyboard, or the keyboard is hidden (e.g., when the keyboard is a slider-style keyboard) or otherwise inactive or inaccessible, any input received via an onscreen (\u201cvirtual\u201d) keyboard invoked on the touch-sensitive display  while the home screen  is displayed on the display  is automatically input into the text entry field . The default setting by which the text entry user interface  is set as the active GUI element may be changed via designated input.","The portable electronic device  monitors for and detects designated input to store (e.g., \u201cSave\u201d) the text received in the text entry field  (block ). The designated input to store the received text may be a hot key, a designated touch gesture, a touching a designated onscreen item, a designated motion gesture, or other suitable input. The input may be, for example, pressing the \u201cENTER\u201d key of a keyboard of the portable electronic device .  illustrates another example of a text entry user interface  for quick text entry. The text entry user interface  includes a \u201cSave\u201d button  next to the text entry field . Double tapping the touch-sensitive display  at the location corresponding to the \u201cSave\u201d button , or clicking on or depressing the navigation device  when the \u201cSave\u201d button  is highlighted or focussed by the onscreen position indicator causes the text received in the text entry field  to be stored in the memory  of the portable electronic device .","The text received in the text entry field  is stored as a data object of a predetermined type (e.g., format) in correspondence an application  associated with the received text and optionally the content of the received text. For example, the received text may be stored as an appointment or other calendar object accessible by a calendar application on the portable electronic device , or a note or memo object accessible by a notepad or memo application on the portable electronic device . The associated application  may be a predetermined or dynamically determined in accordance with user input or the content of the received text, as described more fully below.","The text entry control  interacts with the operating system , applications , databases  and parsing function  using a number of application programming interfaces (APIs). The text entry control  can interact with the operating system , databases  and parsing function  and at least some of the other applications , possibly all of the other applications , using the APIs. The APIs may be used by the text entry control  to determine the data type, data structure (e.g., format), naming conventions and location of database(s) associated with the applications , among other uses. The APIs may include specifications for routines, data structures, data object classes and protocols.","APIs may be provided for each data type supported by the text entry control . For example, APIs may be provided to generate contacts, appointments, memos, tasks, emails, text messages, instant messages (IMs), etc. The data stored on the portable electronic device  may be organized, at least partially, into a number of databases  () each containing data objects of the same type, each associated with the same application , or both. For example, data objects such as contacts, appointments, memos, tasks, emails, text messages and IMs may be stored in individual databases within the memory . The application(s)  associated with each database  is stored, for example in a data table, and accessible to the text entry control  and other applications . The databases  act as data stores for data objects associated by type and application , and do not necessarily have any formal organizational structure. The particular databases  resident on the portable electronic device  depends on the particular applications  and capabilities of the portable electronic device . The text entry control , using the APIs of the respective applications , can generate and store data objects such as contacts, appointments, memos, tasks, emails, text messages and IMs, among other data objects.","Referring again to , a new data object is generated and stored in the memory  of the portable electronic device  for the received text in response to the designated input to store (). An example method  for generating and storing a data object is shown in . The method  may be carried out by software executed, for example, by the processor . Coding of software for carrying out such a method  is within the scope of a person of ordinary skill in the art given the present disclosure. The method  may contain additional or fewer processes than shown and\/or described, and may be performed in a different order. Computer-readable code executable by at least one processor  of the mobile terminal  to perform the method  may be stored in a computer-readable medium such as the memory .","The text received in the text entry field  of the text entry user interface is parsed using a parsing function , which parses the received text using one or more parsing techniques such as, for example, top-down or bottom-up parsing techniques (). The first step of the parsing process is lexical analysis (or token generation). Lexical analysis is performed by a program called a lexer which separates the received text into a series of string sequences (called tokens) using a set of rules defined by the lexer. Each string sequence is a language object such as a word, word fragment or symbol. A word fragment is a short string of characters, for example one to three characters in length, which represent parts or words, abbreviations or acronyms. The rules are usually called regular expressions and define the set of possible character sequences that are used to form individual tokens. Delimiter inputs, such as space characters, are also defined by a regular expression and influences the recognition of other tokens but does not itself define a token.","Different rules may be applied depending on the associated application , the type of data object, or both. For example, rules defining data fields of each data object may be defined and applied to more accurately parse the received text. For example, when the data type is a contact or the associated application  is the contacts application, the parsing function may identify a 10-character string of numbers as a phone number, and may identify a string of alphabetic characters of any length (though there may be a maximum number of characters) as a contact name.","The next step is syntactic analysis (or syntactic parsing) which checks the token sequence to determine if it forms an allowable expression. This is usually done with reference to a context-free grammar which recursively defines elements which can make up an expression and an order in which the elements must appear in the token sequence to form an allowable expression. When the token sequence does not form an allowable expression, the token sequence is reformulated as allowable expression. When the token sequence forms an allowable expression, the token sequence proceeds to the final step of the parsing process.","The final step is semantic parsing (or semantic analysis) which determines how the token sequence is to be used by the associated application  and adds any required semantic information, for example, relating to the type of data object to be generated. The semantic information may also relate to data types of the tokens to be added which will form part of the data object.","Next, a new data object is generated, typically in RAM . The type of data object is determined in accordance with the associated application  and optionally the parsed text (). The data object may be, but is not limited to, a contact, appointment, memo, task, email, text message, or IM. A default data type may be defined for each associated application , which may be changed by the user. The default data type may be override in favour of a specific data type based on the content of the received text, or possibly other input.","The parsed may be analysed to determine the associated application , data object, or both based on characteristics of the parsed text. For example, if the received text is parsed and a string of ten numbers is identified within the received text, the text entry control  may determine that the associated application is the contacts application and the data object to be generate is a new contact record, and then proceeds to generate that new contact record. Alternatively, if the received text is parsed and a string comprised only of alphabetic characters is identified within the received text, the text entry control  may determine that the associated application  is the notepad application and the data object to be generated is a new note, and then proceeds to generate that new note. Alternatively, the data object may be generated before parsing the received text in which case the content of the received text is not used in determining the type of data object.","Next, the new data object is populated in accordance with the parsed text. The data object may have a particular structure or schema () which may include one or more data fields. The portable electronic device  uses the parsed text to populate the data fields of the new data object.","Next, the populated data object is stored in the memory  of the portable electronic device , for example in an appropriate database  in accordance with the data object type, associated application  or both (). The data objects, once stored in memory , may be viewed and\/or edited at a later time using the associated application . The method  for generated and storing a data object is typically performed without any changes to the GUT of the portable electronic device .","Table 1, shown below, provides examples of how text received by the text entry control  may be parsed to generate different data objects for different applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Example Received Text"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Text received in",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"the \u2018text entry",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"field\u2019","Application","Populate data object"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","Hank5195551234","Contacts","Name: Hank"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Phone Number: (519) 555-1234"]},{"entry":["2","5195551234","Contacts","Name: New Unknown"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"[Timestamp]"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Phone Number: (519) 555-1234"]},{"entry":["3","Gym530am","Calendar","Subject: Gym"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Start: 5:30 AM"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Duration: [default]"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Reminder: [default]"]},{"entry":["4","Buy coffee","Notepad","Title: Buy coffee"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Contents: [empty]"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"In the first example, the text \u2018Hank5195551234\u2019 is received in the text entry field . In this example the associated application  is the contacts application so a new contact record is generated. Because the associated application  is the contacts application, the parsing function  parses the received text in accordance with rules for the contact data type. The received text is a string of four letters followed by ten numbers which the parsing function  identifies as two string sequences, \u2018Hank\u2019 and \u20185195551234\u2019, which are determined to be a name and a phone number. The processor  then populates the \u2018Name\u2019 field with the text \u2018Hank\u2019 and populates the \u2018Phone Number\u2019 field with the text \u20185195551234\u2019.

In this example the associated application  is the calendar application and the type of data object is a calendar data object. The calendar data object includes the fields \u2018Subject\u2019, \u2018Start\u2019, \u2018Duration\u2019 and \u2018Reminder\u2019. Because the associated application  is the calendar application, the parsing function  parses the received text in accordance with rules for the calendar data type.","The parsing function  parses the received text into the two text strings \u2018Gym\u2019 and \u20185:30am\u2019 which the parsing function  identifies as a subject for the \u2018Subject\u2019 field and a start time for a \u2018Start\u2019 field, and populates the \u2018Subject\u2019 field with the text \u2018Gym\u2019 and the \u2018Start\u2019 field with the text \u20185:30am\u2019. The value of the other fields of the calendar data type may be populated with default values or may be populated with automatically determined (e.g., calculated) values. For example, the value of the \u2018Duration\u2019 field and \u2018Reminder\u2019 field may be set to default values. A \u2018Date\u2019 field or subfield of the calendar data type may be automatically determined. For example, the value of the \u2018Date\u2019 field may be set to the current day or the next day (for example, if the start time for the current day is in the past). The text received in the text entry field  may be sufficiently defined so that each of the \u2018Subject\u2019, \u2018Start\u2019, \u2018Duration\u2019 and \u2018Reminder\u2019 fields are defined and populated with text from the received text rather than default values or calculated values.","In the fourth example, the text \u2018Buy coffee\u2019 is received in the text entry field . In this example the associated application  is the notepad application so a new \u2018Note\u2019 data object is generated. The \u2018Note\u2019 data object includes the fields \u2018Title\u2019 and \u2018Contents\u2019. Because the associated application  is the notepad application, the parsing function  parses the received text in accordance with rules for the \u2018Note\u2019 data type. The parsing function  may identify the first text string as the text for \u2018Title\u2019 field and may identify the second text string as the text for the \u2018Content\u2019 field. In this example, the text \u2018Buy coffee\u2019 may be populated in the \u2018Title\u2019 field and the \u2018contents\u2019 field is left empty. Alternatively, both the \u2018Title\u2019 field and the \u2018Content\u2019 field may be populated with the text \u2018Buy coffee\u2019.","The data objects described above are merely examples. Other data objects may be used and the data objects described herein may have different data fields than those specified above. Similarly, the parsing function  may parse the received text differently than as described in the above examples.","A reminder event may be generated after the newly generated data object is stored in the memory , for example, to display reminder notification to remind the user to review and\/or complete the newly generated data object at a later time. In some embodiments, the text entry control  may analyze the populated data object to determine whether any data fields in the newly generated data object is empty, and generate a reminder event when the text entry control  determines that a data field in the data object is empty. The reminder event may be generated when the data object is incomplete. The data object may be considered incomplete when one or more predetermined fields are empty (e.g., fields required to properly define the data object), or if any field is empty depending on the embodiment. The reminder generates a reminder notification including a reminder message to be displayed on the display at a specified time. The specified time (e.g., start time) may be automatically determined as a predetermined time the next day (e.g., 8 am the day after the newly generated data object was generated) or a time which is a predetermined duration (e.g., 24 hours) from the time at which the newly generated data object was generated and stored.","The content of the reminder message may be fixed, or may be dynamically determined when the reminder event is generated using content from the newly generated data object, e.g. \u201cReview (or Complete) \u2018Gym530am\u2019 appointment\u201d from example 3 described above. The reminder notification may include a link to the newly generated data object which requires review and\/or completion. Selecting the link causes the newly generated data object to be opened within an \u2018Edit\u2019 user interface (not shown) for editing the newly generated data object which is displayed on the display .","The \u2018Edit\u2019 user interface allows the user to edit the content of the newly generated data object. For example, the user may edit the default values or automatically determined values populated into the data object. For example, the user may change the value of the \u2018Date\u2019 field of a calendar data object from an automatically determined value (e.g., the current day or next day) to a particular date. An option to save and store any changes to the newly generated data object or cancel and disregard any changes to the newly generated data object may be provided by the \u2018Edit\u2019 user interface, after which the \u2018Edit\u2019 user interface is terminated and the \u2018Edit\u2019 user interface removed from the display .","The reminder event may be associated with a task in a task application, or an appointment in the calendar application. The reminder event may only be generated for designated applications such as, for example, the contacts or calendar applications. Device settings may allow the user to enable and\/disable the use of reminder events, specify the applications  for which reminder events are to be generated and\/or specify the conditions in which reminder events are to be generated.","At the start time of the reminder event, the reminder notification is displayed on the display . The reminder notification may include an option to \u201cDismiss\u201d the reminder notification or \u201cSnooze\u201d the reminder notification for a duration of time (the Snooze duration), which may be configurable by the user at the time of the selecting. Dismissing the reminder notification permanently cancels the reminder notification, causing it to be removed from the display . Snoozing the reminder notification temporarily cancels the reminder notification, causing it to be removed from the display , and changing the start time of the reminder event such that it reoccurs at a later time in accordance with the Snooze duration.","Methods for determining the associated application  will now be described. The associated application  may be a predetermined application, may be dynamically determined in accordance with user input or may be dynamically determined in accordance with the content of the received text as described above. A predetermined application may be a default application such as, for example, the notepad application. Device settings may allow the user to change the default application.","Raw text entries received in the text entry field  may be stored in the notepad application (or other designated text processing application.) in addition to being stored in a data object readable by an associated application . Within the notepad application, raw, unparsed text entries may be stored in a single note or in separate notes depending on the embodiment. This provides a repository for all text entries via the text entry control  and may be useful, for example, if the user cannot remember which application  the text entry was sent to and the data object was generated in.","Selection of a particular input from a number of selectable onscreen inputs displayed on the display  in response to input to store the received text may provide the input for selecting an associated application . Each selectable onscreen input is mapped to a different application  on the portable electronic device . The received text will be stored to the application corresponding to the selected onscreen input. The onscreen inputs may be selected using any suitable input.  show a series of user interface screens used in selecting an associated application during quick text entry in accordance with one example embodiment of the present disclosure. In , the text string \u2018Susan930p\u2019 is input in the text entry field  of a text entry user interface  displayed on the display . When the \u201cSave\u201d button  is activated, or other designated input to store is received, an \u2018Application Selection\u2019 user interface window  is generated and displayed on the display .","In the shown example, the \u2018Application Selection\u2019 user interface window  displays a prompt with the text \u201cSend \u2018Susan930p\u2019 to:\u201d along with selectable onscreen inputs, such as selectable onscreen buttons , and . The content of the prompt may vary between embodiments. The onscreen buttons , , are mapped to the contacts, calendar and notepad applications respectively. In the shown example, the onscreen buttons , , are located below the prompt but may be located elsewhere. In response to input selecting one of the onscreen buttons, the portable electronic device  stores the text string \u2018Susan930p\u2019 in accordance with the application  mapped to the selected onscreen button. Double tapping the touch-sensitive display  at the location corresponding to a particular onscreen button, or clicking on or depressing the navigation device  when the particular onscreen button is highlighted or focussed by the onscreen position indicator causes the received text in the text entry field  to be stored in the memory  of the portable electronic device  as a data object associated with the application  mapped to the particular onscreen button (e.g., as a data object of the type associated with the application  mapped to the particular onscreen button). For example, in response to selecting the \u2018Calendar\u2019 button , the portable electronic device  will store the text string \u2018Susan930p\u2019 as a new calendar object associated with the calendar application.","The input may be selection of a particular input from a number of selectable onscreen inputs in the text entry user interface  itself.
