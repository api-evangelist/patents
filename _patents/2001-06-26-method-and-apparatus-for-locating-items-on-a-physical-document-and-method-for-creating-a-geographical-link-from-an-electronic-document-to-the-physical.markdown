title: Method and apparatus for locating items on a physical document and method for creating a geographical link from an electronic document to the physical document
abstract: A method and apparatus for locating items on a physical document and a method for creating a geographical link from an electronic document to the physical document. The geographical link is created by encoding, in a geographic link to the physical document, geographic coordinates of a referenced item in the electronic document. The electronic document is not derived from the physical document. Locating items on the physical document includes calibrating an opto-touch foil that is aligned on the physical document, including processing a calibration location included in locations appearing in the physical document and referred to in the electronic document. For each location, foil coordinates of the opto-touch foil corresponding to where each location appears in the physical document are computed utilizing geographic coordinates of each location and a generated calibration relationship between the geographic coordinates of the calibration location and calibration foil coordinates of the opto-touch foil.

In a preferred embodiment, the present invention discloses a method and system for highlighting on a paper map the geographic position of places referenced in a Web page.","The Internet is a global network of computers and computers networks (the \u201cNet\u201d). The Internet connects computers that use a variety of different operating systems or languages, including UNIX, DOS, Windows, Macintosh, and others. To facilitate and allow the communication among these various systems and languages, the Internet uses a language referred to as TCP\/IP (\u201cTransmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol\u201d). TCP\/IP protocol supports three basic applications on the Internet:\n\n","With the increasing size and complexity of the Internet, tools have been developed to help find information on the network, often called navigators or navigation systems. Navigation systems that have been developed include standards such as Archie, Gopher and WAIS. The World Wide Web (\u201cWWW\u201d or \u201cthe Web\u201d) is a recent superior navigation system. The Web is:\n\n","The Web seamlessly integrates the format of information, including still images, text, audio and video. A user on the Web using a graphical user interface (\u201cGUI\u201d, pronounced \u201cgooey\u201d) may transparently communicate with different host computers on the system, different system applications (including FTP and Telnet), and different information formats for files and documents including, for example, text, sound and graphics.","The Web uses hypertext and hypermedia. Hypertext is a subset of hypermedia and refers to computer-based \u201cdocuments\u201d in which readers move from one place to another in a document, or to another document, in a non-linear manner. To do this, the Web uses a client-server architecture. The Web servers enable the user to access hypertext and hypermedia information through the Web and the user's computer. (The user's computer is referred to as a client computer of the Web Server computers.) The clients send requests to the Web Servers, which react, search and respond. The Web allows client application software to request and receive hypermedia documents (including formatted text, audio, video and graphics) with hypertext link capabilities to other hypermedia documents, from a Web file server.","The Web, then, can be viewed as a collection of document files residing on Web host computers that are interconnected by hyperlinks using networking protocols, forming a virtual \u201cweb\u201d that spans the Internet.","A resource of the Internet is unambiguously identified by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which is a pointer to a particular resource at a particular location. A URL specifies the protocol used to access a server (e.g.: HTTP, FTP, and so forth), the name of the server, and the location of a file on that server.","Each Web page may appear as a complex document that integrates, for example, text, images, sounds and animation. Each such page may also contain hyperlinks to other Web documents so that a user at a client computer using a mouse may click on icons and may activate hyperlink jumps to new pages (which are graphical representations of other document files) on the same or a different Web server.","A Web server is a software program on a Web host computer that answers requests from Web clients, typically over the Internet. All Web servers use a language or protocol to communicate with Web clients which is called Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (\u201cHTTP\u201d). All types of data can be exchanged among Web servers and clients using this protocol, including Hyper Text Markup Language (\u201cHTML\u201d), graphics, sound and video. HTML describes the layout, contents and hyperlinks of the documents and pages.","When browsing, web clients convert user specified commands into HTTP GET requests, connect to the appropriate Web server to get information, and wait for a response. The response from the server can be the requested document or an error message.","After the document or an error message is returned, the connection between the Web client and the Web server is closed.","The first version of HTTP was a stateless protocol. That is, there was no continuous connection between each client and each server. The Web client using HTTP received a response in the form of HTML data or other data. This description applies to version 1.0 of HTTP protocol, while the new version 1.1 breaks this barrier of stateless protocol by keeping the connection between the server and client alive under certain conditions.","After receipt, the Web client formats and presents the data or activates an ancillary application such a sound player to present the data. To do this, the server or the client determines the various types of data received. The Web Client is also referred to as the Web Browser, since it in fact browses documents retrieved from the Web Server.","During the last years, due mainly to the widespread use of personal computers and the universal access of millions of users to the World Wide Web, \u201cmultimedia publishing\u201d has veritably exploded. On one hand, due to the widespread penetration of CD-ROM drives, an enormous number of multimedia titles combining text, images and sounds, are now accessible to owners of personal computers. On the other hand, a great deal of hypermedia information is today accessible via the Internet on the World Wide Web.","A study of the need for information shows a common thread. For a variety of reasons, people often require to be rapidly and easily informed about their environments. They want to have information about the resources or services located in the different regions of the world, in rural, industrial or urban areas. This common need was recognized long ago by Geographic Information Systems (GIS) providers, cartographic information providers and, more recently, by most of the Internet information providers (e.g., Netscape Local Channel on http:\/\/www.netscape.com\/local\/index.html). These institutions and many others (e.g.: travel agencies, government agencies, local authorities, etc.) today provide geographic and cartographic information in the Web by means of several services. Basically, these services enable the user to access, browse or download many different types of digitized maps covering practically all regions of the world. Recently, due mainly to the widespread use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and in-vehicle computerized navigation systems, and to the universal access of millions of users to the World Wide Web, the field of \u201cdigital map publishing\u201d has veritably exploded. Due to the widespread penetration of CD-ROM drives, many geographic and cartographic titles are now available to owners of personal computers. Because Internet users can access GIS applications from their browsers without purchasing proprietary GIS software, WebGIS has the potential to make Distributed Geographic Information (DGI) available to a large, worldwide audience. Today WebGIS makes possible to add GIS functionality to a wide range of network-based applications in business, government, and education. Due to this rapid evolution, a great deal of cartographic content is today accessible via the Internet, particularly the World Wide Web.","Even though electronic digital maps may be accessed and retrieved throughout the Web by any Internet device (e.g., by a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) or WAP enabled smart phone), some drawbacks persist. The retrieval, storage and display of high resolution digital maps require high communication bandwidth, a large memory, and a high graphic resolution. The wireless mobile environment, wherein small, economic, lightweight hand-held devices are commonly used (such as cell phones and Personal Digital Assistants), imposes some constraints for transferring, storing, displaying and manipulating in a Web Browser large image files such as high resolution digital maps. Today, however practically all wireless devices are small and are, limited by communication speed, storage capacity, display area, and energy consumption.","To overcome these limitations, several technologies are emerging. These technologies are intended to provide Internet service providers, telecommunications carriers, and Internet-based businesses a way of offering Web content (originally intended to be displayed on PCs and laptops) to users of wireless devices. For example, IBM's WebSphere Transcoding Publisher:\n\n","Even though the public's enthusiasm for new computer-based multimedia services has been seen by many analysts as a threat to the conventional forms of hard-copy publishing, particularly book publishing, experience teaches that reading a book cannot be compared with reading an electronic medium. In fact, people are very skilled at browsing through paper catalogs, magazines, newspapers, maps and books by flipping through the pages and glancing at pictures and text. Today, reading a paper copy is preferred by most people, whether they are familiar with computers or not. A Publication entitled \u201cThe Last Book\u201d, (, Vol 36, No. 3 Vol 36, No. 3-1997, by J. Jacobson, B. Comiskey, C. Turner, J. Albert, and P. Tsao of the MIT Media Laboratory), clearly illustrates the differences between printed books and computer screens in the following terms:\n\n","The same arguments concerning the friendliness and usefulness of hard-copy books are applicable to hard-copy geographic maps. To locate one or several places, a collection of printed color maps can be much more easily and quickly browsed than a sequence of digital maps screens.","Paper maps have a number of useful advantages over portable electronic displays:\n\n","Thus, even though the enthusiasm of the public for computer-based digital mapping may be seen as a threat to conventional paper maps, reality is that for many people, in real and practical circumstances, the friendliness, usefulness and availability of paper maps cannot be reproduced today with electronic maps. The use of paper maps remains preferable for most people, whether they are skilled or not in using computers.","Nevertheless, touching directly the objects we have around us is one of the simplest, most instinctive, and universal human actions, and finger pointing and touching are the most natural forms of human\/machine interface. The action of touching is so simple and natural that navigating by means of touch screens requires no training and no learning. In fact the pervasiveness, robustness, and versatility of the \u201ctouch technology\u201d is transforming the way people are living, working, learning, and playing.","\u201cTouch technology\u201d is successfully used in many different applications.","In industrial environments, environmentally-robust touch screens are increasing productivity under hazardous and hostile conditions that would destroy a standard Personal Computer and keyboard.","In hospitals, touch input helps doctors to prescribe medications to patients faster by allowing handwritten prescriptions.","In retail locations, interactive, through-the-window displays let customers shop whenever they want, even when a store is closed.","In mobile and consumer devices, touch and stylus input is a widely accepted input method.","At tourist destinations, user-friendly kiosks are a cost-effective way to help travelers get information and make reservations.","Two main advantages of touching are its simplicity and versatility. Touching with the fingertip is the simplest and most intuitive form of pointing and selecting an item. Touching is particularly adapted to applications where the use of a keyboard, a mouse, or an optical pencil or stylus is not practical or is not well adapted to the user's service or comfort.","Traditionally, a touch panel is integrated into the computer display. The touch panel and the display form a combination called a \u201ctouch screen\u201d. The input device is integrated into the monitor, so no space is wasted, and the interaction of the user with the system is made easier. The system guides the user by showing different choices in the form of icons displayed on the screen. When the user touches the icon of choice, the associated action is executed.","In conclusion, there is a real need to provide a system and method for enriching the static information provided by conventional paper documents, maps and drawings.","There is a need to locate on physical documents, items referenced in electronic documents while accessing through the Web hyperlinked information (mostly textual) related to these items.","There is a need to provide mobile users with additional information directly accessible from hard-copy documents and more particularly to illuminate on paper maps, places referenced on Web pages.","There is a need to display information on physical documents while keeping intact the integrity of these physical documents.","None of the methods described in the prior art discloses a method or system that would enable a user to see illuminated, on paper maps, locations of resources or services referenced in an electronic document.","It is an object of the present invention to improve the current systems and methods of selecting, accessing and displaying electronic multimedia information or services.","It is a further object of the present invention to highlight, on a physical (hard-copy) document or physical surface, information related to items selected in an electronic (soft-copy) document while accessing multimedia information and\/or services located in a user workstation or in one or a plurality of servers connected to a communication network.","It is a further object of the present invention to enable a user, when browsing a Web page comprising references to locations in the world (e.g., names of towns, oil posts, motels, buildings, hospitals, monuments, etc.), to receive visual indications showing the position of said locations illuminated over a physical map, even if said locations are not represented on said map.","The present invention provides a method of creating a geographic link from an electronic document to a physical document for locating, on the physical document, an item referenced in the electronic document, comprising the steps of:","defining the referenced item in the electronic document, said electronic document not being derived from the physical document;","determining geographic coordinates of the referenced item;","defining the geographic link to the physical document; and","encoding the geographic coordinates in the geographic link.","The present invention provides a method of locating items appearing on a physical document, comprising the steps of: calibrating an opto-touch foil that is aligned on the physical document, said calibrating comprising processing a calibration location comprised by a plurality of locations appearing in the physical document and being referred to in an electronic document, said electronic document not being derived from the physical document, each location of the plurality of locations having geographical coordinates, said processing generating a calibration relationship between the geographic coordinates of the calibration location and calibration foil coordinates of the opto-touch foil, said calibration foil coordinates corresponding to where the calibration location appears in the physical document; and","for each location of the plurality of locations, computing foil coordinates of the opto-touch foil corresponding to where each location appears in the physical document, said computing utilizing the geographic coordinates of each location and the calibration relationship.","The present invention provides an apparatus for locating items appearing on a physical document, comprising:","means for calibrating an opto-touch foil that is aligned on the physical document, said means for calibrating comprising means for processing a calibration location comprised by a plurality of locations appearing in the physical document and being referred to in an electronic document, said electronic document not being derived from the physical document, each location of the plurality of locations having geographical coordinates, said means for processing adapted to generate a calibration relationship between the geographic coordinates of the calibration location and calibration foil coordinates of the opto-touch foil, said calibration foil coordinates corresponding to where the calibration location appears in the physical document; and","means for computing foil coordinates of the opto-touch foil, for each location of the plurality of locations, corresponding to where each location appears in the physical document, said means for computing utilizing the geographic coordinates of each location and the calibration relationship.","The present invention discloses a system and method of creating in an electronic document one or more of hyperlinks to a physical document for locating on the physical document, one or more items referenced in this electronic document from an user system connected to an opto-touch foil placed on or under the physical document. The method comprises the steps of:\n\n","The present invention further discloses an electronic document comprising one or more referenced items, each referenced item comprising a hyperlink to a physical document, each hyperlink comprising encoded absolute coordinates of the corresponding referenced item, this hyperlink being used for locating the item on the physical document from a user system connected to an opto-touch foil placed on or under the physical document.","The present invention further discloses a system and method of locating on a physical document one or more items referenced in an electronic document comprising hyperlinks to this physical document.

More particularly, the invention discloses a system and method for highlighting on a paper map the geographic location of one or more places cited or referenced in a Web page.","In a particular embodiment, the invention relates to the creation in electronic documents of hyperlinks to physical documents and more particularly to a system and method for assigning geographic coordinates to items (for example places like towns, oil posts, motels, public buildings, water springs, historic monuments, factories, etc.) cited or referenced in an electronic document (for example cited in a Web page). The activation of a \u201cgeographic link\u201d associated with a particular item results in highlighting the position of this item on a physical document, for example a paper map.","In a particular embodiment, the system comprises a transparent opto-touch foil placed in alignment upon a physical map and connected to a user workstation. The opto-touch foil generates optical signals highlighting the locations, on the physical map, of all places referenced in the electronic document. The system comprises means for computing the coordinates on the opto-touch foil of the locations referenced in the electronic document and for highlighting these locations on the physical map by luminous signals.","The user places the opto-touch foil on the selected map. The opto-touch foil is calibrated according to the scale of this map and according to the position and alignment of the opto-touch foil placed on or under the map.

Each time the user activates a \u201cgeographic link\u201d to the map, a spot of light on the referenced location blinks on the map, helping the user to identify and locate the locations referenced in the electronic document (Web page).","As shown in , the system according to the present invention comprises:\n\n","The user workstation () can be an Internet enabled cell phone (e.g., the NOKIA 7110 or the 9110i Communicator), a PDA, an onboard computer, a network computer, an Internet appliance or any wireless IP enabled device, connected to the opto-touch foil ().","In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the user workstation () is connected to the Internet network () and comprises a Web Browser application. Servers () are Web servers and the information and\/or the service are Web pages hyperlinked to selected items and triggered from the Web browser. Locations associated to some items selected by the user on a Web page are illuminated by the opto-touch foil () placed over or under the physical document ().","Opto-Touch Foil","In a preferred embodiment, the opto-touch foil () comprises a transparent resistive or capacitive film, of the type commonly used to manufacture touch screens. The generated signal is generally proportional to the coordinates of the point pressed. On this film is stacked a transparent organic light emitting device film (TOLED film). This light emitting device film is a transparent, bright, self-emitting display that can be directed to emit light from either or both surfaces. The opto-touch foil may communicate with the user workstation over an infrared link, a wired connection or any other communication means (e.g. by means of a wireless connection operating in the globally available 2.4 Ghz band of the \u201cBluetooth\u201d specification, as promoted by the \u201cBluetooth Special Interest Group\u201d and documented on the Official Bluetooth Website http:\/\/www.bluetooth.com\/).","Physical Documents","Physical documents () can be of any kind, for example, different types of geographic maps (e.g., topographical maps, political maps, historical maps, route maps, shaded relief maps, city maps, natural resources maps, rail road maps or even any other type of map), novel books, text books, technical plans, commercial catalogs or even any other type of hard-copy, engraved, written, or printed surfaces (e.g., paintings in a museum of art). The material of the physical documents can be paper, plastic, wood or any other material.","The main components of the invention are the following:","Opto-Touch Foil","The opto-touch foil () comprises two, functionally independent transparent foils, namely a touch foil, and a light emitting foil (opto foil).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0098"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0016","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0016-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0017","list-style":"none"},"li":["a transparent resistive or capacitive touch foil (), of the type used commonly to manufacture touch screens, wherein the generated signals are generally proportional to the coordinates of the point that is pressed or touched (); and","a transparent light emitting foil (), which is a transparent, bright, self-emitting display that can emit light () from either one or both surfaces."]}}}},"The combination of both foils (i.e., the touch foil stacked over the light emitting foil) forms an opto-touch foil ().  represents an opto-touch foil placed and aligned over a physical document () comprising a plurality of items () (i.e., words, pictures, icons, etc.) printed (or written, painted, engraved . . . ) on its surface.","Touch Foil Technology","The touch foil component () may be made of transparent resistive or capacitive films of the type used commonly to manufacture touch screens. The generated signal is generally proportional to the coordinates of the point pressed. One example of touch foil technology it would be possible to use, is the TouchTek4 (4-wire Analog Resistive Touchscreens) of MICRO TOUCH company (TouchTek\u2122 is a trademark of the MICRO TOUCH Company). The TouchTek4 technology is fully described in the Web site of MICRO TOUCH Company at http:\/\/www.microtouch.com\/.","As illustrated in , TouchTek4 touch screens () use a a polyester sheet () with a conductive coating () as a vertical conductive electrode, providing one-half of a touch coordinate. The topsheet () is separated from the bottom layer, a glass substrate () with a conductive coating (), by spacer dots (). The bottom sheet () is attached to the topsheet () by means of an adhesive (). The bottom sheet () forms the horizontal conductive electrode, generating the second half of the touch coordinate. Silver bussbars located on the topsheet () and on the bottom sheet () pass the touch coordinates to the touchscreen controller. TouchTek4 touchscreens feature hard-coated polyester topsheets (), available in several surface finishes. Spacer dots () are available in several dot arrays, optimized for finger, pen and finger, or pen-only input. The conductively-coated glass bottom sheet (, ) is available in several thicknesses. Electronic control is provided by a serial controller, or by 4-wire controllers. TouchTek4's specifications include narrow inactive border areas and compact touch sensors which allow system designers and OEMs to provide the largest useable screen area and full mouse emulation without sacrificing functionality or consuming excess power. Apart from being suited for implementing the touch foil functions of this invention, TouchTek4 touchscreens are commonly used in hand-held personal information management systems; PDAs; mobile computing systems; automotive, diagnostics and telecom devices; and Internet appliances.","Light Emitting Foil (Opto-foil)","The light emitting foil may be made of an array of TOLED's (Transparent Organic Light Emitting Devices), of the type used today to create vision area displays on windshields, cockpits, helmets and eyeglasses. TOLED displays, which can be up to 85% transparent when not energized are today manufactured with standard silicon semiconductors. One example of light emitting foil technology suitable for use is the technology of the TOLEDs manufactured by UNIVERSAL DISPLAY CORPORATION.","The TOLED technology is fully described in the Web site of UNIVERSAL DISPLAY CORPORATION at:\n\n","As illustrated in , in its most basic form, a TOLED is a monolithic, solid-state device comprising of a series of \u201csmall molecule\u201d organic thin films sandwiched between two transparent, conductive layers. As a result, TOLEDs are bright, self-emitting displays that can be directed to emit from either or both surfaces. This is possible because, in addition to having transparent contacts, the organic materials are also transparent over their own emission spectrum and throughout most of the visible spectrum. Typically, a transparent conductive material (), e.g., indium tin oxide (ITO), for hole-injection is deposited directly onto a glass substrate (). Then, a series of organic materials are deposited by vacuum sublimation on the ITO layer: The first organic layer () serves as a hole-transporting layer (HTL) and the second layer () serves as both a light-emitting (EL) and electron-transporting layer (ETL). Finally, a transparent top contact () is deposited for electron injection on top of the organic films. When a voltage () is applied across the device, it emits light. This light emission is based upon a luminescence phenomenon wherein electrons and holes are injected and migrate from the contacts toward the organic heterojunction under the applied electric field. When these carriers meet, they form excitons (electron-hole pairs) that recombine radiatively to emit light.","Since TOLEDs are thin-film, solid-state devices, they are very thin, lightweight and durable, ideal for portable applications, like the one disclosed in this invention. TOLEDs can be bottom, top, or both bottom and top emitting. Also, TOLED technology has attractive advantages regarding transparency (TOLED displays can be nearly as clear as the glass or substrate they are on, and when built between glass plates, TOLEDs are more than 80% transparent when turned off), energy efficiency (for longer battery life), full viewing angle, bright and high contrast light emission, fast response time, and environmental robustness. Thus, TOLEDs are well suited for manufacturing the light emitting foil component used jointly with the touch foil according to the present invention.","User Workstation","The user workstation () is used to access information and\/or services stored locally or located on one or more servers () connected to the network (). The user workstation may be, for example, an Internet appliance, a multimedia Personal Computer (PC), a set-top box, a TV monitor, a game console, a WAP protocol enabled cell phone, etc. The opto-touch foil may communicate with the user workstation by means of a cable, a wire pair, an infrared link, or a wireless radio link (e.g., a \u201cBluetooth\u201d link).","Access to Information","In a preferred embodiment, locations or places in the world (e.g., towns, oil posts, motels, buildings, bridges, monuments, etc.) are referenced in Web pages by means of cartographic coordinates. When someone triggers a so called \u201cgeographic link\u201d on a Web browser, a visual signal illuminates the selected location over a physical map. In the arrangement shown in , the user workstation () is connected to the Internet network (). To access the World-Wide-Web (WWW), the workstation comprises a user interface () including a Web Browser () (also called \u201cWeb Client\u201d).","The method of illuminating on a physical map (), locations referenced on a Web page comprises the following steps. First, the user selects a map covering the geographic area of the locations he wants to highlight. He places and aligns the map under the opto-touch foil () and enters the map scale in the workstation (). To calibrate the opto-touch foil (), the user selects on the Web page the \u201cgeographic link\u201d of a particular location (calibration location) represented on the paper map. The opto-touch foil is calibrated by pressing the opto-touch foil on said location (). As soon as this operation is executed, the locations () in the Web page for which geographic links are defined, are automatically highlighted on the map by means of spots of light emitted by the opto-touch foil (). These geographic links are stored in a table called \u201cGeo-links Table\u201d (). Each time the user triggers a geographic link on the Web page, the spot of light corresponding to this location blinks on the map.","When a location is selected on the map or on the Web page, the Web Browser program () sends a HTTP request () to the identified Web Server (). A response (HTTP response) is sent back by the Web Server () in the reverse direction to the Web Browser (). The HTTP response comprises the requested Web page which is associated with the selected illuminated item.","Geographic Links on Soft-Copy Documents","The definition of hyperlinks from an electronic document to a physical document implies the encoding of the absolute coordinates of the items referenced in the electronic document.","In a preferred embodiment, these hyperlinks are defined as \u201cgeographic links\u201d (or \u201cgeo-links\u201d) and comprise the encoded geographic (cartographic) coordinates of the locations referenced in the electronic document (or Web page). These geographic links are defined in the form of an extension of HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language), with the following syntax:\n\n","This geographic link associates an item related to a location (Location Name) with the cartographic coordinates (Latitude and Longitude) of this location. Optionally, the geographic link associates a location (LocationName) with the Universal Resource Locator (\u201chyperlink-URL\u201d) of another electronic document.","Using an HTML extension of this type, the HTML source code of a Web page like the page hereunder,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0118"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"b":"Getting Around, Taking Precautions"}},{"entry":{"b":"If traveling from  via  and down through  you will"}},{"entry":{"b":"cross the region known as Lika.
