No. 10\/284,826 originally filed Oct. 31, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,849,989 and entitled \u201cTRANSLATION AND POSITIONING MOTOR,\u201d from which priority is claimed.","This invention was made with Government support under government contract no. DE-AC04-94AL85000 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy to Sandia Corporation. The Government has certain rights in the invention, including a paid-up license and the right, in limited circumstances, to require the owner of any patent issuing in this invention to license others on reasonable terms.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to a translation and rotation positioning motor, which can be used for providing precise linear and rotational movements of a scanning tunneling microscope, for example. In particular, the invention relates to a translation and rotation positioning motor that includes piezo actuators and that provides for movement of an object by angstrom level or sub-angstrom level increments on one or more planes, and that is capable of repeated precise realignment of the object so that it can be moved repeatedly to a desired position.","2. Description of the Related Art","Scanning tunneling microscopes (STM) are widely used in industry and in research to obtain atomic-scale images of specimen surfaces. An STM provides a three-dimensional profile of the surface, which is useful for characterizing surface roughness, observing surface defects, and determining surface structure with atomic resolution. An STM operates by providing a needle point of the STM in very close proximity to the specimen surface to be scanned, whereby the needle point is moved about the surface in a raster-like manner. The needle point is disposed at a distance from the specimen surface so that a tunneling effect is achieved, whereby, when a voltage is provided to the needle point, electrons \u201ctunnel\u201d from the needle point to the specimen surface. By moving the needle point with respect to an opposite point on the specimen surface in order to obtain a particular current flow, a plot of the specimen surface characteristic at that point is obtained. By rastering the needle point about different parts of the specimen surface, a three dimensional plot of the specimen surface is obtained.","In order to bring the needle point of the STM close enough (but not in contact) to the specimen surface to achieve the desired tunneling effect, the needle point is moved by way of a coarse positioning device of the STM. Once in the \u201ctunneling region\u201d, a fine positioning device of the STM is utilized in order to obtain a precise positioning of the needle point with respect to the specimen surface to be scanned.","One such positioning device that allows for microscopic movements of a scanning tunneling microscope, and that can be used as either a coarse adjusting device or as a fine adjusting device for an STM, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,237,238, issued to Thomas Berghaus et al., which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. The Berghaus et al. patent describes various types of positioning devices, some of which allow for both linear and rotational movement of an element. FIGS. 15 and 15of the Berghaus et al. patent show a first adjusting device that allows for both linear and rotary movement of a turntable. Referring now to FIG. 15of the Berghaus et al. patent, rotary movement of a turntable 5 is accomplished by way of drive elements 6and 6, each of which includes a bearing element. Linear movement of the turntable 5 is accomplished by way of drive element 6, which is fitted within a groove 34 on the bottom surface of the turntable 5.","FIG. 17 of the Berghaus et al. patent shows a second adjusting device that allows for both linear and rotary movement. Rotary movement of a turntable 5 is accomplished by way of a rotary adjusting device 1, while linear movement of the turntable 5 is accomplished by way of a linear adjusting device 1\u2032 (which has a bearing element of triangular cross-section).","Another conventional microscopic adjusting device is described in published European Patent Application WO 93\/19494, by Shuheng Pan, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. The Pan apparatus provides for microscopic movement of an object in a step-by-step manner, whereby piezo actuators (elements 2\u20132as shown in FIG. 1of Pan) are moved individually (or in groups) in one direction successively while the remaining actuators hold the object still, and when all of the actuators have been moved, they are simultaneously moved in the opposite direction. The simultaneous movement of the actuators in the opposite direction results in linear movement of the object. Different embodiments described by Pan include an embodiment shown in FIG. 5 of Pan, which allows for rotational movement of a sphere 50 about a center point of the sphere.","None of the conventional microscopic adjusting devices described above allows for x-y-z movement of an object using a single adjusting device that provides the capability of movement of the object in both a linear direction and a rotational direction.","Also, the geometrical structure of objects being moved in the apparatuses of Berghaus and Pan are not believed by the inventors of this application to be ideal for allowing rotational and linear movement of an object.","The present invention is directed to an apparatus for moving an object by way of piezo actuators. According to one aspect of the invention, the apparatus includes a first piezo stack which has a first piezo-electric plate and a second piezo-electric plate that are disposed against each other and that are capable of movement in orthogonal directions with respect to each other. The apparatus also includes a second piezo stack which has a third piezo-electric plate and a fourth piezo-electric plate that are disposed against each other and that are capable of movement in orthogonal directions with respect to each other. The apparatus further includes a first bearing that is disposed against the first piezo stack, and a second bearing that is disposed against the second piezo stack. The apparatus still further includes a third piezo stack which has a fifth piezo-electric plate and a sixth piezo-electric plate that are disposed against each other and that are capable of movement in orthogonal directions with respect to each other. The apparatus also includes a fourth piezo stack which has a seventh piezo-electric plate and an eighth piezo-electric plate that are disposed against each other and that are capable of movement in orthogonal directions with respect to each other. The apparatus further includes a third bearing that is disposed against the third piezo stack, and a fourth bearing that is disposed against the fourth piezo stack. The apparatus further includes a fifth bearing that is disposed against a spring element. The first through fifth bearings are disposed around and against a cylindrical object to be moved in at least one of a linear direction and a rotational direction.","Preferred embodiments of the invention will be described in detail below, with reference to the accompanying drawings.","The present invention will be described below with reference to a coarse positioning device for an STM, but one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the present invention may be utilized for other types of positioning devices, such as for a fine positioning device for an STM, a strain motor for straining an object, or for a positioning device for an apparatus to be precisely stepped in units of angstroms and\/or sub-angstroms to a particular location.","A coarse positioning device of an STM typically moves the needle tip of the STM in units of microns or millimeters, whereby a fine positioning device of the STM typically moves the needle tip of the STM in sub-micron units.","The adjusting device according to the present invention functions as a motor, and provides for multi-dimensional positioning of objects with sub-micrometer precision. The motor utilizes shear piezo-electric ceramics to drive the motion of a cylinder linearly along the axis of the cylinder, and also to provide for rotation of the cylinder, as desired. The cylinder may be used as a strain motor for straining an object to be scanned, for example, or it may be used as part of a coarse or fine adjusting element of an STM that is used to scan an object.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["150","150","160","160","160","160","160","160","160","160","160"]},"With regards to the object to be adjusted, the first embodiment of the present invention is used to position a cylindrical object, which is different from the prism-shaped object structure of Pan (see  of Pan) or the hexagonal-shaped object structure of Berghaus et al. (see  of Berghaus et al.), each of which has flat surfaces. By using a cylinder (which has no flat surfaces on an outer circumferential surface thereof) as the object to be positioned in the first embodiment, the first embodiment of the present invention allows for both rotational and linear movement of the cylinder by way of a plurality of bearings disposed around and against the outer circumferential surface of the cylinder.","In particular, due to the configuration of the object to be positioned in the present invention having a cylindrical shape, smooth rotational movement to any amount of rotation (e.g., 360 degrees rotation) and smooth linear translational movement to any amount of translation is possible. This is a feature that is not possible when the object to be positioned is a prism (as in Pan) or a hexagon (as in Berghaus et al.), which both prevent rotation.","In an STM configuration, a needle tip or probe (not shown) is fitted onto one end of the cylinder . The needle tip or probe is used to obtain a plot of the surface of a specimen (e.g., top surface of a fabricated semiconductor device) to be scanned by the STM, as described previously.","In the first embodiment, by way of example and not by way of limitation, the sapphire cylinder  is \u00bd inch in diameter and 1 inch in length. Of course, other sizes of cylinders may be contemplated while remaining within the scope of the invention. The cylinder  is held in place within the motor  by five bearings A\u2013E (only bearings A, C and E are shown in the top view of , since bearings B and D are blocked from view), whereby the bearings A\u2013D are preferably alumina bearings, and whereby the bearing E is preferably a bearing formed from a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) polymer such as Teflon\u00ae. Other constructions for the bearings A\u2013D may be contemplated, such as aluminum metal, or tungsten carbide, which allow for smooth sliding of the bearings on the outer circumferential surface of the cylinder . Though not shown in , bearings B and D are positioned beneath the bearings A and C, respectively, in the same manner as piezo actuators B and D are positioned with respect to piezo actuators A and C in the plan view of , which shows a different embodiment.","Each of the bearings A\u2013D is mounted on a piezo stack that includes two piezo plates , whereby each one of the bearings A\u2013D is capable of moving independently of the other three bearings. In the first embodiment, the bearings A\u2013D are either half-balls or half-cylinders, which are glued directly to the respective top piezo plates. Other ways of fixedly adhering the bearings A\u2013D to the top piezo plate besides gluing may be contemplated while remaining within the scope of the invention. If half-cylinders are used for the bearings, the axis of the half-cylinders should be oriented at 90 degrees with respect to the cylinder .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["80","165","165","80"]},"The bearings A\u2013D are configured to slide on the outer surface of the cylinder . In the first embodiment, the fifth bearing E is also preferably a half-ball or a half-cylinder, which is affixed (e.g., glued) to a leaf spring.","Referring back to , the fifth bearing E is fixed (e.g., glued) to a spring , which is preferably a stainless steel leaf spring. The spring  provides a sufficient pressure to the cylinder  by way of the fifth bearing E, to thereby hold the cylinder  in place with respect to the first through fourth bearings A\u2013D that are also in contact with an outer circumferential surface of the cylinder . By way of example and not by way of limitation, the amount of pressure exerted on the cylinder  by the combination of the leaf spring  and the fifth bearing E is 1 to 2 Newtons.","In the first embodiment, bearing E is preferably coated with a PTFE polymer such as Teflon\u00ae, whereby it acts as a slippery bearing and provides less friction force than any of the other bearings to the outer circumferential surface of the cylinder . Other types of constructions may be envisioned to provide for a slippery bearing as the fifth bearing E, such as polished alumina or tungsten carbide, while remaining within the scope of the invention.","The purpose of the combination of the leaf spring  and the fifth bearing E is to allow the motor  to be operated in any orientation, such as a sideways position, an upside-down position, and\/or to allow the motor  to operate in a zero-gravity environment, for example. By way of the pressure provided to the cylinder  from the combination of the leaf spring  and the fifth bearing E, the cylinder  is held in place among the first through fifth bearings A\u2013E. The cylinder  is moved by way of linear and\/or rotational force provided by way of the motor  according to the first embodiment.","As seen in , the first and second bearings A, B are preferably disposed 120 degrees apart from the third and fourth bearings C, D, with the fifth bearing disposed 120 degrees apart from the first and second bearings A, B, and disposed 120 apart from the third and fourth bearings C, D, along an outer circumference of the cylinder . The piezo plate\/bearing structures are shown fitted onto a chassis , with the cylinder  disposed within a bore  of the chassis  and held in place by way of the first through fifth bearings A\u2013E. Coupling units , each of which preferably includes a screw, a nut and a washer, hold the first through fourth bearings A\u2013D in place onto the chassis . The fifth bearing E and the leaf spring  are also held in place within the chassis  by being snugly fit within the bore  with the cylinder  already disposed within the bore . The fifth bearing E is disposed at a position between the first through fourth bearings A\u2013D along the longitudinal axis of the cylinder . Preferably, the fifth bearing E is positioned against a mid-point (with respect to a length direction) of the cylinder .","Motion is provided to the cylinder  by activating one or more of the piezo-electric ceramic plates , to thereby move the bearings A\u2013D that are disposed against the cylinder .  shows the shape of a shear piezo-electric ceramic plate  with no voltage applied to it. When a voltage is applied to it, the piezo-electric plate  deforms or shears, as shown in . The size of the deformation or shearing, d, can be controlled by the size of the voltage applied to the piezo-electric plate . By way of example and not by way of limitation, a voltage of 200 volts applied to the top and bottom conductive plates of the piezo-electric plate  results in a 1.0 micron deformation or shearing of the piezo-electric plate  (distance \u201cd\u201d). A lesser voltage applied to the piezo-electric plate  will result in a concomitant lesser amount of deformation, as is known to those skilled in the art.","Referring back to , in the first embodiment, each of the piezo stacks  includes two piezo-electric plates  disposed against each other to form a stack. In the first embodiment, the piezo plates  of one piezo stack are oriented such that one piezo-electric plate deforms along the axis of the cylinder , while the other piezo-electric plate deforms perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder .","In a second embodiment of the invention, the piezo stacks are disposed in a manner such that a first piezo plate  deforms along an axis 45 degrees with respect to an axis of the cylinder , while a second piezo plate  deforms along an axis orthogonal to the axis at which the first piezo plate deforms. With such a disposition, when a voltage is applied across one of the piezo plates of a piezo stack, the cylinder  is caused to move in a spiral (both linear and rotationally at the same time) manner. When a voltage is applied across both piezo plates  of a two-plated piezo stack at the same time, the maximum stroke that the cylinder  can be moved at one time is increased to 1.414 (square root of two)*d, in order to get a larger stroke or movement of the bearing coupled to the piezo plates .","In either the first or second embodiments, motion of the cylinder  is preferably achieved by an asymmetric voltage profile using the voltage waveform  as shown in . The voltage waveform  is preferably provided by way of a voltage generator (not shown) being controlled by a microprocessor, for example. Of course, other ways of providing a suitable voltage waveform may be contemplated, while remaining within the scope of the invention.","In the example provided below, assume that the voltage waveform shown in  is provided to the piezo-electric ceramic plates  that are coupled to the bearings A, B, C, and D. The increase of voltage in a linear manner during the time period t is slow enough so that as the piezo-electric ceramic plates  move the bearing B attached to it due to the shearing of the piezo-electric ceramic plates , the static friction between the bearings A,B,C,D and the cylinder  is not broken. The static friction between the cylinder  and the fifth bearing E is smaller than the static friction between the cylinder  and the bearings A,B,C,D. As a result, during the time period t, the cylinder  moves with the movement of the bearings A,B,C,D a distance \u201cd\u201d (see also ). During this time period t, the cylinder  slips on the bearing E. Depending on which one of the two piezo-electric plates  (see also ) is provided with the voltage waveform  of , this movement of the cylinder  may be either a linear movement or a rotational movement, or a combination of the two, if both plates are caused to shear simultaneously.","Following the motion of the bearings A,B,C,D (and the accompanying movement of the cylinder ), the voltage is rapidly dropped within a time period t, which moves the piezo-electric ceramic plates  holding the bearings A,B,C,D back to their original shape (see also ). This causes the bearings A,B,C,D to snap back to its original position, whereby the bearings A,B,C,D move back the distance \u201cd\u201d with respect to the cylinder . Due to the sharp voltage drop during the time period t, acceleration of the bearings A,B,C,D is large enough so as to break the static friction between the bearings A,B,C,D and the cylinder . Also, the inertia of the cylinder  is large enough such that it does not follow the quick snapping motion of the bearings A,B,C,D during the time period t.","Accordingly, the bearings A,B,C,D slide over the outer surface of the cylinder  during the time period t. This results in no movement of the cylinder  as the bearings A,B,C,D move quickly back to their \u201cdefault\u201d or \u201chome\u201d position at the end of the time period t. The result is that the net motion of the cylinder  is approximately the distance \u201cd\u201d during the combined time periods t and t.","The properties of the shear piezo-electric ceramic plates  allow for movements of the cylinder  to be at an amount \u201cd\u201d of between 1 nanometer to 1 micrometer or more. The actual amount of movement is dependent on the size and type of piezo plates used, and the amount of deformation that can be obtained by applying a voltage across the piezo plates.","In the first embodiment, the time period t must be long enough to allow the cylinder  to move without the bearings A,B,C,D sliding along its outer surface. If a maximum displacement of the piezo plate is desired, the voltage ramps up from 0 volts to 200 volts during the time period t, for example. A convenient time period t has been determined by the inventors to be, for example, 1 millisecond, when alumina bearings are used to move a sapphire cylinder. Also, the time period t must be short enough to not allow the cylinder  to move as the bearings are snapped back to their original positions as the piezo plates  coupled to the bearings return to their original non-deformed shape. A convenient time period t has been determined by the inventors to be, for example, 3 microseconds. Of course, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the time periods t and t depend on many specific details, for example on the material composition of the bearings A\u2013E and material composition of the cylinder  to be moved by the bearings A\u2013E. Accordingly, other time period limitations for t and t may be envisioned, based on the material compositions of the bearings and cylinders.","The stack of two shear piezo-electric ceramic plates  positioned behind each of the four active bearings A\u2013D, whereby the plates  are oriented in perpendicular directions with respect to each other, permits both linear translation and rotation of the cylinder , which allows for flexible positioning of the cylinder .","Two degrees of freedom of movement of a cylindrical object, one linear and the other rotational, are obtained by way of a positioning device in accordance with the present invention. Also, by providing different control voltage waveforms to different shear-piezo plates at the same time in the present invention, the cylinder  can be moved both linearly and rotationally at the same time, such as in a spiral manner, or in any desired manner (e.g., two degree rotation of the cylinder  while at the same time the cylinder  is moved in a linear direction two microns towards a surface to be scanned).","In a third embodiment of the invention, the structure is the same as the first embodiment, except that instead of using a combination of a leaf spring  and a slippery bearing E to maintain a proper amount of pressure to hold the cylinder  in place among the bearings, two bearings each having respective piezo plates are used. Thus, six active bearings are disposed around the cylinder  in the third embodiment and are used to move the cylinder  either rotationally or linearly, or both.  shows a structure of six bi-axial piezo actuators A\u2013F disposed around a cylinder , according to the third embodiment of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["160","160","160"]},"By way of example and not by way of limitation, the range of motion of the cylinder  shown in  is 10 mm of linear movement and 360 degrees of rotational movement, with a 1 nanometer accuracy.
