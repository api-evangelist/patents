{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/598,734 entitled REAL-TIME OBJECT TRACKING AND DATA AGGREGATION IN PANORAMIC VIDEO, filed on Feb. 14, 2012, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Streaming, digital video cameras are ubiquitous, serving many applications, primarily in security and surveillance. For these installations, the camera is typically permanently mounted, and has either a wide field of view, or pan, tilt, and zoom (PTZ) capabilities for control by a remote operator. While the operator is controlling a camera to follow an object of interest, the camera view is diverted from other areas causing \u201cblind spots\u201d. Such cameras are useful only for a single operator. Another type of camera is a panoramic camera having a 360\u00b0 horizontal field of view. When a panoramic camera is used, objects of interest are easily lost with such a large horizontal field of view.","In summary, one aspect provides a method comprising receiving, at a first device, panoramic video data of at least one asset derived from at least one panoramic video camera; receiving tracking data related to the at least one asset from a tracking system; augmenting the panoramic video data by embedding it with the tracking data; and streaming the augmented panoramic video data over a network connection to at least one other device.","Another aspect provides a system comprising a computing device; a panoramic streaming video camera that produces panoramic video data, said panoramic streaming video camera having a radio frequency (RF) tag localized therewith; and a plurality of RF transceivers, in communication with a computing device, that detect at least one RF tag affixed to at least one asset to produce tracking data; said plurality of RF transceivers cooperating to create at least one covered area; said computing device capturing said panoramic video data and augmenting said panoramic video data with said tracking data; said computing device relaying to at least one remote system a video stream of augmented panoramic video data depicting the at least one asset within the covered area.","A further aspect provides a computer program product comprising: a computer readable storage medium having computer readable program code embodied therewith, the computer readable program code comprising: computer readable program code configured to receive, at a first device, panoramic video data of at least one asset derived from at least one panoramic video camera; computer readable program code configured to receive tracking data related to the at least one asset from a tracking system; computer readable program code configured to augment the panoramic video data by embedding it with the tracking data; and computer readable program code configured to stream the augmented panoramic video data over a network connection to at least one other device.","The foregoing is a summary and thus may contain simplifications, generalizations, and omissions of detail; consequently, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting.","For a better understanding of the embodiments, together with other and further features and advantages thereof, reference is made to the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. The scope of the invention will be pointed out in the appended claims.","It will be readily understood that the components of the embodiments, as generally described and illustrated in the figures herein, may be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations in addition to the described example embodiments. Thus, the following more detailed description of the example embodiments, as represented in the figures, is not intended to limit the scope of the embodiments, as claimed, but is merely representative of example embodiments.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d (or the like) means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. Thus, appearances of the phrases \u201cin one embodiment\u201d or \u201cin an embodiment\u201d or the like in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.","Furthermore, the described features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. In the following description, numerous specific details are provided to give a thorough understanding of embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the various embodiments can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obfuscation. The following description is intended only by way of example, and simply illustrates certain example embodiments.","The inventors have recognized a need for a camera that provides panoramic views, such that no \u201cblind spots\u201d exist, yet allows for multiple operators to simultaneously view portions of the panoramic video stream. Moreover, the inventors have also recognized that a need exists for tracking or tagging objects of interest and providing a method for manually or automatically changing the view for the purpose of following these objects in the panoramic video. Accordingly, at least one embodiment provides a system and method for merging the benefits of the technologies of panoramic video camera and real time location services (RTLS) such that the data stream produced by persons or objects that are being tracked in real-time, via panoramic video camera and RTLS, can be viewed simultaneously by many users, along with metadata, such as asset information, from any information handling device capable of receiving the digital stream, such as a remote computer, \u201csmart\u201d phone, tablet computing device, or internet TV set, or the like. Moreover, this data stream can be further aggregated with other telemetry data to provide real-time Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and situational awareness.","The description now turns to the figures. The illustrated embodiments of the invention will be best understood by reference to the figures. The following description is intended only by way of example and simply illustrates certain selected exemplary embodiments of the invention as claimed herein.","It should be noted that the flowchart and block diagrams in the figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, apparatuses, methods and computer program products according to various embodiments of the invention. In this regard, each block in the flowchart or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises at least one executable instruction for implementing the specified logical function(s). It should also be noted that, in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the block may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved. It will also be noted that each block of the block diagrams and\/or flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and\/or flowchart illustration, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified functions or acts, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},"The example of  includes a so-called chipset  (a group of integrated circuits, or chips, that work together, chipsets) with an architecture that may vary depending on manufacturer (for example, INTEL, AMD, ARM, etc.). The architecture of the chipset  includes a core and memory control group  and an I\/O controller hub  that exchanges information (for example, data, signals, commands, et cetera) via a direct management interface (DMI)  or a link controller . In , the DMI  is a chip-to-chip interface (sometimes referred to as being a link between a \u201cnorthbridge\u201d and a \u201csouthbridge\u201d). The core and memory control group  include one or more processors  (for example, single or multi-core) and a memory controller hub  that exchange information via a front side bus (FSB) ; noting that components of the group  may be integrated in a chip that supplants the conventional \u201cnorthbridge\u201d style architecture.","In , the memory controller hub  interfaces with memory  (for example, to provide support for a type of RAM that may be referred to as \u201csystem memory\u201d or \u201cmemory\u201d). The memory controller hub  further includes a LVDS interface  for a display device  (for example, a CRT, a flat panel, touch screen, et cetera). A block  includes some technologies that may be supported via the LVDS interface  (for example, serial digital video, HDMI\/DVI, display port). The memory controller hub  also includes a PCI-express interface (PCI-E)  that may support discrete graphics .","In , the I\/O hub controller  includes a SATA interface  (for example, for HDDs, SDDs, 180 et cetera), a PCI-E interface  (for example, for wireless connections ), a USB interface  (for example, for devices  such as a digitizer, keyboard, mice, cameras, phones, microphones, storage, other connected devices, et cetera), a network interface  (for example, LAN), a GPIO interface , a LPC interface  (for ASICs , a TPM , a super I\/O , a firmware hub , BIOS support  as well as various types of memory  such as ROM , Flash , and NVRAM ), a power management interface , a clock generator interface , an audio interface  (for example, for speakers ), a TCO interface , a system management bus interface , and SPI Flash , which can include BIOS  and boot code . The I\/O hub controller  may include gigabit Ethernet support.","The system, upon power on, may be configured to execute boot code  for the BIOS , as stored within the SPI Flash , and thereafter processes data under the control of one or more operating systems and application software (for example, stored in system memory ). An operating system may be stored in any of a variety of locations and accessed, for example, according to instructions of the BIOS . As described herein, a device may include fewer or more features than shown in the system of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200"},"It is also presently preferred that data be captured. This data may include position information about assets, such as players or objects within the video image being collected by the video camera. Additional information may also be collected, i.e., telemetry information about the asset, such as heart rate, body temperature, etc., for a sports player. In outdoor settings, it may be appropriate to use a position collection system based upon the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites. An example of such a GPS based system is shown at www.sportvision.com\/media\/sailing-reel.","As a GPS based system relies upon the availability of line of sight access to various satellites, it is not appropriate for use in an indoor setting or other settings where there may be obstructions. Furthermore, a GPS system operates at a low frequency (<0.2 Hz) and may not be appropriate for a setting where a high degree of positional accuracy is desired. Accuracy of GPS systems is \u02dc3 m. Other technologies exist for higher frequency and indoor applications, offering improved real-time and spatial accuracy. These systems are generally described by the acronym \u201cRTLS\u201d\u2014Real Time Location Services, and are commonly used in industrial, supply-chain, and healthcare applications for asset and personnel tracking. These radio-frequency (RF) based solutions include Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11 a\/b\/g\/n), Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4), and UWB (Ultra Wide Band). As described in ISO\/IEC 24730-2:2006, these solutions utilize a networked location system that provides X-Y coordinates and data telemetry. RTLS transmitters autonomously generate a direct-sequence spread spectrum radio frequency beacon, providing accuracy from 1-3 m in the case of Wi-Fi, down to several cm for UWB.","One such system which may be used in an embodiment is available from Purelink Technologies, Inc., Montreal, Canada. In an embodiment, for example, a basketball game, the players, referees, coaches, etc., would wear Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags and four RFID transceivers would be set up; one at each corner of the court. Using, inter alia, the time delay of the signal received at each transceiver, the Purelink Technologies' system will provide information on the position (X, Y, and Z) of each asset.","At , the video captured by the panoramic camera is \u201cunwarped\u201d. It will be appreciated that the unwarping process occurs because the panoramic lens is non-planar. This unwarping requires considerable computing power since mega-pixel video frames must be processed at rates up to thirty frames per second. Unwarping is typically accomplished utilizing software provided by the manufacturer of the panoramic lens given that the best results are obtained when the unwarping process is specific to the optics of a given panoramic lens. Such post-capture processing, however, degrades the resolution of the video image, thus the video image may no longer be a 4K image. It is desired, however, that the unwarped image be at least 1080p.","At , the unwarped video and the collected data are synchronized. Synchronization is generally performed by matching up time stamps on the appropriate bits of video and data in terms of time synchronization. Moreover, coordinate data from a location service, as described herein, may be synchronized or mapped to the video data, e.g., by selecting a known location common to the video data and coordinate data. For example, the common point for a basket ball game may be center court or a boundary line. Any appropriate method of synchronization may be used.","At  the synched data is embedded into or mixed with the unwarped video. This may be accomplished in any appropriate manner. In one embodiment, the aggregate data streams utilize the MPEG-4 Part 14 multimedia container. In another embodiment, the MPEG-7 format is used.","At  the synched unwarped video and data are streamed. Streaming may be accomplished in any appropriate manner, including directly from the site or feeding the synched unwarped video and data to a server (either local or remote), which in turn streams the information to the ultimate viewer.","Turning now to , this figure depicts a panoramic video camera () that can be either mounted permanently or mounted to a mobile base. Video is streamed via a high speed digital serial interface () to an information handling device (). Audio may be streamed as well if it is desired. An information handling device () unwarps the video stream and then transmits the information, via a network connection (), to the internet (). Telemetry data that is associated with the video data may be aggregated with the video stream or transmitted via a separate stream. A singular or plurality of active Radio Frequency (RF) transceivers () and (), commonly known as \u201ctags\u201d, cooperate with RF transceivers () to provide blanket coverage of a pre-determined area. At (), the RF transceivers and the computing device () are operably connected. The RF tags may be worn, or permanently affixed to assets. A unique RF tag is also assigned to the panoramic camera. As assets move within the area covered by the wireless transceiver network, their positions relative to the camera are captured in real-time. These positions, mapped as Euclidean coordinates in three dimensions (X, Y, Z) are transmitted with the video stream to \u201ccloud-based\u201d servers (). Multiple remote systems () and () accessing this aggregated stream can simultaneously view the panoramic video, telemetry, and real-time locations relative to the camera.","One embodiment uses a fixed focal length compensated equiangular lens, although other commercial off the shelf technologies exist, such as omni-directional catadioptric lenses. The lens is designed such that each pixel subtends an equal solid angle, or an equal area on the unit sphere resulting in superior image quality as will be understood by those acquainted in the art. As used herein, the term \u201cpanoramic\u201d refers to a 360\u00b0 horizontal field of view. In some situations, such a 360\u00b0 field of view is not necessary. It will be appreciated that the field of view can be reduced as required.","The lens is coupled with a digital video camera as shown (). The digital video camera and lens apparatus are ideally situated such that the camera is at right angles with the horizon. An adjustable or self-leveling mount can be used to orient the apparatus appropriately. A microphone may be integrated into the apparatus as well. The digital video camera output is connected to an information handling device () via high speed digital serial interface (), such as USB or IEEE 1394 commonly known as Apple's FIREWIRE\u00ae. The information handling device may be a commercially available information handling device or a custom-built application specific device. The information handling device () has several functions. Firstly, the information handling device () must unwarp the digital video stream from the camera. This unwarping requires considerable computing power since mega-pixel video frames must be processed at rates up to thirty frames per second. Secondly, it must \u201cstream\u201d the digital video information from the camera. One embodiment utilizes the H.264\/MPEG-4 Part 10 streaming codec which provides excellent video quality at low bit rates, as well as stereo audio. Thirdly, the information handling device () processes RTLS data from the wireless receivers (). The quantity and positioning of the wireless receivers () impacts obtaining accurate RTLS over a geographic area.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["10","9","7","7","11","12","10","12","13","11","9","6","14"]},"Information handling device () communicates data with the internet () via a data link () that may be wireless (Wi-Fi), cellular (3G\/4G\/GPRS), or a \u201chardwired\u201d connection such as DSL or fiber optic. The communication link () must have sufficient bandwidth to sustain the video and aggregate data streams. In one embodiment, the aggregate data streams utilize the MPEG-4 Part 14 multimedia container. In a second embodiment, the MPEG-7 format is used.","Once the synched unwarped video and data is streamed, it is available for viewing by a plurality of users. Viewing may be accomplished using any suitable software application, such as Apple's QuickTime\u00ae player, Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae Media Player, and various online players as are utilized by YouTube\u00ae, Vimeo\u00ae, and the like. It is presently preferred, however, to use the JW Player from Longtail Video, New York, N.Y., which permits a custom shell.","Because the digital video camera () produces a fixed panoramic image, remote systems can elect to interact with different views of the panorama. Remote information handling devices () and () contain custom built application software that is capable of decoding video streams as well as aggregate metadata. On tablet system (), both assets () and () are visible in the center of the screen. The user may use controls built into the software to \u201cmove\u201d the section of the panorama being viewed as well as to \u201czoom\u201d in and out. Remote computer () shows the view into the panorama being shifted to the right so that assets () and () appear shifted to the left. In this manner, any number of remote systems can interact with unique views into the panorama. In one embodiment, the remote horizontal field of view is 140\u00b0 or less. Alternatively, to manually navigate through the view, the software can be set to automatically track the asset. As the asset moves relative to the camera, the remote view moves accordingly so as to keep the asset centered in the remote view.","In accordance with embodiments, panorama views are associated with assets such that the software on the remote systems can instantaneously change the view to track an asset. Referring now to , a top view () is shown where the camera and associated apparatus is located in the center of a two-dimensional area. This area corresponds to the area both \u201cseen\u201d by the camera and blanketed by receiver coverage necessary for tracking motion. For the sake of clarity, it is assumed that assets A, B, C, and D are at ground level (inclination 0\u00b0). Asset A is located, in radial coordinates, at (dA, 0\u00b0). Measuring angles counterclockwise, assets B, C, D are located at (dB, 120\u00b0), (dC, 260\u00b0), and (dD, 270\u00b0), respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["16","6","14","16","17","18","19","20"]},"Additional example embodiments are now described.","In a further embodiment, a plurality of panoramic cameras at a single location may be employed. In accordance with this disclosure, the remote view will show the panorama from the camera that is closest to the asset. As the asset moves, the distance to each camera is calculated with the remote view switching accordingly.","In another embodiment, a plurality of panoramic cameras are located in a plurality of locations. The remote viewing software will then offer the same level of interactivity as described in previous embodiments, namely, to automatically track an asset in a remote view, or to allow for remote control of the view in order to track a plurality of assets in a single or multiple views.","In another embodiment, the remote view software that associates metadata with assets is programmed to perform tasks and to form complex associations with data, giving it the ability to make autonomous operational decisions. In one non-limiting example, a fixed asset such as a piece of industrial equipment might be approached by a tagged person. If that person is not authorized to operate that equipment, an alert is sent via SMS to that person's supervisor alerting them to the situation. This alert event is then logged at the data repository. As a second non-limiting example, using the hockey example from above, if two players begin fighting, as determined by being in close proximity for several seconds, then metadata showing past statistics regarding how many past fights each player has been in as well as other relevant information would be shown. Complex associations may be formed by searching through other data repositories, such as databasehockey.com, using a real-time application programming interface (API). Forming new data based upon ephemeral tag locations provides an interactive spectator experience that is unique to each event.","In another embodiment, the panoramic camera is equipped with a thermal imaging array such that it can be used for infrared video. It will be appreciated that such infrared video could be used for example in surveillance or firefighting applications. Other applications will be readily apparent to those schooled in the relevant art.","In another embodiment, advertisers, merchandisers, and sponsors could associate metadata with unique assets in order to promote products, services, or ideas by either purchasing the rights to access the data repository () for one or more tags, or by having the remote user directed to the advertiser's web site. Using the hockey example from above, a remote user tracking their favorite player, could click on that player's visual indicator at which point a popup appears on the screen allowing them to purchase a jersey. A hyper link is shown in the popup which the user can then click through, redirecting them to the advertiser's web store to complete the transaction. Those skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that embodiments will apply equally to other sports but these are not meant to be limiting examples of embodiments.","For instance, in another embodiment, retail loyalty or advantage card information is associated and synchronized with metadata. In a non-limiting example, in a retail setting, a user's shopping card can be tracked by placing a RF tag on the card. The history of that shopper's store experience can then be stored during the checkout procedure, building a statistical profile of the shopper's habits.","Consider the following additional examples which are not intended to limit the scope of this disclosure but merely to illustrate additional contemplated embodiments.","In one non-limiting example, law enforcement agencies and first responders can equip their vehicles with Wi-Fi\/UWB receivers, a panoramic streaming video camera mounted to the roof, and RF transmitters worn by personnel. Each vehicle would also be equipped with a 3G\/4G\/GPRS transmitter allowing remotely captured data and video streams to be transmitted via the cellular network. When arriving at a location, an ad hoc network is created that allows remote supervisory command and control. The panorama as captured by the roof-mounted video camera displays the location of the officer\/agent's personal RF tag, as well as other statistics such as distance from the car, body temperature, heart rate, and other useful telemetry. This can be viewed remotely in real time, by multiple operators, each viewing a different portion of the panorama. Integrating public data, such as from Google Earth\/Maps, as well as using multiple vehicles serves to increase the remote situational awareness.","In another non-limiting example, oil & gas drilling operations often run 24\/7. Many personnel are required on site. Using this technology, the location of all personnel in real-time can be monitored, visually as well as spatially. Telemetry data such as pressure, temperature, flow rates, and the like can be aggregated and attached to the video stream. Infrared lighting may be used in conjunction with the panoramic camera to provide night vision.","In one more non-limiting example, sports teams can employ the technology for use in team and player analytics. Sports networks can employ the technology for marketing. For example, players on a hockey team may be equipped with RF transceivers. On-line game viewers can watch the game through one or more panoramic cameras while tracking their favorite players in real-time on the video stream. Moving a mouse over the player's tracking indicator will cause metadata to be displayed, such as player statistics, or opportunities to buy a jersey with the player's number.","While the various example embodiments have been described in connection with the examples provided herein, these were provided as non-limiting examples. Accordingly, embodiments may be used in similar contexts with similar devices and methods.","It will also be understood that the various embodiments may be implemented in one or more information handling devices configured appropriately to execute program instructions consistent with the functionality of the embodiments as described herein. In this regard,  illustrates a non-limiting example of such a device and components thereof.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, various aspects may be embodied as a system, method or device program product.

The non-signal medium may be a storage medium. A storage medium may be, for example, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, or device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing.
