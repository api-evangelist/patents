title: Watercraft landing cradle
abstract: A parallelgram arrangement of linkages interconnect a stern ramp frame with a plurality of parallel rails vertically adjusted to positions above the ramp frame by actuators for reception and maintenance of a watercraft thereon with minimized vibration, further reduced by shock-absorbing springs positioned in engagement with the rails and the rail actuators. Rail positioning adjustment by the actuators is effected under computer control to match different hull shapes of the watercraft that are curved or v-shaped and therefore non-flat.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The present invention relates to landing reception of watercraft on the stern ramp of sea vessels.","Watercraft are currently retrieved from a body of seawater onto a retrieval ship, involving use of a ramp projected from the stern of the ship onto which the watercraft is landed. Such ramp landing of watercraft often effects impact damage thereof because of hydrodynamic turbulence and ship motion, imposing displacement of the watercraft on the ramp. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to avoid the foregoing watercraft damage imposing problems during retrieval of watercraft onto ships.","Pursuant to the present invention a rectangular ramp frame attached to the stern of a ship is provided with a plurality of parallel spaced horizontally elongated rails onto which a watercraft is landed and retained during retrieval onto the ship. Such rails are maintained in horizontal positions vertically spaced above the ramp frame by adjusted amounts in a parallelgram arrangement of linkages so that the vertical positions of the rails may be selectively varied to accommodate watercraft with different hull shape cross-sections. Such rail adjustment is effected through actuators pivotally interconnecting the rails with one end of the frame, under selective computer control. Watercraft are accordingly received on rails adjusted to match their hull shape for retention on the ramp frame with vibration due to sea condition reduced. Further vibration reduction is effected, by shock-absorbing springs in engagement with the rails at the ends thereof to which the actuators are connected.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrates a body of seawater  underlying a ship  floating thereon having a stern end  to which a cradle ramp  is attached for landing or reception thereon of a watercraft , such as a small boat or unmanned sea vehicle. The watercraft  received on the cradle ramp  from a location on the surface of the seawater  or from a location submerged therein may be transferred from the ramp cradle  onto the stern of the ship  as generally known in the art. However pursuant to the present invention, the cradle ramp  is selectively adjusted in configuration prior to reception of the watercraft  thereon to avoid damaging thereof during reception and retrieval onto the ship  from its seawater location.","As shown in , the cradle ramp  includes a bottom floating frame  having a top rectangular support surface , with a plurality of parallelgram linkages  pivotally interconnected between rails  and at spaced locations on the frame  for horizontally positioning of a plurality (8 to 10) of the rails , disposed in parallel spaced relation to each other as shown in . One end of each of the rails  projects beyond the top frame surface , while the other rail end is connected to an actuator  pivotally connected to the end of the frame  by a pivot anchor . Such actuators  extend through shock-absorbing coil springs  in abutment with the ends of the rails  opposite the other ends projecting beyond the frame . Thus, each of the rails  is displaced horizontally by its actuator  so as to effect pivotal displacement of the linkages  extending therefrom to the bottom frame , so as to effect vertical displacement of the rails  by different amounts between lower and higher horizontal positions as shown in , corresponding to the hull shape of the watercraft  received thereon.","Accordingly, vertical positioning of the rails  is selectively varied from their horizontally aligned top positions as shown in  in order to conform to the hull shape of the watercraft , which is generally cylindrical as shown in . Other differently shaped watercraft hulls, such as V-shaped hulls, may also be accommodated by positional adjustment of the rails  through the rail actuators  under computer control  as diagrammed in . In response to selective inputs , differently shaped watercraft hulls may thereby be landed on the cradle ramp  with minimized impact after controlled adjustment of the rails , while impact induced vibrations because of sea conditions are thereafter reduced by the shock-absorbing springs .","According to other embodiments of the present invention, an inflatable cover  may be placed onto the adjusted rails  as shown in , before landing of a watercraft thereon.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 1\u20134"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
