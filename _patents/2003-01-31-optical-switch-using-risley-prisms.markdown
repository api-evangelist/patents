No. 6,549,700.","This invention was made with Government support under contract no. DE-AC04-94AL85000 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy to Sandia Corporation. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The optical switch of the present invention comprises Risley prisms (i.e., pairs of wedge prisms) to redirect light beams from an array of input ports to an array of output ports. The invention further comprises a stepping rotary microactuator for independent rotation of each wedge prism of a Risley prism pair to redirect the light beams.","As the demand for network capacity grows, telecommunications are being increasingly constrained by the need for more bandwidth. Optical fiber is a transmission medium capable of meeting this demand, having the potential in combination with dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) to provide carrying capacity in a single fiber of hundreds of trillions of bits (terabits) per second, far greater than other means suggested for long-distance communications.","However, network transmission speeds and equipment costs are currently severely limited by the requirement of slow and complex electronic switching for signal routing\u2014converting an optical (i.e., photonic) signal from an input optical fiber into an electronic signal, switching the lower speed electronic signal, converting the electronic signal back to an optical signal, and redirecting the optical signal through an output optical fiber. In particular, it is unlikely that such optoelectronic switching will be able to accommodate the large increase in network bandwidth that will accompany the full implementation of DWDM. To fully exploit an optical fiber's full bandwidth will likely require integrating the transmission, combination, amplification, and switching of optical signals in an all-optical network without optoelectronic switching. Furthermore, efficient switching of terabit optical signals from an input optical fiber array to an array of output optical fibers may require optical cross-connect switches with 256-input\u00d7256-output ports or more.","A number of technologies have been proposed to provide an all-optical switch for telecommunications. These include micromachined tilting mirrors, liquid crystals, bubbles, holograms, and thermo- and acousto-optics. However, none of these technologies are likely to satisfy a wide range of applications, as the requirements for optical fiber array size, scalability, switching speed, reliability, optical loss, cost, and power consumption differ greatly depending on the functionality desired.","In particular, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology has been proposed for optical cross-connects whereby arrays of micromirrors are built on a silicon wafer using surface micromachining fabrication similar to that used in making integrated circuits. These MEMS optical switches use micromirrors to redirect light beams from as many as 256-input to 256-output ports. Each micromirror can be less than 1 millimeter in diameter. However, such a MEMS switch is complex. Furthermore, switching times can be slow and the long-term reliability of moveable parts is a concern. Additionally, the spatial resolution of the MEMS switch may need improvement for some applications. In a large cross-connect switch, the mirrors must be capable of a large range of angular motion, yet be able to accurately move an incident light beam through small tilt angles in order to redirect the incident light beam to a particular output optical fiber and achieve low optical throughput loss. Finally, this MEMS switch requires tightly controlled cleanroom fabrication and contaminant-free switch operation.","Particularly for cross-connect applications, there remains a need for a reliable, scalable, low loss, fast, and low cost optical switch.","According to the present invention, one or more incident light beams from the array of input ports (i.e., input optical fibers) are collimated into an associated array of input Risley prisms (hereinafter termed a Risley prism pair). By independent rotation of the first wedge prism relative to the second wedge prism of each input Risley prism pair, the light beam exiting from any input Risley prism pair can be selectively redirected to any one of an array of output Risley prism pairs. In similar fashion, the wedge prisms of each output Risley prism pair can be independently rotated to direct the light beam into an associated output port (i.e., the output optical fiber) of the optical switch.","Each wedge prism of each input and output Risley prism pair is rotated independently by a rotary microactuator. The rotary microactuator can comprise a cylindrically symmetric electromagnetic stator and an annular soft ferromagnetic rotor that can be patterned with magnetically salient, variable-reluctance pole faces suitable for small angle stepping to provide precise, independent rotation of each wedge prism of a Risley prism pair.","The rotary microactuator can be fabricated by a seven-layer LIGA process (LIGA is a German acronym that stands for lithography, electroplating, and molding), described hereinafter. The seven-layer LIGA process comprises forming sets of stator coil bottoms on a substrate, forming bond pads on the substrate, bonding stator core suspensions to the bond pads, bonding stator coil columns to the stator coil bottoms, bonding stator coil tops to the stator coil columns to form a stator assembly, and bonding a rotor assembly to the substrate within the stator assembly. The rotor assembly is fabricated by forming a torsional spring on a sacrificial substrate and bonding the annular rotor to the torsional spring.","The wedge prisms can be fabricated, integral to the annular rotor of the rotary microactuator, by a deep X-ray lithography (DXRL) process. Using batch-processing techniques, an array of such rotatable wedge prism assemblies can be fabricated on the substrate.","The invention comprises an optical switch comprising two or more Risley prism pairs for selectively switching an incident light beam from any input fiber of a plurality of input optical fibers to any output fiber of a plurality of output optical fibers. The optical switch uses independent rotation of each wedge prism of input and output Risley prism pairs to redirect the incident light beam to a selected output fiber. The invention further comprises a rotary microactuator that can be formed integrally with each wedge prism for precise rotation thereof. The rotary microactuator can be fabricated by a seven-layer LIGA process. The integral wedge prism can be fabricated by a DXRL process. The optical switch using Risley prisms and a method for fabricating the optical switch and the rotatable wedge prism assembly are described below.","A prism can be used to change the direction of propagation of an incident beam of light. As shown in , a wedge prism  having an optical axis , can be used when a relatively small deviation of an incident light beam  is desired. An exiting light beam  will emerge from the wedge prism  having been deflected from its incident direction by an angular deviation given by the angle \u0394. Using Snell's Law and geometric considerations for small prism apex angles, \u03b1, the angular deviation, \u0394, is given by\n\n\u0394=\u03b1(n\u22121)\n\nwhere n is the index of refraction of the prism material relative to the surrounding medium. Furthermore, the exiting beam  can be deflected azimuthally by rotating the wedge prism  around the optical axis  by an azimuthal angle, \u03b8, relative to the optical axis normal . This allows the incident light beam  to be deflected anywhere upon a conical surface determined by the angles \u0394 and \u03b8, with \u0394 further being determined by the prism apex angle between the optical surfaces of the wedge prism .\n","Risley prisms comprise a pair of generally identical wedge prisms that can be independently rotated to redirect the beam in two dimensions. As shown in , when a Risley prism pair , is placed with the optical axis of the first wedge prism  parallel to or in line with the optical axis of the second wedge prism , the total angular deviation, \u03a6, of the Risley prism pair , depends on the relative orientation of the first and second wedge prisms ,  about the common optical axis . As shown in , when the first and second wedge prisms ,  of the Risley prism pair are oriented the same way (i.e., \u03b8=\u03b8=0\u00b0) the beam deviation of each wedge prism  and  is additive so that the total angular deviation, \u03a6, of the exiting beam from the Risley prism pair is a maximum and is equal to the sum of the angular deviations of each wedge prism (i.e., \u03a6=2\u0394). As shown in , when the first and second wedge prisms ,  are counterrotated at 180\u00b0 relative to one another (e.g., \u03b8=0\u00b0 and \u03b8=180\u00b0) their beam deviating effects cancel and the total angular deviation of the beam exiting from the Risley prism pair is zero (i.e., \u03a6=0). In general, the total angular deviation \u03a6 of the exiting beam from a Risley prism pair, , is\n\n\u03a6=2\u0394cos(\u03b8\u2212\u03b8)\/2\n\nand the total azimuthal angle, \u0398, of the Risley prism pair, or , is\n\n\u0398=(\u03b8+\u03b8)\/2\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00037","num":"00037"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["11","21","10","10","5","12","22","11","21","13","4","12","11","23","6","21","22"]},"To center the cone of deflection of each Risley prism pair in the input array  about the output array , the input collimating lenses  can be configured so that the source beams  are pre-aligned to a center detector  when the first and second wedge prisms , of a Risley prism pair are counterrotated by 180\u00b0 (e.g., \u03b8=0\u00b0 and \u03b8=180\u00b0). This is shown in  for the light beam from the counterrotated Risley prism pair . The same pre-alignment can be done for the output focussing lenses  with respect to an opposing center detector  by providing backward-directed light beams through each of the output fibers . The pre-alignment can be provided by a lens mounts ,  wherein the lenses ,  are held and arrayed as shown in FIG. . The lens mounts ,  can also be used to align the fibers ,  to the lenses , .","A Risley prism pair  on the input side of the optical switch  can be oriented so that a light beam  passing therethrough is redirected to any selected optical fiber  of the switch . When the first and second wedge prisms ,  are oriented with the optical axis normal  (i.e., \u03b8=\u03b8=0\u00b0), as shown by Risley prism pair in , the beam is deflected upward in the plane of  by the maximum angular deviation, \u03a6=+2\u0394, to address the uppermost optical fiber . If the wedge prisms ,  are now counterrotated equally in opposite directions, movement about a line is generated with the light beam  being deflected up or down in the plane of  about a centerline . Conversely, when both wedge prisms are rotated 180\u00b0 (\u03b8=\u03b8=+\/\u2212180\u00b0), the Risley prism pair will deflect the beam downward with the maximum angular deviation, \u03a6=\u22122\u0394, to address the lowermost optical fiber . The Risley prism pair in the output array  processing a particular redirected beam  is oriented oppositely to the corresponding Risley prism pair in the input array  that produced that particular redirected beam , so as to direct the switched beam  into the output optical fiber  associated with the output Risley prism pair through which the deflected beam  passes.","The wedge prisms of an input Risley prism pair can also be counterrotated to change the total azimuthal angle of the beam (i.e., with \u0398 not equal to zero, to bring the beam out of the plane of FIG. ). If rotated about its optical axis , a single wedge prism  will rotate the deflected beam  in a cone (see FIG. ). A second, identical wedge prism  of a Risley prism pair can double the angle of the beam rotation and generate a cone twice as large (see FIG. A).",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00041","num":"00041"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["10","21","1","2","11","5","24","2","1","2","1","1","2","5","21","11","21"],"sub":["1","2","1","2"]},"For Risley prisms of a particular aperture size, the size of the optical switch  and the distance between the input and output arrays ,  can be estimated from simple optics. For example, for Risley prism pairs having a clear aperture of 1.5 millimeter diameter, the input\/output array separation can be on the order of 10 inches. For a 256-input \u00d7256-output port circular array optical switch  with a separation between the axes of adjacent Risley prism pairs of about 2.5 mm, to provide space for the rotary microactuators, the overall radius of each array,  and , can be about one inch. The maximum total angular deviation required of each Risley prism pair for such arrays ,  is thus 0.09 radians. With each wedge prism of the Risley prism pair having an index of refraction, n=1.5, the required prism apex angle is about 5\u00b0.","An example of a rotary microactuator useful for rotating each wedge prism of a Risley prism pair is now described with reference to . In particular, three-dimensional (3D) microstructures possible with LIGA fabrication enable electromagnetic rotary microactuators capable of generating significant driving torque with low driving impedance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00044","num":"00044"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["1","10","30","1","30","1","30","40","50","50","51","55","51","51","41","51","41","55","42","56","41","1","42","56","41","42","56"]},"A variety of means, such as gears, bearings, springs, or other guides can be used to rotatably support the rotor  within the stator assembly . However, because the optical switch  can require switching frequencies of tens of kHz or more, minimization of sliding and rolling contacts is preferred for reliable, repetitive operation. A restoring rotor torsional spring , as shown in , can enable rotation of the rotor  without sliding or rolling contact, while inhibiting radial and axial misalignment of the rotor  within the stator assembly . Wobble of the rotor  is further inhibited by the axial variable reluctance of the annular rotor  within the stator pole faces .","The rotary microactuator  shown schematically in  can be fabricated by a LIGA process as described hereinafter. LIGA is particularly well suited for the present invention because of its ability to produce precision, large aspect ratio microstructures. LIGA combines DXRL with thick film deposition, typically by electroplating, to produce prismatic geometries with several hundred microns feature heights and with a lateral run-out of generally less than 0.1 micron per 100 micron feature thickness. Microstructures comprising polymers, glasses, metals, ceramics, and composites can be fabricated by LIGA. Furthermore, modern batch processing enables the parallel fabrication of multiple, complex LIGA microstructures on a common substrate.","With batch LIGA processing, arrays of rotary microactuators  can be fabricated to independently rotate the wedge prisms ,  of each Risley prism pair in the input and output arrays ,  of the optical switch . A seven-layer LIGA process is described below for fabricating a six-pole, three-phase variable-reluctance stepping rotary microactuator . With LIGA, the rotary micro-actuator  can have a working gap of 5 microns, a diameter at the working gap  of 1.75 millimeters, and a pole face ,  height of 250 microns. As indicated above, rotary microactuators of other dimensions are readily obtained with LIGA. A wedge prism  can also be integrally fabricated by a DXRL process. Although fabrication of a single rotary microactuator  with an integral wedge prism  will be described, those skilled in the art will understand that an array of rotatable wedge prism assemblies, as shown in , can be similarly formed on a common substrate by modern batch processing.","The first layer of the seven-layer rotary microactuator fabrication process comprises forming the bottoms  of a plurality of square cross-section helical stator coil windings  on an electrically insulating substrate . The coil winding bottoms  can be formed by conventional LIGA processes, whereby a substrate is coated with a thick photoresist, the photoresist is selectively exposed to collimated radiation through a patterning mask, the exposed polymer is removed by a suitable developer to produce a mold, a complimentary microstructure is formed by electroplating of the structural material in the void spaces of the mold, and the mold is removed by stripping.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00049","num":"00049"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["52","31","31","31","32","30","1","31","31","52","57"]},"In , the stator coil bottoms  are fabricated by patterning an electrically conductive layer, such as copper, on the substrate . For a 25-turn stator coil , the copper coils can have a square cross-section of about 25 microns on a side. The substrate  can be initially coated with a thick photoresist (not shown), such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). The photoresist can be lithographically exposed through a patterning mask to produce a latent image of the stator coil bottoms in the photoresist. Standard UV lithography can be used to pattern the first layer, since the stator coil bottoms  can be only about 25 microns thick. The photoresist is developed to remove the exposed photoresist corresponding to the latent image and thereby produce a mold, into which the coil material (e.g., copper) can be electroplated. The upper surface of the electroplated coil bottoms can be planarized, by precision diamond lapping, to achieve the substrate parallelism necessary to maintain actuator tolerances and the surface planarity necessary for subsequent good diffusion bonding of the stator coil columns  to the stator coil bottoms . The mold photoresist is then removed to yield a set of six-pole stator coil bottoms  on the substrate , as shown in FIG. .","In , a second layer for building up the structure of the rotary microactuator  defines a plurality of bond pads  at each end of the stator coil bottoms . In addition to providing bonding sights for each stator core suspension  (see FIG. ), the bond pads  provide attachment sites for the rotor bond extensions  (see FIG. ).  shows the twelve paired bond pads  for the six stator core suspensions , for the six-pole stator , formed on the substrate . The bond pads  can be of the same material (e.g., PERMALLOY) as the stator core suspensions . Since the bond pads  provide risers for the core suspensions , the bond pad layer should preferably have a thickness sufficient (e.g., 40 microns) to provide electrical isolation of about 15 microns of the stator core suspensions  from the stator coil bottoms . The bond pads  can be formed on the substrate  by a LIGA process, as described above. The bond pad material can be electroplated through the developed openings in a patterned photoresist layer (not shown). After deposition of the bond pad material, the bond pads  can be planarized for subsequent bonding of the stator coil columns  and the rotor bond extensions  to the bond pads . After planarization, the photoresist layer can be removed. The precursor layer can then be selectively removed by etching to avoid inter-coil electrical shorting of the stator coils  and shorting of the stator to coils  to the stator cores  and rotor .","Subsequent coil and core layers can be built up from the stator coil bottoms  and bond pads  by conventional multi-layer processes, such as additive deposition or electroplating processes, or by diffusion bonding of separately fabricated subassemblies or subassembly arrays. A wafer-scale micromachine assembly method using diffusion bonding is disclosed, for example, in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/761,359 to Christenson, which is incorporated herein by reference. The assembly method disclosed by Christenson has been shown to produce integrated multi-layer micromachines by aligned layer-to-layer diffusion bonding of micromachine subassemblies at temperatures that are substantially less than one-half the melting temperature of the bonded materials. The method of Christenson which is applicable to the present invention comprises forming a first micromachine subassembly having a planar mating surface on a foundation substrate (e.g., by a LIGA process); forming a second micromachine subassembly having a planar mating surface on a substrate having a sacrificial surface release layer (i.e., a sacrificial substrate); aligning the foundation and sacrificial substrates with the mating surfaces of the micromachine subassemblies facing; diffusion bonding the mating surfaces together; and releasing the sacrificial substrate, thereby exposing the released surface of the second micromachine subassembly. The planarized mating surfaces are typically prepared immediately prior to bonding by a plasma cleaning and ammonium hydroxide treatment, in the case of nickel for example, to remove the surface oxide. This layer-to-layer method can be repeated as many times a needed to build up the structure of the multi-layer micromachine. Precision alignment tolerances of below one micron have been achieved with this method. The excellent bond strength and electrical conductivity resulting from the low-temperature bonding process is due to the high purity and small grain size of the electroplated material and the high flatness and low surface roughness (i.e., better than 1 microinch) achieved by modern planarization techniques, such as precision diamond lapping. Thus, the low-temperature diffusion bonding method can enable batch assembly of an array of rotary microactuators  with submicron intercomponent tolerances.","In , a third layer is used to build up a plurality of stator core suspensions  attached to the paired bond pads  and suspended above the stator coil bottoms . As described above, the stator core suspensions  and bond pads  can be a soft (high permeability) ferromagnetic material, such as electroplated PERMALLOY (78\/22 Ni\u2014Fe) or an electroplated nickel-iron-cobalt alloy. The stator core suspensions  can have a cross-section of about 250 microns on a side. The stator core suspensions  can be patterned to form magnetically salient, variable-reluctance pole faces . The stator pole face geometry can further comprise axial square teeth with a tooth pitch, for example, of about 10 microns.","In , the core suspensions  can be formed on a core sacrificial substrate (not shown) and diffusion bonded to the bond pads  of  according to the layer-to-layer method describe above. The core sacrificial substrate can be a precision substrate (e.g., silicon or alumina) having an electrically conductive sacrificial surface release layer, such as 0.5-1 micron thickness of titanium. The core suspensions  are formed by coating the core sacrificial substrate with a photoresist, lithographically exposing the photoresist (e.g., PMMA) through a patterning mask, developing of the photoresist to form a mold, and electroplating of the core material into the photoresist mold. DXRL is preferred for patterning of the photoresist to form the stator core suspensions  because of the greater thickness (e.g., 250 microns) of the stator core suspensions  and the precise tolerances desirable for the stator-rotor working gap and the stator pole face geometry. The exposed mating surface of the stator core suspensions  is then planarized, for subsequent bonding of the stator core suspensions  to the bond pads , and the photoresist is removed to yield the stator core suspensions  on the core sacrificial substrate.","The substrate  and core sacrificial substrate can be inverted and aligned with the aid of precision gauge pins press fit into one of the substrates with the opposing substrate having complimentary matching holes. The substrates can then be press-fit together, and the stator core suspensions  can be diffusion bonded to the bond pads . For Ni and Ni\u2014Fe cores, the diffusion bonding can be done at about 475\u00b0 C. and 5000 psi for 1 hour in a vacuum hot press. The core sacrificial substrate can then be released from the stator core suspensions  by removing the release layer (e.g., titanium) with a suitable etchant (e.g., hydrofluoric acid and\/or hydrogen peroxide) to yield an array of stator core suspensions  bonded to the bond pads  on the substrate  as shown in FIG. .","In , a fourth layer used to build up the structure of the rotatable wedge prism assembly comprises a plurality of stator coil columns . The stator coil columns  can have a height of 280 microns to provide an electrical isolation of 15 microns of the stator coil tops  from the stator core suspensions . The stator coil columns material can be the same material as that used for the stator coil bottoms  (e.g., electroplated copper). The stator coil columns  can be formed on a coil columns sacrificial substrate (not shown) and then diffusion bonded to the stator coil bottoms  by a layer-to-layer method as described above. Prior to bonding, the stator coil columns  are planarized, the mating surfaces are prepared as described previously, and the coil columns sacrificial substrate is aligned to the substrate  using gauge pins. Because of the relatively large height of the stator coil columns  (e.g., 280 microns) and the need for precise definition of the inter-coil spacings, DXRL is preferred for patterning of the stator coil columns . For copper stator coils , the stator coil columns  can be diffusion bonded to the stator coil bottoms  at about 400\u00b0 C. and 5000 psi for one hour in a vacuum hot press. The coil columns sacrificial substrate can then be released from the stator coil columns layer, yielding an array of stator coil columns  bonded to the stator coil bottoms  on the substrate .","The stator assembly , shown in , is completed by bonding a fifth layer, comprising the tops  of the stator coils , onto the stator coil columns . The stator coil tops  are formed on a stator coil tops sacrificial substrate (not shown) by a LIGA process, as described previously. The mating surfaces are planarized and prepared, the coil tops sacrificial substrate is inverted and aligned to the substrate , the stator coil tops  are diffusion bonded to the stator coil columns , and the coil tops sacrificial substrate is released from the stator coil tops  to yield the completed stator assembly  on the substrate , as shown in FIG. .","The rotor assembly , shown in , can be fabricated by two-layer LIGA process on a spring sacrificial substrate . The rotor assembly  comprises a soft ferromagnetic annular rotor  that is rotatably attached to a plurality of interleaved rotor torsional springs  that are in turn attached to rotor bond extensions  which can be diffusion bonded to the bond pads  on the substrate . The rotor torsional springs  allow for rotation of the rotor  within the stator assembly .","The rotor torsional springs  are shown in greater detail in FIG. . For this example of the rotary microactuator  of the present invention, the spring constant about the rotational axis can be about 2 Newtons per meter (N\/m) to enable the rotor  to rotate through +\/\u2212180\u00b0. The spring material preferably has a yield strength near 1 Gigapascal (Gpa) and can be electroplated Ni\/Fe, Ni\/P, or Ni\/Co. Each rotor torsional spring  can have a spring flexural element with a rectangular cross section having a height (e.g., 250 microns) much greater than its width (e.g., 20 microns). The high aspect ratio of the flexural element enables azimuthal rotation of the rotor  within the stator assembly , yet has sufficient stiffness in the axial direction to inhibit axial misalignment of the rotor  and stator  during prism  rotation. Additionally, the variable reluctance forces of the magnetic field acts to stiffen the spring response in the axial direction and thereby maintain rotor and stator axial alignment. The rotor torsional spring  can be formed on the spring sacrificial substrate  by the LIGA process previously described. DXRL patterning of a PMMA photoresist can be used to obtain a high aspect ratio of the rotor torsional springs .","Referring to , the soft ferromagnetic annular rotor  and rotor bond extensions  can be formed on a rotor sacrificial substrate (not shown) by a LIGA process. The rotor material can be a soft ferromagnetic material, such as electroplated PERMALLOY. The rotor cross-section can have a width of  microns. Because the height of the rotor pole face  can preferably match that of the stator pole face  (i.e., 250 microns), DXRL can be used to pattern the photoresist used to form the rotor . The rotor  is further patterned with a magnetically salient, variable-reluctance pole face  suitable for small angle stepping. The rotor pole face  can comprise axial teeth that compliment the stator pole face geometry. Stepping in increments of 0.25\u00b0 can be achieved for the three-phase stator, as shown in , using a rotor tooth pitch of 10 microns. After the mating surfaces of the rotor , rotor bond extensions , and rotor torsional springs  are planarized and prepared, as described previously, and the rotor and spring sacrificial substrates aligned, the rotor  and rotor bond extensions  can be diffusion bonded to the rotor torsional springs . The rotor sacrificial substrate can then be released, yielding the rotor assembly  on the spring sacrificial substrate , as shown in FIG. .","Finally, the completed rotor assembly  can be diffusion bonded to the stator assembly , as shown in FIG. . The mating surfaces of the rotor bond extension  and the corresponding bond pads  are prepared and the spring sacrificial substrate  is aligned to the substrate . After diffusion bonding of the rotor bond extensions  to the bond pads , the rotor spring sacrificial substrate is released to yield the completed rotary microactuator  on the substrate . Because of the alignment accuracy enabled by DXRL and multi-layer diffusion bonding fabrication, the stator-rotor working gap can be about 5 microns or less. As discussed above, an array of such rotary microactuators  can be batch fabricated on the substrate .","The stepping rotary microactuator  is energized by connecting the stator coils  to a three-phase power supply (not shown). The required drive electronics can be standard three-phase variable reluctance or brushless DC type circuitry, as is known in the art. Rotor rotation is produced by sequential phased excitations of the stator coils . Stator poles belonging to one-phase are located opposite each other to drive the rotor  symmetrically. With a stator coil winding excitation at 0.5 volts and 5 milliamperes, a working magnetic gap flux density of 3000 gauss and a tangential rotor force per phase of about 5 mN can be generated with the rotary microactuator  of the present invention.","An even higher drive torque and greater efficiency are possible with a hybrid stepping actuator having a permanent magnet in the rotor  or stator . This can be done by a DXRL process as described in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/452,321 to Christenson, which is incorporated herein by reference.","An alternative to a magnetic drive is to use an electrostatic stepping microactuator and drive the microactuator electrostatically with a high voltage. An example of an electrostatic stepping microactuator fabricated by LIGA processes is disclosed by , et al., \u201cDesign rules and test of electrostatic micromotors made by the LIGA process\u201d in J. Micromech. Microeng. 4 (1994). Because the variable-reluctance stepping rotary microactuator  of the present invention can be formed using electromagnetic stator coils to drive the rotor  rather than electrostatic forces, much lower voltages can be used as compared to typical electrostatic microactuators. A drive voltage of 200 volts or more may be required for an equivalent electrostatic drive with a 5 micron rotor-stator gap.","An integral wedge prism  of a Risley prism pair can fabricated in situ within the rotary microactuator  to complete the fabrication of a rotatable wedge prism assembly, as shown in FIG. . The wedge prism  can be fabricated by lithographically patterning the optical surface of the wedge prism  in a photoresist, as disclosed in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/742,778 to Sweatt and Christenson, which is incorporated herein by reference. Formation of the wedge prism  comprises coating a substrate with a photoresist (e.g., PMMA); positioning a patterning mask above the photoresist; exposing the photoresist to a collimated beam of radiation through the mask to code a latent profile defining the optical surface in the photoresist; and developing the photoresist to produce the wedge prism I on the substrate. With DXRL, wedge prisms  having structural heights in excess of one millimeter, RMS optical surface smoothness better than 10 nanometers, and dimensional tolerances of less than 0.1 micron can be produced.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00066","num":"00066"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 13","FIG. 13"],"b":["1","41","30","31","32","41","31","1","34","1","35","36","1","1","41","30","1","36"]},"Alternatively, one or more wedge prisms  can be separately fabricated by DXRL, or other process for fabricating micro-optical elements, and subsequently inserted into the rotor annulus  and affixed thereto. Alternative embodiments of the present invention can produce prisms  comprising other optical materials, such as glass. As disclosed in the copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/742,778 to Sweatt and Christenson, a metal mold for forming the prism array can be produced by LIGA. Glass, or other suitable optical material, can be introduced into the mold by melting, sol-gel processing, or other suitable method. The exposed surface of the molded optical material can be polished to form the angled optical surface , the wedge prism  aligned and bonded to the annular rotor , and the mold removed. Again, arrays of such wedge prisms  can be fabricated by suitable batch processing methods.","The optical switch , as shown in the example of , can be used to switch light beams from a plurality of input ports to a plurality of output ports. The optical switch  comprises an array of input Risley prism pairs  for redirecting the light beams  from the plurality of input ports to an array of output Risley prism pairs  that similarly direct the switched light beams  to the plurality of output ports. The arrays of input and output Risley prism pairs ,  each comprise an array of first wedge prisms  paired with an array of associated second wedge prisms , as shown schematically in FIG. . The first and second wedge prism arrays can be fabricated on separate substrates , according to the LIGA and DXRL processes described above, with reference to .","The input port can comprise a collimating lens array , or other means known to those in the art, for collimating the incident light beams  from a plurality of input optical fibers  into the array of input Risley prism pairs . Similarly, the output port can comprise a focussing lens array , or other means known to those in the art, for focussing the switched light beams  from the output Risley prism pairs  into an array of output optical fibers . The input and output ports can be fabricated according to methods known to those in the art. The entire optical switch  of  can be enclosed within a hermetic package or other container with fiber optic connectors at each end for attaching the optical fibers , .","It will be understood that the above description is merely illustrative of the applications of the principles of the present invention, the scope of which is to be determined by the claims viewed in light of the specification.
