{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The collection and organization of Architecture Documentation or other departmental information is an important process designed to enhance interdepartmental communications, improve employee interactions, as well as meet the increasing demands of regulatory bodies. In some corporations, the knowledge of a department's processes, important data, and motivation is kept internally within the department. This knowledge may exist in many forms, such as in mission documents maintained by managers, in documents stored online or in paper format, on intranet sites, or even in employees' heads. Often, knowing how best to interact with another department or accessing certain knowledge or data becomes a task in knowing the right person to call or bookmarking the right intranet page. Moreover, new employees are often at the most disadvantage as experience with other organizations or groups within the corporation is often the only way to gain an understanding of how a department works and why they operate the way they do.","The wealth of information maintained by a department about its inner workings can be unwieldy. From the broadest mission statement to the most minute implementation detail, the breadth and depth of the data that signifies how and why a department functions requires organization and consistency in order to be useful to those unfamiliar with the department.","Furthermore, as a variety of enterprise architecture drawings and diagrams are developed by various employees, individuals, or entities, many different techniques may be used to represent enterprise architectures. The use of non-uniform architecture diagrams may impede the use, understanding, or effectiveness of the architecture diagrams.","In view of the foregoing issues, a need exists for convenient systems and methods that can more efficiently assist in the storage, development, and organization of enterprise architecture content.","The Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture is a known technique for providing a platform for organizing departmental material into a consistent and navigable structure. The Zachman Framework organizes architecture documentation into six primary categories each with five levels of granularity. The six categories generally break the information down into the \u2018who\u2019, \u2018what\u2019, \u2018why\u2019, \u2018where\u2019, \u2018when\u2019 and \u2018how\u2019 of a department's existence.","Although the Zachman Framework may provide a platform for organizing information, the techniques for implementing the framework may be improved. For example, organizations that attempt to use the Zachman Framework, or any other type of informational storage system, may compile an extremely large amount of printed materials, including reports, diagrams, tables, and lists. In some cases, three-ring binders containing information that is often incomplete, inconsistent, and potentially incorrect due to the laborious manner in which the information was maintained are used. These storage systems are typically rarely updated or referenced.","As discussed below, in various embodiments, a user-modifiable system and method is disclosed that provides dynamic and updatable webpages for storing and displaying information, such as enterprise architecture information. The information may be collected and accessed through a \u201cwild\u201d interface. A wild is a webpage or collection of webpages designed to enable users who accesses it to contribute or modify its content. As appreciated by those skilled in the art, a wild interface typically uses a simplified markup language. Various software platforms may be used to implement wiki technology, such as TWIKI. As illustrated in , the information stored may be grouped according to a schema . The schema  may define various levels  and categories  to create a framework  of units - (). It is appreciated that various schemas  may be utilized. For example, some schemas may use different subject matter in the various levels and categories, or use different arrangement of the information. Additionally, some schema may utilize more or less levels and\/or more or less categories, or arrange the information in non-grid formations.","Referring now to , a sample embodiment of the framework  implementing the schema  is illustrated. The framework  may be a table or grid comprised of a plurality of individual units -. The content of each level may be specified by a header associated with each level. For example, a level  relates to \u201cScope\u201d content, a level  relates to \u201cBusiness Model\u201d content, a level  relates to \u201cSystem Model\u201d content, a level  relates to \u201cTechnology Model\u201d content, and a level  relates to \u201cDetailed Representations\u201d content. It is appreciated that the headers and\/or content for each level, or other type of grouping, may be modified for different applications. In this example, the level of detail provided in each level downwardly progresses from broad to narrow. For example, the content in the \u201cScope\u201d level is broader than the content in the \u201cBusiness Model\u201d level, and the content in the \u201cSystem Model\u201d level is broader than the content in the \u201cDetailed Representations\u201d level. In various embodiments, the framework  may be the Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture, or a variant thereof, as described at http:\/\/www.zifa.com\/. It is appreciated that various embodiments may employ varying level headers. Further, as illustrated in , the individual units of the framework  may include graphics and\/or text to help identify the content related to the unit.","The Scope level  may provide the broadest level of granularity or detail. For example, this level may hold information intended for a CEO level employee. With minimized technical details, this level may provide a general overview, and may be designed to portray the key ideas behind the details that are expressed in the lower levels.","The Business Model level , which still may be lacking technical terminology, may expand upon the ideas listed in the Scope level . In various embodiments, the information provided at this level may be most valuable to business units that interact with the department.","The System Model level  may focus on information for a first department that is valuable to other departments. For example, this level  may provide another department with information related to how best interact with the first department. Request systems, available services, and the means to utilize them may appear in this level.","The Technology Model level  may be dedicated to a more detailed view of the technologies used to implement the concepts described in the broader levels above. For example, application components and how they interact, infrastructure elements and their connectivity, and deployment details of purchased commercial products may appear in this level.","The Detailed Representations level  may include application source code, employee directories, IP address tables, or stock prices, for example. Links repositories of such information may be added when applicable.","The framework  may comprise a plurality of categories for each level. The content for each category may be specified by an associated header. For example, the framework may comprises a category  that specifies \u201cDefinition-What,\u201d a category  the specifies \u201cProcesses-How,\u201d a category  that specifies \u201cLocation-Where,\u201d a category  that specifies \u201cOrganization-Who,\u201d a category  that specifies \u201cTime-When,\u201d and a category  that specifies \u201cRationale-Why.\u201d It is appreciated that the headers and content for the various categories may be modified for different applications.","The Definition-What category  may be used to house information about the data that is important to a department. For example, information such as server uptime, network throughput and request turnover times may fall into this category.","The Processes-How category  may be used to house information about the procedures a department follows on a regular basis. For example, the steps taken to acquire and install a new server, the process for making a change to a production system, and the procedure that employees must follow when making a request of the department are examples of information that may appear in this category.","The Location-Where category  may be used to house information about the physical location of a department's resources. For example, information related to where the department's employees are located, the position on the network of a departmentally owned or managed server, or a company's business operations footprint may appear in the documentation in this category.","The Organization-Who category  may be used to house information about the department's employees. For example, the different positions within the department and the skills required to perform those positions may appear in this category.","The Time-When category  may be used to house time-sensitive and repeating tasks. For example, the monthly, quarterly, and year-end freeze schedule, reoccurring capacity appraisals, yearly budget planning, and even employee evaluations may fit into this category.","The Rationale-Why category  may be used to house information about why a department's motivation. For example, the content may relate to providing a service, increasing revenue, and complying with a specific regulatory requirement are examples of items that may appear in this category.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1B","FIG. 2"],"b":["106","10","10","108","110","10","108","109","107","107","107","101","102","108","10","108","120","108","120","120","108","108","111","111","10","10","108","112","114","112","116","10","118","112","113","115","115","115","117","118","119","116","114","108"]},"The framework  may be viewed on an application program , such as a web browser.

For example, software-as-a-service (SaaS) models or application service provider (ASP) models may be employed as software application delivery models to communicate software applications to clients or other users. Such software applications can be downloaded through an Internet connection, for example, and operated either independently (e.g., downloaded to a laptop or desktop computer system) or through a third-party service provider (e.g., accessed through a third-party web site). In addition, cloud computing techniques may be employed in connection with various embodiments of the invention.","Moreover, the processes associated with the present embodiments may be executed by programmable equipment, such as computers. Software or other sets of instructions that may be employed to cause programmable equipment to execute the processes may be stored in any storage device, such as, for example, a computer system (non-volatile) memory, an optical disk, magnetic tape, or magnetic disk. Furthermore, some of the processes may be programmed when the computer system is manufactured or via a computer-readable memory medium.","It can also be appreciated that certain process aspects described herein may be performed using instructions stored on a computer-readable memory medium or media that direct a computer or computer system to perform process steps. A computer-readable medium may include, for example, memory devices such as diskettes, compact discs of both read-only and read\/write varieties, optical disk drives, and hard disk drives. A computer-readable medium may also include memory storage that may be physical, virtual, permanent, temporary, semi-permanent and\/or semi-temporary.","A \u201ccomputer,\u201d \u201ccomputer system,\u201d \u201chost,\u201d \u201cengine,\u201d or \u201cprocessor\u201d may be, for example and without limitation, a processor, microcomputer, minicomputer, server, mainframe, laptop, personal data assistant (PDA), wireless e-mail device, cellular phone, pager, processor, fax machine, scanner, or any other programmable device configured to transmit and\/or receive data over a network. Computer systems and computer-based devices disclosed herein may include memory for storing certain software applications used in obtaining, processing, and communicating information. It can be appreciated that such memory may be internal or external with respect to operation of the disclosed embodiments. The memory may also include any means for storing software, including a hard disk, an optical disk, floppy disk, ROM (read only memory), RAM (random access memory), PROM (programmable ROM), EEPROM (electrically erasable PROM) and\/or other computer-readable memory media.","In various embodiments of the present invention, a single component may be replaced by multiple components, and multiple components may be replaced by a single component, to perform a given function or functions. Except where such substitution would not be operative to practice embodiments of the present invention, such substitution is within the scope of the present invention. Any of the servers described herein, for example, may be replaced by a \u201cserver farm\u201d or other grouping of networked servers (e.g., a group of server blades) that are located and configured for cooperative functions. It can be appreciated that a server farm may serve to distribute workload between\/among individual components of the farm and may expedite computing processes by harnessing the collective and cooperative power of multiple servers. Such server farms may employ load-balancing software that accomplishes tasks such as, for example, tracking demand for processing power from different machines, prioritizing and scheduling tasks based on network demand, and\/or providing backup contingency in the event of component failure or reduction in operability.","The examples presented herein are intended to illustrate potential and specific implementations of the present invention. It can be appreciated that the examples are intended primarily for purposes of illustration of the invention for those skilled in the art. No particular aspect or aspects of the examples are necessarily intended to limit the scope of the present invention. For example, no particular aspect or aspects of the examples of system architectures, table layouts, or report formats described herein are necessarily intended to limit the scope of the invention.","In general, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that various embodiments described herein, or components or parts thereof, may be implemented in many different embodiments of software, firmware, and\/or hardware, or modules thereof. The software code or specialized control hardware used to implement some of the present embodiments is not limiting of the present invention. For example, the embodiments described hereinabove may be implemented in computer software using any suitable computer programming language such as .NET, SQL, MySQL, or HTML using, for example, conventional or object-oriented techniques. Programming languages for computer software and other computer-implemented instructions may be translated into machine language by a compiler or an assembler before execution and\/or may be translated directly at run time by an interpreter. Examples of assembly languages include ARM, MIPS, and x86; examples of high level languages include Ada, BASIC, C, C++, C#, COBOL, Fortran, Java, Lisp, Pascal, Object Pascal; and examples of scripting languages include Bourne script, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, and Perl. Such software may be stored on any type of suitable computer-readable medium or media such as, for example, a magnetic or optical storage medium. Thus, the operation and behavior of the embodiments are described without specific reference to the actual software code or specialized hardware components. The absence of such specific references is feasible because it is clearly understood that artisans of ordinary skill would be able to design software and control hardware to implement the embodiments of the present invention based on the description herein with only a reasonable effort and without undue experimentation.","Various embodiments of the systems and methods described herein may employ one or more electronic computer networks to promote communication among different components, transfer data, or to share resources and information. Such computer networks can be classified according to the hardware and software technology that is used to interconnect the devices in the network, such as optical fiber, Ethernet, wireless LAN, HomePNA, power line communication or G.hn. The computer networks may also be embodied as one or more of the following types of networks: local area network (LAN); metropolitan area network (MAN); wide area network (WAN); virtual private network (VPN); storage area network (SAN); or global area network (GAN), among other network varieties.","For example, a WAN computer network may cover a broad area by linking communications across metropolitan, regional, or national boundaries. The network may use routers and\/or public communication links. One type of data communication network may cover a relatively broad geographic area (e.g., city-to-city or country-to-country) which uses transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as telephone service providers. In another example, a GAN computer network may support mobile communications across multiple wireless LANs or satellite networks. In another example, a VPN computer network may include links between nodes carried by open connections or virtual circuits in another network (e.g., the Internet) instead of by physical wires. The link-layer protocols of the VPN can be tunneled through the other network. One VPN application can promote secure communications through the Internet. The VPN can also be used to separately and securely conduct the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network. The VPN may provide users with the virtual experience of accessing the network through an IP address location other than the actual IP address which connects the access device to the network.","The computer network may be characterized based on functional relationships among the elements or components of the network, such as active networking, client-server, or peer-to-peer functional architecture. The computer network may be classified according to network topology, such as bus network, star network, ring network, mesh network, star-bus network, or hierarchical topology network, for example. The computer network may also be classified based on the method employed for data communication, such as digital and analog networks.","Embodiments of the methods and systems described herein may employ internetworking for connecting two or more distinct electronic computer networks or network segments through a common routing technology. The type of internetwork employed may depend on administration and\/or participation in the internetwork. Non-limiting examples of internetworks include intranet, extranet, and Internet. Intranets and extranets may or may not have connections to the Internet. If connected to the Internet, the intranet or extranet may be protected with appropriate authentication technology or other security measures. As applied herein, an intranet can be a group of networks which employ Internet Protocol, web browsers and\/or file transfer applications, under common control by an administrative entity. Such an administrative entity could restrict access to the intranet to only authorized users, for example, or another internal network of an organization or commercial entity. As applied herein, an extranet may include a network or internetwork generally limited to a primary organization or entity, but which also has limited connections to the networks of one or more other trusted organizations or entities (e.g., customers of an entity may be given access an intranet of the entity thereby creating an extranet).","Computer networks may include hardware elements to interconnect network nodes, such as network interface cards (NICs) or Ethernet cards, repeaters, bridges, hubs, switches, routers, and other like components. Such elements may be physically wired for communication and\/or data connections may be provided with microwave links (e.g., IEEE 802.12) or fiber optics, for example. A network card, network adapter or NIC can be designed to allow computers to communicate over the computer network by providing physical access to a network and an addressing system through the use of MAC addresses, for example. A repeater can be embodied as an electronic device that receives and retransmits a communicated signal at a boosted power level to allow the signal to cover a telecommunication distance with reduced degradation. A network bridge can be configured to connect multiple network segments at the data link layer of a computer network while learning which addresses can be reached through which specific ports of the network. In the network, the bridge may associate a port with an address and then send traffic for that address only to that port. In various embodiments, local bridges may be employed to directly connect local area networks (LANs); remote bridges can be used to create a wide area network (WAN) link between LANs; and\/or, wireless bridges can be used to connect LANs and\/or to connect remote stations to LANs.","In various embodiments, a hub may be employed which contains multiple ports. For example, when a data packet arrives at one port of a hub, the packet can be copied unmodified to all ports of the hub for transmission. A network switch or other devices that forward and filter OSI layer 2 datagrams between ports based on MAC addresses in data packets can also be used. A switch can possess multiple ports, such that most of the network is connected directly to the switch, or another switch that is in turn connected to a switch. The term \u201cswitch\u201d can also include routers and bridges, as well as other devices that distribute data traffic by application content (e.g., a Web URL identifier). Switches may operate at one or more OSI model layers, including physical, data link, network, or transport (i.e., end-to-end). A device that operates simultaneously at more than one of these layers can be considered a multilayer switch. In certain embodiments, routers or other like networking devices may be used to forward data packets between networks using headers and forwarding tables to determine an optimum path through which to transmit the packets.","As employed herein, an application server may be a server that hosts an API to expose business logic and business processes for use by other applications. Examples of application servers include J2EE or Java EE 5 application servers including WebSphere Application Server. Other examples include WebSphere Application Server Community Edition (IBM), Sybase Enterprise Application Server (Sybase Inc), WebLogic Server (BEA), JBoss (Red Hat), JRun (Adobe Systems), Apache Geronimo (Apache Software Foundation), Oracle OC4J (Oracle Corporation), Sun Java System Application Server (Sun Microsystems), and SAP Netweaver AS (ABAP\/Java). Also, application servers may be provided in accordance with the .NET framework, including the Windows Communication Foundation, .NET Remoting, ADO.NET, and ASP.NET among several other components. For example, a Java Server Page (JSP) is a servlet that executes in a web container which is functionally equivalent to CGI scripts. JSPs can be used to create HTML pages by embedding references to the server logic within the page. The application servers may mainly serve web-based applications, while other servers can perform as session initiation protocol servers, for instance, or work with telephony networks. Specifications for enterprise application integration and service-oriented architecture can be designed to connect many different computer network elements. Such specifications include Business Application Programming Interface, Web Services Interoperability, and Java EE Connector Architecture.","In various embodiments, computers and computer systems described herein may have the following main components: arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), control unit, memory, and input and output devices (I\/O devices). These components can be interconnected by busses, often comprising groups of wires or cables. The control unit, ALU, registers, and basic I\/O (and often other hardware closely linked with these sections) can be collectively considered a central processing unit (CPU) for the computer system. The CPU may be constructed on a single integrated circuit or microprocessor.","The control unit (control system or central controller) directs the various components of a computer system. The control system decodes each instruction in a computer program and turns it into a series of control signals that operate other components of the computer system. To enhance performance or efficiency of operation, the control system may alter the order of instructions. One component of the control unit is the program counter, a memory register that tracks the location in memory from which the next instruction is to be read.","The ALU is capable of performing arithmetic and logic operations. The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to adding and subtracting or might include multiplying or dividing, trigonometry functions (sine, cosine, etc.) and square roots. Some may be programmed to operate on whole numbers (integers), while others use floating point to represent real numbers, for example. An ALU may also compare numbers and return Boolean truth values (e.g., true or false). Superscalar computers may contain multiple ALUs to facilitate processing multiple instructions at the same time. For example, graphics processors and computers with SIMD and MIMD features often possess ALUs that can perform arithmetic operations on vectors and matrices. Certain computer systems may include one or more RAM cache memories configured to move more frequently needed data into the cache automatically.","Examples of peripherals that may be used in connection with certain embodiments of the invention include input\/output devices such as keyboards, mice, screen displays, monitors, printers, hard disk drives, floppy disk drives, joysticks, and image scanners.","Embodiments of the methods and systems described herein may divide functions between separate CPUs, creating a multiprocessing configuration. For example, multiprocessor and multi-core (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit) computer systems with co-processing capabilities may be employed. Also, multitasking may be employed as a computer processing technique to handle simultaneous execution of multiple computer programs.","In various embodiments, the systems and methods described herein may be configured and\/or programmed to include one or more of the above-described electronic, computer-based elements and components. In addition, these elements and components may be particularly configured to execute the various rules, algorithms, programs, processes, and method steps described herein.","While various embodiments of the invention have been described herein, it should be apparent, however, that various modifications, alterations and adaptations to those embodiments may occur to persons skilled in the art with the attainment of some or all of the advantages of the present invention. The disclosed embodiments are therefore intended to include all such modifications, alterations and adaptations without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention as set forth in the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":["The utility of the embodiments of the invention will be readily appreciated and understood from consideration of the following description of the embodiments of the invention when viewed in connection with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A-4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A-5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A-6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A-7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 8A-8C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 13"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
