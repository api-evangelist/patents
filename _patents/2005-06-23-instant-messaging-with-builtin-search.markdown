{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to searches and more particularly relates to instant messaging with search.","Instant messaging is a popular communication tool that enables two or more users to exchange messages via a network during an instant messaging session. When two users are online at the same time, for instance, instant messages may be exchanged in real time between the two users. Thus, the instant messages may be utilized to support a text conversation between the two users in a manner that mimics how the two users would participate in a typical spoken conversation.","Additionally, users have access to wide variety of content, such as web pages, songs, images, and so on. To locate particular content, the users may interact with a search engine which may provide one or more search results. However, searches for content are typically restricted to a single user such that the search and the results of the search are provided separately from the instant messaging session. For example, the user may interact with a search engine over a network and obtain results of the search. However, these search results are typically provided to the requesting user and are not available through the instant messaging session. Therefore, the user is generally unable to share the search results without manually entering the results into an instant message for communication to the other users, which is time intensive and inconvenient.","Instant messaging with search is described. One or more techniques may be employed to provide a search during an instant messaging session, the results of which may then be shared between participants in the instant messaging session.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","The same reference numbers are utilized in instances in the discussion to reference like structures and components.","Overview","Instant messaging with search is described. Traditional instant messaging and search are provided separately, thereby making it difficult for a user to share a search result. Accordingly, techniques are described in which instant messaging may incorporate search to provide results that may be shared between the users during an instant messaging session.","Two users, for instance, may communicate during an instant messaging session through the use of instant messages. During the session, one of the users may enter a search query into the instant messaging user interface which is utilized to perform a search using an online search provider, e.g., an online search engine provided via a particular website. A result of the search may then be provided for output by each of the clients participating in the instant messaging session, thereby \u201csharing\u201d the search result. When output, the search result may also include an indication of who provided the search query (e.g., the user name in the instant messaging session of the initiating user), an indication of the search query that produced the search result, and so on. Thus, each of the participants in the instant messaging session may be readily informed as to a search performed by one or more of the participants.","In the following discussion, an exemplary environment is first described which is operable to employ techniques to provide instant messaging and search. Exemplary procedures and user interfaces are then described which may be provided by the exemplary environment, as well as in other environments.","Exemplary Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","1","104","104","1","104","106","104","1","104","104","1","104","104","1","104","104","1","104"],"i":"m"},"Additionally, although the network  is illustrated as the Internet, the network may assume a wide variety of configurations. For example, the network  may include a wide area network (WAN), a local area network (LAN), a wireless network, a public telephone network, an intranet, and so on. Further, although a single network  is shown, the network  may be configured to include multiple networks. For instance, client () may be communicatively coupled via a peer-to-peer network with client (N). Each of the clients (), (N) may also be communicatively coupled to the content provider () over the Internet. A variety of other instances are also contemplated.","Each of the plurality of clients ()-(N) is illustrated as including a respective one of a plurality of messaging modules ()-(N). Each messaging module ()-(N) is executable such that a respective client ()-(N) may participate in an instant messaging session with another one of the clients ()-(N). Instant messaging provides a mechanism such that each of the clients ()-(N), when participating in an instant messaging session, may send text messages to each other. The instant messages are typically communicated in real time, although delayed delivery may also be utilized, such as by logging the text messages when one of the clients ()-(N) is unavailable, e.g., offline. Thus, instant messaging may be thought of as a combination of e-mail and Internet chat in that instant messaging supports message exchange and is designed for two-way live chats. Therefore, instant messaging may be utilized for synchronous communication. For instance, like a voice telephone call, an instant messaging session may be performed in real-time such that each client ()-(N) may respond to each other user as the instant messages are received.","In an implementation, the messaging modules ()-(N) communicate with each other through use of one or more of a plurality of service providers (), where \u201cs\u201d can be any integer from one to \u201cS\u201d. Service provider (), for instance, may include a messaging manager module () which is executable to route instant messages between the messaging modules ()-(N). For example, client () may cause the messaging module () to form an instant message for communication to client (N). The messaging module () is executed to communicate the instant message to the service provider (), which then executes the messaging manager module () to route the instant message to the client (N) over the network . The client (N) receives the instant message and executes the messaging module (N) to display the instant message.","In another implementation, when the clients (), (N) are communicatively coupled directly, one to another (e.g., via a peer-to-peer network), the instant messages are communicated without utilizing the service provider (). Further discussion of the use of a peer-to-peer network by the clients ()-(N) may be found in relation to .","Each of the plurality of clients ()-(N) has access to a wide variety of content in the environment  of . For example, each of the plurality of content providers () may provide a plurality of content (), where \u201ck\u201d can be any integer from one to \u201cK\u201d. The content () may be configured in a variety of ways, such as web pages , music , images , and other content  such as web logs (blogs). Likewise, each of the clients ()-(N) may include respective storage ()-(N) for respective pluralities of content (), (), where \u201cg\u201d and \u201ch\u201d can be any integer from one to \u201cG\u201d or \u201cH\u201d respectively.","To locate particular content of interest, each of the clients ()-(N) includes a respective search module ()-(N) that is executable to locate content in a variety of ways. For example, search module () may be executed by client () to locate a particular content item from the plurality of content () stored locally on the client (). In another example, the search module () is executable to interact with a search manager module () which may be included on one or more of the service providers (). For instance, service provider () may execute the search manager module () to provide search engine functionality, such as to respond to search queries and provide search results.","Although the search manager module () is illustrated within the messaging manager module () on the service provider (), the modules may be provided separately on different service providers (). For example, one of the service providers () may include the messaging manager module () to provide an instant messaging service and another one of the service providers () may include the search manager module () to provide search functionality, e.g., a search engine. A variety of other examples are also contemplated.","The search modules ()-(N), for example, are illustrated as within the respective messaging modules ()-(N) to depict that the messaging modules ()-(N) may incorporate the functionality of the search modules ()-(N) during an instant messaging session. Although illustrated together, the search modules ()-(N) and the messaging modules ()-(N) may be provided separately and communicate via respective, application programming interfaces. Further discussion of the operation of the search modules ()-(N) in conjunction with the messaging modules ()-(N) may be found in relation to .","Generally, any of the functions described herein can be implemented using software, firmware (e.g., fixed logic circuitry), manual processing, or a combination of these implementations. The terms \u201cmodule,\u201d \u201cfunctionality,\u201d and \u201clogic\u201d as used herein generally represent software, firmware, or a combination of software and firmware. In the case of a software implementation, the module, functionality, or logic represents program code that performs specified tasks when executed on a processor (e.g., CPU or CPUs). The program code can be stored in one or more computer readable memory devices, further description of which may be found in relation to . The features of the instant messaging techniques described below are platform-independent, meaning that the instant messaging techniques may be implemented on a variety of commercial computing platforms having a variety of processors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","110","104","1","104","110","202","202","110","110","104","1","104","104","1","104","204","206","1","206","208","210","1","210"],"i":["s","s","s","s","s","s","s","s"]},"Processors are not limited by the materials from which they are formed or the processing mechanisms employed therein. For example, processors may be comprised of semiconductor(s) and\/or transistors (e.g., electronic integrated circuits (ICs)). In such a context, processor-executable instructions may be electronically-executable instructions. Alternatively, the mechanisms of or for processors, and thus of or for a computing device, may include, but are not limited to, quantum computing, optical computing, mechanical computing (e.g., using nanotechnology), and so forth. Additionally, although a single memory (), ()-(N) is shown for the respective servers () and clients ()-(N), a wide variety of types and combinations of memory may be employed, such as random access memory (RAM), hard disk memory, removable medium memory, and so forth.","Each of the plurality of clients ()-(N) includes a respective one of a plurality of messaging modules ()-(N) which is illustrated as being executed on a respective processor ()-(N) and is storable in a respective memory ()-(N). As previously stated, the messaging modules ()-(N) are executable to provide an instant messaging session, either in indirect communication through use of the service provider () over the network  and\/or in direct communication over a peer-to-peer network , which is illustrated in  by a double-headed arrow to indicate that the peer-to-peer network  may be provided separately from the network .","The plurality of messaging modules ()-(N) may be provided to the plurality of clients ()-(N) in a variety of ways. In an implementation, the messaging modules ()-(N) are provided by the service provider () (and more particularly through execution of the messaging manager modules ()) in response to a request to initiate an instant messaging session. For example, client () may request initiation of an instant messaging session with client (N). If client (N) accepts initiation of the instant messaging session, the messaging manager module () is executed on processor () to communicate the messaging module over the network  for execution on the respective clients ()-(N) to provide an instant messaging session.","As previously described, the search modules ()-(N) are executable in a variety of ways to provide a search for a particular content item, such as to search local storage ()-(N) on the clients ()-(N) and\/or for content () from content providers () that are accessible remotely over the network . For instance, the search modules ()-(N) may receive search queries as inputs. The search modules ()-(N) may then construct search uniform resource locators (URLs) from the search query using respective search configuration data ()-(N). For instance, the user may provide a text input \u201cwhy did the chicken cross the road\u201d and specify a search for \u201cimages\u201d. Therefore, the search configuration data () may be utilized to specify a search URL for images which correspond to the text input. The search URL may then be utilized to access the service provider () and find one or more of a plurality of search results () (where \u201ca\u201d can be any integer from one to \u201cA\u201d) which are illustrated as stored in storage () in memory () of the server (). A variety of techniques may be utilized to perform the search, further discussion of which may be found in relation to the following procedures.","Exemplary Procedures","The following discussion describes instant messaging with search that may be implemented utilizing the previously described systems and devices. Aspects of each of the procedures may be implemented in hardware, firmware, or software, or a combination thereof. The procedures are shown as a set of blocks that specify operations performed by one or more devices and are not necessarily limited to the orders shown for performing the operations by the respective blocks. In portions of the following discussion, reference will be made to the environment  of  and\/or the system  of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","104","1","108","1","108","104","212","112","110"],"i":["s","s"]},"During the instant messaging session, an input is received that requests a search (block ). For instance, the user interface output by the messaging module () may include functionality to accept a text input from a user of the client () and to accept initiation of a search based on the text input. A search is then performed based on the input (block ). For example, a search may be performed for content () stored locally on the client () through execution of the search module (). In another example, a search is performed for content () available from a content provider () over the network  through interaction with the search manager module (), e.g., when the search manager module () is configured to operate as a search engine. A variety of other examples are also contemplated.","A result of the search is obtained by each of the clients (block ), which is then output for display (block ) by each respective client. In additional, the input and an identifier of the client that requested the search may also be output (block ). Thus, each of the clients may be informed as to which client initiated the search, the search query that was used to perform the search, and the results of the search.","The search may be performed and the results output utilizing a variety of techniques. For instance, a technique may be utilized in which the search is performed by one of the participating clients, the results of which are then transferred to other participants (e.g., clients) of the instant messaging session. Using this technique, for example, a search query may be input by client (), which is utilized to obtain one or more search results () from the service provider (). The search results () are then transferred by the client () to each other client participating in the instant messaging session, e.g., client (N). In an implementation, the search results () are \u201cpruned\u201d by the client () before transfer to the other client (N), such as by sending the \u201ctop three\u201d of the search result. In another implementation, the entire search results () obtained by the client () are transferred to the other client, e.g., client (N).","In another technique, a search query is sent to each of the clients that participate in the session such that each participant performs the search. For instance, client () may receive a text input to be used as a search query. The search query is then transferred to each participant in the instant messaging session, such as through use of multipurpose internet mail extensions (MIME) message transport. For example, a MIME message type may be created, e.g., \u201ctext\/search-query\u201d, that is processed by the messaging module (N) to cause the search to be performed using the received search query. In an implementation, the search is performed automatically and without user intervention in response to receipt of the message. In another implementation, the client outputs a notification to a user that a search is requested and permits the user of the client to accept or decline performance of the search.","Search results obtained from the separate searches are then provided to the respective clients. Using this technique, it is possible that the search results may vary from client to client, such as when the clients are located in different geographical locations that have different markets. Although two techniques have been described for performing the search and obtaining search results, a variety of other techniques are also contemplated without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIGS. 5-9"],"b":"400"},"A first client initiates an instant messaging session with a second client (block ).

Although  is illustrated and described in relation to a plurality having two clients ()-(N) as participating in an instant messaging session, it should be recognized that the techniques described herein may also be applied to scenarios in which three or more users are participating in an instant messaging session.","Reference will now be made again to , in which, a first client outputs a user interface configured to receive a search query during an instant messaging session (block ). The search query may be input in a variety of ways.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["502","1","104","1","108","1","502","1"]},"The user interface () includes a representation  of a search button that is selectable to initiate a search, further discussion of which may be found in relation to . In the embodiment  of , a pop-up menu  of search options is illustrated as displayed adjacent to the representation , i.e., the search button. For instance, the menu  may be displayed when \u201cright-clicking\u201d the representation  of the search button, by entering a key combination, and so on.","Each of the search options may be utilized to limit a scope of a search, the illustrated options including limiting the scope to the \u201cweb\u201d, \u201cresults near you\u201d, \u201cnews\u201d, \u201cimages\u201d, \u201cdesktop\u201d, \u201cblogs\u201d, \u201caudio\u201d, \u201cvideo\u201d and \u201cbooks\u201d. For instance, a user may enter a search term for \u201cdog\u201d and specify that the search is to be performed for \u201cimages\u201d. Therefore, the search module () may obtain images which correspond to dogs.","The search options displayed in the pop-up menu  may also be further refined via a sub-menu . For example, the search option \u201csearch the web for results near you\u201d may have a variety of sub-options, which are illustrated as \u201csearch near the recipient\u201d, \u201csearch near the sender\u201d, \u201csearch between the recipient and sender\u201d and \u201csearch near a particular location\u201d. The \u201csearch near the recipient\u201d option may be utilized to search near an originator of the search, and have the results of the search shared by each of the participants in the instant messaging session. Likewise, the \u201csearch near the sender\u201d may be utilized to find search results near the sender, while the \u201csearch near the recipient and the sender\u201d may be utilized to find search results that address the sender and the recipient (e.g., search results for both the sender and the recipient), the sender or the recipient (e.g., search results that address the sender or the recipient), and so on. The \u201csearch near a particular location\u201d option may be utilized to share a search in one location and use information relating to the sender and\/or the recipient. A wide variety of other examples are also contemplated.","Although the previous examples describe the sharing of search results with each client that participates in the instant messaging session, the sender may also specify that the search results are sent to particular clients, such that one of the clients does not receive the search results. For example, another menu may be displayed having a representation of each client that participates in the instant messaging session such that the client () may select which clients are to receive the search results. The specifying of particular clients may be performed in a variety of other ways without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.","The search module () may examine the search configuration data () to determine a URL, at which, the search results may be obtained which correspond to the selection, e.g., \u201csearch the web for news\u201d and a URL specified as \u201curl:\/news\/\u201d from the search configuration data ().
