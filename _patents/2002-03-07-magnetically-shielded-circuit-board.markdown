{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","In the prior art, the earth has a magnetic field. The magnetic field deflects away charged particles that fly toward the earth. Particularly, the magnetic field deflects away charged particles that fly toward the equator of the earth with maximum deflection of the particles when they are travelling perpendicular to the magnetic field. This natural magnetic field provides a degree of protection from charged particles as they approach the earth's surface.","When a space vehicle travels from the earth's surface, protection from the earth's magnetic field is diminished and the performance characteristics of electronic circuits contained within the space vehicle are at increased risk from degradation caused by charged particles that collide with the space vehicle.","Information relevant to attempts to address this problem can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,998,868 (Jensen et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,121,672 (Benedetto). However, each of these references requires a physical shield that adds size and weight to the device to be protected.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,998,868 (Jensen et al.) teaches a Radiation Enhanced Chip Encapsulant for use with space based electronic components. Disclosed is a two part shielding system that includes an inner shield, which is preferably an electrically insulating layer, and an outer shield, which is preferably a loaded encapsulant. In operation, when ionizing radiation is directed at a space based electric component including the encapsulant, the outer layer drains energy from the ionizing radiation and absorbs the same. When the component is subjected to ionizing radiation, secondary electrons, typically from the outer shell, may be emitted. The inner layer traps the secondary electrons before they can act on the encapsulated electronic component. However, Jensen does not suggest a shield, or shield system, that deflects ionized particles away from the device to be shielded.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,121,672 (Benedetto) teaches a Raised Pedestal Radiation Shield for Sensitive Electronics. The radiation shield is attached to the device to be protected and is sized and positioned to extend beyond the outer perimeter of the device, such that the sides of the device are also protected. The shield includes a relatively thick central portion, a relatively thin distal portion and an intermediately sized transitional portion. Preferably, the shield is composed of a high-Z material, such as Kovar or a copper\/tungsten alloy. While Benedetto also contemplates attaching a shield to both the top and the bottom of the device to be protected, it does not teach or suggest a shield that surrounds the device, such as a magnetic field.","The present invention relates to a magnetically shielded circuit board and to a magnetically shielded integrated circuit package for use on a circuit board. A conductive solenoid is used to form a magnetic field either around the circuit board or just around the integrated circuit package. The conductive solenoid is placed either within the circuit board, or around the circuit board, or into the integrated circuit package. Use of one or more conductive solenoids is contemplated by the present invention.","Electrical currents are sent through the conductive solenoids to produce the magnetic fields. The magnetic fields deflect charged particles away from charged-particle-sensitive integrated circuit chips that are on the circuit board.","Magnetically shielded electronic circuits are especially useful in space. Space is a region that has many charged particles that are in flight. Magnetic shielding would be of benefit to a circuit protected with a physical shield by deflecting the secondary electrons produced when high energy particles interact with the shielding.","Again, conductive solenoids are imbedded either into a circuit board, or around a circuit board or into an integrated circuit package. The conductive solenoids are used to conduct currents of electricity. The conductive solenoids thereby produce magnetic fields near the circuit board to deflect charged particles away from charged-particle-sensitive integrated circuit chips.","Charged particles that fly toward the circuit board will not damage integrated circuit chips that are within integrated circuit packages that are connected to the circuit board. The damage prevention to such integrated circuit chips is due to magnetic fields produced near the circuit board.","The circuit board can use superconductive wire solenoids in or around the circuit board, or within integrated circuit packages on the circuit board. When the circuit board, having superconductive wire solenoids, is used in a space vehicle, the superconductive wire solenoids can be made to be superconducting by radiating heat from the superconductive wire solenoids into cold space.","Heat can be transferred from the superconductive wire solenoids to the outside of a space vehicle by means of a heat conductive layer. Then, the superconductive wire solenoids will become superconducting due to a decrease in the amount of heat energy in the superconductive wire solenoids.","Superconductive wire, such as a high temperature superconductive wire, can be used to form superconductive solenoids that are imbedded into or around a circuit board or into an integrated circuit package. An example of a high temperature superconductive wire is a YBa2Cu3O7 superconductive wire.","A conductive solenoid can be formed by wrapping conductive wire around an electrically insulative circuit board layer. The circuit board layer and solenoid can then be made part of a circuit board. Two such circuit board layers and solenoids can be used, to provide two orthogonal conductive solenoids within a circuit board. These layers could be insulated from one another, by another circuit board layer of electrically insulative material. Electrically insulative material could also be placed between the three layers and remainder outer portions of a circuit board. The three layers can thus be incorporated into a circuit board.","A conductive solenoid could be located on or outward of a circuit board. The conductive solenoid could be positioned on or around the circuit board. The conductive solenoid would deflect charged particles, flying toward the circuit board. The charged particles would not hit an integrated circuit that is within an integrated circuit package, the integrated circuit package being attached to the circuit board.","Alternately, a conductive solenoid could be wrapped around an integrated circuit, the conductive solenoid being located within an integrated circuit package that is attached to a circuit board.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00027","num":"00027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["12","18","12","18","6","3","18","19"]},"As an electrical current is sent through solenoid , energy is continuously radiated from solenoid .

The conductive solenoid  can also be composed of copper metalization that is formed into a solenoidal shape. Gold or aluminum metalization can be used in place of copper metalization. Further the solenoid  can be composed of a superconductive material in the shape of wire or metalization. A superconductive wire can be a high temperature superconductive wire.
