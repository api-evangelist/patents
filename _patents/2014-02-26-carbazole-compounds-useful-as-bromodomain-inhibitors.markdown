{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/769,996 filed Feb. 27, 2013, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The invention relates to compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds and to their use in therapy.","The genomes of eukaryotic organisms are highly organized within the nucleus of the cell. The long strands of duplex DNA are wrapped around an octomer of histone proteins to form a nucleosome. This basic unit is then further compressed by the aggregation and folding of nucleosomes to form a highly condensed chromatin structure. A range of different states of condensation are possible, and the tightness of this structure varies during the cell cycle, being most compact during the process of cell division. There has been appreciation recently that chromatin templates form a fundamentally important set of gene control mechanisms referred to as epigenetic regulation. By conferring a wide range of specific chemical modifications to histones and DNA (such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitinylation and SUMOylation) epigenetic regulators modulate the structure, function and accessibility of our genome, thereby exerting a huge impact in gene expression.","Histone acetylation is most usually associated with the activation of gene transcription, as the modification loosens the interaction of the DNA and the histone octomer by changing the electrostatics. In addition to this physical change, specific proteins bind to acetylated lysine residues within histones to read the epigenetic code. Bromodomains are small (\u02dc110 amino acid) distinct domains within proteins that bind to acetylated lysine resides commonly but not exclusively in the context of histones. There is a family of around 50 proteins known to contain bromodomains, and they have a range of functions within the cell. The BET family of bromodomain containing proteins comprises 4 proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRD-T) which contain tandem bromodomains capable of binding to two acetylated lysine residues in close proximity, increasing tile specificity of the interaction.","BRD2 and BRD3 are reported to associate with histones along actively transcribed genes and may be involved in facilitating transcriptional elongation (Leroy et al, Mol. Cell. 2008 30(1):51-60), while BRD4 appears to be involved in the recruitment of the pTEF-13 complex to inducible genes, resulting in phosphorylation of RNA polymerase and increased transcriptional output (Hargreaves et al, Cell, 2009 138(1): 1294145). All family members have been reported to have some function in controlling or executing aspects of the cell cycle, and have been shown to remain in complex with chromosomes during cell division\u2014suggesting a role in the maintenance of epigenetic memory. In addition some viruses make use of these proteins to tether their genomes to the host cell chromatin, as part of the process of viral replication (You et al Cell, 2004 117(3):349-60).","Recent articles relating to this target include Prinjha et al., Trends in Pharmacalogical Sciences, March 2012, Vol. 33, No. 3, pp. 146-153; Conway, ACS Med. Chem. Lett., 2012, 3, 691-694 and Hewings et al., J. Med. Chem., 2012, 55, 9393-9413.","Small molecule BET inhibitors that are reported to be in development include GSK-525762 A, OTX-015 as well as others from the University of Oxford and Constellation Pharmaceuticals Inc.","Hundreds of epigenetic effectors have been identified, many of which are chromatin-binding proteins or chromatin-modifying enzymes. These proteins have been associated with a variety of disorders such as neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic diseases, inflammation and cancer. Thus, these compounds which inhibit the binding of a bromodomain with its cognate acetylated proteins, promise new approaches in the treatment of a range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases or conditions and in the treatment of various types of cancer.","In a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a compound of formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"26.75mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09492460-20161115-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"A is optionally substituted heteroaryl or optionally substituted heterocyclo, wherein the substituents are one or more R, Ror R;","R is hydrogen, optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted (C-C)cycloalkyl(C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted aryl(C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted heteroaryl(C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted heterocyclo(C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl-CO\u2014, optionally substituted aryl-CO\u2014, optionally substituted (C-C)cycloalkyl-CO\u2014, optionally substituted heteroaryl, optionally substituted heterocyclo-CO\u2014, optionally substituted aryl-SO\u2014, optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl-SO\u2014, optionally substituted (C-C)cycloalkyl-SO\u2014, optionally substituted heteroaryl-SO\u2014, optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl-OCO\u2014 or optionally substituted (C-C)cycloalkyl-OCO\u2014;

Such unit doses may therefore be administered more than once a day. Preferred unit dosage compositions are those containing a daily dose or sub-dose (for administration more than once a day), as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient.","Types of cancers that may be treated with the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, brain cancers, skin cancers, bladder cancers, ovarian cancers, breast cancers, gastric cancers, pancreatic cancers, prostate cancers, colon cancers, blood cancers, lung cancers and bone cancers. Examples of such cancer types include neuroblastoma, intestine carcinoma such as rectum carcinoma, colon carcinoma, familiar adenomatous polyposis carcinoma and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, esophageal carcinoma, labial carcinoma, larynx carcinoma, hypopharynx carcinoma, tong carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, renal carcinoma, kidney parenchymal carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, cervix carcinoma, uterine corpus carcinoma, endometrium carcinoma, chorion carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, testis carcinoma, breast carcinoma, urinary carcinoma, melanoma, brain tumors such as glioblastoma, astrocytoma, meningioma, medulloblastoma and peripheral neuroectodermal tumors, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), hepatocellular carcinoma, gall bladder carcinoma, bronchial carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, multiple myeloma, basalioma, teratoma, retinoblastoma, choroid melanoma, seminoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, craniopharyngioma, osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, myosarcoma, liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma and plasmocytoma.","In addition to apoptosis defects found in tumors, defects in the ability to eliminate self-reactive cells of the immune system due to apoptosis resistance are considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases are characterized in that the cells of the immune system produce antibodies against its own organs and molecules or directly attack tissues resulting in the destruction of the latter. A failure of those self-reactive cells to undergo apoptosis leads to the manifestation of the disease. Defects in apoptosis regulation have been identified in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis.","Thus, according to another embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating an autoimmune disease by providing to a patient in need thereof a compound or composition of the present invention. Examples of such autoimmune diseases include, but are not limited to, collagen diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus.

Thus, in one embodiment, the compounds of the invention are co-administered with radiation therapy or a second therapeutic agent with cytostatic or antineoplastic activity. Suitable cytostatic chemotherapy compounds include, but are not limited to (i) antimetabolites; (ii) DNA-fragmenting agents, (iii) DNA-crosslinking agents, (iv) intercalating agents (v) protein synthesis inhibitors, (vi) topoisomerase I poisons, such as camptothecin or topotecan; (vii) topoisomerase II poisons, (viii) microtubule-directed agents, (ix) kinase inhibitors (x) miscellaneous investigational agents (xi) hormones and (xii) hormone antagonists. It is contemplated that compounds of the invention may be useful in combination with any known agents falling into the above 12 classes as well as any future agents that are currently in development. In particular, it is contemplated that compounds of the invention may be useful in combination with current Standards of Care as well as any that evolve over the foreseeable future. Specific dosages and dosing regimens would be based on physicians' evolving knowledge and the general skill in the art.","The combination therapy is intended to embrace administration of these therapeutic agents in a sequential manner, that is, wherein each therapeutic agent is administered at a different time, as well as administration of these therapeutic agents, or at least two of the therapeutic agents, in a substantially simultaneous manner. Substantially simultaneous administration can be accomplished, for example, by administering to the subject a single dosage form having a fixed ratio of each therapeutic agent or in multiple, single dosage forms for each of the therapeutic agents. Sequential or substantially simultaneous administration of each therapeutic agent can be effected by any appropriate route including, but not limited to, oral routes, intravenous routes, intramuscular routes, and direct absorption through mucous membrane tissues. The therapeutic agents can be administered by the same route or by different routes. For example, a first therapeutic agent of the combination selected may be administered by intravenous injection while the other therapeutic agents of the combination may be administered orally. Alternatively, for example, all therapeutic agents may be administered orally or all therapeutic agents may be administered by intravenous injection. Combination therapy also can embrace the administration of the therapeutic agents as described above in further combination with other biologically active ingredients and non-drug therapies (e.g., surgery or radiation treatment.) Where the combination therapy further comprises a non-drug treatment, the non-drug treatment may be conducted at any suitable time so long as a beneficial effect from the co-action of the combination of the therapeutic agents and non-drug treatment is achieved. For example, in appropriate cases, the beneficial effect is still achieved when the non-drug treatment is temporally removed from the administration of the therapeutic agents, perhaps by days or even weeks.","The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes thereof. This invention encompasses all combinations of preferred aspects of the invention noted herein. It is understood that any and all embodiments of the present invention may be taken in conjunction with any other embodiment or embodiments to describe additional embodiments.

Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane.","Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound of the present invention to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispersing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate of such flux can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.","Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like, are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.","Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more compounds of the invention in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain sugars, alcohols, antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents.","Examples of suitable aqueous and non-aqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.","These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms upon the subject compounds may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.","In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.","Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsuled matrices of the subject compounds in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue.","When the compounds of the present invention are administered as pharmaceuticals, to humans and animals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, 0.1 to 99% (more preferably, 10 to 30%) of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","Regardless of the route of administration selected, the compounds of the present invention, which may be used in a suitable hydrated form, and\/or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, are formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art.","Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient.","The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the particular compound of the present invention employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion or metabolism of the particular compound being employed, the rate and extent of absorption, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and\/or materials used in combination with the particular compound employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts.","A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example, the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the compounds of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.","In general, a suitable daily dose of a compound of the invention will be that amount of the compound which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above. Generally, oral, intravenous, intracerebroventricular and subcutaneous doses of the compounds of this invention for a patient will range from about 0.01 to about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight per day.","If desired, the effective daily dose of the active compound may be administered as two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered separately at appropriate intervals throughout the day, optionally, in unit dosage forms. In certain aspects of the invention, dosing is one administration per day.","While it is possible for a compound of the present invention to be administered alone, it is preferable to administer the compound as a pharmaceutical formulation (composition).","Unless specifically stated otherwise herein, references made in the singular may also include the plural.

The R and A substituents are defined previously in the text or a functional group that can be converted to the desired final substituent. The substituent X is a leaving group such as a halogen or OH that can be easily converted to a leaving group such as a triflate. The Y is a boronic acid, boronic ester or stannane. The aniline is converted to the corresponding hydrazine typically using aqueous sodium nitrate and concentrated HCl. The product hydrazine-hydrochloride is then condensed with the substituted cyclohexanone 3 using a variety of Fischer Indolization conditions known in the literature. For example, the use of acetic acid at reflux to furnish the Fischer indole product the tetrandrocarbazole 4, which in cases is generated as a mixture of regioisomers. The regioisomers can separated or carried forward as a mixture in subsequent reactions and separated as a later intermediate.","The tetrandrocarbazole 4, can then be converted to the carbazole 5 using a variety of methods known in the literature, for example with the use of oxidizing agent such as DDQ. A Suzuki or Stille reaction between carbazole 5 (where X=halogen) and the aromatic heterocycle A (where Y=Boronic acid, ester, or stannane) using a suitable Pd catalyst, such as PdCl(dppf), then gives carbazole 7. The Suzuki or Stille partners could be switched such that the carbazole 5 could be the organometallic partner (where X=boronic acid, boronic ester, or stannane) and the aromatic heterocycle A (where Y=halide) is the halogen containing partner.","In the final step, the products of the invention were prepared in a displacement reaction between the carbazole 7 and an the alkylating (or acylating) agent 8, where X is a leaving group such as an halide or mesylate or triflate (or acid chloride, or sulfonyl chloride) in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate and a catalyst such as 18-crown-6. Alternatively, the carbazole nitrogen can be substituted under Mitsunobu conditions using triphenylphosphine and diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD) using alkylating agent 8 (where X is OH).","An alternative synthesis of carbazole 7 is shown in Scheme 2. As shown in Scheme 2, a Suzuki reaction between the starting substituted aniline 1 (where X=halogen) and the aromatic heterocycle A (where Y=Boronic acid or ester) using a suitable Pd catalyst, such as PdCl(dppf), gives the substituted aniline 10. The Suzuki partners could be switched such that the aniline 1 could be the boronic acid partner (where X=boronic acid or boronic ester) and the aromatic heterocycle A (where Y=halide) is the halogen containing partner. The resulting aniline 10 can then undergo a Buchwald N-arylation reaction with a suitably substituted phenyl 11 (where X=halogen) to give the diphenyl aniline 12. The aniline 12 can then undergo a Pd catalyzed cyclization to give the carbazole 7 under a variety of conditions, such as heating with pivalic acid in air in the presence of Pd(Ac).

The purified samples were divided into aliquots, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C.","Time Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) Assay","The binding of compounds to bromodomain BRD4 (44-168), BRD4 (333-460), and BRD4 (1-477 or 44-460) was assessed using a time resolved fluorescent resonance energy transfer binding assay (1), that measures the binding of a fluorescently labeled probe molecule to the bromodomain protein. The bromodomain protein, fluorescent probe molecule (either a biotinylated histone peptide or a fluorescently labeled small molecule), and dose-responsed test compound are incubated together to reach thermodynamic equilibrium. In the absence of a test compound, the bromodomain and small molecule are bound, resulting in a high fluorescent signal. In the presence of a sufficient concentration of inhibitor, this intercation is disrupted resulting in a lost of fluorescent resonance energy transfer.","All assay components were dissolved in buffer composition 20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 0.005% Tween 20, and 100 ug\/ml BSA for BRD4 (1-477 and 44-460). The final concentrations of the bromodomain proteins are 1.6 nM BRD4(44-168), 1 nM BRD4(333-460), and 1 nM BRD4(1-477 or 44-460), and the fluorescent probe molecule is 100 nM, 50 nM, and 7.5 nM respectively. All proteins were biotinylated. A streptavidin labeled with terbium cryptate (Cisbio SA-Tb) was used as detection, and pre-mixed with the bromodomain protein at a final concentration of 0.2 nM. In some instances for BRD4 (44-460), anti-His terbium cryptate was used as a detection. 7.5 nl of dose-responsed test compound or dmso vehicle (0.0375%) was pre-spotted in a black Corning 384 well plate and 10 ul each of bromodomain\/detection reagent and fluorescent small molecule solution were added to the plate, and the reaction incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Plates were then read on EnVision plate reader, (\u03bbex=340 nm, acceptor \u03bbEm=520 nm, and donor \u03bbEm=615 nm, LANCE D400 mirror). Time resolved fluorescence intensity measurements were made at both emissions, and the ratio of acceptor\/donor was calculated and used for data analysis. All data was normalized to 16 high vehicle wells and 8 low reference control wells, and then a four parameter curve fit was applied:\n\n+(()\/(1+(1010))\n\nWhere \u2018a\u2019 is the minimum, \u2018b\u2019 is the Hill slope, \u2018c\u2019 is the IC, and \u2018d\u2019 is the maximum.\n\nHistone peptide: Purchased from GenScript\n\nH4K5K8K12K16\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1105","num":"1394"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00013","num":"00013"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"right"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u20033)"},{"entry":"Biotin-AHA-SGRGK(Ac)GGK(Ac)GLGK(Ac)GGAK(Ac)RHRKV"}]}}}}},"The fluorescently labeled small molecule used was a BRD4 inhibitor known in the art\n\n","The effect of compound binding on the thermal stability of the bromodomains was measured using a BioRad CFX real time PCR instrument by monitoring the fluorescence enhancement of an external probe (SYPRO orange) as it binds preferentially to the unfolded protein. The unfolding reactions were carried out in a 384-well plate in a 4 uL volume with 2-8 uM of bromodomain protein, 1-2% (v\/v) DMSO in buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl. SYPRO orange dye was added at a dilution of 1:500. Compound concentrations ranged from 1.6-100 uM. Unfolding reactions were monitored by first equilibrating the instrument at 25\u00b0 C. for 2.4 sec, followed by ramping the temperature in 0.5\u00b0 C. increments from 25 to 95\u00b0 C. with 60 s equilibration prior to a read at each temperature. Excitation and emission filters for the SYPRO orange dye were set to FRET with the excitation range from 450-490 nm and the emission range from 560-580 nm. The midpoint temperature was determined by calculating the inflection point using the second derivative. The observed temperature shifts were recorded as the difference between the midpoint between a reference well containing protein with dmso but no ligand and a well containing protein with compound.","The thermal shift assay is a biophysical technique that compares the change in unfolding transition temperature of a protein obtained in the presence and absence of a ligand (1). Typically, a fluorescent dye is used to monitor the protein unfolding as the protein is heated. During the unfolding process, hydrophobic regions of the protein are exposed, resulting in an increase in the dye binding and an increase in fluorescence intensity. The midpoint of the protein unfolding transition is defined as the Tm. A ligand that binds to the protein causes an increase in the protein thermal stability, thus increasing the Tm, proportionally to both the ligand concentration and its binding affinity.\n\n","Tumor cells in complete RPMI growth media (Gibco, 11875-085) supplemented with 10% FBS were harvested and plated into 384 black clear-bottom PDL cell culture plates in 30 ul media with 10,000 cells per well. After compound treatment at 37C for 4 hrs, cells were fixed in 4% Formaldehyde at room temperature for 30 minutes and subsequently permeabilized. After washing and blocking, the plates were then incubated with anti-myc primary antibody 1:1000 (Cell Signaling Technology, 5605) at RT overnight. The following day, cells were washed and blocked before adding secondary antibody Alexa 488 Goat-anti Rabbit 1:2000 (Invitrogen, A11034) at RT in the dark for 1 hr. Cells were subsequently washed and scanned on the Cellomics ArrayScan with 10\u00d7 objective lens.","MTS Cell Proliferation Assay","Tumor cells were plated at certain seeding densities in 384-well black clear bottom Matrix plates at 40 ul per well and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO2 before assaying. On the next day, one set of cell plates (T0 plates) were used to determine time zero cell density, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium from the CellTiter 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell proliferation Kit (Promega, G5440) was added at 4 \u03bcl\/well into T0 plates followed by incubation at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO2 for three hours. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured on an Envision reader (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass.). On the same day, the remaining cell plates (T72 plates) were treated with compounds at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO2. After 72 hours, 4 ul MTS reagents were then added onto those cell plates. The plates were further incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO2 for three hours and the absorbance values at A490 were measured on an Envision reader.","Human Tumor Xenograft Models in Mice","All rodents were obtained from Jackson Laboratory. (Bar Harbor, Me.), and maintained in an ammonia-free environment in a defined and pathogen-free colony. All mice were quarantined approximately 1 week prior to their use for tumor propagation and drug efficacy testing. Mice were fed food and water ad libitum. The animal care program of Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute is fully accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). All experiments were performed in accordance with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) animal test methods and guidelines.","Tumor xenografts were grown and maintained subcutaneously (SC) in NSG (NOD scid IL2 receptor gamma chain knockout) mice (Jackson Lab). Tumors were propagated as subcutaneous transplants using tumor fragments obtained from donor mice.","Preclinical Chemotherapy Trials","The required numbers of animals needed to detect a meaningful response were pooled at the start of the experiment and each was given bilateral subcutaneous implants of two tumor fragments (\u02dc20 mg) with a 13-gauge trocar. Tumors were allowed to grow to the pre-determined size window (tumors outside the range were excluded) and animals were evenly distributed to various treatment and control groups. There were typically 6-8 mice per treatment and control groups, consisting of 10-12 tumors. Treatment of each animal was based on individual body weight. Treated animals were checked daily for treatment related toxicity\/mortality. Each group of animals was weighed before the initiation of treatment (Wt) and then again following the last treatment dose (Wt). The difference in body weight (Wt\u2212Wt) provides a measure of treatment-related toxicity.","Tumor response was determined by measurement of tumors with a caliper twice a week, until the tumors reached a predetermined \u201ctarget\u201d size of 0.5 gm or 1 gm depending on the tumor type. Tumor weights (mg) were estimated from the formula:\n\nTumor weight=(length\u00d7width)\u00f72\n","Tumor response criteria are expressed in terms of tumor growth inhibition (% TGI). Tumor growth delay is defined as the difference in time (days) required for the treated tumors (T) to reach a predetermined target size compared to those of the control group (C).

When death occurred, the day of death was recorded. Treated mice dying prior to having their tumors reach target size were considered to have died from drug toxicity. No control mice died bearing tumors less than target size. Treatment groups with more than one death caused by drug toxicity were considered to have had excessively toxic treatments and their data were not included in the evaluation of a compound's antitumor efficacy.","Potential drug toxicity interaction affecting treatment tolerability is an important consideration in combination chemotherapy trials. Interpretation of combination therapeutic results must be based on comparison of antitumor activity of the best possible response for the single agents versus the combination at comparably tolerated doses. Therefore, therapeutic synergism was defined as a therapeutic effect achieved with a tolerated regimen of the combined agents that exceeded the optimal effect achieved at any tolerated dose of monotherapy.
