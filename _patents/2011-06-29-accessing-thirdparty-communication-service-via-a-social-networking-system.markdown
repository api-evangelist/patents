title: Accessing third-party communication service via a social networking system
abstract: A user interface in a social networking system enables users to connect to and interact with each other using a third-party communication service, such as a VoIP or video chat service. A user initiates an interaction with another user in the social networking system, which passes the users' information to the third-party communication service provider to allow it to provide the requested service. The social networking system may pass an encrypted identifier for the users so that the third-party communication service does not have access to the real identities of the social networking system's users. A user of the social networking system may use this process to video conference with users of the third-party communication service, rather than just other users of the social networking system, and vice versa.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Overview"],"p":["This invention relates generally to social networking and, in particular, to accessing a third-party communication service (such as VoIP or video chat) via a social networking system.","When users of a social networking system wish to use a third-party communication service, they typically access the communication service via a web browser or mobile device independently of the social networking system. For example, a third-party communication service may enable users to make free long distance phone calls via voice over IP (VoIP) technology through computers, digital telephony, and mobile devices. Users of a social networking system must create a separate account (e.g., login and password) on these third-party communication services and sometimes must download particular client software to use the third-party communication services.","An open login system of user authentication has been used by social networking systems that enables users to login into the social networking system with their login and password credentials only once via a social plug-in in a web browser. Thereafter, a user may log into a third-party system using his or her login and password credentials for the social networking system. This open login system has enabled third-party systems to use information gathered by the social networking system, such as a user's name, photo, age, and location. This information is only shared with third-party systems with the express consent of the user. Additionally, the third-party system does not receive the unique user identifier of the user logging in, but instead, they receive only the user-authorized information that has been gathered on the social networking system.","Despite the emergence of open login systems, social networking systems have not enabled users to access third-party communication systems from within the social networking systems. Specialized technology that operates on third-party communication services, such as the VoIP phone calls mentioned above, are not used via social networking systems. Additionally, administrators of social networking systems, in an effort to protect the security and privacy of their users, are hesitant to share the unique user identifiers associated with their users with third-party communication services.","Embodiments of the invention provide a user interface in a social networking system that enables users to connect to and interact with each other using a third-party communication service (e.g., a video chat or other communication session) without their identities being shared with the third-party communication service. In one embodiment, a user initiates an interaction with another user from an interface of the social networking system, where the interaction is to be carried out by the third-party communication service provider. If either of the users is not already a user of the third-party communication service, the social networking system passes an encrypted identifier for those users so that the third-party communication service does not have access to the unique user identifiers of the social networking system's users. The third-party communication service may generate a \u201cshadow identifier\u201d for each of the users and communicate the shadow identifier back to the social networking system for associating with each user's account. Thereafter, the social networking system uses these shadow identifiers to identify the users when negotiating context on behalf of the users for any interactions using the third-party communication service. This allows the social networking system to prevent sharing of the users' identities with the third-party communication service provider while allowing the social networking system to enable its users to use the third-party communication service from within the social networking system.","In another embodiment, a user of the third-party communication service can use a user interface of the third-party communication service to initiate an interaction (e.g., a video chat or other communication session) with a user of a social networking system. In this embodiment, the third-party communication service may generate a shadow identifier for a plurality of users of the social networking system and communicate the shadow identifiers to the social networking system, which stores the shadow identifiers in connection with the users' accounts. The third-party communication service initiates an interaction with the receiving user in the social networking system by specifying that user's shadow identifier to the social networking system. In response, the social networking system provides a user interface to the user receiving this interaction to allow the requested interaction between the two users. For a video chat, for example, the social networking system may pop up a video chat window and establish a video chat session with the initiating user of the third-party communication service. This enables users of the third-party communication service to interact with users of the social networking system without the third-party communication service knowing the identity of the user who is receiving the interaction from within the social networking system.","In one embodiment, the social networking system maintains presence information for its users. The social networking system may then provide a user interface for a particular user that lists that user's connections in the social networking system, and this listing may be based on the presence information for those connections (e.g., showing only available connections). In embodiments where the initiating user is using an interface of the third-party communication service, the third-party communication service may obtain the presence information for that user's connections in the social networking system, e.g., by using APIs provides by the social networking system and referencing the user by his or her shadow identifier. In this way, users can initiate interactions using an interface that shows social and presence information, regardless of whether they are accessing the services from the social networking system or the third-party communication service, while preventing sharing of user identities with the third-party communication service.","The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.","A social networking system offers its users the ability to communicate and interact with other users of the social networking system. Users join the social networking system and add connections to a number of other users to whom they desire to be connected. Users of a social networking system can provide information describing themselves, and the information is stored by the social networking system as user profile information. For example, a user can provide age, gender, geographical location, education history, employment history and the like. The information provided by users may be used by the social networking system to direct information to the user. For example, the social networking system may recommend social groups, events, and potential friends to a user.","In addition to declarative information provided by users, social networking systems may also record users' actions on the social networking system. These actions include communications with other users, sharing photos, interactions with applications that operate on the social networking system (such as a social gaming application), responding to a poll, adding an interest, and joining an employee network, just to name a few. A social networking system may also be able to capture external website data that is accessed by its users. This external website data may include websites that are frequently visited, links that are selected, and other browsing data. Information about users, such as their interests in particular users and other objects, can be generated from these recorded actions by the social networking system using appropriate models.","Because of the vast amount of information that can be captured, analyzed, and inferred about users of a social networking system, administrators of the social networking system are highly protective of the identities of their users. The privacy of user profile information and security of the gathered information about users is highly guarded and valued by administrators of a social networking system because this information enables highly targeted advertising based on the interests recorded, analyzed, and inferred based on user profile information. Though partnerships with third-party communication services may be lucrative and beneficial to users of both the social networking system and third-party communication services, the identities of the users of the social networking system must be protected to maintain the value of the information gathered about these users.","Integrating a third-party communication service into a social networking system benefits both groups of users. For example, a third-party communication service, such as a video chat service provider, can be integrated into the social networking experience, taking advantage social actions such as displaying news stories to a user that indicate the availability of connections for phone calls via the user's computer or mobile device. Some connections may be prioritized in the news feed based on the user's affinity for those connections. In this way, users of the social networking system receive a more personalized experience by showing the presence information of other users that are available to take a phone call via a VoIP telephony service provider, a third-party communication service, from within the social networking system.","To integrate the third-party communication service while addressing the privacy and data security concerns of administrators, a social networking system may encrypt the user identifiers associated with users of the social networking system and pass these encrypted user identifiers to the third-party communication service to generate shadow identifiers. These shadow identifiers can be associated with the user profiles of users on the social networking system such that they can be identified by the third-party communication service. This enables users of the social networking system to use the third-party communication service without creating a separate account on the third-party communication service. The third-party communication service utilizes the shadow identifiers that it dynamically generates from the received encrypted user identifiers from the social networking system on a rolling basis as users of the social networking system take advantage of the service from within the social networking experience. In this way, the social networking system and the third-party communication service may utilize the shadow identifiers to identify and connect users from within the social networking system via a client device, such as a web browser or mobile application, without divulging the identities of the users of the social networking system to the third-party communication service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","112","132","100","110","112","132"]},"The social networking system  stores various objects comprising information related to users, connections between users, or other entities represented in the social networking system . These objects include user profile objects  that store information describing the users of the social networking system , connection objects  that describe connections of the users of the social networking system , encrypted user ID objects  that are created by a user ID encrypting module  to mask the identities of users of the social networking system  to third-party communication services, and call session objects  that include information about calls made and received by users of the social networking system . The encrypted user ID objects  are passed from the social networking system  to a third-party communication service . Using the encrypted user ID objects , the third-party communication service  utilizes a shadow identifier generating module  to create shadow identifier objects  for use by the third-party communication service  and the social networking system  to identify users of a social networking system . The third-party communication service  passes the generated shadow identifier objects  back to the social networking system  so that the shadow identifier objects  may be utilized to refer to the users of the social networking system  without revealing private and guarded information about their identities, including full name, email address, and date of birth. In another embodiment, the encrypted user ID objects  may be utilized by the third-party communication service  as shadow identifier objects  to refer to the users of the social networking system.","Users of the social networking system  may initiate a call as a calling user  through a video calling interface module . The initiated call is handled by a call handling module , which utilizes a video call send communications module  and video call receive communications module  to establish the video conference call through the third-party communication service. Receiving users  then receive an indication through a video receiving interface module  that a call is being received. If the call is accepted by the receiving users , the call is established by the third-party communication service via the video call send communications module  and video call receive communications module  between the calling users  and receiving users .","A video calling interface module  provides an interface through which calling users  may select other users to communicate with through the third-party communication service. Alternatively, the video calling interface module  may be referred to as a communications interface, in other embodiments. The video calling interface module  includes selectable avatars associated with available connections  on the social networking system  that are available to receive a call. A calling user  may select one or more available connections  to initiate a video conferencing call through the video calling interface module . In one embodiment, the video calling interface module  also uses the information about users of the social networking system  as provided in their respective user profile objects  to prioritize available connections  displayed to the calling user .","The video calling interface module  receives the selected available connections  and provides an indication to the calling user  for display that the call request is being processed. If the call is accepted by the receiving users , then the video calling interface module  receives audiovisual content through the device that is displaying the video calling interface, such as a computer operating a web browser or a mobile device running an application connected to the social networking system. In one embodiment, the video calling interface module  integrates technology created by a third-party communication service to receive, compress, and transmit audiovisual content into the interface used by calling users . In another embodiment, the technology is embedded into the interface using iFrames, HTML, XML, and\/or a proprietary markup language created by administrators of the social networking system.","Like the video calling interface module , the video receiving interface module  uses technology created by the third-party communication service. Alternatively, the video receiving interface module  may be referred to as a receiver interface. When a call is initiated by a calling user , the video receiving interface module  displays an indication to the receiving user  that a call request is being sent by the calling user . If the call is accepted, the video conferencing call is established between the calling user  and the receiving user  and audiovisual content, including streaming video content, is sent to and received from the receiving user . In one embodiment, the video receiving interface module  integrates the technology to receive, compress, and transmit audiovisual content into the interface used by receiving users . In another embodiment, the technology is embedded into the interface using iFrames, HTML, XML, and\/or a proprietary markup language created by administrators of the social networking system.","User profile objects  are associated with users on the social networking system . The user profile objects  include declared profile information and analyzed information gathered by the social networking system  as recorded through interactions on the social networking system  and external websites. In addition, user profile objects  are uniquely identified by a user identifier. Every user on the social networking system  is associated with a unique user identifier. These user identifiers are first encrypted by the user ID encrypting module  when a calling user  initiates a call with a receiving user  on the social networking system  for the first time, in one embodiment. In an alternative embodiment, user identifiers may be encrypted by the user ID encrypting module  in a batch process. The third-party communication service  receives encrypted user ID objects  for the calling user  and the receiving user  in order to generate shadow identifier objects  using a shadow identifier generating module , in one embodiment. The third-party communication service  then sends the generated shadow identifier objects  to the social networking system . The shadow identifier objects  are then associated with either the calling user  or the receiving user . The shadow identifier objects  and the encrypted user ID objects  are permanently associated with the user profile objects  associated with the calling user  and receiving user , in one embodiment. In another embodiment, encrypted user ID objects  may be used as shadow identifier objects  to reference the associated user profile objects  for the calling user  and receiving user .","Connection objects  represent users that are connected to calling users . Connections may include direct connections (e.g., \u201cfriends\u201d) as well as indirect connections (e.g., \u201cfriends of friends,\u201d or users in the same network, group, place, or geographic location). For example, a calling user  may wish to video conference with another user that went to the same college. In one embodiment, indirect connections may be available connections  that the calling user  could call via the third-party communication service. Additionally, available connections  may also include users of the third-party communication service that are not users of the social networking system . Connections, both direct and indirect, may select an option to make themselves available to calls from other users on the social networking system  and the third-party communication service, in one embodiment. Connections may also select specific times of the day to specify availability. By referring to these users of the third-party communication service by shadow identifiers, both the social networking system  and the third-party communication service may maintain presence information for those users to indicate their availability. After available connections  are selected by a calling user  and a call is initiated, they become receiving users , as shown in .","A call handling module  manages calls initiated by calling users  and generates call session objects  that record information about established calls, such as time, date, calling user , receiving user(s) , and the calling user  and receiving user(s)'s encrypted user ID objects  and shadow identifier objects , if applicable. A transaction record is stored in the call session object  for each of the managed calls. The call handling module  also coordinates messaging between the video calling interface module , video receiving interface module , video call send communications module , video call receive communications module , shadow identifier generating module , and the user ID encrypting module . For example, a call initiated by a calling user  using the video calling interface module  sends a message to the call handling module  that a new call is being established. A call session object  is generated for this new call, recording the time, date, calling user 's associated user profile object , receiving user(s)'s  associated user profile object , and the generated encrypted user ID objects  and shadow identifier objects  for the calling user  and receiving user(s) . Encrypted user ID objects  may only be generated on the first call initiated by a calling user  or the first call received by a receiving user , in one embodiment. Thereafter, the encrypted user ID objects  are associated with the user profile objects  for calling users  and receiving users . Similarly, shadow identifier objects  are only generated if the calling user  or the receiving user  does not have an account on the third-party communication service, in one embodiment. In another embodiment, shadow identifier objects  are generated for calling users  and receiving users  during their first initiated or received call regardless of whether accounts already exist for those users on the third-party communication service.","The call handling module  also provides information about users of the social networking system  to the third-party communication service, such as profile picture, location, age, gender, and limited connection information. The call handling module  shares this information about users of the social networking system  without providing identifying information, such as the email address, mailing address, phone number, or the unique user identifier used by the social networking system  to identify its users. The call handling module  receives information about users from user profile objects  and then uses the user ID encrypting module  to generate encrypted user ID objects  to mask the identities of users of the social networking system . The call handling module  also coordinates the requests for a video conferencing call initiated by calling users  to available connections .","The call handling module  also provides presence information, or call availability, to the video calling interface module  to identify available connections  to the calling user  that are available for a video conferencing call. In one embodiment, connections must specifically allow calling users  to sense their online presence. In another embodiment, connections may specify what times and days they are available for video conferencing. In yet another embodiment, connections that are actively using the social networking system  are considered available connections . Available connections  may also include users of the third-party communication service that are not already users of the social networking system .","Receiving users , or available connections  that have been selected to receive a call from a calling user , receive an indication that a calling user  has initiated a call request. The indication may be implemented as any communication with users on the social networking system , including email messages, wall posts, pop-up notifications, text messages, and instant messages. Once the request to initiate the call has been accepted by the receiving user , the call handling module  instantiates a video receiving interface module  to establish the video conference call with the calling user .","System Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","100","204","214","222"]},"The client devices  comprise one or more computing devices that can receive user input and can transmit and receive data via the network .

Thus, the network  can include links using technologies such as Ethernet, 802.11, worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), 3G, digital subscriber line (DSL), etc. Similarly, the networking protocols used on the network  can include multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), the transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), the hypertext transport protocol (HTTP), the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), and the file transfer protocol (FTP). The data exchanged over the network  can be represented using technologies and\/or formats including the hypertext markup language (HTML) and the extensible markup language (XML). In addition, all or some of links can be encrypted using conventional encryption technologies such as secure sockets layer (SSL), transport layer security (TLS), and Internet Protocol security (IPsec).","A third-party communication service  operates its own servers separate from the social networking system .

In another embodiment, the third-party communication service  operates on a device having computer functionality, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), mobile telephone, smart-phone, etc. The third-party communication service  is configured to communicate via network . The third-party communication service  may employ its own proprietary technology to capture, compress, and transmit audiovisual content over the network . This technology may also include javascript plug-ins, embedded video compression technology, and standard audio\/video codecs. Conventional components such as network interfaces, security functions, load balancers, failover servers, management and network operations consoles, and the like are not shown because the details of the third-party communication service  are unknown to administrators of the social networking system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","100","102","104","114","116","118","122","212","128","218","220","206","208","210","100"]},"The web server  links the social networking system  via the network  to one or more client devices , the third-party communication service , and third-party communication service client devices ; the web server  serves web pages, as well as other web-related content, such as Java, Flash, XML, and so forth. The web server  may provide the functionality of receiving and routing messages between the social networking system  and the client devices , for example, instant messages, queued messages (e.g., email), text and SMS (short message service) messages, or messages sent using any other suitable messaging technique. A user can send a request to the web server  to send a video chat request to a user of a third-party communication service, for example, using information found in that user's user profile object  stored in the user profile store . This chat request, sent via a client device , can be transmitted through the social networking system  to a third-party communication service , which in turn sends a request to the associated third-party communication service client device  via the network . Additionally, the web server  may provide API functionality to send data directly to native client device operating systems, such as iOS, DROID, webOS, and RIM on client devices  as well as a third-party communication service client device .","The web server  may also serve web pages including profile information extracted from user profile objects  via the network  to a third-party communication service . The third-party communication service  may utilize the profile information to maintain online presence information of other users of the social networking system  that are connected to a user and display this presence information on a third-party communication service client device  via a web browser or native application.

The user profile store  also maintains information about objects in the encrypted user identifier store , call session store , connection store , and shadow identifier store  that the users performed actions on. For example, the fact that a user that regularly calls another user on the social networking system  may be stored in both users' user profile objects  stored in the user profile store  and their call session objects , shadow identifier objects , and encrypted user identifier objects  would be associated with their user profile objects . In one embodiment, the user profile store  also maintains the connections of the users of the social networking system . In this way, a module may access the user profile object  of a user and identify the user profile objects  that are the user's connections on the social networking system .

The social networking system  then receives  a response to the request to initiate the video conference call from the client device associated with a receiving user . If the receiving user  accepted the call, then the social networking system  and the third-party communication service  establishes  a video conference call between the calling and receiving users using the shadow identifiers. Through this video conference call, audio\/video content may be communicated between the client devices . In other embodiments, other types of communication protocols may be established , such as file-sharing, VoIP telephony, and remote virus detection.","In one embodiment, the third-party communication service  receives presence information about the available connections  of a calling user  based on the presence information of users maintained by the social networking system . The social networking system  sends presence information about shadow identifiers based on the presence information of its users in response to a query from the third-party communication service . Similarly, the third-party communication service  may share presence information with the social networking system  about its users via shadow identifiers on a rolling basis, periodically sending batch updates. In another embodiment, presence information may be shared in real-time between the social networking system  and the third-party communication service .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A and 5B","b":["100","222","214","100","100","214","100","214","100","100"]},"In this embodiment, a user of the social networking system , such as Deena, may decide to be available for video conference calls from users of the third-party communication service . In this example, there is no pre-existing connection between Charlie and Deena, but Deena is connected to a friend of Charlie's on the third-party communication service , Nicole, who is a user of both the third-party communication service  and the social networking system . Nicole enabled her connections on the social networking system  to be shared with the third-party communication service . In doing so, encrypted user identifiers of Nicole's connections on the social networking system  were communicated to the third-party communication service  and shadow identifiers were generated via the processes described above and specifically illustrated in . Consequently, the social networking system  and the third-party communication service  may identify the presence and\/or availability of users of the social networking system  using their associated shadow identifiers. As a result, the third-party communication service  has received Deena's shadow identifier.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 5A","b":["100","214","100","500","100","100","100","100","100","202","500"]},"A third-party communication service  maintains  presence information of available users on the third-party communication service  using shadow identifiers associated with the available users. The third-party communication service  maintains  this information about its own users so that it may reference its own users to the social networking system  to provide presence information. The third-party communication service  also maintains  shadow identifier objects associated with users of the social networking system  based on their encrypted user identifiers.","As more users of the social networking system  become available, the social networking system  provides  this availability and limited profile information about these users to the third-party communication service , identifying these users by encrypted user identifiers. With this new information, the third-party communication service  searches  for shadow identifiers matching the provided  encrypted user identifiers. If shadow identifiers are not found for received encrypted user identifiers of available users of the social networking system , then shadow identifiers are generated  for those encrypted user identifiers.","In this way, the third-party communication service  and the social networking system  are able to maintain  presence information for users of the third-party communication service  and users of the social networking system , identifying all users by shadow identifiers. By periodically repeating  step , providing available users of the social networking system  to the third-party communication service , the presence information of those users may be maintained  by the third-party communication service . Although not illustrated, the third-party communication service  may also provide presence information of the third-party communication service  that are available, identifying these users by shadow identifiers, so that the social networking system  may maintain  the presence information of those users. In the above example, Deena, a user of the social networking system , has opted to be available to receive calls from users of the third-party communication service , such as Charlie, even though they are not connected on either the social networking system  or the third-party communication service . Deena's presence information is maintained  by the social networking system  when Deena logs in on her client device . Deena's shadow identifier had already been generated and communicated to the third-party communication service , so when her presence as an available user is provided  to the third-party communication service , a shadow identifier associated with her encrypted user identifier is found when searched  for by the third-party communication service . Thus, Deena's availability and presence information is maintained  by the third-party communication service . Charlie, a user of the third-party communication service , may be provided Deena's limited profile information and her presence information as an available user to initiate a video conference call. A calling user using a third-party communication service client device  may select  an available user of the social networking system  to call.","In another embodiment, a user of the third-party communication service  may select  to initiate a call with a connection on the third-party communication service  who is also a user of the social networking system . For example, Edward may be a user of both the third-party communication service  and the social networking system . In this case, Edward would already have an identifier on the third-party communication service  which would serve as a shadow identifier for identifying Edward to the social networking system , in one embodiment. If Edward, using the third-party communication service client device, wanted to know which of his friends on the social networking system  were available for a call, the user identifier associated with Edward on the social networking system would be unknown to the third-party communication service . In one embodiment, the third-party communication service  could utilize an application programming interface (API) provided by the social networking system  to verify Edward's identity on the social networking system . This would enable Edward's encrypted user identifier to be communicated to the third-party communication service  and a shadow identifier could be generated from the received encrypted user identifier. Edward's identifier on the third-party communication service  may be associated with this newly generated shadow identifier, in one embodiment. As a result, the third-party communication service  may utilize the application programming interface provided by the social networking system  to retrieve Edward's available connections on the social networking system  by the newly generated shadow identifier associated with Edward. In this way, Edward's user identifier on the social networking system  remains unknown to the third-party communication service .","Franc, an available connection who uses both the social networking system  and the third-party communication service , may be identified as an available user for Edward to call using shadow identifiers, even if Franc had not added Edward as a connection on the third-party communication service , provided that Franc and Edward are connected users on the social networking system . Using the provided application programming interface, two users, both using a third-party communication service client device , may discover each other on the third-party communication service  by the shadow identifiers that identify them as connections on the social networking system  and connect on a video conference call, in one embodiment. In another embodiment, the third-party communication service  augments a user's contact list on the third-party communication service  with connected users on the social networking system  after information is shared between the third-party communication service  and the social networking system .","In yet another embodiment, a user of the third-party communication service  may select  to initiate a call with a random user of the social networking system  that is available. For example, Gorden, a user of the third-party communication service , may wish to initiate a call with a random available user on the social networking system . Holly, a user of the social networking system , may be chosen by the social networking system  as an available user for Gorden to call. In this embodiment, the calling user , Gorden in this example, may be provided with targeting criteria to filter the random available users on the social networking system . For example, Gorden may wish to make a video conference call with any single female aged 25-35 that lives near San Diego, Calif. Other targeting criteria may include school attended, interests, friends of friends only, and so forth. Receiving users , such as Holly, may accept or decline the request to initiate a video conference call. Because the presence information of users like Holly is maintained  by the third-party communication service  in conjunction with the social networking system  using shadow identifiers, as described above, the privacy and security of Holly's user identifier is not divulged. In summary, available connections for users of either the social networking system  or the third-party communication service  may include direct connections on the social networking system , suggested connections based on similar affinities for users and interests, indirect connections, or even users of a third-party communication service  that are not users of the social networking system . User identifiers for these users on the social networking system  (if applicable) are not shared with the third-party communication service , but instead shadow identifiers are used to reference these users to display their availability to other users of the social networking system  and the third-party communication service .","Referring to , a third-party communication service  receives  a request to call a user of the social networking system  from a third-party communication service client device . A request from the third-party communication service  is received  to create a video conference call with the selected receiving user by the social networking system  shadow identifier associated with the selected receiving user  on the social networking system .","The social networking system  requests  the client device  of the social networking system  to initiate a video conference call. The client device  selects  a response to the request to initiate a video conference call from a pop-up window in a user interface rendered on the client device . The social networking system  receives  a response to the request to initiate a video conference call from the client device . If the call is accepted by the receiving user  via the client device , then the social networking system  establishes  a video conference call between the calling user  and the receiving user  via the social networking system  and the third-party communication service  using the shadow identifiers for the calling and receiving users.","Accessing Other Types of Third-Party Communication Services","Although the Figures have described a video conferencing third-party communication service, other types of third-party communication services may use the same basic infrastructure, including the user identifier encrypting module , a sending  and receiving  communications module, sending  and receiving  interface modules, a communication handling module  (or communication protocol module), a shadow identifier generating module , and the objects created by the modules. Other types of third-party communication services may include other social networking systems; content publishing services, such as blogging and micro-blogging platforms; file sharing platforms, including video, music, and document sharing platforms; traditional phone companies that use their own login credential system; e-commerce inventory systems, including physical inventory resellers; music distribution platforms; and corporate enterprise systems that track inventory, shipments, and sales. In short, any third-party system that uses a communication service with separate login credentials for users may utilize the modules described above so that users of a social networking system may access these third-party communication services from a client device of the social networking system.","Summary","The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purpose of illustration; it is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed.
