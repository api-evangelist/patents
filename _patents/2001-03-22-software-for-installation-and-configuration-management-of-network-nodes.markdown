title: Software for installation and configuration management of network nodes
abstract: A software method and apparatus for installing and configuring network nodes in a wireless local area network by detecting noise levels on each of the available channels in the network. Each stationary access points listens on the available channels on the network. Each of the stationary access points determines a prioritized list of preferred frequencies or channels of operation based on the noise levels from the surrounding channels in use by other stationary access points. The listening stationary access point chooses a frequency and sets itself to the associated channel based on the strength of the other signals on that channel in the network.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE PRIOR ART","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention relates to software for network management and installation procedures for wireless local area networks, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for specifying operational characteristics of a network node by determining the most suitable available channel for communication in a cell between a fixed access point of a wireless local area network and mobile units operating in the cell.","Wireless local area networks (WLANs) use infrared (IR) or radio frequency (RF) communications channels to communicate between portable or mobile computer terminals and stationary access points or base stations. These access points are connected by a wired or wireless communication channels to a network infrastructure which connects groups of access points together to from a local area network (LAN), which can include one or more host computers. In turn, the LAN can be connected to another larger network such as the Internet and the World Wide Web (Web). Several protocols, including the IEEE 802.11 standard, \u201cWireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications\u201d have been designed to standardize WLAN communications. Such standardization is useful for optimizing user requirements, including interoperability, spatial layout, response time, loading and throughput requirements of the network.","\u201cRoaming\u201d terminals are mobile units that can associate with any stationary access point (SAP) in range within a WLAN, and may seamlessly move from SAP to SAP. Each roaming terminal analyzes received signals from access points in its vicinity and associates with a single access point. Communication with an access point connects a terminal with the LAN and therefore with external networks such as the Internet. The region around an access point can be referred to as a \u201ccell\u201d. Roaming terminals can move from cell to cell and remain connected to the LAN and any other network to which the roaming terminal is connected.","The IEEE 802.11 standard defines as the frequencies or channels used for WLAN communications. Typically, a SAP must be manually configured to a particular set of frequency channels for use in a frequency hopping or direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) modulation technique. For example, in the 802.11b DSSS standard, there are three non-interfering channels spaced 25 MHz apart in the 2.4 GHz band (channels 1,6, and 11 in Table 1 hereunder). Multiple IEEE 802.11b networks may operate in the same area by suitable section of the channel for each SAP. This channel configuration is normally set manually by the user or by factory default. Such techniques are disadvantageous since the manually setting of channels, or the selection and installation of factory-set SAPs at particular locations, is error prone. Moreover, even if configured correctly on installation, the selected installation pattern and frequency designations may not be optimal at all times due to data traffic, interference, or other time-dependent conditions during actual use.","Often times there can be several unrelated WLANs or \u201cExtended Service Sets\u201d belonging to different entities in a dense area such as an office building. The SAPs of these unrelated WLANs may use the same frequencies in close proximity. Therefore it is possible for a roaming unit associated with one WLAN to encounter interference with a communication link on an unrelated WLAN. This situation is not desirable. Thus, it is desirable for the SAPs to be able to implement an the optimum pattern or distribution of channel frequencies and have the ability to switch between channels to utilize the best communication link with the nearest available SAP.","In general, the invention features a method and apparatus for WLAN channel management. The method and apparatus allow at either initial installation, on power-up, or during the course of use, the SAPs to negotiate and select a matrix pattern of independent, non-overlapping channels or center frequencies as defined by the IEEE 802.11 standard.","In general, in one aspect, the invention features a method of selecting a center frequency channel in a DSSS communications system for a transmission node on a wireless network. Each SAP inherently has the capability of using any of the allowable frequency channels. Under the IEEE 0802.11 standard, and national spectrum allocations, multiple center channels or center frequencies are available for the SAP to transmit. The method includes detecting a plurality of channel signals from surrounding nodes using a radio receiver, determining characteristics from each of the signals based on predefined desired signal-to-noise ratios, retry rates, or other criteria, and selecting a mode of operation and center frequency based upon achieving the maximum signal-to-noise of the signal available for use by that node.","Implementations may include one or more of the following techniques. A unique frequency for transmission may be selected from a set of available channels. The detection of signals from surrounding nodes may be periodically modified if a selected frequency becomes unsuitable for transmission. Transmission nodes may be physically placed according to minimize interference.","In general, in another aspect, the invention features a method of installing a set of stationary access points in a new network location, and automatically specifying the channel for each SAP. The method includes simultaneously applying power to the access points to initiate an installation software program on each access point, listening in each access point on all prescribed frequency channels for a period of time to determine the channel with the lowest frequency, selecting the frequency channel with the lowest noise level, setting the frequency channel for the access point to the selected channel and activating the access point to emit signals and operate on the channel most suitable.","Implementations may include one or more of the following processes. It may be determined that noise will be reduced is switching to a specific alternative channel is performed. A test signal may be synchronized on the alternative channel where noise levels may be measured and evaluated. This process may be repeated on different alternative channels until the optimum channel is selected.","The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","100","10","11","12","13","11","11","14","12","13","12","13","14","15","15"]},"The network may have a large number of base stations, typically up to sixty-four, and several hundred remote units .

Although hand-held laser-scan type bar code readers are one example, the remote units  may also be bar code readers of the wand or CCD-type, and may be stationary rather than hand-held. The device may be of the optical character recognition (OCR) type as well. Other types of data gathering devices may implement these features, such as temperature or pressure measuring devices, event counters, voice or sound activated devices, intrusion detectors and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","12","13","14","10","220","221","222","223","224","223","225","20","222","11"]},"The base stations , ,  each utilize a CPU  connected to a memory  through a bus . A communications adapter connects the bus  to the communications link . An RF transceiver  is connected to the CPU  in each base station , ,  through the local bus  and is connected to an antenna  for RF transmission and reception from the remote units  using a transmit\/receive exchange protocol. In one embodiment, the exchange protocol is similar to a collision-sense multiple access (CSMA). A detailed discussion of this exchange protocol is discussed below with respect to . An additional RF transceiver can be used as an RF link to and from other base stations, if necessary.","Base stations , ,  are typically stationary units that use line power and often not accessible to an operator. The RF signal path in a typical environment is changeable because equipment in the environment may move around as well as the locations of the remote units . As a result, the particular base station that is in communication with the remote unit  can change. In an implementation, a \u201chand-off\u201d protocol is used to change the base station, which is designated to communicate with the remote unit . In this manner, a remote unit  has a confirmed virtual link with only one base station at a time, although other base stations maybe in range. The base stations , ,  act as intermediaries for the communication link between the remote unit  and the host computer .

The elements of the entry device  and the display  are scanned by signals generated in the CPU , or generated in an entry device and display I\/O controller. In one embodiment, the I\/O controller is an Intel\u00ae 8052 micro controller.","As discussed above, in one embodiment, a transmit\/receive exchange protocol is used by the remote unit  to communicate with the base units , , . The exchange protocol is similar to a collision-sense multiple access (CSMA). The remote unit  first listens before transmitting, and does not transmit if the channel is not free. If an RF channel is quiet a transceiver in the remote unit  starts a transmission. A transceiver in the remote unit  typically begins a data exchange at its own initiative by first listening for other traffic for a brief time interval to, and, if the RF channel is quiet, starting a transmission at a time of its own selection. An outgoing transmission data packet lasts for a certain time interval t, then at a precise time delay tthe mobile unit  starts its transmission, the transceiver  begins listening for a return data packet from the base stations , , . The remote unit  waits for a very small time interval tfor this return, or \u201cacknowledge\u201d packet. If this packet is not returned during this time interval t, the remote unit  ignores any data packets that follow. Because the mobile units  control the data exchange between the remote units  and the base stations , , , the CPU  handles all exchange related tasks including data input from the bar scanner , keyboard and display scans, RF control, data stream transfers to and from the RF, and data coding and encoding. The remote unit  is therefore the primary controller of RF transmission and reception. The remote units  send a periodic data packet with no data to the base stations , ,  in case the base stations , ,  have data to transmit to the remote units .","As discussed above, the mobile unit  can be a portable computer. The portable computer can be used for a variety of computing purposes including but not limited to Internet access, data collection, messaging, word processing, scheduling, mathematical computation, and the like. For these purposes, the portable computer is loaded with an operating system. In an embodiment, the operating system can be any DOS or Windows platform. In specific embodiments, the operating system can be Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows CE, Palm O.S, Linux, or others. In one embodiment, the memory  can be random access memory into which the operating system is loaded. In another embodiment, the memory  can be any type of firmware such as EPROM or EEPROM into which the operating system is \u201cburned\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["430","430","430","341","343","344"]},"An application environment  contains one or more software application processes , .

Each access point is initially unprogrammed or generic with respect to the channel or frequency set at which it is to operate. This simplifies the installation task, since personnel do not have to match pre-programmed units to blueprint locations, or perform manual switch setting on each unit.","Conventionally, each base station site is thought of as covering a \u201ccell\u201d, being an area in which a mobile station located therein will communicate with the base station. If two adjacent base stations in adjacent cells are operating on the same carrier frequency at the same time, there is a likelihood of interference between communications of the two adjacent base stations. It is therefore necessary to ensure as far as possible that this situation does not occur. It is known to use various mechanisms to increase the channel carrying capacity of individual channel frequencies within band spectrum.","The problem of assigning carrier frequencies to base stations in a non-interfering manner, is referred to as the frequency assignment problem. When the frequency assignment problem is extended to include the assignment of channels to carrier frequencies, this is referred to as the channel assignment problem.","In a conventional simple hexagonal cell model as shown in  herein, different carrier frequencies A, B, C are assigned to base stations located at the centers of hexagonal cell. In this frequency assignment scheme, cells using the same carrier frequency are separated by two other cells in between. For example cell A is separated from another cell A by intervening cells B and C. Similarly, cell B is separated from another B cell by intervening cells A and C operating at non-interfering different carrier frequencies.","In this embodiment, a network is initially configured in a location with more than one SAP . Each of the SAPs is configured to \u201csniff\u201d or listen to the channels for other SAPs in a given area. This \u201csniffing\u201d can be achieved by periodically tuning the receiver of the SAP to different channels. On listening for the other SAPs, the sniffing SAP registers amount of noise on the channels or frequency of transmission of the surrounding SAPs , and then selects a unique optimum frequency from the available set under the IEEE 802.11 standard, and FCC guidelines.","In particular, the method according to the present invention is implemented by the following method operations, as set forth in the flow chart of .","First, one installs the set of access points over the region to achieve a desired spatial coverage for the wireless communication network ().","Second, one simultaneously applies power to the set of access points to initiate an installation software program on each access point (). The software program functions to enable each access point to listen on each frequency channel in each of the allowable frequency bands for a period of time T to determine the channels with the lowest average noise level (), and then using such test and sample data, selecting a prioritized sequence of preferred frequency bands for operation (). The software program in each access point then executes a random number generator. Each access point will then have be provided with a different number, which is used to specify which access point chooses first its preferred frequency band, i.e. the random number determines a prioritized sequence of access points in the set for activation ().","In the first access point in the prioritized sequence of the set, the frequency band with the lowest noise level is selected, and the software program specifies operation in that frequency band for operation by the first access point, and activates such access point to operate in such band.","Then, in the second and subsequent access points in the prioritized sequence of N access points in the set, one listens on each frequency channel, and selects the frequency band with the lowest noise level, now considering the emitted signals from each previously activated access point. The software program identifies the frequency band among those available with the lowest average noise level, and activates each such access point in turn to operate its selected band (). The process is iterated as is required with different groups of access points ().","Since the selection of a frequency band for one SAP will change the \u201cnoise\u201d level on that frequency band for other SAPs, the subsequent iterations exclude the already selected frequency band from the prioritized sequence in each other SAP. This may be done under control of a central network management unit, or simply by activating the SAP with the selected frequency band and letting the second and subsequent access points listen on the channels for all previously activated access points.","In a second embodiment of the present invention, the SAPs are installed and operational. The SAP software program periodically monitors the noise distribution over the allowable frequency bands from time to time during operation. For example, if during operation, the SAP has a large number of retries, the SAP follows the same process as discussed above, by initiating a \u201ctime-out\u201d for operations in that unit and tuning the receiver to different channels or frequencies excluding the current channel or frequency of transmission. The goal of the sniffing is for the SAP  to see the current noise or interference level on each of the frequencies of the available frequency bands, and to select a different one if that selection will improve performance.","The second embodiment then provides a method of revising the frequency assignment for a set of stationary access points (SAP) for a local area network, each access point having associated with it a single fixed frequency band or hopping pattern selected from a number N prescribed frequency bands, more specifically defined by the following operations. First,","in each access point, listen on each frequency channel in each of the frequency bands for a period of time T to determine the channels with the lowest average noise level, and selecting a preferred frequency band for operation in that SAP.","One then executes a random number generator in each installation software program in each SAP in the set of N access point to select a prioritized sequence of access points in the set to activate.","Then in the first access point in the prioritized sequence of the first set, select the frequency band with the lowest noise level, setting and specifying operation in that frequency band for operation by that access point, and activate such access point to operate in such band.","Finally, in the second and subsequent access points in the prioritized sequence of N access points in the first set, select the frequency band with the lowest noise level considering the emitted signals from each previously activated access point; specify operation in the frequency band with the lowest average noise level; and activate each such access point in turn.","In a third embodiment of the present invention, the SAPs are installed and operational. The SAP software program periodically monitors the noise distribution over the allowable frequency bands from time to time during operation. For example, if during operation, the SAP has a large number of retries, the SAP notifies a centralized network management unit or configuration controller which initiates a \u201ctime-out\u201d for operations in that unit and a group of adjacent units. Then each timed out unit tunes the receiver to different channels or frequencies excluding the current channel or frequency of transmission of that unit. The goal of the sniffing is for each SAP  to see the current noise or interference level on each of the frequencies of the available frequency bands, and to select a different one if that selection will improve performance. A selection process similar to that in the first and second embodiments may be employed, but now under control of the management unit rather than utilizing a random selection process to prioritize the access points.","As discussed above, typically manufacturers hard code a frequency channel into a SAP. In initial layout of a network, SAPs are installed at locations to achieve a desired spatial coverage for a network. The SAP is loaded with software that soft codes an initial frequency into each SAP  in the ESS or network. The software is initiated by \u201cpower up\u201d or simultaneously applying power to each SAP . In an implementation, the software includes a random number generator that generates an initial frequency for each SAP, helping prevent the SAPs  from choosing the same frequency during initialization. During operation, as provided in the present invention, the SAPs are \u201ctraffic adaptive,\u201d which allows an individual SAP to change or revise its channel of operation if it determines that there are other available channels which are not busy or have lower noise levels.","Each of the individual SAPs , although associated with different cells , can overlap in their range of coverage. To maintain optimal performance, interference from overlapping SAPs can be minimized by choosing different operating frequencies in directly adjacent SAPs through the use of the technique discussed above in the SAP, or through monitoring by the configuration controller  of its set of SAPs, , and reconfiguring each of the SAPs upon command of the controller.","The following table illustrates examples of the of frequencies and respective channel identifier that can be used in an embodiment of the present invention. The table represents only an example of the frequencies that can be used. In other implementations, other frequencies in the 802.11b standard can be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"CHNLID","Frequency (MHz)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u20021","2412"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20022","2417"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20023","2422"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20024","2427"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20025","2432"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20026","2437"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20027","2442"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20028","2447"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20029","2452"]},{"entry":[{},"10","2457"]},{"entry":[{},"11","2462"]},{"entry":[{},"12","2467"]},{"entry":[{},"13","2472"]},{"entry":[{},"14","2484"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 7A","b":["605","610","605","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 7B","FIG. 7A"],"b":["615","625","620","630","2","615","1","605","1","6","3","625","1","1","2","6","11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 7C","FIG. 7B"],"b":["635","4","11","3","1","1","3","4","3"]},"Referring to  a hexagonal cell model, in another situation having many SAP's, it may be that SAP finds that it has a large number of retries from another SAP or unknown RF device. SAP  runs the clear channel-sniffing task, and selects a different channel until the number of retries goes down to an acceptable level. With a high number of retries, the SAP selects different channels until the retries go down. In this example, channel , the current channel, is eliminated and the channels set on SAP, including channels on either side (, , ,  and ). If none of the channels work, then it selects the weakest of SAP and SAP. In the specific example of , only 3 channels (A, B, C) are used.","Still another embodiment of the present invention is the implementation of a network node through the use of a user replaceable PC card or PCMCIA card. Such a card may be plugged into a laptop or portable computer, or even a desktop computer, to enable the computer to act as a network node or bridge between a wired network and a wireless local area network. More specifically, the laptop computer or desktop computer may be connected to a wired network such as the PSTN, or to a LAN through its Ethernet port. Installing the PC card unto the computer will provide the software and a radio transceiver to enable the computer to act as an access point for mobile terminals to wirelessly communicate with the computer, and thereby through the computer to the network.","Since such a desktop or laptop computer may be moved from location to location, and positioned or placed arbitrarily in an existing wireless network environment, it is important that at the initialization stage the PC card provide a program for the transceiver to determine which is the optimum frequency channel in which to operate which may vary from location to location. As in the previous embodiments, the installation of the PC card in the computer initiates a program to listen on the various available channels and to prioritize each of the channels in terms of the noise and characteristics as measured over a period of time. Assuming there is only one card and one computer, the computer program will then execute a program to prioritize the frequency channels in order of acceptability in terms of noise characteristics and elect to operate on the most optimum channel. As in the other embodiments noted above, the PC card software also includes a test mode that will cause the unit to suspend operations and test all channels to see whether the current channel on which operations are taking place is the most optimum channel for use. Such periodic test operations may take place at various time intervals or may be in response to an excessive number of retries due to heavy traffic or load conditions on the channel.","The embodiment more generally provides a software method for extending the functionality of a computer connected to a wired communications network to implement a wireless local area network, in which one","installs a wireless LAN transceiver module in a computer; and","loads software into the computer from the module to provide an interface between the wired communications network and the radio transceiver in the module.","A set of menu controls may be present on a display of the computer to enable the user to define feature and service options for the wireless network such as channel selection and network configuration. The software then configures the wireless LAN module transceiver to process packets to and from the wireless network in accordance with the criteria specified by the user.","Although the above described embodiment envisions the desktop or laptop computer connected to a wired communications network, it is also envisioned that the desktop or laptop computer may connect to other types of computer networks through wireless transceivers or modems for wide area networks, satellite networks, cordless telephone networks, paging networks, and the like. The PC card provides connectivity from a wired network to the wireless local area network, i.e. acts as a bridge between one type of network and a wireless local area network. Even if the desktop or laptop computer is not connected to a second network, the installation of the PC card will still enable the desktop or laptop computer to act as a repeater, or centralized relay or transfer point, to allow mobile units to communicate with each other through the relay or transfer point. Such an application is important in certain types of wireless local area networks which do not envision peer to peer communications, but which are designed to operate through access points. Because of the mobility of a laptop computer or other mobile computer in which the PC card incorporating the software according to the present invention is implemented, and the variable nature of the ambient environment with respect to frequency channel noise, the ability for the transceiver to change frequencies adaptively is a critical aspect of point of utility of the present invention.","Various aspects of the techniques and apparatus may be implemented in digital circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations of them.
