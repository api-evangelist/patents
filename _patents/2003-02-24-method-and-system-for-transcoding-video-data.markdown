title: Method and system for transcoding video data
abstract: A first method of transcoding video data is disclosed that generates a motion vector for a macroblock encoded as a dual prime macro block that has a direct motion vector, and differential motion vector for its two fields respectively. Another method of transcoding includes replacing a skipped P-macroblock that has been used to backward predict a B-Frame with a P-macroblock having a motion vector of zero. Another method of transcoding includes replacing a skipped B-Macroblock with a macroblock having a motion vector from a macroblock of the same frame of the skipped B-Macroblock that is not co-located.

Modifying digital video from a digital video stream having one characteristic to a digital video stream having a different characteristic is referred to generally as video transcoding. Examples of different characteristics include protocol (e.g. MPEG1 and MPEG2) and data rates, such as affected by different quantization values. When all the video information of one video stream is maintained when transcoded a different video stream lossless transcoding is said to occur. For Lossless transcoding to occur it is necessary that that the bandwidth available to the second video stream is sufficient to support the data present in the original video stream.","Currently, lossless video transcoding between protocols is accomplished by decoding a first video stream having a first protocol to generate rendered data (image data), followed by encoding the rendered data to generate a second video data stream having a second protocol. Encoding using rendered data is a computationally intensive process. Therefore, a system and\/or method of transcoding would that reduces processing requirements needed for transcoding, and\/or perform lossless transcoding would be useful.","The present disclosure relates generally to the processing of video data.","Specific methods of transcoding video data are disclosed as well as a system of transcoding data. One method of transcoding video data generates a motion vector for a dual prime macro block having a motion vector and differential motion vector for its two fields respectively. Another method of transcoding includes replacing a skipped P-macroblock that has been used to backward predict a B-Frame with a P-macroblock having a motion vector of zero. Another method of transcoding video data includes replacing a skipped B-macroblock with a macroblock having a motion vector from a macroblock of the same frame of the skipped B-Macroblock that is not co-located. A system including an open loop transcoder and a closed loop transcoder is further disclosed. A method and system of implementing lossless quantization between video protocols in a scalar manner is also disclosed.  better describe the various aspects of the present disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["102","106","102","106","102","106","102","103","103","104"]},"Frame  is an intra frame (I frame), frames ,  and  are forwarded predicted frames (P frames), and frame  is a bi-directional predicted frames (B frame). Each of the frames are further represented by a frame identifier that includes a frame type (I, P, or B) and an integer suffix to indicate the display order of the specific frame relative to the other frames. Therefore, frame B  is displayed prior to frame P , even though P  is needed by a decoder before B .","Each frame - of video data comprises a plurality of macroblocks. Each macroblock in a frame has a corresponding image location where its data, if any, representing an image is to be displayed. For illustrative purposes, . represents a frame template  identifying image locations  through . Therefore, image location  has a screen location that is immediately adjacent horizontally to image locations  and . When discussing specific macroblocks of a frame, the frame identifier (I, P, P, B, P) is further modified by appending the image location number after a slash \u201c\/\u201d. Therefore, the macroblock associated with image location  for frame P  would be referred to herein as macroblock P\/ , and the macroblock associated with image location , adjacent to macroblock , in frame P  would be referred to as P\/ . Additional prefix and suffix information with respect to specific frames or macroblocks will be discussed as needed herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["109","110","109","116","117","116","117","109","116","117"]},"A specific mode of MPEG2 encoding is known as dual-prime mode. With dual prime mode encoding, either the odd or even field motion vectors associated with a P macroblock of data is a differential motion vector, designated dMV as opposed to a non-differential motion vector, or a direct motion vector. A differential motion vector can be combined with the non-differential motion vector of the other field of the same frame to generate a calculated motion vector, designated cMV in . Referring to , the P frame  includes a motion vector (MVo) for the odd field, and a differential motion vector (dMVe) for the even field.","Dual-prime mode is not supported by the MPEG4 protocol. Therefore, in accordance with a specific embodiment of the present disclosure, the MPEG2 data stream  is modified to be MPEG4 compliant. In accordance with one embodiment of the disclosure, the MPEG2 stream , which has been encoded using dual-prime mode to have a differential motion vector (dMVe), is shown being converted to a MPEG4 compliant stream  that includes P-frame , which has two prediction fields (PO, PE), and two respective motion vectors (MVo, cMVe).","As illustrated in , MPEG4 stream  differs from MPEG2 stream  in that the differential motion vector, dMVe associated with the even field, of the MPEG2 P-frame  has been replaced with a calculated motion vector cMVe. The calculated motion vector cMVe, as represented by equation , is determined based upon a combination of the motion vector for the other field in the macroblock, the odd field motion vector in this example, and a value represented by the differential motion vector (dMVe). By replacing the differential motion vectors with motion vector calculated in this manner, a compliant MPEG4 macroblock can be generated in a lossless manner.","Another MPEG2 mode of operation that is not supported by MPEG4 deals with skipping of co-located P macroblocks. While both the MPEG2 and MPEG4 protocols allow for the skipping of macroblocks, i.e. no texture or motion vector data provided for a macroblock, skipping of a P frame macroblock in MPEG2 that is used along with a co-located B-macroblock to predict an image is permitted. However, when a P macroblock is skipped in MPEG4, the B macroblock is skipped as well. This can be better understood with reference to .","Referring to , specific macroblocks - are illustrated to represent a portion of an MPEG2 stream . The data stream  represents a specific image location of frame data that is generally received sequentially. For purposes of illustration, the macroblocks - are received in an order indicated by their reference numbers -. Therefore, with respect to , the macroblock are received in the following order: I-P-P-B.","The portion of the MPEG 2 stream  illustrated in  includes an I macroblock , associated with a frame identifier I; two P frame macroblocks  and , associated with frame identifiers P and P, respectively; and a B frame macroblock , associated with a frame B. The integer suffix of each frame identifier for macroblocks type - indicates the display order of each frame. For example, the macroblock  is to be displayed prior to the macroblock P, which is to be displayed before the macroblock B, which is to be displayed before the macroblock P. It will be appreciated that the reception order of the frame data, that includes the macroblocks of stream , is not necessarily the same as the display order when B frames are used. A slash (\/) and numeric indicator following the frame reference indicates the display location of the macroblock.","The P and B macroblocks of  have motion vectors as indicated by the references MV in the parenthesis following the numeric indicator specifying the display location. For example, MV is the motion vector associated with the P frame. A macroblock having an \u201cs\u201d prefix, such as for macroblock P\/, is a skipped macroblock, which in reality has no texture or motion vector data. Because skipped macroblock sP\/  is a previously decoded macroblock, and macroblock B\/ , is predicted relative to P\/ , stream  contains a MPEG2 protocol that is also valid in a MPEG4 stream protocol once any necessary quantization scaling is performed.","Referring to , the skipped P macroblock P\/ , of stream , is coded with B macroblock B\/  that has texture and or motion vector data. During MPEG2 decoding, the skipped macroblock data for sP\/  is predicted from the rendered data associated with the co-located macroblock P\/ , and the macroblock B\/  is rendered using the predicted data for P\/  and the prediction error data and motion vector data of macroblock B\/ . However, MPEG4 requires a B macroblock to be skipped when the previously decoded collocated P macro-block that is to be displayed subsequent to the B macroblock is skipped and prohibits to encoding of any data for the said macroblock B\/ .  illustrates a non-lossless option for converting the MPEG2 stream to an MPEG4 stream by skipping the B macroblock B\/  in the converted MPEG4 stream . However, since the data associated with the macroblock B\/ of stream  would not used, skipping the B\/ macroblock in stream  results in a lossy solution relative to the MPEG2 stream.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["4","22","163","170","4","22","163","160","4","22","160","0","173","160","4","22","4","163","160","2","22","172","4","22","173","164","160","3","22","3","164","170"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["180","200","180","3","22","184","3","3","22","184","3","22","0","3","21","3","3","21","3","00"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"]},"MPEG4 allows the use of two quantization methods. One method is known as the MPEG2 mode by the MPEG4 world, while the other is know as MPEG4, or MPEG4 mode. Although the default quantization matrices in use in the MPEG4 mode are different from the quantization method in use in the MPEG2 mode it is possible in MPEG4, as in MPEG2, to transmit specific matrices. The major difference between the MPEG2 mode and the MPEG4 mode comes from the way the DC sample in the intra block is processed.","Specifically, the quantization step used in MPEG2 for processing the DC sample in the intra block lies in the range {8, 16, 32}, and is not dependent on the quantization step used to quantify the AC sample. This is not the case with MPEG4 mode, wherein the DC quantization step varies with the AC quantization step in a piecewise linear manner for AC quantized values greater than 4. This difference in the use of the DC sample with respect to the quantizing AC sample can prevent lossless transcoding of the intraframe that propagates an error to all subsequent frames based on the intraframe (group of pictures).","One method of lossless transcoding from MPEG2 to MPEG4 is illustrated by the flow diagram of , and can be utilized when the MPEG2 quantization scale is equal to eight (8).","At step , the value of the MPEG2 data DC quantization scalar (DC_Q_SCALE) is determined. At step , a determination is made whether DC_Q_SCALE is equal to 8. If so, an MPEG4 AC quantization scalar (AC_Q_SCALE) can be used having a value of 1, 2, 3, or 4, as allowed by the MPEG4 DC Lookup table. If not, the scalor method of  cannot be used to requantize the MPEG2 data stream.","At step , AC_Q_SCALE is determined by selecting a value of AC_Q_SCALE such that (AC_Q_SCALE)\/(AC_Q_SCALE)=A, where AC_Q_SCALE is the AC quantization scalar of the MPEG2 data, and A is equal to a value of 1, 2, 3, and 4. By selecting AC_Q_SCALE to maximize the value of A, greater compression will be realized on the transcoded stream.","At step , the MPEG2 AC element F\u2033[u][v] is dequantified to obtain F[u][v].","At step , dequantified valued F[u][v] is scaled by A (F[u][v]*A) to obtain Fs[u][v].","At step , scaled value Fs[u][v] is encoded using the AC_Q_SCALE value determined in step , and the value AC_Q_SCALE is encoded as well in the MPEG4 data stream.","The method illustrated in  allows for the lossless transcoding of quantified macroblock data from MPEG2 to MPEG4 mode, where MPEG4 encoding is utilized. In this case the quantization scale in use by the MPEG4 intra block encoding can be kept lower than 5, allowing the quantization value for each macro block transcoded to MPEG4 to be adjusted to maintain a lossless transcoding.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["700","710","712","714","102","702"]},"In operation, an input stream comprising digital video data is received by the system . The digital video data will generally include frame based video data such as video data specified by various MPEG specifications, however, it will be appreciated that other proprietary and standard video data protocols can be received as well.","The control module  monitors information from the input stream to control switches  and  to control operation of closed loop transcoder  and open loop transcoder . In addition, control module  controls switch  to provide an output stream transcoded relative to the input stream. Generally, the control module  will enable one of the closed loop transcoder  and the open loop transcoder  to provide the output data stream. More specifically, the control module  operates to select as the source of the output data, one of the closed loop transcoder  or the open loop transcoder  an to control the transcoding process. In one embodiment, the switch function that results in the selection of the output is implemented by controlling an actual switch, such as switch . In an alternate embodiment, the switch function is implemented by enabling one of the outputs of the closed loop transcoder  and the open loop transcoder  so that only one of the transcoders provides the output stream.","A closed loop transcoder is a transcoder system that following the generation of a transcoded data frame, the transcoded data frame is decoded to provide the encoder portion of the transcoder a decoded reference frame based upon the transcoded data frame. In an open loop transcoder, the transcoded data frame is not decoded to provide a reference frame to the transcoder.","In one embodiment, the control module  selects closed loop transcoder  to transcode a macroblock of frame data when the transcoding of the received macroblock is to result in a scaling of the data rate (i.e. data reduction) that is close to one (i.e. no data reduction), and any reference frames, relative to the received frame, have also been encoded in open-loop mode. In one embodiment, the open loop transcoder is used when lossless transcoding can be used to perform a lossless transcode of the input data. For example, using one of the lossless techniques of , , , , or  described herein. In other embodiments, lossy techniques, such as the technique of  can be implemented using the system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["72","710"]},"At step , data to be transcoded is received. In one embodiment this received data is associated with a frame of video data. At step , a determination is made whether the data is to undergo a data reduction scaling of approximately one based upon a precision value of the system. For example, a system can be preset, in a programmable or fixed manner, to execute step  when it is determined that the data is to be scaled within a specific range, such as 0.8 to 1.2. Otherwise the flow proceeds to step , where the closed loop transcoder  is selected.","It will be appreciated that when the transcoding to be performed includes a data rate scaling that is not close to one (i.e. a significant change, e.g. reduction, in data rate) that a new quantization will need to be performed during the encoding operation. This re-quantization step is a lossy operation that is performed by a lossy transcoder, such as the closed loop transcoder . When a lossy transcode occurs to a reference frame, the loss of information will be propagated to any frames that will be subsequently predicted using the reference frame. The need to avoid this error propagation due to lossy transcoding results in the use of the closed loop transcoder.","At step , a determination is made whether the data to be transcoded is dependent on reference frames themselves were transcoded by a lossy process (i.e. transcoded using the closed loop transcoder ). One way of determining if the reference frames are themselves lossy is for the transcoder  and\/or  to attach a flag to a frame of transcoded data to indicate whether a lossy or lossless transcode was used, and for the control module  to monitor this flag. Generally this flag will be an internal flag, providing the transcoder \u201cstate\u201d (open\/close) used at step . This allows the transcoder to know how previously transcoded frames where transcoded. If the reference frame has been encoded in lossy mode or if the current frame is targeted to be encoded in a lossy mode, e.g. the scaling is considered important, then the close loop transcoder is selected (lossy mode) otherwise flow proceeds to step  and the open loop transcoder (losseless) is selected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 8","FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 8"],"b":["901","903","921","931","714"]},"The closed loop transcoder of  is represented by the elements that form the data path including control elements ,  and , decoder , decoder reference frames , encoder , closed-loop decoder , and encoder reference frames . When a macroblock or frame is sent to the closed-loop transcoder it is decoded to produce a decoded reference frame which is stored with the decoder reference frames . Typically the data will be decoded in a conventional manner using an inverse quantification module, an inverse transformation module, and an inverse motion compensation module. It will be appreciated that additional modules, or different, modules may be used to generate the decoder reference frames.

In one embodiment, quantization scalar  is used when a macroblock or frame of the input stream needs quantification scaling for purposes of protocol conversion, such as discussed with reference to  for scaling input data from MPEG2 format to MPEG4 format. Once transcoded (e.g. scaled to be compliant with a different protocol), the data is provided to the output stream. In order to assure that the received data is available for any subsequent decoding steps, the data can also be provided to the reference frame decoder portion  so that a reference frame can be stored in the decoder reference frames location . It will be further appreciated that the scaling function performed by the quantization scalar  can also be performed by the first transcoder described. However, the first transcoder is more complex requiring more processing resources than use of the quantization scalar . Therefore, use of the quantization requires fewer processing resources resulting in a more efficient transcoder implementation.","Another open-loop transcoder is represented by the data path that includes the control element , the open-loop protocol transcoder , and the quantizer scalar , and the control element . Input stream data sent to the open-loop protocol transcoder  can be transcoded heuristically using the methods described with reference to , and provided to the quantization scalar as needed. In this manner the amount of processing resources needed to transcode input data is reduced. The open-loop protocol transcoder is illustrated as being implemented separate from the decoder  and the encoder . However, it will be appreciated that in another embodiment the open-loop protocol transcoder function could be implemented as part of one or both of the decoder  or the encoder . For example the macroblocks from the input stream could be inverse quantified by the decoder  and provided to the encoder , by control module , before inverse transformation, thereby allowing the data to be heuristically transformed. A heuristical transformation module, such as open-loop protocol transcoder , within the encoder  could be used to transcode the data prior to quantization. Once heuristically transformed, the data would be quantized, generally by quantization module , and provided to the output stream. In another embodiment, the input data would not need to be inverse quantized, and instead, the heuristically transformed data would be sent to the quantization module  (connection not shown) before being provided to the output stream.

In one embodiment, when a data rate scale factor substantially close to 1, as predefined by the system or a user, is to be maintained, the criteria is met and the flow proceeds to step . Otherwise, if significant data rate scaling is to be performed, for example resulting in a loss of data when a lower data rate needs to be supported, the flow proceeds to step , whereby the data being evaluated is sent to the closed-loop encoder for transcoding so that an encoder reference frame will be generated by the closed-loop decoder .","At step  a determination is made whether the macroblock or frame data being evaluated is dependent upon a reference frame that was transcoded in a lossy manner.

If so, the flow proceeds to step  where the macroblock is sent to an open-loop transcoder for transcoding, otherwise the flow proceeds to step . It will be appreciated that with respect to the specific system of  that the open-loop transcoder of step  can be the open-loop protocol transcoder for heuristic transcoding, or to the open loop transcoder that includes the decoder  and the encoder . Where a heuristic transformation is performed, the data will typically be sent to the step , where the macroblock is decoded to generate a reference frame for use in the decoding of subsequent reference frames, if needed.","At step  a determination to identify an associated frame-type of the data being transcoded.
