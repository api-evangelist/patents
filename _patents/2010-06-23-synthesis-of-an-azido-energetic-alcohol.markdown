The Federal government may have rights in the technology.","This invention relates generally to the synthesis of an azido energetic alcohol, and more particularly, to the synthesis of 3-azido-2,2-dinitropropanol from 2,2-dinitropropane-1,3-diol.","Generally, the field of energetic materials uses compounds composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. These are typically arranged to form explosophoric functionality such as N-nitro, C-nitro, O-nitro, and azido.","Energetic materials containing the geminal dinitro groups (\u2014C(NO), gem-dinitro) have generally low sensitivity to unplanned stimuli, making them particularly valuable in the creation of munitions meeting Insensitive Munition (\u201cIM\u201d) requirements. Additionally, these explosophores are attractive due to their high oxygen content and high energy.","A number of gem-dinitro containing compounds have found application in the production of energetic materials. Typically, these gem-dinitro containing materials are prepared by conversion from a mononitroderivative with an active hydrogen using the silver nitrate method or the potassium ferricyanide method. Alternatively, they may be prepared by functional group manipulation of an existing gem-dinitro containing compound.","Geminal dinitro alcohols such as 2,2-dinitropropanol, 2,2,-dinitrobutanol, and fluorodinitroethanol have the versatility to allow the preparation of a range of energetic plasticizers, binders and oxidizers. For example, 2,2-dinitropropanol is useful in the production of the energetic plasticizers bis(2,2-dinitropropyl formal) (\u201cBDNPF\u201d) and bis(2,2-dinitropropylacetal) (\u201cBDNPA\u201d).","Although azide groups do not contribute to the oxygen balance of the compounds in which the azide group is contained, organic azides can make an exceptional contribution to the heat of formation (75-95 kcal\/mol) and the total energy released upon decomposition. Compounds containing both an azide and gem-dinitro group can possess higher energy than the corresponding azido (N) compounds and thermal stability.","Displacement of leaving groups adjacent to gem-dinitro moieties is known to be difficult due to inductive effects. Previous attempts to create 3-azido 2,2-dinitropropyl chloride by displacement of 1,3 dichloro 2,2-dinitropropane have been unsuccessful for at least this reason. The general approach of preparing 1,2 and 1,3 azido alcohols by displacement of an intermediate cyclic sulfate is well known in organic chemistry.","A versatile 1-azido 2,2-dinitro containing synthon can be used to create energetic ingredients containing the functionality described above. A gamma azido energetic alcohol can be formed by displacement of an intermediate cyclic sulfate. A gamma azido energetic alcohol is a versatile intermediate that allows for the potential preparation of a wide range of energetic ingredients, including, for example, plasticizers, binders, and oxidizers. Inexpensive starting materials, for example, nitromethane and sodium azide, can be used to synthesize a gamma azido energetic alcohol.","In one aspect, the invention features a method of forming an azido energetic alcohol. The method includes converting an energetic diol to a cyclic sulfite, oxidizing the cyclic sulfite to a cyclic sulfate, and opening the cyclic sulfate to form a non-cyclic sulfate. The non-cyclic sulfate is hydrolyzed subsequent to opening to form an azido energetic alcohol.","In another aspect, the invention features a method of forming an azido energetic alcohol. The method includes reacting thionyl chloride with an energetic diol to form a cyclic sulfite, oxidizing the cyclic sulfite by a ruthenium catalyzed method to form a cyclic sulfate, and reacting the cyclic sulfate with sodium azide followed by hydrolysis to form an azido energetic alcohol.","In some embodiments, the energetic diol is 2,2-dinitropropane-1,3-diol. The cyclic sulfite can be 2,2-dinitro 1,3-propanediol sulfite. In some embodiments, the cyclic sulfate is 2,2-dinitro 1,3-propanediol sulfate. The azido energetic alcohol can be a gamma azido energetic alcohol. The gamma azido energetic alcohol can be 3-azido-2,2-dinitropropanol.","In certain embodiments, the hydrolyzer is sulfuric acid. The cyclic sulfate can be opened by reacting the cyclic sulfate with sodium azide.","In another aspect, the invention features a compound represented by Formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"16.59mm","wi":"55.37mm","file":"US08841468-20140923-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In some embodiments, the compound has peaks located at about 4.35, 4,6 and 6.48 ppm in a H-nuclear magnetic resonance (\u201cNMR\u201d) spectrum and peaks located at about 51, 62, and 119 ppm is a C-NMR spectrum.","Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following drawings and description, all of which illustrate principles of the invention, by way of example only.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"16.59mm","wi":"55.63mm","file":"US08841468-20140923-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Formula 1, a yellow oil that is soluble in organic solvents, has peaks located at about 4.35, 4.6, and 6.48 ppm in a H-NMR spectrum and peaks located at about 51, 62, and 119 ppm in a C-NMR spectrum as discussed with reference to  below.
