Also disclosed are methods for producing the resin monomers.","In an embodiment, the herein disclosed resins replace hydrolyzable methacrylate-based resins with BPA-free and hydrolytically stable vinylbenzyl ether based resins. As an example, three co-polymerizable compounds, erythritol divinylbenzyl ether (E-DVBE), triethyleneglycol divinylbenzyl ether (TEG-DVBE), and the reaction products of vinylbenzyl glycidyl ether with N-tolylglycine salts (NTG-VBGE) (see  for examples of their structures) were synthesized, purified, and evaluated as substitutes for currently used Bis-GMA, TEG-DMA, and NTG-GMA (Glycine, N-2-hydroxy-3-(2-methyl-1-oxo-2-propenyl)-oxypropyl-N-(4-methylphenyl), monosodium salt) [CAS No. 133736-31-9], respectively.

The E-DVBE and TEG-DVBE have two terminal double bonds, which can each readily copolymerize, and can be used in the polymeric phase resin network. The TEG-DVBE is used to adjust and control the viscosity of the monomers to obtain good handling properties of dental composite restorative systems. The NTG-VBGE, incorporated in the form of the sodium, magnesium, or other salt, is the active ingredient in dentin and enamel bonding, serving as a surface-active comonomer.","2) Eliminate all BPA moieties. Many publications allege the dangers of BPA leaching from dental composites and sealants; these could decrease patients' willingness to obtain necessary dental care.","3) Eliminate potentially hydrolysable ester groups (contained in Bis-GMA, TEG-DMA, and NTG-GMA\u2014see ) in either the cross-linking monomers of the composite or in its accompanying adhesive-bonding formulation. The herein disclosed materials have ether groups that are not susceptible to salivary or other esterases, and thereby are more resistant to degradation in the oral cavity.","4) Improve physical and chemical properties that cannot be achieved with current resins. For example, E-DVBE is an ambiphilic compound with two hydrophobic vinylbenzyl groups at its ends and a flexible hydrophilic center (two hydroxyl groups from meso-erythritol). The vicinal hydroxyl groups can more easily form clusters of hydrogen bonds with the readily accessible hydroxyl groups of other such monomers.

It also plugs dentinal tubular openings, thereby preventing penetration of the adhesion-promoting monomeric components.","The vinylbenzyl ether groups readily homopolymerize and copolymerize with methacrylate groups and other polymerizable groups including vinyl groups. The polymerization of the vinylbenzyl compounds may be initiated using initiators that are currently used in the methacrylate systems, for example: photo-initiators for wavelength 400-540 nm or dual-cure initiators for both light and chemical initiation. An example of photo-initiator is the mixture of camphorquinone (CQ) and ethyl 4-N,N-dimethylaminobenzoate (4E) at concentrations of 0.2 wt % and 0.8 wt %, respectively, of the polymer matrix.

Spectra were collected with 64 scans from 650 cmto 4000 cmat 8 cmspectral resolution with a beam spot size of 90 \u03bcm\u00d790 \u03bcm. Ten spectra each of three disks (8 mm in diameter and 1 mm in thickness) of every combination of resins were obtained from the flat top and bottom of the disks. Each spot was manually focused before data collection. The reflectance spectra were proportioned against a background of a gold coated slide and transformed to absorbance spectra using the Kramers-Kronig transform algorithm for dispersion correction, which converts the reflectance spectra to absorbance-like spectra. The degree of vinyl conversion (DC) was calculated as the reduction in the vinyl peak (1634 cm) height using the phenyl absorbance peak (1610 cm) as an internal standard. The peak heights were determined using the ISys software (Spectral Dimensions, Olney, Md., USA).

Both Bis-GMA and TEG-DMA were decomposed dramatically by enzymes. Also evaluated was the resistance of new polymers made of TEG-DVBE and traditional polymers made of a mixture of Bis-GMA and TEG-DMA in 1:1 mass ratio to esterase enzymes. After 16 days challenge with the enzymes, no degradation was found in new polymers. The traditional polymers showed significant degradation by the enzymes. The test materials and methods are described below. Enzyme preparation began with cholesterol esterase derived from bacteria (CE, C9281, Sigma, Saint Louis, Mo., USA) and Pseudocholinesterase from horse serum (PCE, C4290, Sigma, Saint Louis, Mo., USA), which were reconstituted at desired concentrations in phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS, 14190-144, Gibco\u00ae, Grant Island, N.Y., USA) and sterile filtered using a 0.22 \u03bcm filter. The prepared enzyme solutions used for replenishing enzyme activity in the biodegradation experiments were stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until needed.","Enzyme activity assay (i.e., CE activity) was determined by para-nitrophenyl acetate (p-NPA) hydrolysis assay. P-NPA substrate (N8130, Sigma, Saint Louis, Mo., USA) was prepared by dissolving p-NPA in methanol (100 mM p-NPA), and diluting with a 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, to give a final p-NPA concentration of 1 mM. In a typical CE activity assay 50 \u03bcL p-NPA solution, 50 \u03bcL of CE solution (1 unit\/mL) and 100 \u03bcL sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM), pH 8.8, were added to a 96-well plate to give a final pH of 7.0, and the change of absorbance over time was measured at 410 nm at 25\u00b0 C. using a SpectraMax Microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif., USA). One unit of CE activity is defined as a change of absorbance of 0.01 per minute. CE enzyme inhibition was assessed with the addition of 4 \u03bcL of phenylmethanesulfonyifluoride (PMSF, 50 mM in anhydrous ethanol). PCE (1 unit\/mL) activity was determined with acetylcholinesterase activity assay kit (MAK119, Sigma, Saint Louis, Mo., USA) by measuring a change in absorbance at 412 nm, using butylthiocholine (BTC) as a substrate. One unit of PCE activity was defined as the formation of 1.0 \u03bcmol of butyrate released per 1 mL of enzyme per minute at pH 7.5 and 25\u00b0 C.","For polymer preparation, the composition of conventional resin was 50:50 wt % Bis-GMA:TEG-DMA (Esstech, Essington, Pa., USA) with 0.2 wt % Camphorquinone (CQ, 124893, Aldrich, Saint Louis, Mo., USA) and 0.8 wt % ethyl 4-(diamethylamino)benzoate (DMAEMA, E24905, Aldrich, Saint Louis, Mo., USA as the photoinitiator system. TEG-DVBE was mixed with 1 wt % IIRGACURE 819 (1-819) and 1 wt % bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)iodonium hexafluorophosphate (DPI) as a photoinitiation system. Photoinitiation systems for each composition were selected to achieve resins with high degree of conversion. Monomer samples were filled into a 3 mm radius 1 mm height cylindrical Teflon mold, and between two Mylar films at the top and the bottom to prevent oxygen-inhibition of the surface layer. Additionally, glass slides were used in order to flatten the surface. The samples were photocured with a Triad 2000 visible light curing unit (Dentsply Trubyte, York, Pa., USA) for 1 minute on each side. The hardened pellets with a 75 mm2 surface area were post-cured overnight in a vacuum oven at 60\u00b0 C., then incubated in D-PBS at 37\u00b0 C. with stirring for 24 hours to remove any unreacted monomers. Pellets were then rinsed with distilled water and vacuum dried until they reach a constant mass.","For monomer degradation, Bis-GMA, TEG-DMA, and TEG-DVBE monomers were each dissolved in DMSO (20 mM monomer), and diluted in D-PBS to give a monomer concentration of 0.4 mM. Monomer solutions (750 \u03bcL) were incubated with CE or PCE (750 \u03bcL, 2 units\/mL) for 24 hours at 37\u00b0 C. (n=3). PMSF at 1.0 mM and 0.5 mM were used as negative controls for CE and PCE, respectively. At 1, 8, and 24 hours of incubation, 400 \u03bcL of media was removed from each sample and the enzyme activity was inhibited with the addition of 266 \u03bcL methanol. Samples were centrifuged at 16000 rcf for 30 minutes to eliminate large particles and stored at 4\u00b0 C. until analysis with HPLC.","For polymer degradation, cured polymer pellets were incubated with 500 \u03bcL 1 unit\/mL CE or PCE, with media volume to polymer resin surface area ratio of 6.6 ul per mm, for up to 16 days at 37\u00b0 C. (n=3). PMSF at 1.0 mM and 0.5 mM were used as negative controls for CE and PCE, respectively. The incubation media was replaced every 48 hrs to maintain nominal enzyme activity. Each pooled media was quenched with the addition of 400 \u03bcL methanol. The media from 2, 8, and 16 days of incubation periods were pooled for HPLC analysis. Pooled were centrifuged at 16000 rcf for 30 minutes and stored at 4\u00b0 C. until analysis with HPLC. Samples were also centrifuged for 30 minutes to eliminate large particles and stored at 4\u00b0 C. until analysis with HPLC.","For HPLC analysis, an Agilent 1290 Infinity Binary HPLC System was used for the chromatographic separation and quantification of the degradation products. Specifically, the disappearance of TEG-DMA, Bis-GMA and TEG-DVBE monomers, as well as the appearance of methacrylic acid (MA, 155721, Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA) derived from TEG-DMA and Bis-GMA and bishydroxy propoxy phenyl propane (bis-HPPP, 15137, Fluka, Saint Louis, Mo., USA) from Bis-GMA as degradation products where of interest. A Zorbex Extend 5 \u03bcm C18 4.6\u00d7250 mm column (770450-902, Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, Calif., USA) was used for the separation of products. The mobile phase consisted of 2 mM buffer solution of HPLC-grade ammonium acetate (AX1222, EMD Chemicals Inc., Billerica, Mass., USA) with pH adjusted to 3.0 with 6.0 N hydrochloric acid (A144-500, Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, N.J., USA) and HPL-grade methanol (MX0475, EMD Chemicals Inc., Billerica, Mass., USA). The separation was achieved with 50% to 100% methanol in ammonium acetate buffer gradient for 30 minutes in order to provide comparison with reported tests results for current monomers. Degradation products were detected by absorbance at 215 nm using a 1290 Infinity variable wavelength UV detector. Calibration curves were created by linear correlation of peak area to known concentrations of the analytes in methanol and the amount of products formed from both monomer and polymer degradation were analyzed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIGS. 8A and 8B","FIG. 8A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 8B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIGS. 9A and 9B","FIG. 9B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIGS. 10A and 10B"},"The above description refers to resins, resin composites, and adhesives for use in a dental composite restorative system.
