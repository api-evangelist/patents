title: Projectile system and method for impeding vessel movement
abstract: A projectile system for impeding vessel movement is provided. The system includes a projectile device that contains a superoxide material for generating an exothermic reaction when exposed to water. At termination of flight, the projectile releases the superoxide material into the surrounding water. A delay can be set to enable the projectile to release its payload underneath the water surface, creating both a disturbance in the water and large gas bubbles to affect the trajectory of the target surface vessel.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy, and the invention herein may be manufactured, practiced, used, and\/or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates generally to projectiles, and more particularly to a projectile system and method for impeding vessel movement on a water's surface.","Conventional methods and devices for impeding the movement of small surface vessels include deployable nets designed to foul the propeller mechanism of a vessel, fences, and fixed barriers. While generally effective at stopping small surface vessels, all are limited in terms of flexibility due to their small area of effect.","Accordingly Stationary barriers take time to set up and restrict both desirable and undesirable maritime traffic, and are passive defenses. Deployable nets, either shot from some launching apparatus or dropped into the water by a boat or aircraft, have limited range, cover a limited area, and require the target vessel to collide with the nets in order to be effective. Without any of these nonlethal options, lethal force can be used, but is much more prone to uncertainty. Moreover, net systems have negligible effect on surface vessels powered by jet propulsion systems.","Accordingly, various exemplary embodiments provide a method and a system that can be used to effectively and non-lethally impede movement of a vessel on the surface of water. Other objects and advantages of various exemplary embodiments will become more obvious hereinafter in the specification and drawings.","In accordance with the various exemplary embodiments, a projectile system and method are provided for impeding vessel movement. The projectile system includes a superoxide material for generating an exothermic reaction when exposed to water. A device contains the superoxide material during a projectile flight thereof. The device also supports release of the superoxide material into a surrounding environment upon completion of the projectile flight.","Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to , a projectile system that can be used to impede movement of a surface or floating vessel (not shown) is illustrated and is referenced generally by numeral . As used herein, the term \u201cfloating vessel\u201d refers generally to relatively small (i.e., generally on the order of 40 feet or less in length) boats that can be manned or unmanned. Further, the phrase \u201cimpede movement\u201d as used herein contemplates a variety of non-lethal outcomes ranging from simple course disruption to capsizing of the vessel. However, it is to be understood that both the size of the floating vessel and the type of movement impediments generated by embodiments of the projectile system are not limitations of the present invention.","Projectile system  includes a casing  that is at least partially filled with a superoxide material . As is known in the art, superoxide materials (e.g., potassium superoxide (KO), sodium superoxide (NaO)) are a class of materials that exothermally react with both fresh and salt water environments. More specifically, the exothermic reaction is very fast and generates heat and gas such that a gas bubble(s) are readily generated as a result of the reaction. Control of the reaction rate can be achieved via particle size, packing density, and the rate that superoxide material  is dispersed in the water environment. In the illustrated embodiment, superoxide material  is in a particle or powder form to maximize reaction surface area when dispersed from casing .","Casing  is generally shaped to be aerodynamically stable in a ballistic sense. That is, casing  is generally shaped as a projectile that can be fixed or launched from a barrel or launcher, and then fly through the air in an aero-dynamically stable fashion for delivery to a specified\/aimed location as will be explained further below. In addition, casing  will generally be made completely or partially from a material that will fracture when receiving an impact force (e.g., when casing  strikes a target, when something within casing  generates a pressure wave pushing out on casing , etc.). For example, casing  can be made completely or partially from a frangible material (e.g., plastic) that readily fractures when casing  is subject to an impact force.","The projectile system of the present invention is not limited to using a powdered superoxide material . For example,  illustrates another projectile system  in which casing  is completely or partially filled with pellets  of superoxide material. Pellets  might be used to generate a slower but longer-lasting reaction when casing  fractures\/ruptures thereby dispersing pellets  into a surrounding environment.","As mentioned above, the projectile system of the present invention can be configured to generate its own casing rupturing force that will also function to disperse the superoxide material contained therein. Accordingly,  illustrates another projectile system  in which casing  encases both super-oxide material  (e.g., in powdered form, pelletized form, etc.) and a device  designed to expel\/disperse superoxide material  from casing . For example, device  could be configured similar to an automobile airbag initiator that generates a rapid pressure wave that will cause casing  to fracture while also dispersing superoxide material  into a surrounding environment.","A method of using the projectile system of the present invention to impede movement of a vessel will now be explained with the aid of . For simplicity,  illustrates the use of a single projectile system (e.g., projectile system ). However, it is to be understood that a plurality of projectile system  can be utilized in an operational scenario without departing from the scope of the present invention. In , a vessel  is shown floating at the surface  of a body of water . Vessel  can be traveling in the direction indicated by arrow .","In accordance with the present invention, projectile system  is launched or otherwise propelled to a location  that can be just forward of vessel  or a location  that targets vessel  at or near the waterline  thereof. Obviously, if more than one projectile system  is being used, both location  and location  could be selected or targeted. Once reaching its selected or targeted location, the casing of projectile system  fractures as described above to thereby disperse superoxide material  in water  around locations  and\/or . (For sake of clarity, the fractured pieces of the casing are not illustrated in .) The dispersed superoxide material  reacts with water  to quickly generate heat and gas that causes a gas bubble  to form in water . The presence of gas bubble  impedes the movement of vessel  by, for example, disrupting its course, rocking vessel , or capsizing vessel .","The advantages of the present invention are numerous. The non-lethal projectile system can be used to specifically target suspicious vessels traveling along the surface of the water. The number of projectile systems used can be selected predicated on the suspected threat level. Since the exothermic reaction provided by the superoxide materials is rapid, the effectiveness of the present invention can be readily gauged so that a more lethal deterrent can be employed if necessary.","Although the invention has been described relative to specific embodiments thereof, there are numerous variations and modifications that will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced other than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":["Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reference to the following description of the preferred embodiments and to the drawings, wherein corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
