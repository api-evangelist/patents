No. 12\/576,196, filed Oct. 8, 2009, entitled \u201cCOUGH AND SNEEZE ARRESTOR\u201d, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.","Hygienic devices.","Airborne viruses and bacteria can be easily spread through direct contact with contaminated items, e.g., door handles, table tops, or railings, or by coughing and sneezing. Infected persons who may spread airborne viruses and bacteria are often in public places by necessity or on purpose because, for example, they may not even be aware that they are contagious. In any case, the spread of airborne viruses and bacteria can be rapid and swift.","One method that infected persons use to control the spread of airborne viruses and bacteria in public is to cover his\/her mouth with a hand or arm when coughing or sneezing. While this method may limit the spread of particulates emanating from the cough or sneeze, it does not completely contain the cough or sneeze. Moreover, the particulates will thereafter be on the person's hands and can be deposited on door handles, rails or any other public item. The particulates can be transferred to an unknowing person and cause subsequent infection.","Another method that infected persons use to control the spread of airborne viruses and bacteria in public is to use a tissue when coughing or sneezing. This method also limits the spread of particulates emanating from the cough or sneeze, however, similar to the above, it does not completely contain the cough or sneeze. A tissue is porous and can let airborne viruses, bacteria and particulates pass through. Moreover, the person using the tissue uses his or her hand to handle the tissue therefore transferring viruses, bacteria and particulates to the person's hand which may be subsequently deposited on door handles, rails or any other public item. Similar to the above, the particulates can be transferred to an unknowing person and cause subsequent infection.","With the break-out of new and virulent viruses, such as the H1N1 flu virus, or the so-called \u201cswine flu\u201d virus, the need for controlling the spread of airborne viruses and bacteria in public in eminent. Consequently, a method or device which alleviates the problems associated with the methods and devices discussed above is needed.","A hygienic device to control the spread of airborne viruses and bacteria emanating from coughing or sneezing, comprising: (i) a cup having a rim; (ii) a first filter suspended and attached within an interior of the cup near an opening of the cup, the first filter having a plurality of apertures of a first size; (iii) a second filter suspended and attached within the interior of the cup near a middle of the cup, the second filter having a plurality of apertures of a second size; and (iv) a third filter suspended and attached within the interior of the cup near a bottom of the cup is herein disclosed.","The hygienic device may further comprise: (v) a first recess in the rim of the cup, the first recess to accommodate a nose of a person; and (vi) a second recess in the rim of the cup, the second recess positioned 180 degrees relative to the first recess, the second recess to accommodate a chin of the person. The diameter of each of the plurality of apertures of the first size may be greater than a diameter of each of the plurality of apertures of the second size. The plurality of apertures of the first size may be symmetrically spaced throughout the first filter and each of the plurality of apertures of the second size may be symmetrically spaced throughout the second filter. The plurality of apertures of the first size may be between 500 micrometers and 1500 micrometers and the plurality of apertures of the second size may be between 250 micrometers and 750 micrometers. Each of the first, second and third filters may be embedded with a microbicide. The microbicide may be an antibacterial, viricide or a combination thereof. The microbicide may be an antibacterial selected from the group consisting of benzalkonium chloride (BAC), cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTMB), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), benzethonium chloride (BZT) or any combination thereof. The cup may be comprised of a material, the material one of paper, polylactic acid or polystyrene foam. Each of the first, second and third filters may be comprised of an absorbent material.","A hygienic device to control the spread of airborne viruses and bacteria emanating from coughing or sneezing, comprising: (i) a containment device, the containment device approximately cylindrical, the containment device closed on a first end and open on a second end, the containment device having a sidewall extending from the first end to the second end; (ii) a first filter suspended and attached within an interior of the sidewall of the device near the open second end, the first filter having a plurality of apertures of a first size; (iii) a second filter suspended and attached within the interior of the sidewall of the device near a middle of the device, the second filter having a plurality of apertures of a second size; and (iv) a third filter suspended and attached within the interior of the sidewall of the device near the closed first end is herein disclosed.","The hygienic device may further comprise (v) a first recess in the rim of the device, the first recess to accommodate a nose of a person; and (vi) a second recess in the rim of the device, the second recess positioned 180 degrees relative to the first recess, the second recess to accommodate a chin of the person.

The nose bridge and chin bridge allows for a comfortable fit about the person's mouth and substantially or completely eliminates infectious material from escaping therefrom. Alternatively, the device may be placed on the person's nose.","Advantageously, a hygienic device according to embodiments of the invention can be used in any public or private location to control the spread of airborne viruses and bacteria emanating from coughing or sneezing. The device is disposable and eliminates contact of a person's hand or arm when the person coughs or sneezes thereby preventing transfer of infectious material to door handles, rails, desks or any other surface with which multiple persons may come into contact (thereby likely spreading the infectious material to others). Moreover, the device may be embedded with a microbicide which kills bacteria and\/or viruses. Thus, if the device is accidently dropped, e.g., on a desktop, the chance of transfer of infectious material is substantially reduced (relative to, e.g., a tissue).","While certain exemplary embodiments have been described and shown in the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that such embodiments are merely illustrative of and not restrictive on the broad invention, and that this invention is not to be limited to the specific constructions and arrangements shown and described, since various other modifications may occur to those ordinarily skilled in the art."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1A"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
