The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","Comparatively low voltage (i.e., less than about 500 mV) operation of electro-optic devices, such as but not limited to electro-optic modulator devices, is an important predicate and avenue that may provide for future bandwidth needs within the context of integration of electro-optic devices and nanoelectronic devices. In particular, an operating voltage of a silicon electro-optic device may desirably scale aggressively as a rail voltage (Vdd) for a related digital silicon nanoelectronic device scales to 600 mV in future anticipated complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology platforms.","In addition, a low voltage swing modulation scheme for an electro-optic modulator device can significantly reduce a total transmitter energy and footprint within an electro-optic circuit that includes the electro-optic modulator device by reducing a drive electronic component complexity in comparison with a drive electronic component complexity for an electro-optic circuit that includes an electro-optic modulator device predicated upon a comparatively high voltage swing modulation scheme.","In accordance with the above, it is thus of great interest to pursue low operating voltage electro-optic devices that are silicon semiconductor material fabrication compatible.

Structural Features and Fabrication Methodology of Micro-Ring Electro-Optic Modulator Structure","A micro-ring electro-optic modulator structure in accordance with the embodiments was fabricated using a micro-ring of radius 2.5 microns, which was intended as being close to a bending loss limited footprint of a micro-ring within a micro-ring electro-optic modulator device, in order to minimize both the energy requirements and the drive current requirements of a micro-ring electro-optic modulator device that results from operation of the micro-ring electro-optic modulator structure.","As is illustrated in ), a ring resonator PIN diode based electro-optic structure and related device in accordance with the embodiments includes an intrinsic ring waveguide optically coupled with an intrinsic strip waveguide at an optical coupling location. The ring resonator PIN diode based electro-optic structure and related device in accordance with the embodiments also includes an n-doped region interior to the intrinsic ring waveguide. The ring resonator PIN diode based electro-optic structure and related device also includes a first p-doped region surrounding the intrinsic ring waveguide on one side of the strip waveguide and a second p-doped region adjacent the optical coupling region on the side of the intrinsic strip waveguide opposite the intrinsic ring waveguide. Thus as illustrated in ) inherently the intrinsic ring waveguide and the portion of the intrinsic strip waveguide at the optical coupling location comprise an intrinsic portion of a PIN diode that includes the n-doped region and the p-doped regions as electrodes.","As is illustrated in the schematic plan-view diagram of ), the micro-ring electro-optic modulator structure is formed with a 2.5 micron radius micro-ring electro-optic waveguide (i.e., a ring waveguide) of linewidth about 500 nanometers (i.e., within a range from about 400 to about 600 nanometers) coupled by a separation distance of about 150 nanometers (i.e., within a range from about 50 to about 300 nanometers) with a nominally linear input and output optical strip waveguide of linewidth about 350 nanometers (i.e., within a range from about 300 to about 400 nanometers). A transmission spectrum of the micro-ring electro-optic modulator device that derives from operation of the micro-ring electro-optic modulator structure of ) for TE mode polarized incoming light is shown in ). The optical transmission spectrum of ) is normalized to non-resonant transmission of the micro-ring electro-optic modulator device.","The micro-ring electro-optic modulator structure in accordance with the embodiments as illustrated in ) may in particular be fabricated using a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate as is illustrated in ). The silicon-on-insulator substrate of ) comprises: (1) a base silicon substrate  which is typically comprises a monocrystalline silicon material; (2) a buried oxide (or other dielectric) layer  located and formed upon the base silicon substrate ; and (3) a surface silicon layer , which typically also comprises a monocrystalline silicon material, located and formed upon the buried oxide layer . The silicon-on-insulator substrate that is illustrated in ) is otherwise generally conventional in the microelectronic fabrication art, and in particular the optoelectronic fabrication art. Typically: (1) the buried oxide layer  has a thickness from about 1000 to about 5000 nanometers with about 3000 nanometers being particularly common for use when fabricating optoelectronic structures and optoelectronic devices; and (2) the surface silicon layer  has a thickness from about 200 to about 500 nanometers, with about 260 nanometers being particularly common and desirable within the context of the embodiments.","As is illustrated within the schematic cross-sectional diagram of ), the surface silicon layer  that is illustrated within the silicon-on-insulator substrate of ) may be partially etched to provide a pillar P that is intended as illustrative of a micro-ring cross-section within a micro-ring electro-optic modulator structure in accordance with the embodiments, where the pillar P is located and formed within an etched surface silicon layer \u2032. A height of the pillar P is about 200 to about 220 nanometers, and typically about 210 nanometers, above a surrounding lower plateau of the etched surface silicon layer \u2032.","Although not specifically illustrated within the schematic cross-sectional diagram of ), the surface silicon layer  (i.e., which is typically about 260 nm thick) within a silicon-on-insulator semiconductor substrate may be used for both a passive input and output strip waveguide within the micro-ring electro-optic modulator structure as illustrated within the schematic plan-view diagram of ), as well as for an electro-optic micro-ring waveguide within the micro-ring electro-optic modulator structure as illustrated within the schematic plan-view diagram of ).","To form the micro-ring electro-optic modulator structure of ) from the silicon-on-insulator substrate structure of ), the partial etching step may be undertaken using electron-beam lithography for forming an appropriate mask layer, although such is not necessarily a limitation of the embodiments. Rather, the surface silicon layer  within the silicon-on-insulator substrate of ) may be partially etched to provide the etched surface silicon layer \u2032 including the pillar P within the micro-ring electro-optic modulator structure of ) using lithographic methods including but not limited to photolithographic methods and electron beam lithographic methods. In addition, either of the foregoing lithographic methods may utilize resist materials including but not limited to positive resist materials, negative resist materials and hybrid resist materials. As is illustrated within the schematic cross-sectional diagram of ), either a passive input and output monocrystalline silicon strip waveguide or a monocrystalline silicon micro-ring waveguide within a micro-ring electro-optic modulator structure in accordance with the embodiments is partially etched into a surface silicon layer \u2032 to provide a height of the pillar P of about 210 nanometers.","As is illustrated within the schematic cross-sectional diagram of ), another lithography process step is used to cover the micro-ring electro-optic modulator region of the etched surface silicon layer \u2032 and continue the etching of the etched surface silicon layer \u2032 to provide a twice etched surface silicon layer \u2033 slab having a thickness about 50 nanometers with the pillar P extending the additional 210 nanometers within the twice etched surface silicon layer \u2033 slab. Within the embodiments, the additional patterning of the etched surface silicon layer \u2032 to provide the twice etched surface silicon layer \u2033 slab is intended to provide for isolation of individual micro-ring electro-optic modulator structures from each other, and from other structures that may be located and formed within the same substrate as the micro-ring electro-optic modulator structure in accordance with the embodiments.","As is illustrated within ), after the additional etching of the etched surface silicon layer \u2032 to form the twice etched surface silicon layer \u2033 slab that still includes the pillar P, a conformal passivation layer  is located and formed (i.e., either grown or deposited) upon the twice etched surface silicon layer \u2033 slab including the pillar P. This particular conformal passivation layer  may comprise any of several passivation materials, and in particular dielectric passivation materials, that may be readily grown or deposited, such as but not limited to silicon oxide dielectric passivation materials, silicon nitride dielectric passivation materials and silicon oxynitride dielectric passivation materials, but typically comprises a silicon oxide dielectric passivation material that has a thickness from about 15 to about 25 nanometers, and more particularly about 20 nanometers.","As is illustrated within the schematic cross-sectional diagram of ), portions of the twice etched surface silicon layer \u2033 slab separated by the pillar P (and also optionally but not necessarily laterally recessed from the pillar P sidewalls by a lateral separation distance from about 200 to about 2000 nanometers) are ion implanted with either: (1) a p-dopant to provide a p-doped region (i.e., preferably on the outside of a micro-ring within a micro-ring electro-optic modulator structure, while using a boron difluoride or appropriate alternative dopant at a dose of about 3e15 ions per square centimeter and an ion implantation energy about 45 keV); or (2) an n-dopant to provide an n-doped region (i.e., preferably on the inside of the micro-ring within the micro-ring electro-optic modulator structure, while using a phosphorous or appropriate alternative dopant at a dose of about 2e15 ions per square centimeter and an ion implantation energy of about 33 keV). As a result of the foregoing preferred ion implantation conditions, the p-doped region preferably includes at least a portion of the twice etched surface silicon layer \u2033 slab outside the micro-ring within the micro-ring electro-optic modulator structure and the n-doped region preferably includes at least a portion of the twice etched surface silicon layer \u2033 slab inside the micro-ring within the micro-ring electro-optic modulator structure, within the micro-ring electro-optic modulator structure as illustrated in ).","Subsequent to implanting the pertinent portions of the twice etched surface silicon layer \u2033 slab to provide the p-doped region and the n-doped region optionally and preferably, but not necessarily, laterally recessed from the pillar P sidewalls, the micro-ring electro-optic modulator structure whose schematic cross-sectional diagram is illustrated in ) is preferably thermally annealed at a temperature from about 900 to about 1100 degrees centigrade (and commonly at about 1000 degrees centigrade) for a time period from about 5 to about 30 seconds (and commonly about 15 seconds). Alternatively, an operational but not necessarily optimal electro-optic structure in accordance with the embodiments may also be realized at a relatively low thermal annealing temperature of about 650 degrees centigrade (i.e., generally from about 600 to about 700 degrees centigrade) for a time period of about 120 seconds (i.e., generally from about 100 to about 140 seconds), generally within a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) apparatus, for purposes of activating the dopants within the p-doped region and the n-doped region , while simultaneously repairing and recrystallizing any amorphization damage to the twice etched surface silicon layer \u2033 slab.","As is understood by a person skilled in the art, the conformal passivation layer  that is illustrated within the schematic cross-sectional diagram of ) functions as a screen layer with respect to ion implantation of the p-doped region and the n-doped region (or at least one of the foregoing regions). Thus, due to the presence of the conformal passivation layer , and with proper adjustment of the ion implantation parameters (and also assuming proper dopant activation), it is possible to provide at least one, and preferably both, of the p-doped region and the n-doped region with a generally high volume dopant concentration at a surface of the p-doped region or the n-doped region (and also within lower lying portions of the p-doped region and the n-doped region ) that is desirable for forming low contact resistance connections to a low series resistance PIN diode that includes the p-doped region , the intrinsic silicon pillar P and the n-doped region . Typically and preferably, such a generally high volume dopant concentration at the surface of the p-doped region or the n-doped region (and lower lying portions of the p-doped region and the n-doped region ) is at least about 1e19 (i.e., 10) dopant atoms per cubic centimeter, and more typically from about 5e19 (i.e., 5\u00d710) to about 2e20 (i.e., 2\u00d710) dopant atoms per cubic centimeter, which may be readily activated in accordance with the thermal annealing conditions described above to provide a correlating activated dopant carrier concentration.","As is illustrated within the schematic cross-sectional diagram of ), the conformal passivation layer  is patterned to form a patterned conformal passivation layer \u2032 that exposes the p-doped region and the n-doped region , but not the pillar P. Such patterning may be effected using methods and materials that are otherwise generally conventional in the microelectronic fabrication art, and in particular the optoelectronic fabrication art, and will typically but not necessarily include photolithographic and etch methods, such as but not limited to reactive ion etch methods.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 2(","i":["f","a ","b","a ","b "],"b":["20","18","18","20","20","18","18"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 2(","FIG. 2("],"i":["g","f","a ","b ","a ","a","b ","b","a ","b ","a","b\u2032.

The charge carrier electro-optic device simulations are in-turn validated against experimental steady state and transient performance of a micro-ring electro-optic modulator device in accordance with the embodiments.

Ultra Low Voltage Swing Modulation in Charge Carrier Injection Modulators","In accordance with the foregoing description, 1 Gbit\/s modulation with a peak-peak drive voltage of only 150 mV has been demonstrated within a micro-ring electro-optic modulator device. An eye diagram corresponding to the drive voltage of the modulator device is shown in ). The output optical waveform generated by the silicon micro-ring electro-optic modulator device at 1 Gbit\/s NRZ is shown in ). The electro-optic modulator device was driven directly from a pattern generator using a 20 dB attenuator to obtain a 150 mV voltage swing. A bias-tee was used to add a variable DC voltage to optimize the optical waveform. The driving signal was terminated in a 50 ohm termination at the end of a high speed probe to avoid reflections. A 150 mV voltage swing about a bias voltage level of 1.03 V was used to obtain clear waveforms. The optical eye diagram is shown in ) illustrating an open eye. Symmetric rise and fall times of about 1 ns were observed corresponding with a recombination lifetime in silicon waveguides determined predominantly by surface recombination processes.","A radio frequency switching power consumed by the modulator device in accordance with the embodiments is estimated to be 7.9 fJ\/bit excluding a state hold power. An estimate of a switching power may be determined by first considering that a total charge carrier injection times a voltage swing provides a switching energy per charge carrier injection. However, since 0-0, 0-1, 1-0, 1-1 transitions are all equally likely in a pseudo-random signal, a switching energy per bit is determined as \u00bcth of the switching energy per transition. A total charge injection for switching is estimated from an optical quality factor (Q \u02dc3000), a group index (n=4.262) and modal volume of the cavity (\u0398=1.96 \u03bcm3) and a free carrier dispersion in silicon. The refractive index shift required for full optical switching across a ring waveguide in accordance with the embodiments is obtained from \u0394n=n\/Q=1.42e-3. This corresponds with an injected charge density of \u03c1=3.9e17 cm\u22123. Hence a total charge injected is \u03a6=251 fC at each 0-1 transition for a modulator device in accordance with the embodiments. An energy per injection may therefore be about 37.7 fJ. However, since 0-0, 0-1, 1-0, 1-1 transitions are all equally likely in a pseudorandom signal, a switching energy per bit is determined as 7.9 fJ\/bit. Also, it is noted that the total energy of a charge carrier injection modulator in accordance with the embodiments is dominated by a direct current power consumption which is determined by VI=e V\u03c1\u0398Q\/\u03c4=267 \u03bcW.","The principle of operation of a micro-ring electro-optic modulator device in accordance with the embodiments as described herein may also be extended to faster operating speeds. By controlling a charge carrier lifetime within a micro-ring within a micro-ring electro-optic modulator device in accordance with the embodiments, one may anticipate that a speed of a micro-ring electro-optic modulator device may be increased while still operating in a low drive voltage regime, with low loss micro-ring waveguides. In , there is show a simulation of a 10 Gbps micro-ring electro-optic modulator device optical transmission (i.e., pointed top peaks) operation with a 500 mV voltage swing (i.e., flat top peaks) by reducing an effective carrier lifetime. A Shockley Read Hall (SRH) recombination rate is increased such that the effective carrier lifetime is 100 \u03bcs. A diode IV forward bias resistance is 110 ohm and a micro-ring resonator loaded Q is 25,000, corresponding with a modest propagation loss of 17 dB\/cm and a photon lifetime of 21 \u03bcs.","4. Extension to Direct Digital Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor Driven Modulators","The proposed fabrication sequence in accordance with the embodiments may enable a high-speed direct digital logic driven micro-ring electro-optic modulator device that may be operated with a single stage (or tapered) inverter. A switching speed of a scaled single stage digital logic driver has been estimated. A maximum switching speed (f=1\/t) for a single stage inverter (see, e.g., ) driven by a minimum sized transistor may be estimated in accordance with equation 4.\n\n=3()()+1.5()\u2003\u2003(4)\n","Within equation 4, C, Vand Iare the capacitance, voltage and current through minimum sized transistor at a given technology node, and Iis the peak current through the modulator. The maximum switching speed of the direct logic drive as a function of the drive current for the modulator is plotted in , where the operating voltages V decrease in concert with the gate lengths L. Gate lengths, voltages and delays are taken from ITRS 2009, Table PIDS2: High Performance Logic Technology Requirements, for exemplary purposes, although other source materials may be used. It is readily apparent that at 1 mA current levels for the present micro-ring electro-optic modulator device, switching speeds approaching 10 GHz may be realized using direct complementary metal oxide semiconductor logic drive transistors. An estimated scaled NMOSFET channel width for a 1 mA drive current is expected to be G=GI\/Ian Iof 664 \u03bcA\/\u03bcm at a 22 nm CMOS technology node. This implies a drive transistor size of 1.5 \u03bcm which can scale down with current densities. It is noted that the peak current in the device simulation shown in  is 3 mA, which corresponds with a scaled digital inverter cut-off bandwidth of 10 GHz in a 16 nm CMOS node. Such a reduction in footprint, driver energy and complexity may enable seamless integration of a micro-ring electro-optic modulator in accordance with the embodiments with CMOS nanoelectronics.","5. Summary","In summary, the embodiments demonstrate an ultra-low drive voltage (150 mV) operation of a charge carrier injection based micro-ring electro-optic modulator device in a Gbit\/s regime in an ultra low mode volume (2 \u03bcm3) silicon modulator device. Such a low voltage driving scheme allows for a direct digital logic driven modulator driven with a micron sized transistor. An ability to scale the voltages of micro-ring electro-optic modulator devices down to few 100 mV may enable compatibility with future low voltage nanoelectronic technologies beyond 22 nm node CMOS, enabling close integration of nano-electro-optics with nanoelectronics.","6.
