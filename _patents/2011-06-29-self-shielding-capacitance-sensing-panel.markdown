{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/360,305, filed on Jun. 30, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference, and also claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/478,346, filed Apr. 22, 2011, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","This disclosure relates to the field of capacitive sensors and, in particular, to a self-shielding capacitive sensing panel.","Computing devices, such as notebook computers, personal data assistants (PDAs), kiosks, and mobile handsets, have user interface devices, which are also known as human interface devices (HID). One user interface device that has become more common is a touch-sensor pad (also commonly referred to as a touchpad). A basic notebook computer touch-sensor pad emulates the function of a personal computer (PC) mouse. A touch-sensor pad is typically embedded into a PC notebook for built-in portability. A touch-sensor pad replicates mouse X\/Y movement by using two defined axes which contain a collection of sensor elements that detect the position of one or more conductive objects, such as a finger. Mouse right\/left button clicks can be replicated by two mechanical buttons, located in the vicinity of the touchpad, or by tapping commands on the touch-sensor pad itself. The touch-sensor pad provides a user interface device for performing such functions as positioning a pointer, or selecting an item on a display. These touch-sensor pads may include multi-dimensional sensor arrays for detecting movement in multiple axes. The sensor array may include a one-dimensional sensor array, detecting movement in one axis. The sensor array may also be two dimensional, detecting movements in two axes.","Another user interface device that has become more common is a touch screen. Touch screens, also known as touchscreens, touch windows, touch panels, or touchscreen panels, are transparent display overlays which are typically either pressure-sensitive (resistive or piezoelectric), electrically-sensitive (capacitive), acoustically-sensitive (surface acoustic wave (SAW)) or photo-sensitive (infra-red). The effect of such overlays allows a display to be used as an input device, removing the keyboard and\/or the mouse as the primary input device for interacting with the display's content. Such displays can be attached to computers or, as terminals, to networks. Touch screens have become familiar in retail settings, on point-of-sale systems, on ATMs, on mobile handsets, on kiosks, on game consoles, and on PDAs where a stylus is sometimes used to manipulate the graphical user interface (GUI) and to enter data. A user can touch a touch screen or a touch-sensor pad to manipulate data. For example, a user can apply a single touch, by using a finger to touch the surface of a touch screen, to select an item from a menu.","The following description sets forth numerous specific details such as examples of specific systems, components, methods, and so forth, in order to provide a good understanding of several embodiments of the present invention. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art, however, that at least some embodiments of the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known components or methods are not described in detail or are presented in a simple block diagram format in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention. Thus, the specific details set forth are merely exemplary. Particular implementations may vary from these exemplary details and still be contemplated to be within the spirit and scope of the present invention.","In one embodiment, a self-shielding capacitive sensor including a plurality of sensor elements may be used with both mutual capacitance and self capacitance sensing methods. One embodiment of such a capacitive sensor may include a first plurality of sensor elements and a second plurality of sensor elements intersecting the first plurality of sensor elements. These may be, for example, row and column sensor elements, where each row sensor element is capacitively coupled with each column sensor element. In one embodiment, the row sensor elements are used to transmit a signal that is measured at the column sensor elements to detect changes in capacitance at each intersection between the row and column sensor elements. In one embodiment, one set of sensor elements may be used to shield the other set of sensor elements from a noise source. For example, the row sensor elements, which may be the transmit sensor elements, may be used to shield the column (receive) sensor elements from a noise source, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), another type of display, or other circuitry. In one embodiment, the shielding sensor elements may be situated in between the noise source and the other set of sensor elements, and may be wider or may cover more area such that substantially all the area of the other set of sensor elements is shielded from the noise source.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","100","116","110","150","116","121","116"]},"In one embodiment, the sensor array  includes sensor elements ()-(N) (where N is a positive integer) that are disposed as a two-dimensional matrix (also referred to as an XY matrix). The sensor array  is coupled to pins ()-(N) of the processing device  via one or more analog buses  transporting multiple signals. In this embodiment, each sensor element ()-(N) is represented as a capacitor. The self capacitance of each sensor in the sensor array  is measured by a capacitance sensor  in the processing device .","In one embodiment, the capacitance sensor  may include a relaxation oscillator or other means to convert a capacitance into a measured value. The capacitance sensor  may also include a counter or timer to measure the oscillator output. The capacitance sensor  may further include software components to convert the count value (e.g., capacitance value) into a sensor element detection decision (also referred to as switch detection decision) or relative magnitude. It should be noted that there are various known methods for measuring capacitance, such as current versus voltage phase shift measurement, resistor-capacitor charge timing, capacitive bridge divider, charge transfer, successive approximation, sigma-delta modulators, charge-accumulation circuits, field effect, mutual capacitance, frequency shift, or other capacitance measurement algorithms. It should be noted however, instead of evaluating the raw counts relative to a threshold, the capacitance sensor  may be evaluating other measurements to determine the user interaction. For example, in the capacitance sensor  having a sigma-delta modulator, the capacitance sensor  is evaluating the ratio of pulse widths of the output, instead of the raw counts being over or under a certain threshold.","In one embodiment, the processing device  further includes processing logic . Operations of the processing logic  may be implemented in firmware; alternatively, it may be implemented in hardware or software. The processing logic  may receive signals from the capacitance sensor , and determine the state of the sensor array , such as whether an object (e.g., a finger) is detected on or in proximity to the sensor array  (e.g., determining the presence of the object), where the object is detected on the sensor array (e.g., determining the location of the object), tracking the motion of the object, or other information related to an object detected at the touch sensor.","In another embodiment, instead of performing the operations of the processing logic  in the processing device , the processing device  may send the raw data or partially-processed data to the host . The host , as illustrated in , may include decision logic  that performs some or all of the operations of the processing logic . Operations of the decision logic  may be implemented in firmware, hardware, software, or a combination thereof. The host  may include a high-level Application Programming Interface (API) in applications  that perform routines on the received data, such as compensating for sensitivity differences, other compensation algorithms, baseline update routines, start-up and\/or initialization routines, interpolation operations, or scaling operations. The operations described with respect to the processing logic  may be implemented in the decision logic , the applications , or in other hardware, software, and\/or firmware external to the processing device . In some other embodiments, the processing device  is the host .","In another embodiment, the processing device  may also include a non-sensing actions block . This block  may be used to process and\/or receive\/transmit data to and from the host . For example, additional components may be implemented to operate with the processing device  along with the sensor array  (e.g., keyboard, keypad, mouse, trackball, LEDs, displays, or other peripheral devices).","The processing device  may reside on a common carrier substrate such as, for example, an integrated circuit (IC) die substrate, or a multi-chip module substrate. Alternatively, the components of the processing device  may be one or more separate integrated circuits and\/or discrete components. In one embodiment, the processing device  may be the Programmable System on a Chip (PSoC\u2122) processing device, developed by Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, San Jose, Calif. Alternatively, the processing device  may be one or more other processing devices known by those of ordinary skill in the art, such as a microprocessor or central processing unit, a controller, special-purpose processor, digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), or other programmable device. In an alternative embodiment, for example, the processing device  may be a network processor having multiple processors including a core unit and multiple micro-engines. Additionally, the processing device  may include any combination of general-purpose processing device(s) and special-purpose processing device(s).","In one embodiment, the electronic system  is implemented in a device that includes the touch-sensing surface  as the user interface, such as handheld electronics, portable telephones, cellular telephones, notebook computers, personal computers, personal data assistants (PDAs), kiosks, keyboards, televisions, remote controls, monitors, handheld multi-media devices, handheld video players, gaming devices, control panels of a household or industrial appliances, or other computer peripheral or input devices. Alternatively, the electronic system  may be used in other types of devices. It should be noted that the components of electronic system  may include all the components described above. Alternatively, electronic system  may include only some of the components described above, or include additional components not listed herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["121","101","121","101","100","121","225","222","223","225","201","212","213"]},"Capacitance sensor  includes multiplexer control , demultiplexer  and multiplexer , clock generator , signal generator , demodulation circuit , and analog to digital converter (ADC) . ADC  is further coupled with touch coordinate converter . Touch coordinate converter  outputs a signal to the processing logic .","The transmit and receive electrodes in the electrode matrix  may be arranged so that each of the transmit electrodes overlap and cross each of the receive electrodes such as to form an array of intersections, while maintaining galvanic isolation from each other. Thus, each transmit electrode may be capacitively coupled with each of the receive electrodes. For example, transmit electrode  is capacitively coupled with receive electrode  at the point where transmit electrode  and receive electrode  overlap.","Clock generator  supplies a clock signal to signal generator , which produces a TX signal  to be supplied to the transmit electrodes of touch sensor . In one embodiment, the signal generator  includes a set of switches that operate according to the clock signal from clock generator . The switches may generate a TX signal  by periodically connecting the output of signal generator  to a first voltage and then to a second voltage, wherein said first and second voltages are different.","The output of signal generator  is connected with demultiplexer , which allows the TX signal  to be applied to any of the M transmit electrodes of touch sensor . In one embodiment, multiplexer control  controls demultiplexer  so that the TX signal  is applied to each transmit electrode  in a controlled sequence. Demultiplexer  may also be used to ground, float, or connect an alternate signal to the other transmit electrodes to which the TX signal  is not currently being applied.","Because of the capacitive coupling between the transmit and receive electrodes, the TX signal  applied to each transmit electrode induces a current within each of the receive electrodes. For instance, when the TX signal  is applied to transmit electrode  through demultiplexer , the TX signal  induces an RX signal  on the receive electrodes in matrix . The RX signal  on each of the receive electrodes can then be measured in sequence by using multiplexer  to connect each of the N receive electrodes to demodulation circuit  in sequence.","The mutual capacitance associated with each intersection between a TX electrode and an RX electrode can be sensed by selecting every available combination of TX electrode and an RX electrode using demultiplexer  and multiplexer . To improve performance, multiplexer  may also be segmented to allow more than one of the receive electrodes in matrix  to be routed to additional demodulation circuits . In an optimized configuration, wherein there is a 1-to-1 correspondence of instances of demodulation circuit  with receive electrodes, multiplexer  may not be present in the system.","When an object, such as a finger, approaches the electrode matrix , the object causes a decrease in the mutual capacitance between only some of the electrodes. For example, if a finger is placed near the intersection of transmit electrode  and receive electrode , the presence of the finger will decrease the mutual capacitance between electrodes  and . Thus, the location of the finger on the touchpad can be determined by identifying the one or more receive electrodes having a decreased mutual capacitance in addition to identifying the transmit electrode to which the TX signal  was applied at the time the decreased mutual capacitance was measured on the one or more receive electrodes.","By determining the mutual capacitances associated with each intersection of electrodes in the matrix , the locations of one or more touch contacts may be determined. The determination may be sequential, in parallel, or may occur more frequently at commonly used electrodes.","In alternative embodiments, other methods for detecting the presence of a finger or conductive object may be used where the finger or conductive object causes an increase in capacitance at one or more electrodes, which may be arranged in a grid or other pattern. For example, a finger placed near an electrode of a capacitive sensor may introduce an additional capacitance to ground that increases the total capacitance between the electrode and ground. The location of the finger can be determined from the locations of one or more electrodes at which an increased capacitance is detected.","The induced current signal  is rectified by demodulation circuit . The rectified current output by demodulation circuit  can then be filtered and converted to a digital code by ADC .","The digital code is converted to touch coordinates indicating a position of an input on touch sensor array  by touch coordinate converter . The touch coordinates are transmitted as an input signal to the processing logic . In one embodiment, the input signal is received at an input to the processing logic . In one embodiment, the input may be configured to receive capacitance measurements indicating a plurality of row coordinates and a plurality of column coordinates. Alternatively, the input may be configured to receive row coordinates and column coordinates.","In one embodiment, the sensor array  can be configured to detect multiple touches. One technique for multi-touch detection uses a two-axis implementation: one axis to support rows and another axis to support columns. Additional axes, such as a diagonal axis, implemented on the surface using additional layers, can allow resolution of additional touches.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["301","311","320","321","328","110","150"]},"The diamond pattern of sensor array  may be used according to a self-capacitance measurement method to detect coupling capacitance between a conductive object, such as a finger, and any of the row or column sensor elements.","When a sensor array  having a diamond pattern is used with a mutual capacitance method, a large coupling of finger capacitance to the receiving (RX) electrodes may cause signal disparity, resulting in loss of sensitivity when the system is poorly grounded and measurement inaccuracies. Furthermore, the diamond pattern of sensor array  may also expose the RX sensor elements to direct noise coupling. For example, if the sensor array  is used as part of a touchscreen, the sensor array  may be made from a transparent material overlaying a noise source such as an LCD or other type of display. In this arrangement, the RX sensor elements may be susceptible to noise from the display that may affect the capacitance measurements.","In one embodiment, false touches or other measurement inaccuracies may result from mechanical stress that causes bending of the sensor array. For example, in a touch screen system having a gap between the touch sensor and a LCD panel, mechanical stress can cause the sensor baseline to change, and the change in sensor baseline may be interpreted as a false touch or a shift in finger coordinates.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["351","351","361","370","371","378","351","351"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["400","400","410","110","110","150","410","420","110","410","420","410","420"]},"In one embodiment, the RX sensor elements  are situated above the wider TX sensor elements . In one embodiment, the wide TX sensor elements  cover substantially all of the area of the sensor array , such that substantially all of the area of the sensor elements  overlaps some portion of one of the sensor elements , except for small areas in between or at the edges of the sensor elements .","As illustrated in , each of the RX sensor elements  includes three parallel sub-elements (such as RX sub-element ) that are electrically connected to each other. Although three sub-elements are pictured for each RX sensor element, the number of sub-elements is not limited to three, but may be more or fewer than three.","The multiple RX sub-elements increase the fringe electric field between the TX and RX sensor elements. Since mutual capacitance sensing methods operate by detecting modulation of the fringe electric field by a conductive object, the multiple RX sub-elements maximize the detectable change in mutual capacitance to achieve a high signal to noise ratio.","In one embodiment, the capacitive coupling between the finger or other conductive object proximate to the sensor array  may be reduced (as compared to the diamond pattern) because of the smaller surface area of the RX sensor elements . This also helps to achieve a high signal to noise ratio.","In one embodiment, the division of the RX sensor elements  into multiple sub-elements can also improve the water rejection characteristics of the sensor array and improve edge accuracy. The number of sub-elements per sensor element and the dimensions of the sub-elements may be optimized to minimize the RC delay (the time delay for the panel to detect a touch, which is affected by the resistance and capacitance of the sensor element) and to maximize the change in mutual capacitance that is caused by a touch or proximity of a conductive object, such as a finger.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":["400","460","400","400","410","420"]},"In one embodiment, the RX sensor elements  are shielded from the LCD panel  or another noise source by the wider TX sensor elements  while the capacitance measurement scan is being performed because the TX sensor elements  (except for the TX element that is actively transmitting) are kept at virtual ground during the measurement scan. In one embodiment, the TX sensor elements  may be situated between the RX sensor elements  and the LCD panel  or other noise source to minimize the area of the RX sensor element  available for direct coupling with the panel  or other noise source. In comparison to other sensor array patterns, such as the diamond pattern of sensor array  in , the self-shielding sensor array  reduces the need for a shield layer between the sensor array and a noise source.","In one embodiment, the wider TX sensor elements  help maintain a constant parasitic capacitance to the RX sensor elements, thus suppressing baseline changes to the RX electrodes due to mechanical stresses, such as bending of the sensor array .","Compared to other sensor array patterns, such as the crossbar pattern of sensor array  illustrated in , the pattern used in the self-shielding sensor array  allows for a more balanced coupling between the finger or other conductive object and the TX and RX sensor elements. For example, when a conductive object approaches the sensor array , a higher capacitance may be formed between the conductive object and the column sensor elements than between the conductive object and the row sensor elements. In contrast, a conductive object approaching the self-shielding sensor array  may form approximately equal capacitances between the conductive object and both the TX and RX sensor elements.","In one embodiment, the width of each sub-element and the number of sub-elements for each of the RX sensor elements  may be chosen so that the surface area of each RX sensor element available for direct capacitive coupling with the finger or other conductive object is approximately equal to the surface area of each TX sensor element available for direct capacitive coupling with the finger or conductive object. This balancing may avoid the use of software or firmware algorithms to boost or equalize the row and column signals.","Although the previous figures illustrate TX sensor elements that are arranged as row elements and RX sensor elements arranged as column elements, the TX sensor elements may alternatively be columns and the RX sensor elements may be rows. The arrangement of TX or RX sensor elements as either rows or columns may be independent of the aspect ratio (such as landscape vs. portrait) of the sensor array. Furthermore, in alternative embodiments, the number of sub-elements of each sensor element may be more or less than three, and may not necessarily have equal widths or be evenly spaced apart.","For example,  illustrates a portion of a self-shielding capacitive sensor array , according to one embodiment.
