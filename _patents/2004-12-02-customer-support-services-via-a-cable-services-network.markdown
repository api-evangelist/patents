In recent years, technology advances have enabled customers to receive an even greater variety of products and services through cable services networks. Modern cable services networks provide traditional video television programming, telephone services, high speed Internet access, electronic mail services, video-on-demand, information services, and the like. Through the use of set-top boxes (computing systems) cable services providers can provide interactive television services to customers. Such interactive television services allow customers to interact directly with services providers in response to services and product offerings presented to the customers through their personal television sets.","With the increase in the availability of and subscription to various cable services and products, customers require significantly greater access to cable services providers for customer support services. For example, customers often need to contact their cable services providers regarding billing and bill payment issues, customers often desire frequently asked questions, or customers may need contact information for one or more offices\/departments operated by their cable services provider.","In a typical setting, a cable services customer must call a general cable services telephone number followed by an extended holding period, or the customer may be transferred to many different offices\/departments before the customer receives the desired customer support services. In the case of billing issues, the customer may need to quickly process a billing payment, but is restrained by the requirement to physically mail or hand-deliver a payment to the services provider.","Accordingly, there is a need for an improved customer support services method and system that allows for efficient provision of customer support services via a cable services network. It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present invention has been made.","Embodiments of the present invention solve the above and other problems by a method and system for providing customer support services through an interactive television session via a cable services network. According to general aspects of the invention, a cable services customer may access a variety of customer support services of his\/her cable services provider via an interactive television session.","If the customer desires to check billing information or pay a pending bill, the customer may request billing data from a billing service via a web services system. Billing data is formatted and is presented to the customer at the customer's local television set via a cable services set-top box that interfaces the customer's television set with the cable services system. If the customer desires to pay a bill through an interactive television session, the customer is provided one or more user interfaces for entering banking account or credit card information and an amount of payment. Payment information provided by the customer is submitted to the cable services system billing system, and a confirmation of the payment information is processed via a web services system. If the payment information submitted by the customer is acceptable, the payment is processed, and the payment confirmation is presented to the customer.","According to another aspect of the invention, a cable services customer may enroll in an automatic bill payment system via an interactive television session. A list of customer accounts are provided to the customer from the cable services system billing system via a web services system. The customer may select to enroll in an automatic bill payment system for one or all of the customer's cable services accounts. Through a user interface presented to the customer at the customer's local television set, the customer may provide banking account or credit card information for automatically paying selected accounts on a periodic basis. Confirmation of the information provided by the customer is performed at the cable services billing system via the web services system.","According to other aspects of the invention, cable services customers may obtain general customer support services information including work order status information, answers to frequently asked questions, contact information for various offices\/departments of the cable services provider, and the like via an interactive television session. Such customer support information may be obtained from a variety of information services through a web services system.
