title: Serial attached SCSI expander management and alarm reporting using SNMP
abstract: Disclosed is a Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) expander. The SAS expander is configured with an Ethernet interface and at least one SAS interface. The Ethernet interface is configured to communicate using TCP/IP protocol. The SAS expander is also configured to send an indicator of an alarm condition using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The indicator of the alarm condition is sent via the Ethernet interface. Configuration functions and status reads or writes of values stored in the SAS expander, or devices coupled to it may also be exchanged using SNMP.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Mass storage systems continue to provide increased storage capacities to satisfy user demands. Photo and movie storage, and photo and movie sharing are examples of applications that fuel the growth in demand for larger and larger storage systems.","A solution to these increasing demands is the use of arrays of multiple inexpensive disks. These arrays may be configured in ways that provide redundancy and error recovery without any loss of data. These arrays may also be configured to increase read and write performance by allowing data to be read or written simultaneously to multiple disk drives. These arrays may also be configured to allow \u201chot-swapping\u201d which allows a failed disk to be replaced without interrupting the storage services of the array. Whether or not any redundancy is provided, these arrays are commonly referred to as redundant arrays of independent disks (or more commonly by the acronym RAID). The 1987 publication by David A. Patterson, et al., from the University of California at Berkeley titled \u201cA Case for Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID)\u201d discusses the fundamental concepts and levels of RAID technology.","RAID storage systems typically utilize a controller that shields the user or host system from the details of managing the storage array. The controller makes the storage array appear as one or more disk drives (or volumes). This is accomplished in spite of the fact that the data (or redundant data) for a particular volume may be spread across multiple disk drives.","An embodiment of the invention may therefore comprise a Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) expander, comprising: an Ethernet interface configured to communicate using TCP\/IP protocol, the SAS expander configured to send an indicator of an alarm condition using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), said indicator of said alarm condition to be sent via said Ethernet interface; and, at least one SAS interface.","An embodiment of the invention may therefore further comprise a method of reporting an alarm condition associated with a Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) expander, comprising: receiving an alarm indicator; and, sending an indicator of said alarm using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), said indicator of said alarm condition to be sent via an Ethernet interface of said SAS expander.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","120","140","140","150","130","132","110","120","150","120","130","132","150","110","150","130","132","120"]},"Network  may be any network or collection of networks that couple, link, or otherwise operatively connect computer  with other devices or systems and is also operatively coupled to storage system  and SAS expander . Network  may include other secondary data networks. In an example, network  may include a backhaul network, a local network, a long distance network, a packet network, the Internet, or any combination thereof, as well as other types of networks.","In an embodiment, SAS expander  includes an Ethernet interface to communicate with network . SAS expander  may support TCP\/IP protocol in order to communicate with network . SAS expander  may also support performing tasks using the SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP). In particular, SAS expander  may be configured to perform SMP tasks and activities in response to messages received or sent using SNMP protocol. These tasks and activities may be performed in response to SNMP messages received from computer  via network .","SNMP is a protocol for managing devices in a network. An SNMP managed device (in managed storage system , this includes but is not limited to, SAS expander ) runs an SNMP agent. An SNMP agent which is typically a software module or task which listens for SNMP requests coming from a managing node (in managed storage system , this includes, but is not limited to computer ).","To be SNMP managed, SAS expander  defines a Management Information Base (MIB). A MIB is a collection of unique object identifiers (called OIDs) which identify an attribute of a managed device. For example, an attribute could be a data store (e.g., a Vendor Identification string of SAS Expander ). In another example, an OID can be a logical entity which identifies a functionality (e.g., an OID can be used to cause SAS expander  to reset). The MIB can be visualized as a tree structure which should be shared between the manager (computer ) and the agent. Both the manager and agent should be able to understand the MIB tree in the same manner. However, the manager typically has a larger MIB tree because it may manage many other devices. Once the MIB is defined, the SAS expander  can be managed using SNMP primitives. In particular, SAS expander  can be managed using, but not limited to, the SNMP-GET and SNMP-SET primitives.","In an embodiment, SAS expander  may receive an indicator of an alarm condition. This alarm condition may be received via a SAS interface from a disk drive -. The alarm condition may be generated internally to SAS expander . For example, SAS expander  may detect an over-temperature condition using an internal sensor. This condition may be reported to computer  using SNMP protocol via network . Other conditions, internally stored values, registers, and the like may be set or reported by SAS expander  to computer  using SNMP protocol. Alarm conditions may be reported to computer  using a SNMP trap message. SAS expander  may be configured to only report certain, predetermined alarm conditions.","By having SAS expander  configured to quickly report any alarming conditions which occur on SAS expander  (or are reported to SAS expander ) to computer , it allows a system administrator to take quick action. Taking quick action may avoid potentially large financial consequences or losses.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","202","150","120","110","204","150","120"]},"An alarm indicator is received ().

In another example, SAS expander  may receive, via a SAS interface, and indication that one of disk drives - is about to fail, or has failed. An indicator of the alarm is sent using SNMP protocol (). For example, SAS expander  may generate an SNMP trap message to inform computer  of the alarm indication. It should be understood that the steps shown in  are independent of each other.
