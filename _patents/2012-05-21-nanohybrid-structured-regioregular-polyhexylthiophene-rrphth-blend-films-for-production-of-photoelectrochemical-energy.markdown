The government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to methods of using nano-hybrid structured regioregular polyhexylthiophene for photoelectrochemical energy application.","2. Description of the Prior Art","In recent years, the photoelectrochemical, organic light emitting diodes, optoelectronic and solar cell devices based on conjugated polymer (p-type) and inorganic nanomaterials (n-type) have been studied due to their high electron mobility, chemical and physical stability of inorganic nanoparticles, and by large ease in fabrication and the flexibility in fabrication of larger cells at low cost. (G\u00fcnes, S.; Neugebauer, H.; Sariciftci, N. S. 2007, 107, 1324-1338; Kim, J. S.; Kim, W. J.; Cho, N.; Shukla, S.; Yoon, H.; Jang, J.; Prasad, P. N.; Kim, T. D.; Lee, K. S. J. Nanosci. Nanotech. 2009, 9, 6957-6961).","The promising photo-conversion efficiencies in photovoltaic systems with PbSe, CdS, CdSe, and nanocrystals in hybrid structures with conjugated polymer in multilayered systems have been studied at large (Huynh, W.; Dittmer, J. J.; Alivisatos, A. P. 2002, 295, 2425-2427; Cui, D.; Xu, J.; Zhu, T.; Paradee, G.; Ashok, S.; Gerhold, M. 2006, 88, 183111; Biju, V.; Kanemoto, R.; Matsumoto, Y.; Ishii, S.; Nakanishi, S.; Itoh, T.; Baba, Y.; Ishikawa, M. J. Phys. Chem. C. 2007, 111, 7924-7932; McCumiskey, E. J.; Chandrasekhar, N.; Taylor, C. R. 2010, 21, 225703; Abken, A. E.; Halliday, D. P.; Durose, K. 2009, 105, 064515). Quantum materials (e.g., polymer-nanocrystal systems) appear promising, but the use of a toxic precursor (e.g., Cd, Pb, etc.) remains a limitation to their development as an alternative to inorganic devices on a large-scale fabrication. In this context, TiOand ZnO nanomaterials, which are non-toxic, offer physical and chemical stability and are promising candidates for hybrid heterojunction photovoltaic cells (Boucle, J.; Chyla, S.; Shaffer, M. S. P.; Durrant, J. R.; Bradley, D. D. C.; Nelson, J. Adv. Funct. Mater. 2008, 18, 4, 622-633; Lin, Y.-Y.; Chu, T.-H.; Li, S.-S.; Chuang, C.-H.; Chang, C.-H.; Su, W.-F.; Chang, C.-P.; Chu, M.-W.; Chen, C.-W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 10, 3644-3649; Mane, R. S.; Lee, W. J.; Pathan, H. M.; Han, S.-H. 2005, 109, 24254-24259).","Recently, reports have been devoted to TiOnanocrystal (nc) polymer blends, mainly because of a strong incompatibility of the polar nanoparticles with common organic solvents. The use of higher hole mobility polymer such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) blends with commercial nc-TiObased photovoltaic device has shown external quantum efficiencies up to 15% in an overall AM1.5 solar power conversion system (Breeze, A. J.; Schlesinger, Z.; Carter, S. A.; Tillmann, H.; Horhold, H.-H. Sol. Energy Mater. Sol. Cells. 2004, 83, 263-271; Wu, M.-C.; Liao, H.-C.; Lo, H.-H.; Chen, S.; Lin, Y.-Y.; Yen, W.-C.; Zeng, T.-W.; Chen, C.-W.; Chen, Y.-F.; Sua, W.-F. Sol. Energy Mater. Sol. Cells. 2009, 93, 961-965; Shim, H. S.; Kim, J. W.; Kim, W. B. J. 2009, 9, 4721-6). More recently, the blends of conjugated polymers and inorganic nanocrystals have offered high electron mobility with improved spectral coverage for energy applications (Stavrinadis, A.; Xu, S.; Warner, J. H.; Hutchison, J. L.; Smith, J. M.; Watt, A. R. Nanotechnology. 2009, 20, 445608; Zhao, L.; Wang, J.; Lin, Z. 2010, 5, 33-44). The effective conduction path for charge transport in conjugated polymer blends with metal oxide or quantum dot still remains a challenge (Selmarten, D.; Jones, M.; Rumbles, G.; Yu, P.; Nedeljkovic, J.; Shaheen, S. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2005, 109, 15927-15932). The RRPHTh has a structure similar to hairy-rod polymers, which could be used for blending with inorganic particles, and form semicrystalline films with crystalline domains embedded in an amorphous matrix (Li, G.; Shrotriy, V.; Yao, Y.; Huang, J.; Yang, Y. 2007, 17, 3126-3140; Iovu, M. C.; Zhang, R.; Cooper, J. R.; Smilgies, D. M.; Javier, A. E.; Sheina, E. E.; Kowalewski, T.; McCullough, R. D. 2007, 28, 1816-1824; Yazawa, K.; Inoue, Y.; Shimizu, T.; Tansho, M.; Asakaw, N. 2010, 114, 1241-1248). The high degree of crystallinity and strong inter-chain interactions in RRPHTh would lead to higher charge mobility since the carriers are no longer confined to a single chain (Loewe, R. S.; McCullough, R. D. 1999, 40, 852-853; Ramajothi, J.; Ochiai, S.; Kojima, K.; Mizutani, T. 2008, 47, 8279-8283; Reyes-Reyes, M.; Kim, K.; Carroll, D. L. 2005, 87, 8, 083506).","Recently, nanodiamond (ND) particles have gained attention due to facile surface functionalization, biocompatibility, quantum information processing, magnetotometry, novel imaging, and IR fluorescence application, and have been shown to enhance the optical and electrochemical properties of conducting polymers (Gomez, H.; Ram, M. K.; Alvi, F.; Stefanakos, E.; Kumar, A. 2010, 114, 18797-18804). These and all other referenced publications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

However, in view of the art considered as a whole at the time the present invention was made, it was not obvious to those of ordinary skill how the art could be advanced.","While certain aspects of conventional technologies have been discussed to facilitate disclosure of the invention, Applicants in no way disclaim these technical aspects, and it is contemplated that the claimed invention may encompass one or more of the conventional technical aspects discussed herein.","The present invention may address one or more of the problems and deficiencies of the prior art discussed above.

It is also characterized using a combination of physical and electrochemical techniques.","The RRPHTh may also be blended with poly(3-octylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3OT) and ND to exploit hybrid structures. Thus, the electrochemical, optical, surface and photochemical properties of ND-RRPHTh and ND-P3OT hybrid can be investigated in different electrolytes. The photoelectrochemical studies presented unexpected photo-conversion properties.","The present invention also provides a method of using of small quantities of nanodiamond to enhance photoconductivity RRPHTh polymers. Promising photoelectrochemical properties of blend ND-RRPHTh nano-hybrid film has been demonstrated. The photoelectrochemical properties of ND-RRPHTh deposited on either n-type silicon or ITO coated glass plate in TBATFB electrolyte is around 8 to 10 times higher in current density, and energy conversion efficiencies as compared to simple RRPHTh, TiO-RRPHTh and ZnO-RRPHTh nano-hybrid films.","In an embodiment, the current invention comprises a nano-hybrid film including a regioregular polythiophene blending substantially uniformly with nanoparticles. The nanoparticles include nanodiamonds, and the blending is achieved in a working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode arranged in an electrolyte. The addition of nanodiamond to the polythiophene unexpectedly and synergistically enhances the photoconductivity of the nano-hybrid film.","The regioregular polythiophene may be a regioregular polyhexylthiophene.","The nanoparticles may further include titanium oxide and\/or zinc oxide.","The working electrode can be an ITO coated glass plate. In a further embodiment, the counter electrode can be an n-type silicon coated glass surface. In yet a further embodiment, the reference electrode can be a gold coated glass surface.","The electrolyte may be tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate.","The nano-hybrid film can be arranged in a photoelectrochemical cell or photovoltaic cell for use in photoelectrochemical applications.","The film can have a thickness of about 500 nm to about 1 \u03bcm.","The nanoparticles may have a blended particle size of about 20 nm to about 100 nm. This is larger than each nanoparticle when blended, and thus, the nanoparticles likely aggregate prior to blending with the polythiophene.","The film may further include poly(3-octylthiophene-2,5-diyl) polymers blended into the regioregular polythiophene to form the film.","In a separate embodiment, the current invention comprises a nano-hybrid film including any one or all of the foregoing limitations.","In a separate embodiment, the current invention includes a method of fabricating a photoelectrochemical cell with enhanced photoconductivity. The method includes the steps of blending nanoparticles into a regioregular polyhexylthiophene polymer on a substrate containing a working electrode, a counter electrode, and a reference electrode arranged within an electrolyte. The nanoparticles include nanodiamonds.","Zinc oxide and\/or titanium oxide may also be blended into the polyhexylthiophene polymer with nanoparticles.","The working electrode may be an indium tin oxide coated glass plate. The reference electrode may be an n-type silicon coated glass surface. The reference electrode may be a gold coated glass surface.","The electrolyte may be tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate providing enhanced photoconductivity.","A poly(3-octylthiophene-2,5-diyl) polymer may also be blended into the polyhexylthiophene polymer with nanoparticles.","These and other important objects, advantages, and features of the invention will become clear as this disclosure proceeds.","The invention accordingly comprises the features of construction, combination of elements, and arrangement of parts that will be exemplified in the disclosure set forth hereinafter and the scope of the invention will be indicated in the claims.","In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and within which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments by which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.","In the broadest aspect, the present invention provides a nano-hybrid film of ND-RRPHTH, TiO-RRPHTh and ZnO-RRPHTh on ITO coated glass plate, n-type Si and gold coated glass surface. The film is fabricated and characterized using a combination of physical and electrochemical techniques.","The present invention provides the method of blending RRPHTh with TiO, ZnO and nanodiamond (ND) nanoparticles using chloroform as a solvent. The morphology, structure, optical, electrochemical and photoelectrochemical properties of nano-hybrid blend RRPHTh film on different substrates are also provided. The ND-RRPHTh has shown unexpected morphological and photoelectrochemical properties. The RRPHTh chains with ND show crystallinity due to diffusion of nanoparticles molecules to nucleation sites to form hexagonal aggregation.","The electrochemical and photochemical characteristics of RRPHTh hybrid film deposited on ITO coated glass plate, gold, and n-type silicon substrates, and gold coated glass surfaces in different electrolytes (e.g., acetonitrile (ACN)+lithium perchlorate (LiClO), ACN+TBAFFBF, camphor sulfonic acid (CSA)+deionized water, hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sulfuric acid (HSO)) are provided. The nano-hybrid diamond film accepts the electrons from electron hole pairs, which are generated due to excitons, then move into the another electrode, such as a platinum electrode. Subsequently, the electron is moving from electrolyte to the other electrode. The ND-RRPHTh nano-hybrid film on n-type Si displays maximum photo-conversion efficiency. This simpler system, the conjugated polymer blending with nanomaterials, presents photo-conversion properties that can be exploited for a variety of photo-energy applications.","RRPHTh, TiO(2-10 nm), ZnO (av. 30-40 nm), LiClO, Camphor sulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid (37%), Acetonitrile, chloroform were all ACS grade, and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). The diamond nanoparticles (99%, dia 5-10 nm) were purchased from International Technology Center. All these chemicals and materials were employed as purchased without any further purification, unless otherwise specified.","The RRPHTh and nanoparticles (e.g., TiO, ZnO and ND) were mixed at 1:1 ratios in chloroform solvent. The RRPHTh was first dissolved and later, equal ratio by weight of TiO, ZnO and ND separately dispersed in the solution and stirred for 48 hrs. Care must be taken as longer stirred solution shows better blending properties. The resulting solution containing RRPHTh with nanoparticles were deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass plates, n-type silicon, and gold coated glass substrates using solution cast and spin coating techniques in a thickness range varying from 500 nm-1 \u03bcm in average measured by stylus profiler.","Optical spectroscopy is well known technique for characterizing conducting polymer to understand the absorption bands of inter- and\/or intra-gap states. FTIR, Raman and UV-vis optical studies on RRPHTh hybrid with TiO, ZnO, NDs polymers is a preferred tool to derive information regarding the vibrational bands, Raman Shift and absorption bands of the film.","The vibrational bands of the nano-blend film deposited on (100) n-type silicon single crystal were measured by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer spectrum-1). The sample chamber of the spectrophotometer was continuously purged with nitrogen for 10-15 minutes before the data collection, as well as during the measurements for the elimination of the water vapor absorption. For each sample, eight (8) interferograms were recorded, averaged, and Fourier-transformed to produce a spectrum with a nominal resolution of 4 cm. FTIR spectra of nano-blend films were obtained after proper subtraction from substrate silicon base line. UV-Vis spectra of RRPHTh blend film deposited of glass were made using a UV-Vis Spectrometer Jasco V-530. The Raman spectra deposited on n-type Si substrates were obtained by a visible-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw 1000) with an Ar laser at a wavelength of 514.5 nm, a laser spot of 1 \u03bcm using a laser power of 25 mW.","The morphology and size of the nano-hybrid RRPHTh films were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi-S4800) at 5 kV, and the molecular level morphology was explored using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (JEOL 3011) at 300 kV. The electrochemical measurements were carried out using a Potentiostat\/Galvanostat instrument (Radiometer Analytical\u2014VoltaLab 40 PGZ301). A standard three electrode configuration was employed, where a glass\/ITO\/nano-hybrid RRPHTh film acted as a working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and Ag\/AgCl as the reference electrode. The reference for the absorbance was a bare ITO-coated glass plate in the corresponding electrolyte. A standard electrochemical cell with a three-electrode system was employed for the photoelectrochemical photocurrent response for the RRPHTh blend films (Ding, H.; Ram, M. K.; Nicolini, C. 2001, 118, 81-88; Valter, B.; Ram, M. K.; Nicolini, C. 2002, 18, 1535-1541; Ram, M.

K.; Zheng, L.; Nicolini, C. 2001, 36, 5423-5428). The electrochemical studies were performed in electrolytes 0.1 M HCl, 0.1 M HSO, 0.1 M LiClOin propylene carbonate, 0.1 M CSA+water, and 0.1 TBATFB in ACN. The electrochemical cell contained films coated on the discussed substrates acting as working electrodes, platinum as a counter electrode, and Ag\/AgCl as a reference electrode for water based electrolytes, whereas silver wire was used as a reference electrode for non-aqueous electrolytes. The photoelectrochemical properties of the nano-hybrid films, ND-RRPHTh, ZnO-RRPHTh and TiO-RRPHTh, in different electrolytes were studied using a 60 watt lamp illuminated from a distance of approximately 5 cm away from the working electrode. The switching on\/off action from the visible light was controlled manually.","The UV-visible absorption spectra of RRPHTH (curve 1); ND-RRPHTh (curve 2), ZnO-RRPHTh (curve 3) and TiO-RRPHTh (curve 4) are shown in . The RRPHTh (curve 1) shows the absorption bands at 525 and 610 nm, the ND-RRPHTh (curve 2) shows the bands at 531, 563 and 611 nm, the ZnO-RRPHTh (curve 3) has the characteristic bands 525 and 610 nm, and the TiO-RRPHTh (curve 4) blend observes the bands at 365, 495 and 600 nm (Boland, P.; Sunkavalli, S. S.; Chennuri, S.; Foe, K.; Abdel-Fattah, T.; Namkoong, G. 2010, 518, 1728-1731; Ram, M. K.; Yavuz, O.; Aldissi, 2005, 151, 77-84). The optical absorption of the blends corresponds \u03c0-\u03c0* transition at the range 400-650 nm (Rikukawa, M.; Nakagawa, M.; Ishida, K.; Abe, H.; Sanui, K.; Ogata, N. 1996, 284-285, 636-639). There is shift of the RRPHTh (\u03c0-\u03c0*) band while blending with TiO, ZnO or ND as compared to pristine RRPHTh, suggesting that the polymer chain packing is perturbed by the incorporation of the nanoparticles.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"sub":["2","\u03b1","\u03b2","\u03b1","\u03b2","2","2"],"sup":["\u22121","\u22121 ","\u22121 ","2 ","3 ","\u22121","\u22121 ","\u22121","\u22121"],"i":["Mater.

A shift in the wave number generally indicates an increase in the crystallinity of RRPHTh polymers and the extension of the effective conjugation length along the polymer backbone for ND-RRPHTh film.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"sub":["2","3 ","2 ","3 ","3","2 ","3","3 ","3","2 ","2","2","2","3","2 ","2 ","2","2","3"],"sup":["\u22121 ","\u22121","\u22121","\u22121","\u22121","\u22121","\u22121","\u22121"],"i":["Adv.

Molecular level morphology was investigated using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (JEOL 3011 operated at 300 kV).","The film of hybrid morphology of the RRPHTh alone and RRPHTh with nanomaterials fabricated on SEM was used to measure the SEM studies.  shows the SEM pictures of RRPHTh, ND-RRPHTh, ZnO-RRPHTh, and TiO-RRPHTh, respectively. It is well known that both the processing methods and the type of solvent used play a critical role both on the degree of organization of conjugated polymer. The SEM analysis does not provide any information on the topography (i.e. height and phase images) of the samples. The RRPHTh picture shows the simple aggregation of the RRPHTh polymer when chloroform was evaporated. The larger-scale roughness may reflect the formation of a gel phase during solvent removal that subsequently collapses to an extent governed by the final polymer content of the film. The hexagonal arrangement of RRPHTh with ND can been observed in  (Motaung, D. E.; Malgas, G. F.; Arendse, C. J.; Malwela, T. 2010, 124, 208-216). This observation suggests that the relative roughness of the nano-hybrid films is attributed to the influence of a strong ND interaction with RRPHTh, ZnO-RRPHTh blend has also shown some degrees of arrangement whereas as more agglomeration would be expected for blends of TiOin RRPHTh. Moreover, no sequential arrangement with TiOnanoparticles intermixing is achieved independently, as was evidenced on the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Nevertheless, the SEM investigations suggest that a reasonable polymer-nanoparticles intermixing is achieved independently of the blend roughness, fir all type of nanoparticles.","The nanostructural characterization of the nanocrystalline films has therefore been employed here to elucidate film morphology using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM micrographs of the RRPHTh films are shown in , and TEM micrographs of the ND-RRPHTh nano-hybrid films are shown in .  show TEM images of the simple aggregation and crystallization of the RRPHTH polymer after chloroform was evaporated, from which the measured average crystallite size was found to be between 7 and 12 nm in the lattice.  are bright-field transmission electron micrographs of a film with a uniform distribution of ND nanoparticles in the RRPHTh conducting polymer at two different scales. Although lattice images reveal individual crystallites at atomic resolution, further TEM analysis of the ND-RRPHTh evidenced that the ND nanoparticles are encapsulated within the RRPHTh polymeric structures. The ND-RRPHTh particle size of 20-100 nm is larger than the ND nanoparticles precursor, indicating that hybrid occurs by aggregation of few nanoparticles of ND.  shows a high resolution TEM of ND-RRPHTH nanocomposite, where aggregated individual ND particles have been characterized.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":["FIG. 6()","FIG. 6()"],"sub":"2 ","i":["J.

The CV is reversible regardless of the presence of different types of nanoparticles blending with RRPHTh. Since polythiophenes typically undergo chemical and electrochemical oxidation to accept one-electron oxidation per about 5 units of the thiophene ring, the linear correlation between maximum redox peak, current (ipa) and square root of potential v(not shown in figure) suggests that diffusion of the RRPHTh molecule to the surface area of the platinum electrode is an important factor to determine ipa, similar to cases of electrochemical reactions of low molecular compounds.

The characterization (i.e., characterization techniques such as Scanning electron microscopy, Atomic force microscopy, FTIR, RAMAN, UV-Vis, electrochemical) were performed in nano-hybrid structures of polythiophenes with nanodiamond blends. The morphology, structure, optical, electrochemical and photoelectrochemical properties of nano-hybrid RRPHTh films deposited on different substrates were investigated. The electrochemical and photochemical properties of ND-RRPHTh hybrid film deposited on ITO coated glass plate, n-type silicon substrates, and gold coated glass surfaces were investigated in different electrolytes. Enhanced photoelectrochemical properties of polythiophenes-nanodiamond deposited on n-type silicon were achieved in terms of current density and energy conversion efficiencies. The solid photovoltaic cell was also fabricated on ND-polythiophene based structured materials. This conjugated polymer blending with nanomaterials presented unexpected photo-conversion properties, which can be exploited for various photo-energy applications.","Nano-hybrid film of conducting polymer with nanodiamond showed the regular hexagonal arrangement of RRPHTh with ND. The hybrid particle size of 20 nm-100 nm was larger than the ND nanoparticles precursor, indicating that hybridization occurs by the aggregation of few nanoparticles of ND in blend structure. The UV-Vis study showed that there was a shift of the RRPHTh (\u03c0-\u03c0*) band while blending with ND, ZnO, or TiOwhen compared to pristine RRPHTh, suggesting that the polymer chain packing was perturbed by the incorporation of the nanoparticles. The shift in Raman band in blend showed that the extension of the effective conjugation length along the polymer backbone for nano-hybrid film based on nanodiamond polythiophenes hybrid structures. The photoelectrochemical properties of ND-RRPHTh deposited on either n-type silicon or ITO coated glass plate in TBATFB electrolyte was around 8 to 10 times higher in current density and energy conversion efficiencies as compared to RRPHTh, ZnO-RRPHTh, and TiO-RRPHTh nano-hybrid films. The ND-RRPHTh nano-hybrid films provided percolating channels for holes transport to the electrode. The ND-RRPHTh film provided current around 70 \u03bcA, whereas RRPHTh, ZnO-RRPHTh, and TiO-RRPHTh provided current around 5 \u03bcA, 9 \u03bcA, and 7 \u03bcA, respectively, when a 60 Watt bulb was switched on and off for the films in an electrolyte containing TBATFB, Ag wire was used as reference electrode and Pt was used as counter electrode in a photoelectrochemical cell. Similar results were also observed for P3OT-ND film. The synthesis parameters of substituted polythiophenes are understood and can be variable.","The nanoparticles (ND, ZnO, and TiO) and RRPHTh were mixed at 1:1 ratio in chloroform solvent. Initially, 1 g of RRPHTh was dissolved in 100 ml chloroform for 5-6 hours, and then equal weight of each nanoparticle was separately dissolved in the RRPHTh\/chloroform solution. Similarly, 1 g of P3OT was dissolved in 100 ml chloroform 6 hours, and equal weight of nanodiamond is dissolved in the P3OT\/chloroform solution. The mixture was stirred for 48 hours at room temperature. Care must be taken since the longest stirred solutions have shown the optimum physical properties of blend films. The resulting solution containing RRPHTh with nanoparticles were deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass plates, n-type silicon, and gold coated glass substrates using solution cast and spin coating techniques in a thickness range varying from 500 nm-1 \u03bcm in average measured by stylus profiler.","Various techniques have been used for characterization of hybrid structures (Ding, H.; Ram, M.

K.; Zheng, L.; Nicolini, C. 2001, 36, 5423-5428). The electrochemical studies were performed in electrolytes, 0.1 M HCl, 0.1 M HSO, 0.1 M LiClOin propylene carbonate, 0.1 M CSA+water, and 0.1 TBATFB in ACN. The electrochemical cell contained films coated on the substrates acting as working electrodes, Pt as a counter electrode, and Ag\/AgCl as a reference electrode for water based electrolytes, whereas silver wire was used as a reference electrode for non-aqueous electrolytes. The photoelectrochemical properties of the ND-RRPHTh, ZnO-RRPHTh and TiO-RRPHTh nano-hybrid films in different electrolytes were studied using a 60 W lamp illuminated from a distance of about 5 cm away from the working electrode. The switching on\/off action from the visible light was controlled manually.","The UV-visible absorption spectra of RRPHTh, ND-RRPHTh, ZnO-RRPHTh, and TiO-RRPHTh are shown in . The RRPHTh (curve 1) reveals the absorption bands at 525 and 610 nm, ND-RRPHTh (curve 2) shows the bands at 531, 563 and 611 nm (Boland, P.; Sunkavalli, S.

The ZnO-RRPHTh shown in Figure (curve 3) has the characteristic bands at 525 and 610 nm. The TiO-RRPHTh blend (curve 4) show the bands at 365, 495 and 600 nm (Boland, P.; Sunkavalli, S.

The optical absorption of the blends corresponds to \u03c0-\u03c0* transition at the range 400-650 nm (Rikukawa, M.; Nakagawa, M.; Ishida, K.; Abe, H.; Sanui, K.; Ogata, N. 1996, 284-285, 636-639).
