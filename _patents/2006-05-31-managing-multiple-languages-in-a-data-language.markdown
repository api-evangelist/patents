title: Managing multiple languages in a data language
abstract: Described are various methods and apparatuses that provide for variants for multiple resource types and efficiently managing these resources by use of common variables and an organized file structure. A file structure is organize by a common variables, such as the $lang variable, and includes resource references such that once the common variable is defined, similar resources can be referenced using the same instruction by the use of modifying the common variable. Multiple resource types, including text, images as well as other resource types may be managed using the file structure disclosed herein.

No. 60\/686,180, filed May 31, 2005, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated herein by this reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to variable processing of software applications. More particularly, the invention relates to creating file structures and resource processing with common variables.","2. Description of the Related Art","Data languages are becoming a more pervasive way to program. Data languages include markup languages, such as those based on XML, including HTML, TRIGML (owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated). Data driving languages are extensively used in programming web-based applications but are not limited thereto. Examples of XML based languages also include billing and transaction processing applications.","Difficulties rise in a couple of instances when using data languages. For example, in developing a user interface (UI), it is desireable to have the availability to multiple languages for an application depending on the language desired by the application running on the device. For example, a wireless device used in France may want to access the term \u201cbonjour\u201d whereas a wireless device used in the United Kingdom may want to access the term \u201cHello\u201d for the same purposes.","In addition to text, however, there may be other resource types that the application would like to vary based on the culture, language, or other variable. For example, the application may wish to display the Eiffel Tower as a backdrop if the language is selected as French, yet may wish to display Buckingham Palace for English. Similary, more risque pictures may be desired for those languages\/cultures that the application developer believes are more appropriate versus more reserved images for those languages\/cultures the application developer believes is more reserved.","Current methods use to address this problem is the use of language packs. Microsoft Word, for example, can install a language pack. This language pack merely changes a pointer value for a defined term. For example, a French language pack installed would substitute the menu option for \u201cedit\u201d the corresponding French word, such as \u201cediter.\u201d Multiple language packs may be installed, but they become hard to manage as the number of language dependent resources gets large. Further, there is no solution to managing resources based on other variants.","Therefore, what is needed in the art is a method, apparatus and system for that allow the managing the language variants for multiple types of resources. Further, what is need is a method, apparatus and system for providing variants for multiple resource types and managing resources using multiple variants.","Systems and methods consistent with the present invention overcome the shortcomings of existing systems by creating systems, methods and apparatuses that provide for variants for multiple resource types and efficiently managing these resources by use of common variables and an organized file structure.","In one embodiment, a method for generating a structure for managing resources using a variable in a data language comprises receiving a plurality of resource references distinguished by a variable and building a structure using the variable and the plurality of resource references, wherein the plurality of resource references may be accessed by modifying the variable value.","In another embodiment, a method for generating a file structure to access similar resource reference distinguished by a common variable comprises dividing the file structure using the common variable type placing a value associated with each of the similar resource references in the same relative location within the file structure.","In yet another embodiment, a device for storing a file structure to access similar resource references distinguished by a common variable comprises a memory, the file structure stored in the memory, wherein the file structure is organized via a common variable and the similar resource references are located within the file structure as the same locations within different common variable values and a processor to retrieve the resource references using the common variable value.","In yet another embodiment, a computer readable medium containing computer executable instructions that when executed generates a file structure to access similar resource references distinguished by a common variable by performing the step of dividing the file structure using the common variable and placing a value associated with each of the similar resource references in the same relative location within the file structure referenced by the common variable.","In yet another embodiment, a method of managing resources in a data language comprises receiving a request for a resource using a parameter, modifying the parameter, and receiving a request for a related resource, modified using the parameter.","In yet another embodiment, a method for receiving a request for a resource value contained within a file structure organized using a common variable comprises storing a value of the common variable, receiving the request for a resource, wherein the request contains the common variable and resource reference, retrieving the value of the common variable, and retrieving the resource value using the retrieved common value and the resource reference by looking up a location in the file structure associated with the common value and the resource reference. This method may further include modifying the value of common variable, receiving a request for a second resource value contained within the file structure organized using the common variable and the resource reference, retrieving the modified common variable, retrieving a second resource value using the modified common variable and the resource reference.","Other objects, advantages and features of the present invention will become apparent after review of the herein after set forth Brief Description of the Drawings, Detailed Description of the Invention and the Claims.","Reference will now be made in detail to the presently exemplary and preferred embodiments of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters designate like or corresponding parts throughout the several drawings. The nature, objectives and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent to those skilled in the art after considering the following detailed description in connection with the accompanying drawings.","Regarding use of terms, in this description, the terms \u201cwireless device,\u201d \u201cwireless telephone,\u201d and \u201cmobile device\u201d are used interchangeably. The term \u201capplication\u201d as used herein is intended to encompass executable and nonexecutable software files, raw data, aggregated data, patches, content, user interfaces and user interface components, and other code segments. Further, like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several views, and the articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d includes plural references, unless otherwise specified in the description.","The following description relates to a user interface resource management method, apparatus and system using TrigML data language. TrigML is a data language useful in developing User Interfaces. TrigML is a product owned by QUALCOMM Corporation. Like data languages defined under XML, TrigML code includes the use of tags. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that while the forgoing description is in terms of a UI, TrigML and managing languages, that it is applicable to other applications than UI, may be implemented in data languages other than TrigML, including other XML based languages, and may be use to manage other resource types using variants other than language.","Embodiments of the present invention include managing resources, such as text and images by managing languages.

The processor  executes the application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) layer  that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory  of the mobile device. The memory  can include random-access or read-only memory (RAM or ROM), EPROM, EEPROM, flash memory, or any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform  also includes a local storage  that can hold software applications, files, or data not actively used in memory , such as software applications or user interface components downloaded from the user interface server  (). The local storage  is typically comprised of one or more flash memory cells, but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EPROM, EEPROM, optical media, tape, or soft or hard disk.","The computer platform  also includes a display  that may be used by the software applications to display data using the user interface (not shown).","The components shown in  are typical of many types of mobile devices, but it will be appreciated that other components may be added to the mobile device  and in certain cases, some components shown in  may be omitted from the mobile device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["301","301"]},"In this example, the computing device  includes a processor unit , a memory , a storage medium , and an audio unit .

However, if \u201cGerman\u201d does not exist, the trigplayer would revert to the previous $lang value that was valid. Therefore, if the $lang value of English was successfully used previously, the trigplayer would then try to find \u201ctext\/English\/a\u201d when the above expression was encountered.","Alternatively, the trigplayer may have a default value for $lang that it always reverts to.

This method tests whether the string $lang is present in the resource path for the resource object.","When the resource path of an object is a new argument of lang which if it is passed in will substitute the presence of $lang with the passed in language. This code can then be called by the TrigCompiler when it is generating the resource paths to go into the bar file.
