Kubatova and W. Seames, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/074,206 filed on Jun. 20, 2008, for \u201cThermal Cracking Method to Produce Short Chain Carboxylic Acids from Biomass\u201d by A. Kubatova and W. Seames, which are incorporated by reference.","This invention was made, at least in part, with U.S. Government support under contract numbers 04-C-GA-ERAU, amendment #039, awarded by the Federal Aviation Administration. The U.S. Government may have certain rights in this invention","One of the key challenges facing modern industrialized society is the rapid depletion of crude oil, which is the primary source for most transportation fuels and many organic chemicals. The petrochemical industry represents a substantial benefit to human society and the invention and commercialization of alternative sources for petrochemicals is of great importance.","Two categories of organic chemicals that are often produced from petroleum are short chain carboxylic acids and short chain carboxylic esters. These chemicals have a wide range of uses, which include serving as monomers for many types of polymers, paints, coatings, and fragrance sources for perfumes and other commodities.","The use of short chain carboxylic acids as monomers is of particular importance. Substantial efforts have been made in recent years to develop usable polymers from fatty acids bound within triacylglycerides. Processes such as the Soyol process incorporate triacylglyceride fatty acids directly into polymers. One disadvantage of these processes is that the resulting polymers have properties that are different, and in many cases inferior, to existing polymers produced from petrochemical-based monomers.","Surprisingly, very little work has been done to chemically modify triacylglycerides to produce more useful fatty acid-based monomers and other commodity chemicals that are identical, or nearly identical, to existing monomers. Thus, a need exists to provide an alternative source for these chemicals so that demand can be satisfied as the source material, crude oil, diminishes.","The invention described herein provides a process for the production of commercial grade short chain carboxylic acids and short chain carboxylic esters from triacylglycerides, long chain fatty acids, long chain lipids, or similar chemicals.","One embodiment of the present invention is a method for producing a mixture of short chain carboxylic acids from biomass. The method includes adding biomass to a reactor vessel, heating the biomass to crack it, removing undesired and unreacted materials and light ends from the cracked biomass, and removing a mixture containing carboxylic acids having carbon chain lengths between C2 and C16.","Another embodiment of the present invention is a composition including a carboxyl group-containing compound derived by cracking biomass and having a carboxyl carbon chain length between C2 and C16.","In a first aspect of the invention, an oil containing primarily fatty acids embedded within triacylglyceride obtained from plants, expressed from algae, derived from animal biomass, or derived from other sources is added to a reactor vessel.","In a second aspect of the invention, the oil is heated in the reactor vessel to a temperature from about 100\u00b0 C. to about 600\u00b0 C. at a pressure ranging from about vacuum conditions to about 3000 psia for a time sufficient to crack the oil. During the process, undesired material, unreacted oil, and light ends are removed from the cracked oil. The purified material contains chemical compounds that are desirable for isolation as short chain carboxylic acids and fuels.","In a third aspect of the invention, short chain carboxylic acid compounds are extracted from fuel compounds and are purified. The short chain carboxylic acids generally include fatty acids with 2-12 carbon atoms (C2-C12). Desirable fuel components generally include C4-C16 alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, cycloparaffins, and alcohols.","In a fourth aspect of the invention, preferential extraction of selected fatty acids is carried out by liquid-liquid extraction using a basic aqueous solvent such as an amine like trimethylamine. The fatty acid rich solvent is regenerated to liberate the fatty acids from the solvent. Individual C2-C12 fatty acids are obtained in purified form by physical and\/or chemical separation.","In a fifth aspect of the invention, preferential extraction of selected fatty acids is carried out by a sequential liquid-liquid extraction method whereby room temperature water is used to preferentially extract C2-C5 fatty acids, then higher temperature water or a basic aqueous solution is used to selectively extract C4-C7 fatty acids, and finally pressurized hot water or another solvent is used to preferentially extract C6-C12 fatty acids. After extraction individual C2-C12 fatty acids are obtained in purified form by physical and\/or chemical separation.","In a sixth aspect of the invention, esterification of one or more of the individual C2-C12 short chain fatty acids or a mixture thereof using an alcohol or a mixture of alcohols is carried out. Esterification alcohols employed for the esterification include, but are not limited to, methanol, ethanol, normal propanol, iso-propanol, normal butanol, iso-butanol, allyl alcohol, and other alcohols. After esterification, the esterified material is separated from unreacted material.","In order to accurately describe the invention, the following terms are defined to have the following associated meanings:","\u201cBiofuel\u201d means any fuel that is derived from plant or animal biomass.","\u201cBiomass\u201d means any organic, non-fossil material that is derived from the mass of any biological organism excluding mass that has been transformed by geological processes in substances such as coal or petroleum.","\u201cBiomass oil\u201d means any oil derived from a biomass source.","\u201cCarboxyl group\u201d means a portion of a chemical molecule that contains a carbon atom with a double bond connection to an oxygen atom and where the same carbon atom is also connected to a hydroxyl group, and where no other atoms are connected by a chemical bond to the doubly-bonded oxygen atom. This structure is acidic because in certain solutions, the hydrogen atom on the hydroxyl group readily dissociates from the chemical molecule, forming a cation (the hydrogen atom) and an anion (the remainder of the chemical molecule).","\u201cCatalyst\u201d means those substances that accelerate the rate or ease of a chemical reaction.","\u201cCatalytic cracking\u201d means a cracking process that uses a catalyst.","\u201cCracking\u201d means any process that changes the chemical composition of an organic chemical or chemical mixture by cleaving one or more carbon-carbon bonds in one or more molecules.","\u201cCrop\u201d means any plant.","\u201cDiesel\u201d means a fuel made commercially for diesel-powered vehicles.","\u201cCarboxylic acid ester\u201d is a chemical compound formed by the reaction of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, where a terminal hydrogen atom of the carboxyl group is replaced by a carbon chain (radical) from the alcohol.","\u201cFatty acid\u201d means a carboxylic acid with a saturated or unsaturated aliphatic tail.","\u201cHydroxyl group\u201d means a portion of a chemical molecule containing an oxygen atom connected by a single bond to a hydrogen atom and also connected by a single bond to the rest of the chemical molecule, where the hydrogen atom is not connected to any other atoms.","\u201cLight ends\u201d means chemicals which stay in the gaseous phase at conditions of temperature and pressure at which middle distillates are in the liquid phase.","\u201cMiddle distillate\u201d means a chemical which has properties amenable for inclusion in a gasoline, kerosene, or diesel type fuel or which have a volatility similar to those paraffins and\/or olefins which are amenable for inclusion in a gasoline, kerosene, or diesel type fuel. A middle distillate can also contain carboxylic acids.","\u201cPlant\u201d means any living organism that is a member of the kingdom Plantae or of the division Chiorphyta (green algae).","\u201cPlant oil\u201d means lipids that are derived from plant sources. Examples of plant oil include crop oils or oilseeds and vegetable oils.","\u201cShort chain carboxylic acid\u201d means a chemical compound with no more than 12 carbons that contains a carboxyl group.","\u201cShort chain carboxylic ester\u201d means a chemical compound derived from a short chain carboxylic acid in which the carboxylic acid group is replaced by an ester group.","\u201cTars\u201d are very long chain chemical compounds generated during the cracking reaction.","\u201cThermal cracking\u201d means a cracking process that involves the addition of energy in the form of thermal energy as measured by an increase in the temperature of the substance being cracked.","\u201cTriacylglyceride\u201d or \u201cTG\u201d is a major component of unmodified plant oils, it is an ester of glycerol and three fatty acids.","\u201cUnreacted raw material\u201d is the material in the cracking reactor product stream that has a chemical composition that is not amenable as a middle distillate blend component and can be further exposed to cracking reactor conditions and transformed into middle distillate and\/or light ends and\/or tars. These compounds may be chemically identical to the original starting material, a fatty acid whose length is identical or similar to the fatty acid chains on an original triacylglyceride (when triacylglycerides are in the feedstock) or a partially cracked paraffin, olefin, or carboxylic acid that has too many carbon atoms in the primary carbon chain to be amenable as a middle distillate blend component.","No previous invention or published work has been identified that describes the use of thermal and catalytic cracking for the formation of short chain carboxylic acids and\/or esters. Thus, there is a need to develop a method that allows a crop oil, biologically generated lipid, or animal fat oil feedstock to be converted into these important and valuable chemicals. The current invention utilizes separation technologies coupled with thermal\/catalytic cracking techniques in order to develop crop oil-, biologically generated lipid-, or animal fat-based chemicals that can replace commercially available chemicals generated from other feed stock sources.","The present invention is directed to the production and purification of C2 to C16 short chain carboxylic acids with potentially subsequent conversion to short chain carboxylic esters from plant oils, biologically generated lipids, or animal fats. Specifically, the feedstocks are triacylglyceride compounds. This invention provides a means to produce these valuable and necessary chemicals from new feedstocks, not currently utilized in their production. The chemical modifications, based on the use of cracking and separation techniques, are designed to produce commercial-quality short chain carboxylic acid chemical products that can directly replace comparable chemical products generated from other feedstock sources.","Research exploring triacylglycerides thermal and catalytic cracking (individual triacylglycerides and vegetable oils) has occurred sporadically in the last few decades. From these works, a set of organic reactions have been identified as occurring during the thermal\/catalytic cracking of triacylglycerides. These reactions are illustrated in Table 1 below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"441pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"1.

Saturated fatty acids do not contain any double bonds or other functional groups. Unsaturated fatty acids contain two or more carbon atoms having a carbon-carbon double bond. Saturated acids include stearic (C18; 18:0), palmitic (C16; 16:0), myristic (C14; 14:0), and lauric (C12; 12:0). Unsaturated acids include those such as linolenic (cis, cis, cis C18; 18:3), linoleic (cis, cis C18; 18:2), oleic (cis C18; 18:1), hexadecanoic (cis, cis C16; 16:2), palmitoleic (cis C16; 16:1), and myristoleic (cis C14; 14:1).","It is known that thermal and catalytic cracking of medium (C10-C14) and\/or long (greater than C16) chain fatty (naturally synthesized carboxylic) acids, coupled with separation and purification technologies, can produce a mixture of chemicals suitable for use as a fuel or a fuel blendstock, most specifically as components in diesel, kerosene, aviation turbine, and motor gasoline fuels. An example of a method for deriving fuel from biomass is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/824,644 (Seames), which is herein incorporated by reference. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/824,644 describes a process for producing a fuel from biomass with a cloud point below \u221210\u00b0 C. The present invention describes a process that can produce short chain carboxylic acids and carboxylic acid esters while also producing materials suitable for use fuels or fuel blendstocks. Combining production of short chain carboxylic acids and acid esters with fuel or fuel products offers the ability to produce not one but two beneficial products using one set of cracking parameters.","In the cracking process, energy is used to break carbon-carbon bonds. Once broken, each carbon atom ends up with a single electron and free radicals. Reactions of the free radicals can lead to the various products illustrated in Table 1. The breaking of large organic molecules into smaller, and more useful, molecules can be achieved by using high pressures and\/or temperatures with a catalyst (catalytic cracking) or without (thermal cracking). Previous research has shown that medium (C10-C14) and long (greater than C16) chain fatty (naturally synthesized carboxylic) acids are compatible for the cracking processes, using either thermal or catalytic cracking. These techniques have been used in previous inventions and studies to modify the chemical composition of crop oils or biodiesel. However, they have not been used to produce commercial quality short chain carboxylic acids and\/or esters.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","10","10"]},"A catalyst can be used to improve the yield of desirable products, decrease the formation of unwanted products, or increase the efficiency of the cracking reaction due to lower pressure, temperature, or residence time requirements. Catalysts include but are not limited to zeolites, carbon and rare metals such as palladium, niobium, molybdenum, platinum, titanium, aluminum, cobalt, gold and mixtures thereof.","The cracking output is subjected to a variety of processing and purification steps  dependent upon the material generated. The output from the cracking reactor depends upon the specific reactor design employed. The following are examples of reactor types known to those skilled in the art: batch, continuous flow through, flow through packed bed, and fluidized bed. Material generated in the cracking reactor can generally be defined as light ends , unreacted raw materials (recyclables) , residual materials or residue (tars) , and middle distillate .","Light ends  are unreacted vapor-phase materials that were added to the reactor to manipulate the cracking reaction, such as hydrogen, nitrogen, or water vapor, in addition to small molecular weight organic chemicals and hydrocarbons generated in the cracking reactor. The small molecular weight organic chemicals and hydrocarbons, such as methane, methanol, ethane, ethanol, n-pentane, i-pentane, pentene, pentanol n-butane, i-butane, butanol, butane, methyl ester, ethyl ester, etc., have chemical and physical properties that are undesirable (such as being too volatile) when present in substantial concentrations of short chain carboxylic acid extracts or middle distillate fuel components. Light ends are separated from the other material that exits the reactor by gas-liquid phase separation, distillation, condensation, or other processes in purification step .","Unreacted raw materials  are chemicals that enter the cracking reactor but are not converted to chemical compounds with carbon chains shorter than C16. These materials have some chemical and physical properties that are undesirable in the fuel products. Unreacted raw materials are separated from the middle distillate components by distillation or other separation techniques in purification step . Unreacted or uncracked raw materials  can then be returned to the cracking reactor, fed to a second cracking reactor or utilized for some other purpose.","Residual material or residue tars  are chemicals produced during cracking reactions that have a higher molecular weight, lower volatility and\/or lower heating value than is desirable in middle distillate . Some of the residual components  can be separated from middle distillate  along with unreacted raw materials  and processed with these unreacted raw materials . Other residue components , typically those of higher molecular weight, will be in the form of solid material (at room temperature) after the cracking reaction. These compounds are typically known as \u201ctars.\u201d Tars  may contain valuable chemical compounds, such as boiler fuel or other by-products that can be extracted from residual material  by various process methods including solvent extraction, distillation, etc or may contain chemicals that can be transformed by chemical reactions into valuable chemical compounds. Depending upon the design of the cracking reactor, tars  may not be amenable to further processing. Such tars  may be oxidized, combusted or otherwise removed from the cracking reactor or cracking catalysts by methods known in the art.","Middle distillate components  are short chain carboxylic acid compounds generated in the cracking reactor as well as those portions of the remaining material that contribute to desirable chemical and physical properties of fuel or fuel blend stock products.","Short chain carboxylic acids  are removed from middle distillate  using one or more process methods (step ) including solvent extraction, distillation, etc. One embodiment of such a process is illustrated in . Middle distillate  enters a short chain fatty acid (SCFA) extraction column in step . Solvent, such as a 40% aqueous solution of trimethylamine, hot water or aqueous NaOH, is delivered to the extraction column. The solvent absorbs short chain fatty acids as it passes through the column, generating an SCFA-rich solvent while other components (e.g., biofuel components ) remain in a separate liquid phase and are removed from the column separately. Mixed short chain fatty acids  are separated from the solvent. The solvent can then be regenerated (step ) and delivered back to the extraction column.","Once short chain carboxylic (fatty) acids  are isolated from middle distillate , they can be processed and purified further. Additional purification steps produce product streams that contain primarily single components or specific groups of short chain carboxylic acids . One embodiment of a typical purification scheme is shown in . Light fatty acids (C5 and shorter) and heavy fatty acids (C6 to C16) are separated from mixed short chain fatty acids  by mixed SCFA splitter . The separated fatty acids are then further separated using distillation columns to extract fatty acids of particular carbon chain lengths. For example, the light short chain fatty acids are delivered to a series of distillation columns. Acetic acid is isolated in acetic acid column , propanoic acid is isolated in propanoic acid column , butyric acid is isolated in butyric acid column  and valeric acid is isolated in valeric acid column . Less volatile (heavy) short chain fatty acids are isolated in a similar manner using hexanoic acid column , heptanoic acid column  and heavy SCFA splitter  (for fatty acids having eight or more carbon atoms on the carbon chain). The purification process selected is dependent upon the technology used to isolate short chain carboxylic acids  from the fuel components of middle distillate .","Individual or mixtures of the short chain carboxylic acids  produced in this process can be further processed into short chain carboxylic acid esters by reacting the short chain carboxylic acid with one or more alcohols. Unreacted and\/or by-product material is then removed from the product short chain carboxylic acid esters to obtain commercial quality short chain carboxylic acid esters.","In one embodiment of the invention, a triacylglyceride crop oil, biologically generated lipid, animal fat oil or a transesterified derivative of any of these oils (biomass ) is heated to a temperature ranging from 300\u00b0 C. to 500\u00b0 C., in a cracking reactor, at pressures ranging from vacuum conditions to 3000 psia, in the presence of a gaseous environment that can contain an inert gas such as nitrogen, water vapor, hydrogen, a mixture of vapor-phase organic chemicals or any other gaseous substance, for residence times ranging from one to 180 minutes to affect cracking reactions that change the chemical composition of the contents of the cracking reactor. The vapor leaving the cracking reactor (crackate), is subjected to downstream processing that can include cooling and partial condensation, vapor\/liquid separation, extraction of by-product chemicals by solvent extraction or other chemical\/physical property manipulation, in-situ reaction, distillation or flash separation to produce an acceptable transportation fuel, such as aviation turbine fuel or diesel fuel. The liquid and solids leaving the reactor (residue) are subjected to downstream processing that can include cooling or heating, liquid\/solid separation, vapor\/liquid separation, vapor\/solid separation, extraction of by-product chemicals by solvent extraction or other chemical\/physical property manipulation to produce an acceptable fuel by-product or byproducts. Unreacted and partially reacted material  separated from either the crackate or the residue may be recycled to the cracking reactor, routed to additional cracking reactors or used in other processes.","A two liter per hour continuous cracking reactor system was used as the cracking reactor. Thermal cracking under vacuum conditions was applied to soybean oil. Output from the cracking reactor (crackate) was analyzed and then processed further. The light hydrocarbons were removed in a packed distillation column, and the heaviest were removed using a second packed distillation column. This produced a middle distillate liquid containing a high percentage of short chain carboxylic acids. The middle distillate was then mixed with an equal amount of room temperature, purified water and the oil and water phases were then separated. This step removed most of the C2-C4 fatty acids. The oil from this extraction was then mixed with an equal amount of 1M NaOH in purified water and the oil and aqueous phases were then separated. Table 4 summarizes the results of the short chain fatty acid extractions with water and NaOH. The amounts of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) extracted are represented by % (w\/w) of middle distillate .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 4"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},"SCFA","SCFA"]},{"entry":["FA","SCFA","extracted","extracted"]},{"entry":["Carbon","in distillate","with water","with NaOH"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Chain","Mean",{},"Mean",{},"Mean",{}]},{"entry":["Length","% (w\/w)","SD","% (w\/w)","SD","% (w\/w)","SD"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["2","2.84","0.13","2.84",{},"2.84",{}]},{"entry":["3","3.23","0.19","3.23",{},"3.23"]},{"entry":["4","1.33","0.03","1.05","0.01","1.30"]},{"entry":["5","1.64","0.03","0.51","0.03","1.49","0.01"]},{"entry":["6","2.14","0.05","0.05","0.06","1.88","0.04"]},{"entry":["7","3.06","0.06",{},{},"1.88","0.13"]},{"entry":["8","2.66","0.05",{},{},"0.41","0.14"]},{"entry":["9","2.55","0.03"]},{"entry":["10","2.70","0.08"]},{"entry":["11","0.31","0.01"]},{"entry":["16","0.04","0.001"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"As in Example 1, a middle distillate  containing a high percentage of short chain carboxylic acids was produced from soybean oil.
