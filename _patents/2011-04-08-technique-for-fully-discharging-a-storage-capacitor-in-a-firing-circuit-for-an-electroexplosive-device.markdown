This application is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.","The invention was made with United States Government support under Contract No. W31P4Q-06-C-0330 awarded by the Navy. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","The invention relates to miniature electro-explosive devices (EEDs) and more particularly to electro-explosive devices activated with complete discharge of a storage capacitor.","Many miniature electro-explosive devices (EEDs) are fired (activated) by the rapid discharge of the energy stored in a storage capacitor into the bridgewire of the EED by the closure of a switch, typically a Field Effect Transistor (FET). In many designs, the capacitor is not able to be fully discharged because as the capacitor voltage drops (as the discharge progresses), the gate-to-source voltage across the FET drops below the turn-on threshold, essentially turning off the switch. Fully discharging the capacitor is desirable to increase the reliability of firing the EED, but a method is needed to achieve this in a low-cost fashion utilizing a minimum number of components, particularly in applications where the volume available for the firing circuit is limited.","What is needed, therefore, are techniques for fully discharging a storage capacitor.","One embodiment of the present invention provides a firing circuit configured for complete discharge of a storage capacitor, the firing circuit comprising: a storage capacitor; an inductor; a diode; a transistor switch having a gate to which the inductor and the diode are connected in series; the inductor and the capacitor being configured for inductor capacitor ringing, the inductive capacitive ringing creating upon initiation of the circuit a gate voltage at the gate having a greater magnitude than the initial capacitor voltage of the storage capacitor; and the diode blocking the discharge of the gate voltage ensuring that the capacitor can be fully discharged.","Another embodiment of the present invention provides such a firing circuit further comprising a transistor switch disposed between the capacitor and the inductor.","A further embodiment of the present invention provides such a firing circuit wherein the transistor switch is a field effect transistor.","Still another embodiment of the present invention provides such a firing circuit wherein the field effect transistor is a p-type field effect transistor.","Even another embodiment of the present invention provides such a firing circuit where the capacitor is a gate to source capacitance of the field effect transistor.","An even further embodiment of the present invention provides such a firing circuit wherein the diode is a forward biased diode.","Yet another embodiment of the present invention provides such a firing circuit wherein a gate voltage of the transistor switch, upon triggering of the firing circuit swings to a negative value approximately equal to a voltage of the storage capacitor less a forward voltage of the diode.","A yet further embodiment of the present invention provides such a firing circuit wherein a gate to source voltage of the field effect transistor is the difference between twice a storage capacitor voltage and a diode forward voltage.","A still yet further embodiment of the present invention provides such a firing circuit wherein during discharge; a gate to source voltage of the first field effect transistor remains substantially constant.","One embodiment of the present invention provides a method for the complete discharge of a storage capacitor in a firing circuit, the method comprising: instantiating an inductive capacitive ringing in the firing circuit thereby creating a negative gate voltage of a field effect transistor equal to a voltage of the capacitor less a forward voltage of a diode; preventing the flow of current in an opposite direction by disposing a positive bias diode before the field effect transistor gate.","The features and advantages described herein are not all-inclusive and, in particular, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and not to limit the scope of the inventive subject matter.","A circuit  configured according to one embodiment of the present invention and illustrated in  consisting of an inductor  and a diode , connected to the gate of the FET , provides a simple and cost-effective solution to the problem of incomplete discharge of a capacitor in a firing circuit with a minimum number of added components. The circuit illustrated in  showing the added inductor  and diode . Inductive capacitive ringing of this circuit increases the gate voltage at the Gate FET  to a value higher than the initial voltage of the storage capacitor ; the diode  blocks the discharge of the gate voltage ensuring that the capacitor  can be fully discharged (as long there is continuity in the bridgewire).","In such an embodiment, the circuit  provides an inductor , a diode , a storage capacitor  (in some embodiments the gate to source capacitance of the FET may serve as the capacitor), and a FET having a gate  to which the inductor  and the diode  are connected in series.","The other end of the series connected diode  and inductor  are connected to a transistor switch  (in some embodiments such a transistor switch may be FET or Bipolar transistor) which connects the diode and inductor to ground when a firing trigger pulse is received at the gate of the transistor . When triggered the circuit  creates inductor capacitor ringing, thus providing a FET  gate voltage, as illustrated in , that swings below ground to a negative level that is approximately equal to the storage capacitor voltage minus the forward voltage of the diode . The gate to source voltage of the FET  is therefore equal to 2 times the storage capacitor voltage minus the forward voltage of the diode as opposed to just the storage capacitor voltage in the known methods. Further once the Gate to source voltage has swung to its most negative value the diode prevents current from flowing in the opposite direction and therefore stops further ringing thereby maintaining the peak FET gate to source voltage. Further as the storage capacitor voltage drops during its discharge the FET gate to source voltage remains relatively constant since there is not a rapid discharge path for the capacitor . The FET therefore remains in its low resistance state providing for complete storage capacitor discharge.","One embodiment of the present invention provides a firing circuit  configured for complete discharge of a storage capacitor , the firing circuit comprising: a storage capacitor ; an inductor ; a diode ; a transistor switch  having a gate to which the inductor  and the diode  are connected in series; the inductor  and the capacitor  being configured for inductor capacitor ringing, the inductive capacitive ringing creating upon initiation of the circuit a source to gate voltage at the FET  that is higher than the initial capacitor voltage of the storage capacitor ; and the diode  blocking the discharge of the gate voltage ensuring that the capacitor  can be fully discharged. In one such embodiment, the firing circuit  has the transistor switch  disposed between the capacitor  and one terminal of the EED bridgewire .","In various embodiments of the present invention, the transistor switch  may be a field effect transistor, for instance a p-type field effect transistor.","In alternative embodiments, the capacitor  may be a gate to source capacitance of the field effect transistor.","In such a system the gate voltage of the transistor switch, upon triggering of the firing circuit swings to a negative value approximately equal to a voltage of the storage capacitor less a forward voltage of the diode or a gate to source voltage of the field effect transistor is the difference between twice a storage capacitor voltage and a diode forward voltage.","A still yet further embodiment of the present invention provides such a firing circuit wherein during discharge; a gate to source voltage of the transistor switch remains substantially constant.","One embodiment of the present invention provides a method for the complete discharge of a storage capacitor in a firing circuit, the method including instantiating a inductive capacitive ringing in the firing circuit thereby creating a negative gate voltage of a field effect transistor equal to a voltage of the capacitor less a forward voltage of a diode; preventing the flow of current in an opposite direction by disposing a positive bias diode before the field effect transistor gate.","The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description. Each and every page of this submission, and all contents thereon, however characterized, identified, or numbered, is considered a substantive part of this application for all purposes, irrespective of form or placement within the application.
