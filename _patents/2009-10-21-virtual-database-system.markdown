title: Virtual database system
abstract: Information from multiple databases is retrieved and stored on a database storage system. Multiple point-in-time copies are obtained for each database. A point-in-time copy retrieves data changed in the database since the retrieval of a previous point-in-time copy. A virtual database (VDB) is created by creating a set of files in the data storage system. Each file in the set of files created for a VDB is linked to the database blocks on the database storage system associated with a point-in-time copy of the source database. The set of files associated with the VDB are mounted on a database server allowing the database server to read from and write to the set of files. Workflows based on VDBs allow various usage scenarios based on databases to be implemented efficiently, for example, testing and development, backup and recovery, and data warehouse building.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Virtual Database Systems"],"p":["This invention relates generally to databases, and in particular to storage efficient systems for managing databases and lifecycle workflows based on databases.","Databases store the data that is critical to an organization and thus form an important part of an organization's information technology infrastructure. As the information available in an organization grows, so does the complexity of the infrastructure required to manage the databases that store the information. The increased complexity of the infrastructure increases the resources required to manage the databases and the applications that depend on the databases. These increased costs may include the costs associated with hardware for managing the databases as well as the costs associated with additional personnel needed to maintain the hardware. The increased complexity of the infrastructure also affects the maintenance operations associated with the databases, for example, causing backup and recovery operations to take significantly longer.","In a typical organization's infrastructure environment, production database servers run applications that manage the day-to-day transactions of the organization. Changes to production databases or to applications that depend on the production databases are tested on copies of the databases to protect the production environment. Copies of the production databases may be required for several stages in the lifecycles of workflows associated with the production database and applications that depend on the production databases. For example, the stages in the lifecycle of a change incorporated in a production database may include a development stage, a tuning stage, a testing stage, a quality assurance stage, a certification stage, a training stage, and a staging stage. Making copies of the production databases for each stage requires redundant and expensive hardware infrastructure as well as the time overhead required to copy the data, which may take days or weeks. Additional hardware also requires additional costs associated with physically storing the hardware, such as floor space requirements and costs related to power and cooling. Furthermore, redundant hardware typically causes inefficient use of available resources.","Lifecycle workflows can be complex and often involve coordination across multiple teams. Hence, making a database available for a specific purpose, such as for supporting a particular stage in the lifecycle, may require further processing associated with the databases. For example, databases often contain critical confidential information, causing security and integrity to be important considerations in an environment managing databases. As a result, access permissions required for different teams working on different stages are often different. For example, data that can be accessed by personnel managing the production database server is often different from data that can be accessed by a person working in the testing stage of the lifecycle. This causes further complications related to administration of permissions across various stages of the lifecycle of any workflow related to the databases.","To address the needs unmet by existing database technologies, embodiments of the invention enable virtual databases that efficiently use storage and other computing resources. Methods of creating a virtual database (VDB) read different point-in-time copies of a source database. In these embodiments a \u201csource database\u201d includes physical copies of the database in an enterprise that includes production database, standby database, and any other life cycle databases. In the detailed description of invention that follows \u201cproduction database\u201d and \u201csource database\u201d are used interchangeably to mean the same. Multiple database blocks are read from the source database and stored on a storage system. A database block is a unit of data used by a database and comprises a specific number of bytes stored in the storage. A database block can also be referred to as a page. A portion of the database block stores metadata associated with the database block. Examples of information that may be stored in the metadata of a database block include information related to the data stored in the database block, information related to objects of database that the database block is part of, or information indicating when the data in the database block was updated. The information indicating when a database block was updated may be available as a relative ordering of the database blocks based on their time of update. The database blocks retrieved from the source database and stored on the storage system correspond to different point-in-time copies of the source database and at least some of the database blocks are associated with multiple point-in-time copies of the source database. A set of files are created for a virtual database. Each file in the set of files created for a VDB is linked to the database blocks on the storage system associated with a point-in-time copy of the source database. The set of files associated with the VDB are mounted on a database server allowing the database server to read from and write to the set of files. In an embodiment, a virtual database may be created based on point-in-time copies of another virtual database.","In an embodiment, multiple VDBs can be created based on the database blocks associated with the same point-in-time copies of the source database. Alternatively, two VDBs created may be associated with different point-in-time copy of the source databases. The database blocks stored on the storage system may be shared between sets of files associated with different VDBs. The sharing of database blocks stored on the storage system may occur between VDBs associated with the same point-in-time copy of the source database or between VDBs associated with different point-in-time copies of the source database. In an embodiment, pre-script operations may be performed before linking, loading, or provisioning operations. The pre-script operation allows user specified operations to be executed, for example, processing information that may not be stored in the source database. Similarly, post-script operations may be performed after linking, loading, or provisioning operations. A post-script operation may be associated with a pre-script operation and perform further processing on the information processed in the pre-script operation.","In an embodiment, a request can be received from the database server to read the data stored in the VDB. The data requested is accessed from the database blocks and sent to the database server in response to the read request. In another embodiment, a request can be received from the database server to write data to the VDB. A database block associated with a file in the set of files associated with the VDB is identified for writing the data sent in the write request. If the database block identified is also associated with the second VDB, a copy of the database block is made. The copied database block is linked to the file and the data in the write request is written to the copied database block. The original database block that was copied remains associated with the second VDB allowing the second VDB to view data unchanged by the write operation.","The features and advantages described in this summary and the following detailed description are not all-inclusive. Many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims.","The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.","In certain embodiments of the invention, one or more virtual databases are created based on the state of a production database or a virtual database at a particular point in time, and the virtual databases can then be individually accessed and modified as desired. A database comprises data stored in a computer for use by computer implemented applications. A database server is a computer program that can interact with the database and provides database services, for example, access to the data stored in the database. Database servers include commercially available programs, for example, database servers included with database management systems provided by ORACLE, SYBASE, MICROSOFT SQL SERVER, IBM's DB2, MYSQL, and the like. A database may be implemented using a database model, for example, a relational mode, object model, hierarchical mode or network model. The term \u201cproduction database\u201d is used in particular examples to illustrate a useful application of the technology; however, it can be appreciated that the techniques disclosed can be used for any database, regardless of whether the database is used as a production database. Furthermore, embodiments can create a virtual database using storage level snapshots of production databases or clones of production databases instead of a live production database. The virtual databases are \u201cvirtual\u201d in the sense that the physical implementation of the database files is decoupled from the logical use of the database files by a database server.","In one embodiment, information from the production database is copied to a storage system at various times, such as periodically. This enables reconstruction of the database files associated with the production database for these different points in time. The information may be managed in the storage system in an efficient manner so that copies of information are made only if necessary. For example, if a portion of the database is unchanged from a version that was previously copied, that unchanged portion need not be copied. A virtual database created for a point in time is stored as a set of files that contain the information of the database as available at that point in time. Each file includes a set of database blocks and the data structures for referring to the database blocks. In some embodiments, the database blocks may be compressed in order to store them efficiently. In some embodiments, the database blocks may be stored in the storage system data store  in an encrypted form to increase security of stored data. A virtual database may be created on a database server by creating the database files for the production database corresponding to the state of the production database at a previous point in time, as required for the database server. The files corresponding to the virtual database are made available to the database server using a file sharing mechanism, which links the virtual database to the appropriate database blocks stored on the storage system. The process of making the virtual database available to a database server is called \u201cprovisioning\u201d the virtual database. In some embodiments, provisioning the virtual database includes managing the process of creating a running database server based on virtual database. Multiple VDBs can be provisioned based on the state of the production database at the same point in time. On the other hand, different VDBs can be based on different point in time state of the same production database or different production databases. In some embodiments, provisioned databases are monitored for health and user actions. The database storage system  is notified of these events. The database storage system  handles these events based on either built-in or user specified rules. For example, if a user action affects availability of a virtual database, a warning message can be displayed on monitoring console or transmitted to a user via email. The database server on which a virtual database has been provisioned can then read from and write to the files stored on the storage system. A database block may be shared between different files, each file associated with a different VDB. In particular, a database block is shared if the corresponding virtual database systems  are only reading the information in the database block and not writing to the database block. In one embodiment, the virtual database manager  makes copies of the database blocks only if necessary. For example, a particular database block may be shared by multiple VDBs that read from the same database block. But if one of virtual database systems  attempts to write to the database block, a separate copy of the database block is made because the writing operation causes that database block to be different for the VDB corresponding to that virtual database systems  than it is for the other VDBs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["110","100","110","140","100"]},"In response to a request from the administrator system , or based on a predefined schedule, the database storage system  may send a request  for data to a production database system . The production database system  responds by sending information stored in the production database as a stream of data . The request  is sent periodically and the production database system  responds by sending information representing changes of data stored in the production database since the last response  sent by the production database system . The database storage system  receives the data  sent by the production database system  and stores the data. The database storage system  may analyze the data  received to determine whether to store the information or skip the information if the information is not useful for reconstructing the database at previous time points. The database storage system  stores the information efficiently, for example, by keeping versions of database blocks that have changed and reusing database blocks that have not changed. In an embodiment, database storage system  employs a hierarchical caching system where high speed solid-state drive (SSD) or equivalent storage devices are configured for caching read operations and for persisting logs for writing operations to magnetic disks.","To create a virtual database, the database storage system  creates files that represent the information corresponding to the production database system  at a given point in time. The database storage system  exposes  the corresponding files to a virtual database system  using a file sharing system . The virtual database system  runs a database server that can operate with the files exposed  by the database storage system . Hence, a virtual copy of the production database is created for the virtual database system  for a given point in time in a storage efficient manner.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2(","FIG. 2("],"b":["130","110","100","130","230","205","240","210","230","130","205","110","240","130","110","230","205","100"],"i":["a","b"]},"System Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["110","100","140","130"]},"A production database system  is typically used by an organization for maintaining its daily transactions. For example, an online bookstore may save all the ongoing transactions related to book purchases, book returns, or inventory control in a production system . The production system  includes a database server , a production DB data store , a vendor interface module , and a production system library . In alternative configurations, different and\/or additional modules can be included in a production database system .","The production DB data store  stores data associated with a database that may represent for example, information representing daily transactions of an enterprise. The database server  is a computer program that provides database services and application programming interfaces (APIs) for managing data stored on the production DB data store . The production system library  provides APIs useful for extracting information from the production database system . The vendor interface module  represents APIs provided by a vendor for customizing functionality provided by the database server , for example, APIs to retrieve database blocks that changed since a previous time point. An example of a vendor interface module is the program code of a database server provided by vendor ORACLE that implements RMAN APIs. Database servers provided by other vendors, for example, MICROSOFT's SQL SERVER or IBM's DB2 have similar APIs. In one embodiment, the vendor interface module  mounts the production DB data store  of the production database system  on the database storage system  using a file sharing system similar to the file sharing system . Mounting the production DB data store  on the database storage system  allows transfer of information stored on the production database system  to the database storage system .","The production system library  may be implemented in different ways depending on the requirements of the vendor interface module . In an embodiment, the vendor interface module  loads the production system library  in order to call back functions implemented in the production system library . For example, the production system library  may be a shared object file with a \u201c.so\u201d or a \u201c.DLL\u201d file extension that contains executable program code that can be called by a C\/C++ executable program or by a JAVA program that uses the JAVA NATIVE INTERFACE for interaction with binary code generated by C\/C++ programs. Alternatively, the production system library  may be implemented using the JAVA programming language and installed in the production database system  as a file with \u201c.jar\u201d extension. The java program requires a JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE running on the production database system  for execution. In another embodiment, a part of the production system library  may be implemented as an executable \u201c.so\u201d shared object file and another part of the production system library  may be implemented as a JAVA program installed as a \u201c.jar\u201d file.","The vendor interface module  responds to requests from database storage system , and in response to the requests, collects requested information from the production DB data store  and returns the collected information to the database storage system . The vendor interface module  may send request to the database server  for retrieving information from the production DB data store . The vendor interface module  loads the program code in the production system library  and invokes it to transmit the stream of data for to the database storage system  for further processing. In some embodiments the vendor interface module  may directly interact with the production DB data store  instead of sending a request to the database server  to retrieve the necessary database blocks. In other embodiments, the vendor interface module  may retrieve the necessary database blocks from storage level snapshots of production databases or clones of production databases instead of a live production database.","The database storage system  retrieves information available in the production database systems  and stores it. The information retrieved includes database blocks comprising data stored in the database, transaction log information, metadata information related to the database, information related to users of the database and the like. The information retrieved may also include configuration files associated with the databases. For example, databases may use vendor specific configuration files to specify various configuration parameters including initialization parameters associated with the databases. Copying the configuration files allows a VDB to be created with configuration parameters similar to the source production database. In some embodiments, the configuration parameters files may be modified by a database administrator using the user interface  to customize the VDB configuration for a specific usage scenario. For example, the production database may be accessed by a database server  using a particular cache size whereas the corresponding VDB may be accessed by a database server  using a different cache size.","The information retrieved may also include information associated with applications using the database, for example, an enterprise resource planning (ERP) application may be using the database and may have data specific to the ERP application. Retrieving the ERP application data allows a similar ERP application to be executed with a VDB created based on the production database system. This is beneficial for usage scenarios where a VDB is created for an environment similar to the production environment, for example, for testing and development. A database administrator can use the user interface  to specify logic for copying the information that is specific to a production environment as well as logic for appropriately installing the information with a VDB for use by a virtual database system .","In some embodiments, information regarding users of the production database, for example, the users with administrative privileges may be obtained by using specific APIs or by running specific scripts on the production database. The information about the users can be used to facilitate life cycle management of VDBs in the system. In an embodiment, a database administrator is allowed to use the user interface  in order to specify information regarding user accounts to be created and their access permissions. For example, if the VDB is created for testing purposes, test users may be created on the VDB for test organization whereas if the VDB is created as a standby for the production database, only users with production support roles should have access. In some embodiments, access permission may specify if a user can provision a privileged VDB. One example of privileged VDB is a VDB with full access to non-public information (information that may not be accessible to non-privileged users), for example, social security numbers or credit card information. The corresponding un-privileged VDB is a VDB with non-public information masked or scrambled. Another example of privileged VDB is a VDB with sensitive data accessible transparently. The corresponding un-privileged VDB is a VDB with sensitive information encrypted.","In some embodiments, access privileges are simplified to three levels: administrator, owner, and auditor. Administrator has full control of all managed objects including databases and hosts. The control available to an administrator included policy management. Owner has access to use of resources, for example, an owner can provision a VDB. Auditor can view logs but may not have rights to consume system resources.","The data stored in the storage system data store  can be exposed to a virtual database system  allowing the virtual database system  to treat the data as a copy of the production database stored in the production database system . The database storage system  includes a point-in-time copy manager , a transaction log manager , a interface manager , a system configuration manager , a storage allocation manager , a file sharing manager , a virtual database manager , and a storage system data store . In alternative configurations, different and\/or additional modules can be included in the database storage system .","The point-in-time copy manager  interacts with the production database system  by sending a request to the vendor interface module  to retrieve information representing a point-in-time copy (also referred to as a \u201cPIT copy\u201d) of a database stored in the production DB data store . The point-in-time copy manager  stores the data obtained from the production database system  in the storage system data store . The data retrieved by the point-in-time copy manager  corresponds to database blocks (or pages) of the database being copied from the production DB data store . After a first PIT copy request to retrieve information production DB data store , a subsequent PIT copy request may need to retrieve only the data that changed in the database since the previous request. The data collected in the first request can be combined with the data collected in a second request to reconstruct a copy of the database corresponding to a point in time at which the data was retrieved from the production DB data store  for the second request.","The transaction log manager  sends request to the production database system  for retrieving portions of the transaction logs stored in the production database system . In some embodiments, the request from the transaction log manager  is sent to the vendor interface module . The data obtained by the transaction log manager  from the vendor interface module  is stored in the storage system data store . In one embodiment, a request for transaction logs retrieves only the changes in the transaction logs in the production database system  since a previous request for the transaction logs was processed. The database blocks retrieved by a point in time copy manager  combined with the transaction logs retrieved by the transaction log manager  can be used to reconstruct a copy of a database in the production system  corresponding to times in the past in between the times as which point-in-time copies are made.","The storage allocation manager  provides the functionality of saving data retrieved from the production database system . For example, the point-in-time copy manager  may call APIs of storage allocation manager to save blocks of data retrieved from the production database system . The storage allocation manager  keeps track of the various versions of each block of data that may be obtained from the production database system . For a given time point, the storage allocation manager  can be requested to provide the latest version of a block of data obtained before the given time point. The storage allocation manager  can also be used for making copies of blocks of data. If a block of data is copied for read-only purposes, the storage allocation manager  allocates only sufficient storage to keep a pointer of reference to the exiting block of data. However, if an attempt to write to the copied block of data is made, the storage allocation manager  allocates sufficient storage to make an actual copy of the block of data to avoid updating the original block of data.","The file sharing manager  allows files stored in the storage system data store  to be shared across computers that may be connected with the database storage system  over the network. The file sharing manager  uses the file sharing system  for sharing files. An example of a system for sharing files is a network file system (NFS). A system for sharing files may utilize fiber channel Storage area networks (FC-SAN) or network attached storage (NAS) or combinations and variations thereof. The system for sharing files may be based on small computer system interface (SCSI) protocol, internet small computer system interface (iSCSI) protocol, fiber channel protocols or other similar and related protocols. In some embodiments, the database storage system  may utilize a logical volume manager. Sharing a file stored in the storage system data store  using the file sharing manager  allows a remote computer, for example, the virtual database systems  to access the data in the shared file. A remote system may be able to read and write from\/to the file shared by the storage system data store . In an embodiment, files are organized in a format emulating a given file system disk layout, such as the file system of WINDOWS operating system called NTFS or the UNIX file system (UFS).","The virtual database manager  receives requests for creation of a virtual database for a virtual database system . The request for creation of a virtual database may be sent by a database administrator using the administration system  and identifies a production database system , a virtual database system , and includes a past point-in-time corresponding to which a virtual database needs to be created. The virtual database manager  creates the necessary files corresponding to the virtual database being created and shares the files with the virtual database system . The database administrator for a virtual database system  may be different from a database administrator for the production database system .","The interface manager  renders for display information necessary for display using the administration system . A database administrator user can see information available in the storage system data store  as well as take actions executed by the database storage system. For example, a database administrator can see the different production databases stored in the storage system data store  obtained from different production database systems . As another example, the database administrator can request the database storage system  to make a PIT copy of a database stored on a production database system  at a particular point-in-time. In an embodiment, the interface manager  allows external applications to access information of the database storage system . For example, the database storage system may provide application programming interface (API) to allow third party vendors to write applications based on database storage system . In an embodiment, the interface manager  provides web services that allow web applications to access information available in the database storage system . For example, the database storage system can be part of a cloud computing environment. A third party vendor can use web services to implement various workflow scenarios based on VDBs, for example the various workflow scenarios described herein. This allows automation of the workflow scenarios based on VDBs.","The system configuration manager  allows a database administrator using the administration system  to setup or change the configuration of the database storage system . For example, when the database storage system is being initially setup or at a later stage, the system configuration manager  allows a database administrator user or an agent to specify production database systems  and virtual database systems  to connect to. The system configuration manager  also allows a user with appropriate roles and privileges to setup policies specifying the schedule with which the point-in-time copy manager  retrieves PIT copies of databases in the production database systems  as well as the frequency and the times at which the transaction log manager  retrieves updates to online transaction logs from the production database systems . In an embodiment, a schedule can specify the frequency and times during the day for the PIT and log retrieval actions or it could be an a periodic schedule specifying the calendar days when the same action should take place.","In an embodiment, policies can be defined by a database administrator and stored in the system configuration manager  for various operations associated with the loading of point-in-time copies from production database systems , loading of transaction logs from the production database systems , purging of information from the database storage system  including point-in-time copies of databases and transaction log information, and provisioning of virtual database systems. A policy specifies rules for executing the specific operation. For example, a policy may specify the operation to be executed based on a predetermined schedule. A policy may determine when to purge PIT copies stored in the database storage system  based on number of PIT copies that have been accumulated for a production database. A policy may measure storage availability to determine when to purge information. For example, if the amount of storage available reaches below a threshold level, old PIT copies of selected databases may be purged. The policy may also specify priority of production databases to be used before purging information, for example, low priority database information is purged before purging high-priority database information. In a particular workflow scenario, a policy may determine when to obtain new information from a production database and automatically update VDB information and provision the updated VDB based on the new information.","A virtual database system  includes a database server  and a VDB system library . The database server  is similar in functionality to the database server  and is a computer program that provides database services and application programming interfaces (APIs) for managing data stored on a data store . The data managed by the database server  may be stored on the storage system data store  that is shared by the database storage system  using a file sharing system . The VDB system library  contains program code for processing requests sent by the database storage system . In alternative configurations, different and\/or additional modules can be included in a virtual database system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","110","110","310","405","335","110","110","405","405","140","100","405","110","100","480","480","100","405","450","480"]},"The production database system  sends the requested data to the point-in-time copy manager . If the request  is the first request for data associated with a database stored on the production database system , the production database system  sends the data of the entire database in reply. In response to subsequent requests , the production database system  sends only the data of the database blocks that changed since the last time a reply was sent  in response to a previous request .","In an embodiment, the vendor interface module  sends  a request to the database server  to collect the information required for the reply . The vendor interface module  also loads the program code available in the production system library . The database server sends  a request for the necessary data to the data store  and receives the requested data in response . The database server  sends  the requested data to the vendor interface module  in response to the request . The vendor interface module  invokes  the production system library  to package the data received  from the database server into a format that can be processed by the point-in-time copy manager . The production system library  sends  the requested data stream that is formatted appropriately to the point-in-time copy manager . The production system library  sends  the information sent  by the database server to the point-in-time copy manager . The vendor interface module  in conjunction with the program code of the production system library  builds the data stream for processing by the database storage system .","In other embodiments, the vendor interface module  in conjunction with the production system library  obtains the required data directly from the data store  and sends  the data to the point-in-time copy manager . Typically, these embodiments are beneficial when the database server  does support appropriate APIs for extracting the necessary information. In these embodiments, the production system library  includes code to analyze the structures of the files of the database stored in the data store  and also includes code to process metadata associated with database blocks stored in the data store  to find database blocks that changed since a previous time point.","The reply  is a stream of data comprising database blocks that may be stored in multiple files in the data store . The stream of data corresponding to the reply  may interleave information associated with the different database blocks, for example, database blocks obtained from different files may be interleaved. Hence, the program code of the point-in-time copy manager  processes the data stream without assuming any particular order of the database blocks received in the data stream. These database blocks may also belong to different databases.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["110","310","310","510","310","515","110"]},"The point-in-time copy manager  analyzes  the metadata for each database block to determine if the database block needs to be stored in the storage system data store  or it can be eliminated. For example, the log sequence number in the metadata of the database block may indicate that even though the production system library  sent  the database block along with the data stream, the database block was never updated since the last reply  received from the production system library . Hence, the block need not be stored in the storage system data store  and can be skipped. Other examples of database blocks that need not be stored include temporary database blocks, session specific database blocks, and empty database blocks that have no data written in them. Another example of database blocks that need not be stored includes database blocks that are not meaningful or inaccessible to database software. Another example includes database blocks that have been marked deleted, emptied, or invalidated by database software.","In the above embodiment, the information sent  by the production database system  included unnecessary blocks that were eliminated after the data stream was received by the database storage system . In other embodiment, some or all of the unnecessary blocks may be eliminated while the data stream is built by the production system library . In this embodiment, the data stream sent  to the database storage system  by the production database system  is reduced in size resulting in efficient communication between the two systems.","By skipping database blocks that do not need to be stored as well as by using compression of the stored database blocks, the database storage system may achieve significant savings in terms of storage required for the database files compared to the production database system for the data corresponding to the same database. For example, the storage space occupied by the data corresponding to a production database in the storage system data store  may be a quarter of the space occupied by the production database in the production DB data store . Note that the entire information corresponding to the production database system is obtained by the first PIT copy. Subsequent PIT copies obtain only the changed information in the production DB and can be much smaller than the information contained in the first PIT copy.","If the point-in-time copy manager  determines  that a database block in the data stream can be skipped, the point-in-time copy manager  proceeds to identify  the next database block for processing. In an embodiment, the point-in-time copy manager  uses the database block size available in the stream metadata to identify database block boundaries in the stream of data. Each block is then processed accordingly.","If the point-in-time copy manager  determines that the database block in the data stream needs to be stored in the data storage system data store , the point-in-time copy manager  analyzes the database block metadata to map  the database block to a database file and a location within the file. The point-in-time copy manager  sends  a request to the storage allocation manager  to save  the database block. The storage allocation manager  stores  the database block in the appropriate file associated with database block in the storage system data store . The point-in-time copy manager  checks  if the data stream is processed completely. If there is unprocessed data remaining in the data stream, the point-in-time copy manager  proceeds to identify the next block of data for processing.","The storage allocation manager  may keep several different versions of the database block in the storage system data store  corresponding to the data in the database block if it is updated at different points in time. The file in which the database block is saved comprises a file header including metadata associated with the file and a sequence of database blocks. Each vendor specific database server  organizes the database information as a set of files that the database server  is capable of processing. The organization of information using the set of files for the database may be vendor specific and the database storage system incorporates the program logic to organize the database information in vendor specific organization of files. The point-in-time copy manager  creates a set of files structure that may be similar to the set of files of the database in the data store . However, the information in the storage system data store  may include multiple versions of the database blocks, each corresponding to updated information at different points in time. In an embodiment, the storage allocation manager  stores the database blocks associated with the files in an efficient manner, such that a copy of a database block is made only if the database block was updated for a point-in-time. For example, if a block B is updated at time T but not at time T, whereas a block B is updated at time T and T both, the data structure of the storage system data store  does not keep a copy of the database block B for time T whereas it keeps a version of the database block B for time T.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["320","385","320","110","445","445","385","450","445","320","335","345","350","110","320","460","365","440","390"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["110","100","320","600","110","320","320","610","110","320","620","320","630"]},"In an embodiment, the transaction log manager  waits  a predetermined interval of time between log file updates and sends  the next request to the production database system  to check if new updates to the transaction log updates are available. If no updates were made to the production database during this time interval, the production database system  informs the transaction log manager  accordingly. If no new updates to transaction log for this time interval are available, the transaction log manager  waits  for another interval of time. If the response from the production database system  indicates that updates to transaction logs are available, the transaction log manager  sends  the next request to the production database system  for retrieving the next update to the transaction logs.","The incremental changes to the transaction logs may be obtained by the transaction log manager  much more frequently compared to the point-in-time copy made by the point-in-time copy manager . For example, the point-in-time copy manager may make a point-in-time copy of a database stored in the production database system  once a day whereas the incremental changes to the transaction logs may be obtained by the transaction log manager  every five minutes. Obtaining incremental changes to the transaction logs at a high frequency provides the ability to recreate a copy of a database from the production database system  at a time point in between the times that a point-in-time copy is made by the point-in-time copy manager .","The production database system  may reuse the transaction log files in a circular fashion, thereby overwriting the previous log files. However, the database storage system  creates a new log file each time it determines to close the log file to which data is currently being written to start writing to a different log file.  compares the log files of the production database system  with the log files of the database storage system . The log files  for the production database system represent online transaction log files. A limited number of files are typically allotted for storing the online transaction logs. For example,  shows three files (), (), and () allotted by the production database system  for storing the online transaction logs.","As shown in , the arrows  indicate a change of the transaction log file to which the transaction logs are being written by the production database system  at a given time Ti (the times T, T, T, are assumed monotonically increasing). For example, at time T, the production database system  stopped writing the transaction logs to the file () and started writing the transaction logs to the file (). Similarly at time T, the production database system  stopped writing the transaction logs to the file () and started writing the transaction logs to the file (). At time T, the production database system  stopped writing the transaction logs to the file () and decided to reuse the transaction log file (). Before reusing a transaction log file, the production database system  ensures that the transaction logs available in the transaction log file are applied to the appropriate database. The log file changes at times T, T, T are similar to the changes described above. Hence, the production database system may typically reuse the transaction log files in a circular fashion to reuse storage.","The database storage system does not use a circular reuse strategy for log file data because the database storage system keeps the historical information for a much longer time determined by the log retention policy, based on the transaction logs. Keeping the historical information based on the transaction logs provides the ability to create VDBs for past time points. VDBs can be created for past time points as long as transaction logs necessary to reconstruct the database snapshot corresponding to the past time points are available. A strategy based on circular reuse of transaction log files results in earlier transaction logs being overwritten. Hence, a database system using circular reuse strategy for the log files can only reconstruct database snapshots based on the transaction logs for recent time points for which the transaction logs have not been overwritten.","The logs files  stored in the database storage system  are retained log files. The arrow  represents transfer of information from a transaction log file  of the production database system  to the retained log file  of the database storage system . Each arrow  may correspond to several requests  being sent from the transaction log manager  to the production database system  and several responses being sent  by the production database system  that are processed by the transaction log manager  and stored.","For example, arrow () indicates copy of information from log file () to () during the time interval T to T. At time T, the production database system started writing transaction logs to file (). The database storage system creates a new log file () and arrow () indicates the transfer of transaction log information from file () to log file (). The above process continues, but at time T, even though the production database system starts reusing the log file (), the database storage system creates a new log file (). Arrow () indicates copy of transaction log information to log file (). Accordingly, the transaction log information from the same transaction log file of the production database system  may be copied to multiple log files in the database storage system  at different times. For example, the information in transaction log file () is copied to log file () between T and T, to log file () between T and T, and to log file () between time T and T. The database storage system  avoids reuse of the log files to keep the transaction log information for as long as possible as determined by the log retention policy. This allows a user to recreate a snapshot of a database at a previous time point for which the transaction log information is available.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["390","110","390","1","2","110","850","1","860","2","850","860","850","1","110","850","1","850","1","850","1","850","1","850","1","860","2","850","850","850","310","850","850","850"],"i":["a","b","c","d","d","e","a","d","b","c","e"]},"The arrow  shown in  represents the step of creating the files representing a read\/write copy of a database based on the information  as performed by the virtual database manager . The arrows  represent the step of making the files  available to the virtual database system  via the file sharing system .  is a flowchart of the process for creating a virtual database. The virtual database manager  receives  a request to create a virtual database for a Virtual Database System . The request to create a VDB may be received from the administration system . The request to create a VDB may include details of the production database system  and the corresponding database that needs to be made available as a VDB, the virtual database system  for which the VDB needs to be created, and a past time point Tn for which the database snapshot needs to be created as a VDB.","The virtual database manager  identifies  the recent most PIT copy associated with time Tj, such that Tj<Tn. The virtual database manager  further identifies  a portion of the log file updates for the time period from Tj to Tn. The read\/write file structure  is created  by making storage efficient copies of the database blocks in the identified PIT copy and the appropriate portions of the log files. The appropriate transaction logs can be applied to a VDB created based on a PIT copy so as to create a snapshot of the source database for a time point that occurs after the PIT copy was made. Accordingly, even though a PIT copy may be made periodically, for example, daily, a VDB can be created for any time point in between PIT copies by appropriately applying the transaction logs to a previous PIT copy. For example, a PIT copy may have been made from a production database at midnight on a particular date. However a VDB can be created based on the state of the production database at a particular time later during the day, for example, 10:25 am, even though no PIT copy was made at that particular time. The changes in the production database from midnight to the particular time are obtained from the transaction logs.","The mechanism of making storage efficient copies of the file structure is further described herein. The virtual database manager  sends  (indicated by arrow  in ) handles to the read\/write file structure to the associated virtual database system . In some embodiments, the virtual database manager  makes the file structures available to the virtual database system  by sending a request to the file sharing manager . The file sharing manager  in response, shares the appropriate files with the virtual database system  using the file sharing system . The virtual database manager  also sends  a request to the virtual database system  to perform recovery  of the new virtual database by applying the appropriate retained logs to the database blocks.

Point-in-time copies of VDB are also made based on a predefined schedule. This allows a user to create a second virtual database VDB based on a point-in-time copy of VDB.

This can be considered a lazy mechanism for creating copies of the database blocks that copies a database blocks only if the corresponding virtual database system  writes to the database block. Since the number of blocks that a virtual database system  writes to may be a small fraction of the total number of blocks associated with the VDB, the above structure stores the data associated with the VDB in a highly storage efficient manner.

These steps may be executed by a database administrator of the database storage system  or executed automatically using a script. Various operations associated with a virtual database are described below.","The link operation provides information necessary to access a database on a production database system  to the system configuration manager  of the database storage system . The information necessary to access the database enables the database storage system  to retrieve data from the production database system . The information may include the name of the database, network address of the production database system  hosting the database, and access control information. As part of the linking operation, the database storage system may communicate with the production database system  to validate the information of the database. The database storage system  can retrieve database blocks from the linked database in the production database system  and store them in the storage system data store . The database blocks stored in the storage system data store  can be used to create virtual databases. In some embodiments, linking may specify that only a part of source database needs to be copied rather than the whole source database. For example, in relational databases a part of the source database could be a table space, a set of one or more tables, a subset of a table, or a set of subsets of tables. In an embodiment, a user can specify a script for computing a part of a database.","The load operation retrieves data from a database of the production database system  for storage in the database storage system . The database needs to be linked to the database storage system  before the database can be loaded. If the load operation is retrieving the data of the database for the first time, the entire data available in the database is retrieved. As a result, the first load operation can be slow and may take several hours or days depending on the size of the database and the network bandwidth based on state of the art hardware. Subsequent load operations may take significantly less time since they retrieve only changes in the database since a previous load operation. The load operation is performed periodically to obtain the changes to the database on an ongoing basis. The load operation may obtain database blocks of the database and\/or transaction logs representing updates to the database since a previous point in time. The input required for the load operation includes information identifying a previously linked database. If only a part of the source database is specified in linking, only that part will be loaded.","The load operation can also incrementally update information available in a VDB. The information obtained from the production database system  by a database storage system  may be updated periodically. As the information obtained from the production database system  available in the database storage system is updated, the information provisioned to the virtual database system  can also be updated. It is possible that the data in the VDB is updated by the virtual database system . In this case, the incremental load identifies the updates made by the virtual database system  and compares them with the changes retrieved from the production database system . If there are no conflicts in the two sets of updates, the load operation can succeed by applying the changes of the production database system  to the VDB. If there are conflicts, a report of the conflicts may be presented to a database administrator and input requested from the database administrator to help resolve the conflicts. In one embodiment, the conflicts between the updates from the two sources are detected by identifying the database blocks affected by the two updates. If there is no overlap between the database blocks of the two sets of updates, the database storage system  determines that there are no conflicts. If only part of source database is specified in linking, only changes to that part will be loaded.","The provision operation creates a virtual database in the database storage system  and makes it available to a virtual database system . The virtual database may be created based on a point-in-time copy of a source database or a point-in-time copy of another virtual database. One or more read\/write files may be created for the VDB and shared with the virtual database system  using the file sharing system . The read\/write files include structures that point to database blocks stored in the storage system data store . The input required for the provision operation includes information identifying a previously linked and loaded database or an existing VDB, a previous time point corresponding to the desired state of the database, and information identifying a virtual database system  for which the virtual database is being provisioned. In some embodiments, a part of a VDB could be provisioned. Similarly, parts from different VDBs may be provisioned together to form a new VDB. In other embodiments, several VDBs may be provisioned together as a group using application specific coordination scheme. These group oriented provisioning may involve provisioning or coordination of provisioning of application logic or configuration.","The bookmarking operation marks an application significant point in time in one or more virtual databases. The resulting \u201cbookmark\u201d can be used to direct provisioning operation. Typically, the operation is triggered by user or external program through administration system . Database storage system  returns a token as the resulted \u201cbookmark\u201d is stored in database storage system . Later, user or external programs can provision the VDB or the group of VDBs to the same application significant point in time using returned token. For example, an external program may wish to capture production database in certain state, such as right after a massive batch processing run. User could invoke bookmarking operation via administration system  and save returned token. Later, user can provision the VDB to the same state by supplying saved token. In some embodiments, tokens are in the form of string.","The refresh operation corresponds to the database storage system  periodically updating a VDB based on the latest information from the source database system . For example, a VDB may be used for a reporting system that generates report for users to view. The refresh operation automatically loads the latest information periodically from a production database system , for example, daily. The VDB being refreshed is shutdown. The VDB is updated with the latest point-in-time copy of the production database system  and the VDB restarted. Accordingly, the users of the corresponding virtual database system  see the latest reports based on the latest point-in-time copy of the data in the production database system . In an embodiment, the VDB may also be refreshed based on transaction logs obtained in between point-in-time copies obtained from production database system . The input required for a refresh operation includes information identifying a VDB to be refreshed and a schedule for refreshing the data.","The pre-script operation corresponds to execution of special purpose instructions that perform specific tasks before performing another database storage system  operation. For example, a pre-script operation may be performed before provisioning a VDB or a load of a database from the production database server . A database may be used along with applications that require application specific data stored outside the database. When the database is refreshed or loaded, a pre-script operation can be executed to load the application specific data to the database storage system . The input to the pre-script operation may include an executable script specifying the operations to be performed and details of the database storage system  operation before which the pre-script operation is performed.","The post-script operation corresponds to execution of special purpose instructions that perform specific tasks after performing database storage system  operation. For example, a post-script operation may be performed after provisioning a VDB to a virtual database system . Testing and development of an application using the database in the production database system , can be performed by running a similar application using a testing or development virtual database system . In this scenario, the application specific data copied from the production database server  by the pre-script operation may have to be further copied to the virtual database system  that runs a corresponding application. The instructions for copying the application specific data from the database storage system  to the virtual database system  are executed as a post-script operation after the provision operation. The input to the post-script operation includes an executable script specifying the operations to be performed and details of the database storage system  operation after which the post-script operation is performed.","The pre-script and post-script operations can be associated with various VDB operations. For example, pre-script operation can be performed before a refresh operation and a corresponding post-script operation performed after the refresh operation to allow copy\/installation of specific information before\/after the refresh operation. Similarly, pre-script\/post-script operations may be associated with other VDB operations including link, load, provision, and export among other operations. For example, during linking or loading data from a source database, pre-scripting\/post-scripting operations allow scrubbing of data by using compression, masking, or removing data including columns or rows of database tables. Pre-scripting and post-scripting allows dealing with application data associated with applications using the source database and\/or the VDB. Pre-scripting and post-scripting allows management of system environment issues associated with provisioning of VDBs and allows starting\/stopping activities before\/after a VDB is provisioned.","The share operation corresponds to granting permission to another user in order to allow the user to access a VDB. In an embodiment, the share operation may include the step of creating a new VDB and provisioning it for sharing with a new user or a set of users. For example, in a test and development environment, after reaching a particular stage of development using a VDB, the VDB may be shared with test users. The input required for a share operation may include information a VDB to be shared, information identifying users with whom the VDB is shared and access control information identifying the level of permissions granted to the users.","The export operation copies the information available in a database from one computer to another. Typically the information is copied to a target computer for assembly as a database. A stage operation corresponds to an export operation that copies the database information to a staging server. A staging server is typically used for performing system level testing of a database before using changes made to the database or to a database application in a production environment. The input to the export operation includes, information identifying the VDB to be exported and information identifying the target machine to which the data from the VDB needs to be exported.","The mask operation corresponds to altering or skipping specific information in a database when the information in the database is being copied. For example, when a copy of a database is made, sensitive information in the source may not be copied to the target. Another example is that data is scrambled when database is provisioned. Examples of sensitive information include credit card information or social security numbers. Example scenarios where database information is masked include making a copy of a production database for testing purposes. Users of the database that perform testing using a VDB may not need the sensitive information stored in the production database system . Other operations that can transform data being copied from a source database include compress and encrypt. The compress operation transforms the data by preserving the original information but the converting the format of the data so that it occupies less space when stored. The encrypt operation transforms the data to a format that cannot be read by applications that do not have the logic to decode the encrypted information. The inputs to the mask, compress, or encrypt operations include information identifying a source VDB and a target database. The target database may itself be a VDB or the data can be exported to a conventional system.","The purge operation deletes information not needed from a VDB. Typically information is purged when it occupies large amount of space and is not needed anymore. For example, a database may be storing event data associated with events occurring in a system over a long period of time. Old data that is not needed any more or data that has been archived can be purged from the database. The purge operation can be performed when the database information is copied by skipping the information to be purged from the copy operation. The inputs for a purge operation can include information identifying a source VDB and a target database. The target database can be a VDB or it can be a conventional database.","The extract, transform, and load (ETL) operations refers to typical operations performed in a data warehousing project. The extract step retrieves data from a source, the transform step modifies the data based on certain operational needs and the load operation loads the data to a target system. The input required by the ETL operations includes information identifying a source database, information identifying a target database, and operations to be performed for transformation of the data. The inputs for the ETL operation can include information identifying a source VDB and a target database. The target database can be a VDB or it can be a conventional database.","The replicate operation transfers changes from the data stored in a source storage system to a target storage system. The data being replicated can either be a VDB or the data stored in the storage system data store , corresponding to the database blocks obtained from one or more production database systems . The source and target storage systems need to be setup appropriately for the replicate operation. Program code for replication on the source storage system may periodically identify the changes in the data stored in the source storage system and send the changes to the target storage system. Similarly, program code on the target storage system may receive the changes form the source storage system and process them appropriately to incorporate the changes. Replication can be used for high-availability by mirroring the data from the source storage system to the target storage system. The target storage system is available for use in case the source storage system becomes unavailable for some reason. The inputs for the replicate operation may include information identifying a source system and a target system.","The backup operation creates a copy of the data available in a storage system such that the backup copy of the storage system can be used to reconstruct information of the original storage system in case the original data is lost. The restore operation recovers the information available in the backup copy and reconstructs the information. Note that any changes in the original storage system since the backup was created may be lost, unless the update information is saved in some format. In some embodiments, the backup information is stored on large storage systems with possibly slow retrieval speed, for example, tape backup systems.","Other VDB operations based on the concepts defined herein can be defined and used for datacenter workflow automation. VDB operations can also be created by combining existing VDB operations. Different workflow scenarios that utilize the above operations based on VDBs or database storage systems  are described below.

The amount of data stored in the storage system data store  can be significantly less than the amount of data stored by the data store  of the backup system  since only changes made to the databases  are stored in the storage system data store . Hence the time required to link\/load the data in databases  to the storage system data store  combined with the time taken to backup  the data of storage system data store  can be significantly less than the time taken by the backup operations  in a large enterprise, especially when it comes to the load and time required from the source databases.","Maintaining Database Replicas","In several workflow scenarios, information in a source database is periodically copied to a target database. For example, information may be copied from a source database to a target database used for recovery of information in case the source database is destroyed in a disaster (the process known as disaster recovery). Information may also be copied to one or more databases to increase the availability of the data to users. For example, if the source database is down for maintenance or for other reasons, the target database can be made available to the users. In some usage scenarios, information is copied from a source database to a target database that is used for reporting purposes. The execution of reports on a production database system may cause significant load on a database. Since the production database system is used for transaction processing, it is preferred that a different server synchronized with the database on the production database system be used for generating reports. The target database is updated frequently to provide up-to-date reports using the reporting infrastructure. Another scenario that requires copy of information from a source database to a target database is the migration of databases from one machine to another. Migration of databases may be required when an enterprise upgrades software to newer versions, for example, upgrades to a newer version of operating system, a newer version of database management system, a newer version of an application, or upgrade to new hardware. Migration of databases may also be required from one physical location to another, for example, when a company is acquired by another company.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0121"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 19"],"b":["1905","1905","1950","1935","1905","1940","1910","1935","1940","1935","1950","1940"]},"Various parameters related to the copy  operation including the rate of transfer, frequency of transfer, type of information being transferred may depend on the specific scenario.

The instructions  (e.g., software) may be transmitted or received over a network  via the network interface device .","While machine-readable medium  is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium, the term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, or associated caches and servers) able to store instructions (e.g., instructions ).

Although individual operations of one or more methods are illustrated and described as separate operations, one or more of the individual operations may be performed concurrently, and nothing requires that the operations be performed in the order illustrated. Structures and functionality presented as separate components in example configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly, structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations, modifications, additions, and improvements fall within the scope of the subject matter herein.","Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components, modules, or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules (e.g., code embodied on a machine-readable medium or in a transmission signal) or hardware modules. A hardware module is tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system) or one or more hardware modules of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.","In various embodiments, a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.","Accordingly, the term \u201chardware module\u201d should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired), or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. As used herein, \u201chardware-implemented module\u201d refers to a hardware module. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware modules comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor, for example, to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.","Hardware modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware modules. Accordingly, the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connect the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example, one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).","The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise processor-implemented modules.","Similarly, the methods described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or processors or processor-implemented hardware modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the processor or processors may be located in a single location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment or as a server farm), while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.","The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a \u201ccloud computing\u201d environment or as a \u201csoftware as a service\u201d (SaaS). For example, at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers (as examples of machines including processors), these operations being accessible via a network (e.g., the Internet) and via one or more appropriate interfaces (e.g., application program interfaces (APIs).)","The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the one or more processors or processor-implemented modules may be located in a single geographic location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment, or a server farm). In other example embodiments, the one or more processors or processor-implemented modules may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.","Some portions of this specification are presented in terms of algorithms or symbolic representations of operations on data stored as bits or binary digital signals within a machine memory (e.g., a computer memory). These algorithms or symbolic representations are examples of techniques used by those of ordinary skill in the data processing arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. As used herein, an \u201calgorithm\u201d is a self-consistent sequence of operations or similar processing leading to a desired result. In this context, algorithms and operations involve physical manipulation of physical quantities. Typically, but not necessarily, such quantities may take the form of electrical, magnetic, or optical signals capable of being stored, accessed, transferred, combined, compared, or otherwise manipulated by a machine. It is convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals using words such as \u201cdata,\u201d \u201ccontent,\u201d \u201cbits,\u201d \u201cvalues,\u201d \u201celements,\u201d \u201csymbols,\u201d \u201ccharacters,\u201d \u201cterms,\u201d \u201cnumbers,\u201d \u201cnumerals,\u201d or the like.

The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.","Some embodiments may be described using the expression \u201ccoupled\u201d and \u201cconnected\u201d along with their derivatives. It should be understood that these terms are not intended as synonyms for each other. For example, some embodiments may be described using the term \u201cconnected\u201d to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact with each other. In another example, some embodiments may be described using the term \u201ccoupled\u201d to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact. The term \u201ccoupled,\u201d however, may also mean that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other, but yet still cooperate or interact with each other. The embodiments are not limited in this context.","As used herein, the terms \u201ccomprises,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincludes,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201chas,\u201d \u201chaving\u201d or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion. For example, a process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process, method, article, or apparatus. Further, unless expressly stated to the contrary, \u201cor\u201d refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example, a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following: A is true (or present) and B is false (or not present), A is false (or not present) and B is true (or present), and both A and B are true (or present).","In addition, use of the \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d are employed to describe elements and components of the embodiments herein.
