These applications reside on a UICC\/SIM card (Universal IC Card; IC: Integrated Circuit) and use certain functionalities of the mobile phone, where the UICC\/SIM card is usually plugged in or is otherwise coupled with. Further such details are particularly described in specification documents 3GPP TS 31.111, USIM Application Toolkit (Release 5); 3GPP TS 31.111, USIM Application Toolkit (Release 5); 3GPP TS 23.140, Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), Functional description, stage 2; 3GPP TS 31.102, Characteristics of the USIM Application (Release 5); and in W. Rankl, W. Effing, Smartcard Handbook, John Wiley & Sons, second edition, 2000.","Mobile communication services such as the 2nd generation (e.g., GSM) and the 3rd generation (e.g., UMTS) use well-defined smart cards in addition to telecommunication devices like mobile phones. Plugged into a telecommunication device like a mobile phone, these smart cards enable a user to use the mobile communication service he\/she has subscribed to. Moreover, user preferences and settings, as well as a user's personal information, can be stored on such smart cards. In GSM these cards are called SIM. In UMTS, one distinguishes between the physical card (the UICC) and its logical functionality (the USIM).","CAT\/SAT\/USAT (Card Application Toolkit\/SIM Application Toolkit\/USIM application Toolkit) is a toolkit which provides operators with an API (Application Programming Interface), which enables them to put their own, network operator-specific applications on a SIM or a UICC card taking into account the particularities of mobile phones, independent of the particular operator, smart card manufacturer and mobile phone manufacturer. For that purpose, CAT\/SAT\/USAT provides a standardized execution environment for applications stored on the SIM\/USIM\/UICC and the ability to utilize certain functions of the supporting mobile equipment, particularly a telecommunication device (below abbreviated by ME ); i.e., the mobile phone. CAT\/SAT\/USAT provides mechanisms, which allow applications, residing in the UICC\/JUSIM\/SIM, to interact and operate with any ME which supports the specified mechanism(s), thus ensuring interoperability between a UICC\/USIM\/SIM and an ME, independent of the respective manufacturers and operators. The UICC\/SIM card is the physical basis for this toolkit since UICC\/SIM are usually owned by the operator and can, thus, be adapted most easily to the operator's needs. Examples of such USAT mechanisms are the (U)SAT proactive commands (often also called proactive UICC commands) like DISPLAY TEXT, GET INPUT, PLAY TONE, RECEIVE DATA, SEND DATA, SEND SHORT MESSAGE, SET UP CALL, etc, of which applications residing on the USIM\/UICC can make use of. Since only the mobile equipment can act as the master in the communication between the ME (mobile equipment) and the UICC\/SIM , the proactive (U)SAT commands are defined to create a way for the UICC\/SIM to indicate, that the UICC\/SIM wants to send a command to the ME. That is, the UICC uses the proactive (U)SAT commands to issue instructions to the ME. The ME knows what action it has to take when it receives this kind of instruction.","Nowadays, in mobile networks like GSM, SMS (Short Message Service) is used to send and receive short messages between mobile terminals. Currently, a new messaging service, the so-called MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service), is being standardized. Contrary to SMS, MMS messages may contain multimedia elements such as for example, text, still image, audio or video. MMS is a peer-to-peer messaging service between two MMS User Agents (or between an MMS User Agent and a 3rd Party Value-Added Service Provider, VASP), which are both connected to an MMS Relay\/Server. The MMS User Agent resides either on a mobile phone (e.g., a UMTS-UE (UE abbreviation for User Equipment)) or a GSM-MS (MS abbreviation for Mobile Station), on an external device; for example, a notebook\/laptop, coupled or connected to a mobile phone, or even on a PC or other telecommunication devices not connected or not coupled to a mobile phone. It is an application layer function on the respective telecommunication equipment that provides the user with the ability to view, compose and handle the Multimedia Messages (below abbreviated by MMs), including submission and reception of MMs. A MMS Relay\/Server is a network entity responsible for the storage and handling of incoming and outgoing messages and for the transfer of the message between different messaging systems.","To summarize, the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is a new messaging service, with which messages with multimedia elements of different types (e.g. still image, audio, video) and different formats (with respect to still image: e.g., JPEG or GIF) can be exchanged between (especially mobile) terminals via network components or directly with each other.","It is an object of the present invention to bring about a method for controlling a multimedia messaging service between a telecommunication device and a telecommunication network in a simple and efficient way for a network operator.","This objective is accomplished by a method for controlling a multimedia messaging service between at least one smart card, a telecommunication device and a telecommunication network, wherein the commands and\/or the data transfer of each multimedia message to and from the telecommunication device are controlled by the smart card being coupled with the telecommunication device.","Thus, a network operator is enabled to control the handling, (e.g., composing, changing, erasing, or any other kind of manipulating), of the respective multimedia message, one or several parts of it, or references to at least one part or all of it in a efficient and simple way.","Further, the present invention relates to a smart card for controlling a multimedia messaging service between a telecommunication device and a telecommunication network, wherein the transport commands and\/or the data transfer of each multimedia message to and from the telecommunication device are controlled by the smart card being coupled with the telecommunication device, particularly wherein the controlling is performed according to the inventive method.","The present invention also relates to a telecommunication device being coupled with such a smart card.","Additional features and advantages of the present invention are described in, and will be apparent from, the following Detailed Description of the Invention and the Figures.","Like reference signs refer to corresponding parts and elements throughout . There, inventive transport commands for controlling a multimedia messaging service (below abbreviated by MMS) between a telecommunication device and a telecommunication network by a smart card and data transfers associated with these commands are indicated by bold frames.","According to a first embodiment of the present invention, the following examples for the usage of MMS as bearer service for (U)SAT is discussed. In , the UICC (or SIM card) contains a (U)SAT application and resides on a smart card SC. The (U)SAT application is activated. In addition, the terminal ME (where the UICC\/SIM card is plugged in) runs an MMS User Agent; i.e., MMS functionality is residing on the terminal.","Operator X provides the subscribed users with an USAT application, which allows the user to receive the weather forecast as multimedia content by using MMS. This can be, for example, multimedia presentation of the weather forecast with text, still images, audio, video, etc. Typically, such an application is pre-installed on the smart card SC at the time of issuing the card. An example of this is shown in .","User Y wants to know what kind of weather it will be tomorrow in Germany, especially in Berlin, the city the user lives in, for example. Thus, user Y starts the weather application on his\/her telecommunication device ME, particularly a mobile phone, and the weather application menu will be displayed on the telecommunication device's display by command DM (indicated by sequence number  in ). Thereafter, user Y selects the weather forecast for Berlin, Germany from the menu of the USAT weather forecast application on his\/her mobile phone by command US (indicated by sequence number  in ). USAT will send the proactive UICC command SEND MM to the ME by command SM (indicated by sequence number  in ). This message consists of the information, which the ME needs to send an MM to the USAT server for the weather forecast of Berlin, Germany; e.g., headers, attachments, link to attachments, address of the USAT application server, etc. With the information included in this SEND MM command the MMS UA composes an MM and sends it to the MMS Relay\/Server RS by command MS (indicated by sequence number  in ). The MMS Relay\/Server RS forwards this Multimedia Message (abbreviated by MM) to the USAT server (or VAS server (VAS=value added server)) US by command GI (indicated by sequence number  in ). The MMS Relay\/Server RS and the USAT server US are components of the telecommunication network NET, which is indicated by a dashed line in . The USAT server reads the MM and sees that the user requests the weather forecast of Berlin, Germany. The USAT server collects the latest weather forecast information of Berlin and composes an MM containing a multimedia weather forecast presentation with text, still images audio, video about the weather forecast of Berlin and sends it to the MMS Relay\/Server by command IN (indicated by sequence number  in ). The MMS Relay\/Server sends a notification to the MMS UA by command MN (indicated by sequence number  in ). The user is notified about the new MM including the weather forecast. The user can request MM retrieval now by command GM (indicated by sequence number  in ) and the MM retrieval procedure will be started now by command MR (indicated by sequence number  in ). After the MM retrieval, the user can watch the weather forecast of Berlin on his\/her mobile phone.","A more detailed description of the proactive UICC command \u201cSEND MM\u201d is described below with reference to :","In the communication between the ME and the UICC\/SIM, only the ME can act as the master, with the UICC\/SIM acting as a slave. However, the UICC\/SIM advantageously has the possibility to indicate that a command has to be fetched (transfer an Application Toolkit command from the SIM to the ME) by the ME. This is accomplished as follows. The UICC\/SIM responds to every communication with the mobile phone with a status word, indicating the successful or unsuccessful outcome of the communication. With a special status word (\u201c91 XX\u201d) the UICC\/SIM indicates that the UICC\/SIM wants to send a proactive (U)SAT command, whereupon the ME fetches the data. These commands are also called proactive UICC commands and are (U)SAT commands.","In this example, accordingly, after the user has selected the \u201cweather forecast of Berlin, Germany\u201d item from his\/her menu, the UICC\/SIM answers with the status word \u201c91 XX\u201d indicating that a (U)SAT command is waiting. The ME fetches the data with the SEND MM command (see ). The ME executes the predefined action upon reception of the SEND MM command; namely, the ME composes an MM, based on the information in the SEND MM command, and sends the MM to the addressee indicated in the SEND MM command, in this case the USAT server.","With the SEND MM command, the UICC requests from the ME to compose an MM and submit it to the network based on the information conveyed with the command. The SEND MM command consists of all the information which the MMS User Agent needs to compose and submit an MM as requested. The information preferably provided in the SEND MM command (denoted by reference sign SM in ) is shown in Table 1 attached below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Command parameters of the proactive"},{"entry":"UICC \u201cSEND MM\u201d command"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Command",{}]},{"entry":["parameter","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Command","The command details conveyed in the \u201cSEND MM\u201d"]},{"entry":["details","command contain information to the user command"]},{"entry":[{},"(in this case the \u201cSEND MM\u201d command)."]},{"entry":[{},"It consists of, for example:"]},{"entry":[{},"A command number, which identifies the command"]},{"entry":[{},"in case of multiple ongoing commands.

This is shown in . The functionality of the commands with the sequence numbers \u2013 in  is the same as described above for . The MM will be retrieved by the ME according to the well-known MMS behavior; e.g., with immediate retrieval (commands MN, GM, MR with sequence numbers \u2013 in ). According to this embodiment of the present invention, this MM may contain a respective information element, called \u201cMMS bearer\u201d. This \u201cMMS bearer\u201d information element may, for example, be a flag, which can be set to (1), which refers to the MMS being used as bearer service, or not set to (0), which refers to the MMS not being used as bearer service. This \u201cMMS bearer\u201d information element can be part of any MMS message which terminates at the telecommunication device, particularly terminal ME; e.g., MMs, MMS notifications, MMS delivery reports or MMS read-reply reports. In this example, MMS is used as bearer service for USAT, wherein the \u201cMMS bearer\u201d information element in the MM received by the MMS User Agent is set to (1). The MMS User Agent on the terminal ME checks the \u201cMMS bearer\u201d information element and sees that MMS is used as bearer (flag is set to (1)). The MMS User Agent will send the MM with the ENVELOPE (DOWNLOAD MM) command DO to USAT (command DO indicated by sequence number  in ) on the smart card SC, without displaying the MM to the user or alerting the user. With that the data conveyed in the MMS message (or parts of it) are transferred from the terminal ME to the smart card SC.","Optionally, the UICC may additionally send the proactive UICC command \u201cDISPLAY MM\u201d to the ME. With the information in this MM (in this case, the weather information of Berlin), the ME displays the weather forecast of Berlin on the display.","The first advantageous USAT mechanism in this example is the ENVELOPE (DOWNLOAD MM) command DO, which is used to download the MM from the ME to the UICC (see , command DO indicated by sequence number ).","This ENVELOPE (DOWNLOAD MM) command DO preferably contains the following information according to Table 2:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Command parameters of the ENVELOPE"},{"entry":"(DOWNLOAD MM) command."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Command",{}]},{"entry":["parameter","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Command","The command details conveyed in the \u201cENVELOPE"]},{"entry":["details","(DOWNLOAD MM)\u201d (copy and paste error)"]},{"entry":[{},"command contain information to the user command"]},{"entry":[{},"(in this case, the \u201cENVELOPE (DOWNLOAD MM)\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"command)."]},{"entry":[{},"See Table 1: command details for comments"]},{"entry":[{},"It consists of, for example:"]},{"entry":[{},"A command number, which identifies the command"]},{"entry":[{},"in case of multiple ongoing commands.

The functionality of the commands with sequence numbers \u2013 in  is the same as described above for the signalling in . The MMS User Agent, residing on the ME, receives an MMS notification by command MN (indicated by sequence number  in ). This MMS notification contains the \u201cMMS bearer\u201d information element (see, also, example 1b), which is set (1); i.e., MMS is used as bearer service. The MMS User Agent on the ME checks the \u201cMMS bearer\u201d information element in the MMS notification and sees that MMS is used as bearer service. Based on information in the MMS notification or based on information on the ME, the MMS User Agent decides if the MMS notification will be downloaded to the UICC\/USAT or if the UICC\/USAT only will be informed that a new MMS notification has arrived. In this example, the MMS User Agent will pass the MMS notification directly to the UICC\/USAT by command DON (indicated by sequence number  in ); i.e., the MMS notification is downloaded from the ME to the UICC\/USAT. USAT checks the notification to determine if the MM has to be downloaded (positive check, by USAT) or rejected (negative check of USAT). After a positive check USAT will initiate the ME (MMS UA) to download the MM by sending the proactive UICC command GET MM to the ME (command GOK in  indicated by sequence number ). Now the ME can start the downloading procedure by sending a Get MM message (command GM indicated by sequence number  in ) to the MMS Relay\/Server RS and the MMS Relay\/Server sends the MM to the ME (command MR indicated by sequence number  in ). The ME starts the download MM\/envelope procedures with the Download MM command (command DO indicated by sequence number  in ) for downloading the MM. When these procedures are finished, the UICC sends the proactive UICC command DISPLAY MM to the ME (command DI indicated by sequence number  in ) and the ME will display the video of the weather forecast of Berlin, Germany.","The ENVELOPE (DOWNLOAD MMS NOTIFICATION) command DON is the first advantageous command in this example.

User Y then selects movie A of the list of movies (command US indicated by sequence number  in ). USAT will send the proactive UICC command SEND MM to ME (command SM indicated by sequence number  in ). This message contains the information, which the ME needs to send the MM to the USAT server US for a preview of movie A. With the information included in the SEND MM command, the MMS UA, residing on the ME, composes an MM and sends it to the MMS Relay\/Server RS by command MS (indicated by sequence number  in ). The MMS Relay\/Server RS forwards the MM to the USAT server (or VAS server) US by command GI (indicated by sequence number  in ). The USAT server US reads the MM and detects that the user requests a preview of movie A. The USAT server composes an MM and includes an attachment with the preview of the movie to the MM and sends it to the MMS Relay\/Server by command IN (indicated by sequence number  in ). The MMS Relay\/Server RS sends a notification to the ME by command MN (indicated by sequence number  in ). Based on information in the MMS notification or based on information stored in the ME, the ME decides if the MMS notification will be downloaded to the UICC\/USAT or if the UICC\/USAT only will be informed that a new MMS notification has arrived. In this example, the ME decides to send a UICC MM NOTIFICATION to the UICC by command UMN (indicated by sequence number  in ) to inform the UICC that an MM arrived at the ME. Based on the content of this command (e.g., types of attachment, sizes, headers, etc.) USAT decides which content has to be downloaded and then sends the command GET MM ATTACHMENT REQUEST (command GAR indicated by sequence number  in ) to the ME to request that the needed MM attachment will be downloaded. In this example, the attachment \u201cpreview of movie A\u201d is requested to be downloaded. The ME will download the attachment by sending the ENVELOPE (DOWNLOAD MMS ATTACHMENT) command (command DOA indicated by sequence number  in ).

It also gives an operator the opportunity to use multimedia content from a (U)SAT application, which until now has been limited to text and icons. For the use of Multimedia Messaging Service as a transport mechanism for (U)SAT, there preferably are provided those above-described SAT\/USAT commands\/mechanisms. Thus, a functionality (e.g. CAT\/SAT\/USAT commands\/mechanisms) is now available for an operator to use the non-realtime MMS for transporting data to and from a smart card in a mobile device (i.e., to handle MMS or MMS content), when MMS is used as bearer service for CAT\/SAT\/USAT.","In sum, a functionality for an operator is accomplished to use the non-realtime MMS for transporting data to and from a smart card in a telecommunication device, particularly a mobile device, and the inventive display of multimedia data is elaborated in detail. For such purpose, new commands\/mechanisms between a smart card and the telecommunication device are generated, which enable an (operator-defined) application running on the smart card (which is plugged into the mobile device) to request the mobile device to execute MMS-specific functionality (which runs on the mobile device). As such, for example, (U)SAT is allowed to handle MMS as bearer service.","It is an advantage of the proposed (U)SAT mechanisms and commands that the usage of these (U)SAT mechanisms and commands is independent of the particular mobile equipment (i.e., mobile phone) that the user uses at a certain point of time. The (U)SAT functionality is processed on the SIM or the USIM on the UICC, which can be plugged into telecommunication equipment (particularly mobile) or an apparatus connected or coupled with a terminal.","Moreover, the above described (U)SAT mechanisms and commands are advantageously independent of the particular operator or UICC\/SIM card manufacturer. As such, third-party application developers can create applications based on these (U)SAT mechanisms which are platform-independent and can sell these applications to any operator and\/or any UICC\/SIM card manufacturer. These applications can make use of the inventively proposed (U)SAT mechanisms and commands.
