{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2008-0033602, filed on Apr. 11, 2008, which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a recording\/playing device, a server for managing content location information, an information recording medium, and a method for managing content information, and more particularly, to a recording\/playing device for receiving contents, recording the contents on a recording medium, and playing the contents from the recording medium, a server for managing content location information, an information recording medium, and a method for managing content information.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","Broadcasting waves from a broadcasting station includes a variety of contents including audio, video, application programs, etc. Data broadcasting standards have been developed and are under deployment to receive such broadcast waves and implement application programs in synchronization with audio and video. These data broadcasting standards allow for implementation of various additional functions when transmitted application programs are received, loaded to a terminal, and executed, rather than simply output audio and video.","For example, a Set-Top Box (STB) is a terminal supporting the data broadcasting standards. For the STB, a Java virtual machine is ported to a device driver and Java-based data broadcasting middleware is implemented to support a standard Application Programming Interface (API) using the Java virtual machine. The Java API provided by the data broadcasting middleware of the STB facilitates a Multiple System Operator (MSO) to create an application program that services a Digital Video Recorder (DVR), an Electronic Program Guide (EPG), or the like. When the application program is delivered in broadcasting streams, it is implemented on the data broadcasting middleware of the STB.","Among the data broadcasting standards, Globally Executable Multimedia home platform (GEM) is a standard describing the most common contents, and Open Cable Application Platform (OCAP) is an extension of the GEM standard for a cable broadcasting environment, usually laid out in North America. These two standards have their respective extensions for supporting DVR, called \u2018DVB; Digital Recoding Extension to GEM\u2019 and \u2018OCAP Extension: OCAP Digital Video Recorder\u2019.","DVR is a function that allows for recording and play-back of a current broadcasting program or rewind or pause of a live broadcasting program. The implementation of the DVR function requires the middleware of the STB to support the DVR extension API of each standard and also requires MSOs to provide DVR API-based applications.","In addition, to use the DVR function, a broadcasting receiver should be equipped with a recording medium, for example, a Hard Disk Drive (HDD). The broadcasting receiver may then record or play received broadcast contents on or from the HDD and may provide time shift, instant replay, various trick plays, etc. The time shift is also referred to as a time machine.","However, the use of an expensive HDD in a broadcasting receiver may increase the manufacture cost of the broadcasting receiver. Due to a limited interior space of the broadcasting receiver product, there may be insufficient room for installing the HDD within the broadcasting receiver. Moreover, the HDD may be an obstacle to making the broadcasting receiver slim.","Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a device for recording and playing contents, a sever for managing content location information, an information recording medium, a method for managing content information, and a recording medium for the method that substantially obviate one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.","An object of the present invention is to provide a recording\/playing device for recording contents on recording media distributed across a network and sharing contents recorded on the recording media, an information recording medium, a server for managing content location information, and a method for managing content location information.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a recording\/playing device for acquiring information about contents recorded on recording media distributed across a network, searching the acquired information for information about user-requested contents, and providing the requested contents to the user, an information recording medium, a server for managing content location information, and a method for managing content location information.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a recording\/playing device for readily acquiring information about contents recorded on recording media distributed across a network so as to maintain the latest information about the contents, an information recording medium, a server for managing content location information, and a method for managing content location information.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a recording\/playing device for, when only part of entire contents are recorded on each of recording media distributed across a network, searching for the recorded part in each recording medium, receiving the content parts from the recording media, combining the received contents into the entire contents, and playing the entire contents, an information recording medium, a server for managing content location information, and a method for managing content location information.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a recording\/playing device for efficiently performing a time shift based on contents recorded on recording media distributed across a network, an information recording medium, a server for managing content location information, and a method for managing content location information.","A further object of the present invention is to provide a computer-readable recording medium having a program for executing a content information management method in a computer recorded therein.","Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.","To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a recording\/playing device includes a communication interface unit configured to interface data transmission and reception with at least one external resource connected to a network and a controller configured to receive a request for a content, search for an external resource recording the requested content based on content identification information and control receiving the content from the searched external resource.","In another aspect of the present invention, a content locater management server includes a communication interface unit configured to interface data transmission and reception with at least one recording\/playing device connected to a network, a storage configured to store a content list including location information about the recording\/playing device and content information being information about contents recorded at the recording\/playing device and a controller configured to update the content list upon receipt of the location information or the content information from the recording\/playing devices, and search the content list for a recording\/playing device recording requested content, upon receipt of a content search request from the recording\/playing device.","In another aspect of the present invention, a recording medium includes a first region configured to store location information about an external resource, and a second region configured to store content information in conjunction with the location information, the content information being information about contents recorded by the external resource.","In a further aspect of the present invention, a method for managing content information includes transmitting a message indicating an active state, when the active state is set, transmitting location information that provides access information, upon receipt of a request for the location information in response to the transmitted message, and transmitting content information including content information about recorded contents, upon receipt of a request for the content information in response to the transmitted location information.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description of the present invention are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.","Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

That is, upon selection of display, the external high-quality contents are simply provided to the DEMUX  without downconversion of the resolution of the contents, and upon selection of recording, they are provided to the recording\/playing controller  after downconversion of their resolution. The downconversion may be performed in many ways and the resolution of the downconverted contents may vary with the downconversion method used. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, downconversion to a CCIR656 format of 480i (i denotes interlaced scanning) is performed. If the contents received from the external device are analog, the format converter  digitizes them and outputs the digital contents to the DEMUX  or the recording\/playing controller .","The demodulator  demodulates the contents received from the receiver  and provides the demodulated contents in the form of a Transport Stream (TS) to the DEMUX .","The DEMUX  demultiplexes the contents received from the demodulator  or the format converter  into an audio Element Stream (ES) and a video ES and outputs the audio ES and the video ES respectively to an audio decoder and a video decoder of the decoder . If a plurality of broadcasting programs are multiplexed into a single channel, the DEMUX  chooses only broadcast contents of a user-selected program, demultiplexes the broadcast contents into an audio ES and a video ES, and provides the audio and video ESs to the decoder . If the demodulated contents include a data stream and a system information stream, the DEMUX  also demultiplexes the contents into the data stream and the system information stream and provides the streams to corresponding blocks, which is not a feature of the present invention and thus will not be described herein in detail.","Upon selection of recording, the DEMUX  simply outputs the contents received from the demodulator  or the format converter  to the recording\/playing controller , or demultiplexes the received contents into an audio ES and a video ES and provides the audio and video ESs to the recording\/playing controller . If a plurality of broadcasting programs are multiplexed into a single channel, the DEMUX  chooses only broadcast contents of a user-selected program to be recorded and provides them to the recording\/playing controller . An exemplary embodiment of the present invention is implemented, in which each channel delivers one broadcasting program.","The decoder , which includes the audio and video decoders, decodes the audio and video ESs received from the demultiplexer  by their respective decoding algorithms. The display unit  converts the decoded audio data received from the decoder  to analog audio data and outputs them through a speaker, and converts the decoded video data received from the decoder  to a display format and displays the converted video data on a screen. Upon receipt of OSD data from the OSD processor , the display unit  mixes the video data with the OSD data and outputs the mixed data on the screen.","Transmission\/reception of contents and control signals between the communication interface unit  and the external resource  may be carried out in an Ethernet manner. For the Ethernet-based transmission\/reception, the communication interface unit  has a LAN card that operates with Ethernet in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The LAN card is at least one of a wired LAN card and a wireless LAN card, or it is a wired-wireless integrated LAN card.","In the case where the communication interface unit  is connected to the external resource  wiredly (i.e. by an Ethernet cable), upon selection of recording, the communication interface unit  transmits contents to be recorded, received from the recording\/playing controller  to the external resource  in a wired Ethernet manner, so that the external resource  records the contents.","In the case where the communication interface unit  is connected to the external resource  wirelessly, upon selection of recording, the communication interface unit  transmits contents to be recorded, received from the recording\/playing controller  to the external resource  in a wireless Ethernet manner, so that the external resource  records the contents.","Herein, data may be transmitted on an Ethernet MAC frame basis between the communication interface unit  and the external resource . In this case, the communication interface unit  and the external resource  each may include an Ethernet MAC frame parser (not shown) for parsing only the contents of a data region.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"Referring to , the communication interface unit  and the external resource  each may include an Ethernet MAC frame generator (not shown) for converting recorded or played contents to an Ethernet MAC frame.","The Ethernet MAC frame includes a 7\/1-byte preamble\/Start of Frame Delimiter (SFD), a 6-byte destination address, a 6-byte source address, a 2-byte data length, 45- to 1500-byte data, and a 4-byte checksum. The 7-byte preamble is used for synchronization between a source and a destination. The 1-byte SFD indicates the start of the Ethernet MAC frame. The 2-byte data length indicates the length of the following data. The 4-byte checksum is a 32-bit hash code for use in an error check of the frame.","According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when the DTV A  transmits recorded contents to the communication interface unit , the Ethernet frame has the address of the wireless LAN card of the DTV A  in the source address, the address of the recording\/playing device  in the destination address, and the recorded contents in the data.","In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, upon receipt of an Ethernet MAC frame having the configuration illustrated in  from the DTV A  through the communication interface unit , the recording\/playing device  parses only recorded contents included in the data region of the Ethernet MAC frame and plays the parsed recorded contents.","Meanwhile, DVR mode may be activated automatically or by user selection in the present invention. Alternatively, the DVR mode may be activated automatically or manually by user selection, depending on whether the DVR mode is on or off. When the DVR mode is activated, DVR functions such as time shifting may be performed. If the DVR mode is deactivated, the DVR functions are not performed. For example, if the DVR mode is deactivated, a function corresponding to a DVR menu item is not executed despite selection of the DVR menu item, and even though a DVR command is entered through the input device such as the remote controller , a function corresponding to the DVR command is not performed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIGS. 7 and 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"]},"In the illustrated case of , the submenus of Time shift mode, Recorded Quality, Recorded TV, Scheduled List, Manual Record, and HDD Format are displayed as the activated DVR menu items. The number, positions, sequence, and operations of the submenus included in the activated DVR menu are a merely exemplary application, to which the exemplary embodiments of the present are not limited because they may be readily modified by those skilled in the art.","The user may set automatic\/manual time shift mode by the Time Shift Mode submenu. When On is selected for the Time Shift Mode submenu, the automatic time shift mode is set, and when Off is selected for the Time Shift Mode submenu, the manual time shift mode is set.","Therefore, when upon power-on of the digital TV, the DVR mode is activated and the automatic time shift mode is set, the controller  requests time shifting of broadcast contents of a current received and demodulated channel to the recording\/playing controller .","If the DVR mode is activated but the manual time shift mode is set upon power-on of the digital TV, the controller  requests time shifting of broadcast contents of a current received and demodulated channel to the recording\/playing controller , only if the user selects the time shift function through the input device such as the remote controller  or by the menu. When an external interrupt signal is received during displaying received broadcast contents, the time shift mode may also be set automatically. For example, when an incoming call is received during displaying broadcast contents on the digital TV, the time shift mode may also be set automatically.","When upon power-on of the digital TV, the DVR mode is activated but the manual time shift mode is set, the user may be prompted to determine as to whether the time shifting is to be performed. For example, the OSD processor  may OSD-process a message prompting the user to make a decision as to whether to perform time shifting and display the OSD message on the display unit . During viewing broadcast contents, the user may select at any time whether to invoke the time shifting using the Time Shift Mode submenu, a predefined key for time shifting in the input device such as the remote controller , or the like.","Upon receipt of a time shift request from the controller , the recording\/playing controller  determines whether another digital TV is time-shifting broadcast contents of an intended channel using the recording medium of the DTV A . If only the recording\/playing device  is connected to the DTV A  or if a plurality of digital TVs are connected to the DTV A  but any other digital TV does not time-shift the broadcast contents of the channel using the recording medium of the DTV A , the recording\/playing controller  transmits the broadcast contents of the channel to the DTV A  through the communication interface unit , starting from a requested time of the time shift. The DTV A  then records the received broadcast contents in a time-shift recording region of its internal recording medium. Thereafter, the user of the recording\/playing device  may determine whether to play the previous video stored in the time-shift recording region by means of the input device such as the remoter controller . Upon user selection of a time to play the broadcast contents stored in the time-shift region of the recording medium of the DTV A , the recording\/playing controller  reads data of the broadcast contents, starting with data at the user-selected play time from the recording medium of the DTV A  through the communication interface unit . If the data of the broadcast contents received from the DTV A  have been encrypted, the recording\/playing controller  decrypts them and outputs the decrypted data to the DEMUX . Also, if the data of the broadcast contents have been encoded, the recording\/playing controller  decodes them and outputs the decoded data to the DEMUX .","According to the present invention, if the digital TV has simultaneous screen functions, it may display at least one on-going live broadcast content and a time-shifted content on one screen at the same time.","The simultaneous screen functions refer to displaying independent pictures in a main screen and at least one sub-screen that are split from the screen. The simultaneous screen functions include Picture in Picture (PIP), Picture Out Picture (POP), double windows (double pictures), etc. In PIP, one or more sub-screens are displayed within a main screen, whereas in POP, one or more sub-screens are displayed on the left (or the right) of a main screen. In the double windows function, the screen is split into left and right sub-screens and a main picture is displayed on the left sub-screen, while a sub-picture is displayed on the right sub-screen. The left and right sub-screens may be of the same size or different sizes.","For example, if the PIP function is selected and time shifting is on-going, current received live broadcast contents may be displayed on the main screen, while displaying broadcast contents read and played from the recording medium of the DTV A  on the sub-screen. Or the live broadcast contents may be displayed on the sub-screen, while displaying the played broadcast contents on the main screen. In another example, when time shifting is not performed, that is, already-recorded broadcast contents B are played simultaneously with recording broadcast contents A, if the PIP function is selected, the broadcast contents A may be displayed on the main screen, while displaying the broadcast contents B on the sub-screen. In addition, keys may be designated to invoke the PIP, POP, and double windows functions, respectively in the input device such as the remoter controller . Alternatively, a single key is designated for the PIP, POP, and double windows functions such that the PIP, POP, or double windows function may be selected according to the number of sequential pressings of the key. Also, the picture of the main screen may be exchanged with that of the sub-screen.","The recording medium of the DTV D  may be divided into a time-shift recording region and a semi-persistent recording region. Contents received at the DTV A  may be stored in the time-shift recording region or the semi-persistent recording region depending on the recording type of the contents. For instance, time shift-requested contents are stored in the time-shift recording region and contents for which instant recording or reserved recording is requested are stored in the semi-persistent recording region.","It may be said that the time-shift recording region is a temporary storage for storing a small amount of data. For example, if the time-shift recording region has the capacity of storing two hours of data, it is full after storing data for two hours. Then current received contents may be stored by deleting the data of the time-shift recording region in a first-input first-deleted fashion, or overwriting new data on the existing data in the time-shift recording region. Different time-shift recording regions may be allocated for digital TVs connected to the DTV A  or a single time-shift recording region may be allocated separately in an appropriate manner for the digital TVs.","Meanwhile, if the recording\/playing controller  detects that another digital TV is already time-shifting broadcast contents of an intended channel using the recording medium of the DTV A , upon receipt of a time shift request from the controller , it performs time shifting by sharing the broadcast contents of the intended channel under time shifting of another digital TV, without storing the broadcast contents. For example, if the digital TV  has already been time-shifting broadcast contents of a time shift-requested channel, the recording\/playing controller  of the recording\/playing device  does not transmit the broadcast contents of the time shift-requested channel to the DTV A . Rather, it shares the broadcast contents of the channel that is being time-shifted by the digital TV . That is, the recording\/playing controller  joins the broadcast contents that the digital TV  is storing in the recording medium of the DTV A . Since the recording\/playing device  is now capable of playing data preceding the time shift request, the user may view the contents already broadcast before the time shift request. Also, this obviates the need for storing the same data redundantly in the recording medium of the DTV A , thereby avoiding unnecessary waste of the recording medium.","Without the foregoing function, the recording\/playing device  transmits the broadcast contents of the time shift-requested channel to the DTV A , for recording in the recording medium, irrespective of whether another digital TV is time-shifting the broadcast contents. As a result, since a plurality of digital TVs store the same data in different regions of the recording medium of the DTV A , the recoding medium is unnecessarily consumed. Moreover, the recording\/playing device  cannot display data broadcast before the time of the time shift request. That is, since a typical time shift function allows for storage of only broadcast contents following the time of the time shift request within the capacity (or time) of the time-shift recording region of a predetermined recording medium, broadcast contents preceding the time shift-requested time cannot be displayed. To avert this problem, when a plurality of digital TVs are connected to the DTV A  and a time shift request is received from one of the digital TVs, it is determined whether another digital TV is time-shifting broadcast contents of an intended channel using the recording medium of the DTV A  in the present invention. If the broadcast contents of the intended channel are being time-shifted by another digital TV, the digital TV that has received the time shift request performs time shifting by sharing the broadcast contents being time-shifted, without storing the broadcast contents.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0110"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},"Referring to , upon receipt of a content request command, the recording\/playing controller  searches for the external resources , ,  and  having requested contents , based on content identification information about the contents .
