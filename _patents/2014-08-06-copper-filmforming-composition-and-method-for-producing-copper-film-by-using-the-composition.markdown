Described specifically, the composition is desired to be of a solution type which is free of a solid phase such as fine particles, to provide a copper film excellent in electrical conductivity, to be convertible to a copper film at a low temperature, to be good in coating properties, to be good in storage stability, and to be easy to control the thickness of a film to be obtained by a single application, especially to permit forming a thick film through a single application. However, no copper film-forming composition is known yet to fully satisfy all of these requirements.","Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a copper film-forming composition which fully satisfies all of the above-described requirements. A more specific object of the present invention is to provide a copper film-forming composition which is in the form of a solution free of a solid phase such as fine particles and can obtain a copper film of sufficient electrical conductivity when applied onto a substrate and heated at a relatively low temperature. Another more specific object of the present invention is to provide a copper film-forming composition which by similarly adjusting the concentration of copper in its components, can control the thickness of a film to be obtained through a single application and can conveniently perform the production of a copper film with a desired thickness.","As a result of a great deal of consideration with the above-described circumstances in view, the present inventors found that a copper film-forming composition, which contains copper formate or a hydrate thereof, copper acetate or a hydrate thereof, a diol compound having a specific structure and a piperidine compound having a specific structure in particular proportions, satisfies the above-described required performance, leading to the present invention.","Described specifically, the present invention provides a copper film-forming composition comprising, as essential components, 0.01 to 3.0 mol\/kg of copper formate or a hydrate thereof, 0.01 to 3.0 mol\/kg of copper acetate or a hydrate thereof, at least one diol compound selected from the group consisting of diol compounds represented by the below-described formula (1) and diol compounds represented by the below-described formula (1\u2032), a piperidine compound represented by the below-described formula (2), and an organic solvent with the copper formate or the hydrate thereof, the copper acetate or the hydrate thereof, the at least one diol compound and the piperidine compound dissolved therein,","wherein, when a content of the copper formate or the hydrate thereof is assumed to be 1 mol\/kg, the diol compound is contained in a range of 0.1 to 6.0 mol\/kg and the piperidine compound is contained in a range of 0.1 to 6.0 mol\/kg:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0021"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"51.90mm","wi":"58.25mm","file":"US09028599-20150512-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1 ","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0022"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"15.24mm","wi":"52.92mm","file":"US09028599-20150512-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"The present invention also provides a process for producing a copper film, comprising the following steps: applying, onto a substrate, the above-described copper film-forming composition, and then heating the substrate at 100 to 400\u00b0 C. to form a copper film.","According to the present invention, a copper film-forming composition is provided, which is in the form of a solution free of a solid phase such as fine particles and can obtain a copper film of sufficient electrical conductivity when applied onto a substrate and heated at a relatively low temperature. By suitably adjusting the concentrations of the copper formate or the hydrate thereof and the copper acetate or the hydrate thereof, the copper film-forming composition according to the present invention can control the thickness of a film to be obtained through a single application, and therefore, can produce a copper film with a desired thickness.","One of characteristic features of the copper film-forming composition according to the present invention resides in the use of copper formate as a precursor for a copper film. Copper formate for use in the present invention may be a non-hydrate or may be hydrated. Specifically, anhydrous copper(II) formate, copper(II) formate dihydrate, copper(II) formate tetrahydrate, and the like can be used. Such copper formate may be mixed as it is, or may be mixed as an aqueous solution, a solution in an organic solvent, or a suspension in an organic solvent.","The content of copper formate in the copper film-forming composition according to the present invention may be adjusted as desired according to the thickness of a desired copper film. For example, the content of copper formate may be preferably 0.01 to 3.0 mol\/kg, more preferably 0.1 to 2.5 mol\/kg.","Here, it is to be noted that the term \u201cmol\/kg\u201d as used herein means \u201cthe physical quantity of a solute dissolved per kg of solution\u201d. For example, when copper formate and copper acetate are dissolved as much as 63.55 g in terms of copper in 1 kg of the copper film-forming composition according to the present invention, the copper concentration is considered to be 1.0 mol\/kg. When 153.58 g of copper formate is dissolved in 1 kg of the copper film-forming composition according to the present invention, the copper concentration is likewise considered to be 1.0 mol\/kg because the molecular weight of copper(II) formate is 153.58.","Another one of the characteristic features of the present invention resides in the use of copper acetate as a control agent for the concentration of copper in combination with copper formate described above. Copper acetate for use in the present invention may be a non-hydrate or may be hydrated. Specifically, anhydrous copper(II) acetate, copper(II) acetate monohydrate, and the like can be used. Like copper formate, such copper acetate may be mixed as it is, or may be mixed as an aqueous solution, a solution in an organic solvent, or a suspension in an organic solvent. According to a study by the present inventors, the formulation of a copper film-forming composition by making combined use of copper formate in addition to copper acetate can provide the resulting copper film with improved electrical properties. When copper(II) acetate monohydrate (molecular weight: 199.65) is used, for example, its inclusion at 1.0 mol\/kg means that 199.65 g of copper(II) acetate monohydrate is contained in 1 kg of the copper film-forming composition according to the present invention as described above.","According to another study by the present inventors, the combined use of copper acetate in addition to copper acetate can obtain a copper film-forming composition of a lower viscosity compared with the preparation of a copper film-forming composition of the same copper concentration from copper formate alone. When a copper film-forming composition is used as a coating formulation in a coating method represented by inkjet coating or spin coating, a higher viscosity may generally lead to deteriorations in coating properties. In contrast to this, the copper film-forming composition according to the present invention can remain low in viscosity and can maintain coating properties even when its copper concentration is high.","As copper acetate has very high solubility in the copper film-forming composition, the concentration of copper in the copper film-forming composition can be made high compared with the control of the concentration of copper with copper formate alone in the copper film-forming composition. The concentration of copper in the copper film-forming composition gives a significant effect on the thickness of a copper film to be formed by a coating method. In contrast to this, the copper film-forming composition according to the present invention has high stability and high coating properties even when the concentration of copper is high, and therefore, is also excellent in the controllability of the thickness of a copper film to be obtained from the composition. When a copper film is produced, for example, with the copper film-forming composition according to the present invention by such a coating method as described above, the copper film can be formed as a smooth, electrically conductive film having an appropriate thickness in a wide range of several tens to 1,000 nm by a single application.","The content of copper acetate in the copper film-forming composition according to the present invention may be adjusted as desired according to the thickness of a desired copper film. The content of copper acetate may be preferably in a range of 0.01 to 3.0 mol\/kg, with 0.1 to 2.5 mol\/kg being more preferred.","No particular limitation is imposed on the concentration ratio of copper formate to copper acetate in the copper film-forming composition according to the present invention. Preferably however, the composition may be prepared such that 40% or more of the whole copper concentration in the composition is attributable to the addition of copper formate. Further, a substantially equal (1:1) concentration ratio of copper formate to copper acetate can obtain a film of excellent electrical characteristics, and therefore, is particularly preferred.","The dial compound, which is represented by the below-described formula (1) or (1\u2032) and is a component that makes up the copper film-forming composition according to the present invention, is characterized by having one or more amino groups. According to a further study by the present inventors, the diol compound exhibits effectiveness as a solubilizer for copper formate or a copper formate hydrate, provides the copper film-forming composition with storage stability, and further, is effective in providing improved electrical conductivity when converted to a film.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0034"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"51.90mm","wi":"58.25mm","file":"US09028599-20150512-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In the formula (1), X denotes a hydrogen atom, methyl group, ethyl group or 3-aminopropyl group.

When producing a copper film, for example, by a coating method, the organic solvent may be used preferably in a range of 0.01 parts by mass to 5,000 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the sum of the masses of copper formate (in terms of copper formate even in the case of a copper formate hydrate; this will apply equally hereinafter) and copper acetate (in terms of copper acetate even in the case of a copper acetate hydrate; this will apply equally hereinafter). If the content of the organic solvent is lower than 0.01 parts by mass, such an excessively low content of the organic solvent may lead to an inconvenience such that cracks occur in the resulting film or the coating properties are deteriorated, and therefore, is not preferred. As the proportion of the organic solvent increases, the resulting film becomes thinner. From the aspect of productivity, it is hence preferred not to exceed 5,000 parts by mass. Described more specifically, when producing a copper film by spin coating, it is preferred to use the organic solvent in a range of 20 parts by mass to 1,000 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the sum of the masses of copper formate and copper acetate. When producing a copper film by screen printing, on the other hand, it is preferred to use the organic solvent in a range of 0.01 parts by mass to 20 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the sum of the masses of copper formate and copper acetate.","The copper film-forming composition according to the present invention contains, as essential components, copper formate or a hydrate thereof, copper acetate or a hydrate thereof, the specific diol compound, the specific piperidine compound and the organic solvent as described above, and may additionally contain one or more optional components to such extents as not to impair the advantageous effects of the pre sent invention.

When these optional components are used, their total content may be preferably 10 mass % or lower, more preferably 5 mass % or lower.","A description will next be made about the process of the present invention for the production of a copper film.","The process of the present invention for the production of a copper film comprises an application step that the above-described copper film-forming composition according to the present invention is applied onto a substrate, and a film-forming step that the substrate is then heated at 100 to 400\u00b0 C. to form a copper film. If needed, it is possible to add, before the film-forming step, a drying step that the substrate is held at 50 to 200\u00b0 C. to evaporate low-boiling components such as the organic solvent, and after the film-forming step, an annealing step that the substrate is held at 200 to 500\u00b0 C. to provide the resulting copper film with improved electrical conductivity.","Coating methods usable in the above-described application step may include spin coating, dip coating, spray coating, mist coating, flow coating, curtain coating, roll coating, knife coating, bar coating, slit coating, screen printing, gravure printing, offset printing, inkjet coating, brush coating, and the like.","Further, the application step to desired one of the remaining steps may be repeated a plurality of times to obtain a needed thickness. For example, the entire steps of from the application step to the film-forming step may be repeated a plurality of times, or the application step and drying step may be repeated a plurality of times.","Atmospheres for the above-described drying step, film-forming step and annealing step may each be either a reducing gas or an inert gas in general. Under the presence of a reducing gas, a copper film of superior electrical conductivity can be obtained. As the reducing gas, hydrogen can be mentioned, and as the inert gas, helium, nitrogen or argon can be mentioned. The inert gas may also be used as a diluent gas for the reducing gas. In each step, energy other than heat\u2014such as plasma light, laser light, light from discharge lamps such as xenon lamps, mercury lamps, mercury xenon lamps, xenon flash lamps, argon flash lamps or deuterium lamps, or one of various radiations\u2014may be applied or irradiated.","The present invention will hereinafter be described in further detail based on production examples and examples. It should, however, be borne in mind that the present invention is by no means limited by the following examples.","The compounds described in Table 1 were formulated to give the corresponding values (mol\/kg) in parentheses, whereby copper film-forming composition Nos. 1 to 12 were obtained as examples of the present invention.
