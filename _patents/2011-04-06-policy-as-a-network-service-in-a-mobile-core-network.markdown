{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The subject disclosure relates to wireless communications and, more particularly, to policy servers that operate as a policy service function within a deployable network architecture of a wireless communications network.","With the increasingly high demand for mobile broadband services, network operators are rushing to deploy large-scale networks. Such networks include Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks as well as other types of networks. The services that can be supported on the networks include both data (particularly video) and voice. These services need Quality of Services (QoS) and some services (such as voice) will need guaranteed bit rate bearers to deliver a positive customer experience. In addition, operators should be able to differentiate, control, and bill different types of traffic on the network.","Traditionally, policy management for telecommunication networks has focused mainly on network management. In recent years, however, as wireless networks have migrated toward Internet Protocol (IP)-based service environments, policy management has been gaining increasing importance to telecommunication networks that manage and control those services. Thus, policy management becomes an important component in the deployment.","Although policy management has been standardized in some networks, such as LTE networks, the deployment use cases and architecture are not covered in the standard and it is up to each operator to decide how to deploy the network based on its services and use cases. Further, each separate service, or class of services, requests the networks to apply different policy mechanisms, depending on the type of request being handled. Additionally, most of the management functions are scattered across the network and tend to be performed in a localized and static fashion.","For instance, when a user of a networked portable device, such as a cell phone, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), laptop, or the like, request(s) access to one or more services offered through the one more networks, there is no common manner to track access and user requests based on type of services, such as voice. Further, there is no common means to manage, store, update, and so forth, the in session and\/or cross session, dynamic policy related information.","In deploying networks, it is important to provide network resources based on the need of mobile services. Although policy and charging control (PCC) has generally been defined (e.g., for LTE network by 3GPP), it does not cover using the policy itself as a service.","The above-described deficiencies of today's policy deployment architectures are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with conventional systems and corresponding benefits of the various non-limiting embodiments described herein may become further apparent upon review of the following description.","A simplified summary is provided herein to help enable a basic or general understanding of various aspects of exemplary, non-limiting embodiments that follow in the more detailed description and the accompanying drawings. This summary is not intended, however, as an extensive or exhaustive overview. Instead, the sole purpose of this summary is to present some concepts related to some exemplary non-limiting embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description of the various embodiments that follow.","Various embodiments provide a deployable network architecture that enable policy servers to operate as a policy service function that can track service information, cache the service information dynamically, and provide network information to dynamically manage mobile services.","Other embodiments relate to a network element that can operate as a primary policy access gateway for a first geographic region and as a secondary policy access gateway for a second (or subsequent) geographic regions. The first geographic region and the second (or subsequent) geographic regions can overlap, at least in part.","Further, the various embodiments are configured to utilize a network element or policy access gateway that communicates with various network entities. Further, the network element can communicate with roaming partners on behalf of the various network entities, thus hiding the home network topology from the visited roaming partners.","These and other embodiments are described in more detail below.","Overview","Mobile services increasingly demand more intelligence in the core network to deal with bandwidth demand, Quality of Service (QoS), differentiated billing, and other traffic treatments that are unique to specific services and applications. As a result of this increasing demand, more and more network elements should be policy enabled in order to be able to treat service traffic differently based on service characteristics. On the other hand, services and applications should have information about the network condition to further customize the application dynamically in order to provide a positive user experience. The network policy information traditionally is not retained in the network, or, even if the network policy information exists, it is often scattered throughout the network. In addition, service layer information is typically dynamic and not available for use within the network.","Network deployment should support Internet Protocol (IP)-based and non-IP based service traffic, including voice services and mobile data services. A challenge with deploying a core network, such as a LTE core network, for example, is to provide network resources based on the need of mobile services. Thus, the core network should retain and manage service information and provide appropriate information based on the services that use the network resources. For example, the services should be network resources aware and the network should be service aware. A link between the two is a policy management framework. The policy information is an enabler for network intelligence. Although policy and charging control (PCC) has been defined for various networks, such policies do not cover using the policy itself as a service.","Thus, it would be beneficial to provide a deployable network architecture that enables policy servers to operate as a policy service function that can track service information, cache the service information dynamically, and provide the network information to dynamically manage mobile services. The various aspects can also provide the ability to manage in session and\/or cross session policy related information. Furthermore, the disclosed aspects can enable distribution of policies and\/or policy related information, such as policy notification, within the mobile network.","An aspect relates to an apparatus that includes a tracking component configured to monitor a first state of a first user service activity. The apparatus also includes a cache component configured to retain the first state of the first user service activity. Further, the apparatus includes an interface component configured to communicate the first state of the first user service activity to a plurality of managed mobile services.","In some implementations, the interface component is further configured to receive information related to a second state of a second user service activity. The first user service activity and the second user service activity are associated with a user equipment in a first geographic area.","In an implementation, the apparatus further includes a support module configured to provide direct support for the first geographic area and indirect support for a second geographic area. At least a portion of the first geographic area and the second geographic area comprise a common area.","According to some implementations, the apparatus is configured to hide a topology of a home network from a roaming partner. In a further implementation, the first user service activity comprises a first activity and a second activity for a user equipment. In another implementation, the first user service activity comprises a plurality of services provided to one user equipment. In still another implementation, the first user service activity is provided by different network elements.","Another aspect relates to a method performed by a network entity for providing mobile services. The method includes tracking a set of first user session data associated with a first session for a user device. The set of first user session data is temporarily cached. The method also includes sending the set of first user session data to a data store.","In an implementation, the method further includes receiving an indication of a second session for the user device and obtaining the set of first user session data from the data store. Method also includes applying the set of first user session data to the second session for the user device.","In some implementations, the method includes pushing session record information of the set of first user session data to at least one gateway for authorized access. In an aspect, the pushing comprises providing the session record information to at least one of a network element, an application, a resource, or another gateway.","According to some implementations, the method includes associating the set of first user session data with policy record information. In other implementations, the method includes communicating with a roaming network, wherein the communicating hides the home network topology from visited roaming network.","In some aspects, the method includes generating a session record for the set of first user session data. The session record comprises an identification of the user device and associated network elements. In other aspects, the method includes providing routing between network entities and five or more service zones.","According to another aspect is a system that includes a first component configured to monitor a set of first user service activities within a first geographic region. Also included is a second component configured to monitor a set of second user service activities within the first geographic region. The first user service activities and the second user service activities are for a user device.","In an implementation, the system comprises a third component configured to provide backup support for a network entity. The network entity monitors a third set of user service activities associated with a second geographic region. At least a portion of the first geographic region and the second geographic region overlap. The backup support provides redundancy.","In another implementation, the first component is further configured to point to an active policy record information in a network element. In some implementations, the first component interfaces to a plurality of network elements that perform functions related to policies and charging functions.","Herein, an overview of some of the embodiments for a scalable policy deployment architecture has been presented above. As a roadmap for what follows next, various exemplary, non-limiting embodiments and features for policy deployment architectures are described in more detail. Then, some non-limiting implementations and examples are given for additional illustration, followed by representative networks and environments in which such embodiments and\/or features can be implemented.","Policy as a Network Service in a Mobile Core Network","By way of further description with respect to one or more non-limiting ways to provide a scalable policy deployment architecture, a high-level block diagram of an exemplary communication system is illustrated generally by . The communication system can be included in an environment, which can be a communications network and\/or a set of communication networks. Network types can include Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS), Long Term Evolution (LTE), High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA), Single-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (SC-CDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Single-Carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), and so on. Although the various aspects and examples are discussed herein with respect to a LTE network, it should be appreciated that the disclosed aspects can be utilized with other networks and any references to LTE networks are for purposes of simplicity of describing the various aspects.","The environment can include a multitude of network entities . Network entities, can include, but are not limited to, Policy Controlling and Rules Functions (PCRFs), Policy and Charging Enforcement Functions (PCEFs), Diameter Routing Agents (DRAs), Balance Managers (BMs), Session Border Controllers (SBCs), gateways (e.g., messaging gateway), application and content providers, and so forth. A BM can manage, for example, quota gigabytes per month, which can track the amount of usage for each user equipment. Such usage can be tracked for billing purposes (e.g., pay per view) or for other purposes (e.g., statistical information, usage information, and so forth). SBCs can control the signaling and the media streams involved in setting up, conducting, and tearing down voice calls or other interactive media and can comprise an Application Function (AP).","The network entities  can deploy one or more policies. As used herein, \u201cpolicies\u201d refers to a set of one or more rules that a network operator can define and enforce in a telecommunications network (e.g., environment). The policies can be exchanged and can be applied both within an operator domain and across different operator domains.","The policies are input in the form of one or more arriving policies  to a tracking component . In accordance with some aspects, the policies are received from a gateway or another device. The policies are applied to user sessions and a user service is provided based, in part, on the policies. The tracking component  is configured to monitor a first set of data  of a first user session . A cache component  is configured to dynamically retain the first set of data . The tracking component  (or another component) is further configured to monitor a second (or subsequent) user session . The first user session  and the second (or subsequent) user session  are associated with the same user\/user device. For example, the first user session  can be a voice service and the second user session  can be a data service.","In accordance with some aspects, as a function of the monitoring, a utilization component  is configured to obtain the first set of data  of the first user session  and apply the first set of data  to the second user session . However, in accordance with some aspects, the first set of data  is not applied to the second user session , instead, a second set of data  associated with the second user session  is retained by cache component .","An interface component  is configured to communicate the first set of data  and\/or the second set of data  to one or more managed mobile services. For example, the data can be communicated to the one or more network entities . However, in accordance with some aspects, the data is communicated to one or more network elements  (sometimes referred to as Policy Access Gateways).","The interface component  is further configured to receive policy and other state information from other network elements, such as network entities  and\/or network elements  (e.g., network elements located in a different geographic region of the network). For example, a user device is moved into the geographic area being serviced by a communications apparatus  that includes tracking component , cache component , utilization component , and\/or interface component . In this case, information related to the state of one or more services provided to the user device can be communicated to interface component  (e.g., from another network element , as will be discussed in further detail below). In such a manner, utilization component  can apply the state or network condition to the user device in order to further customize the application dynamically and provide a positive user experience.","The communications apparatus  can be, for example, a, network node, network element or network entity. In accordance with some aspects, the communications apparatus  (sometimes referred to herein as a Policy Access Gateway (PAG)) can be configured to perform various functions usually performed by a Diameter Routing Agent (DRA), as defined by the Third (3) Generation Partnership (3GPP). In addition to the standard DRA functions, the communications apparatus  is configured to perform functions for processing policies. According to some aspects, the communications apparatus  is configured to perform both DRA functions as well as additional functions for policy processing. Further, the communications apparatus  can be configured to retain state and session information.","In accordance with some aspects, the communications apparatus  is configured as a centralized mechanism to obtain, cache, and share dynamic policy information within a network. Thus, the state and other policy information can be cached and shared among other communication apparatuses (or PAGs). Such sharing of information can also be utilized in order to provide redundancy within the network. For example, the communications apparatus  can provide primary support for network elements within a certain geographic region. Further, since information related to network elements within another geographic region have been communicated to (or shared with) the communications apparatus , the communications apparatus  can provide secondary support for user devices arriving from the other geographic region(s).","In an embodiment, the communication system illustrated by  can differ in operation from a conventional communication system in order to provide additional benefits over those achievable by systems that employ a non-scalable policy deployment architecture. For instance, the communication systems disclosed herein are scalable and can be deployed in a very large network that support hundreds of millions of users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200"]},"Illustrated are four geographic regions, represented by the dashed ovals and labeled Geographic Region A , Geographic Region B , Geographic Region C , and Geographic Region D . The Geographic Regions represent policy service geographic region distribution and, due to the overlapping nature of the Geographic Regions can provide operation redundancy. Although only four Geographic Regions are illustrated and described, a communication network can include fewer or more Geographic Regions.","Included in each Geographic Region are a multitude of PCEFs  as well as Application Functions (AF) and other policy consumers . The PCEFs  and AF and other policy consumers  interface with Policy Access Gateways (PAGs). The PAGs track and correlate user session(s) state and point to an active policy record information in a corresponding PCRF. For example, PAGs  points to an active policy record in PCRF , PAGs  points to an active policy record in PCRF , PAGs  points to PCRF , and PAGs  points to PCRF .","An AF is an element offering applications that need dynamic policy and\/or charging and control over an IP-Connectivity Access Network (IP-CAN) user plane behavior. The AF can receive an indication that the service information is not accepted by a PCRF together with service information that the PCRF would accept. In that case, the AF rejects the service establishment to the user equipment (or user device). If possible, the AF can forward to the user equipment an indication of the service information that the PCRF would accept. The AF may communicate with multiple PCRFs and contact the appropriate PCRF based on either an end user IP Address and\/or a user equipment identity of which the AF is made aware.","In accordance with some aspects, each PAG is configured to provide primary support for a first geographic region and, at substantially the same time, provide secondary support for at least a second geographic region, wherein a portion of the geographic regions overlap. For example, Geographic Region A  and Geographic Region B  overlap at . Geographic Region B  and Geographic Region D  overlap at . Geographic Region D  and Geographic Region C  overlap, at . Further, Geographic Region C  and Geographic Region A  overlap, at .","The PAGs , , ,  communicate with each other, as shown by the dark lines connecting the PAGs. In accordance with some aspects, the PAGs communicate over a PAG Net, which is a secure and dedicated diameter signaling network backbone. The sharing of information between the PAGs can mitigate an amount of signaling related traffic and can enable routing decisions between network elements that are involved in policy and charging control (PCC) design paths.","Since the PAGs communicate with each other and can be located in areas of the Geographic Regions that overlap, each PAG can provide primary support for its Geographic Region and secondary support for at least one adjacent Geographic Region. For example, PAG  can provide primary support for Geographic Region A  and, if needed, can provide secondary support for Geographic Region B  and\/or Geographic Region C . In a similar manner, PAG  can provide primary support for Geographic Region B  and can provide secondary support for Geographic Region D  (if PAG  is not available to provide primary support for Geographic Region D ) and\/or Geographic Region A . In a similar manner, PAG  can provide secondary support to Geographic Region C  (if PAG  is no longer available (or needs assistance) to provide support to Geographic Region C ) and\/or Geographic Region B. Further, PAG  can provide secondary support to Geographic Region A  and\/or Geographic Region D . The geographic redundancy facilitates the use of a policy as a network service for application functions and other policy consumers .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304","302","306","304","308","306","304","304","304","1","2","306","302"]},"Session Binding Record for MSISDN1234567890:","PCEF=A(data), B(voice)","PCRF=X","SPR=Y","OCS\/OFCS=A","However, other information can be obtained by the PAG . The PAG  can also track the various information during the active user session state and, if applicable, the information  can be updated. For example, the information retained in data store  can be updated dynamically as changes occur.","The PAG  is also the pointer to active policy record information in a corresponding PCRF . The information is shared among all PAG instances. Such sharing can mitigate policy signaling related traffic. In some aspects, the sharing of information can enable more optimal routing decisions between each network element that is involved in PCC decision paths when multiple APNs are involved. This can provide offloading of the PCRF from the TPS perspective, which is a driver for PCRF scalability in a highly distributed network. This process is shown by the arrows at .","During an initial default bearer set up process, information related to various network entities is tracked and cached by PAGs. Examples of network elements include a policy decision engine (e.g., Policy Control and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) in 3GPP), a Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF ), and Subscription Profile Repository (SRP ). The policy decisions are generated by the policy decision engine. The PCEF examines packets passing though a gateway and enforces control and charging policy decisions on the packets. The SRP is a logical entity that includes all subscriber\/subscription related information needed for subscription-based policies and IP-CAN (Internet Protocol Connectivity Access Network) bearer level charging rules by the PCRF. The SPR may be combined with or distributed across other data sores in the operator's network. The SPR may provide information including, but not limited to, Subscriber's allowed services, Information on subscriber's allowed QoS, Subscriber's charging related information, and Subscriber category. Another example, of a network element whose information is tracked by the PAG is an On-Line Charging System and an Off-Line Charging System (OCS\/OFCS )","The binding record can be updated during the second default bearer setting up process. Thus, there is no need to signal again to the PCRF , SPR , and\/or OCS\/OFCS . Direct packet replay can occur for the second default bearer, which can mitigate the amount of signaling needed. This binding information tied to policy can provide complex services that utilize resources from different network nodes in that all policy related information and session state information are cached in the PAG . The information can be readily available to these network nodes without each network node needing to have to cache part of the information. Additionally, the PAG can provide the information to other internal network elements as a service to the internal network elements.","In accordance with some aspects, the PAG  can export the session related dynamic data into a gateway . As needed, other network elements  that need policy and user session information can access the data. The paths related to session discovery and policy information sharing for active users are illustrated by arrows  and . The other arrows indicate the paths involved in session creating and binding set up.","Illustrating other aspects,  is a block diagram showing a communication apparatus , according to an aspect. The communication apparatus  is configured to obtain, cache, and share dynamic policy information in a communications network. Caching all the information in a single entity, mitigates the amount of signaling needed to obtain the information (as compared to when the information needs to be obtained from multiple entities). In some aspects, the communication apparatus  is a network element or a Policy Access Gateway (PAG) that is included in a geo-diversified architecture to provide large scale deployment.","The communication apparatus  retains state and other policy record information and caches the information, which can allow the information to be shared among other network entity instances (e.g., other PAGs). The sharing of the information can mitigate policy signaling related traffic when multiple APNs are involved. For example, user session and policy information can be shared within a telecom network, which can enable the centralized management of policy related information in the network and also share and serve the information with network elements.","Communication apparatus  comprises a tracking component , a cache component , a utilization component , and an interface component . The interface component  (or another component) is configured to obtain network policy information  from a multitude of network entities , labeled as network entitythrough network entity, where N is an integer. Each of the network entities  can perform a different function, or subsets of the network entities can perform different functions, wherein a subset, as used herein comprises one or more network entities. For example, a first subset of network entities can perform a first function, a second subset of network entities can perform a second function, a third subset of network entities can perform a third function, and so on.","The communications apparatus  also comprises a component that is configured to provide routing between the network entities  and a multitude of service zones , labeled as service zonethough service zone, where M is an integer. In an example, the routing between the network entities  and the multitude of service zones  might have previously been performed by a Diameter Routing Agent (DRA), according to conventional deployment architectures. However, in accordance with the disclosed aspects, the routing is performed by the communications apparatus  (or PAG). In accordance with some aspects, service zones  comprise five or more service zones, wherein the communications apparatus  further provides routing between the network entities  and the five or more service zones .","According to some aspects, communication apparatus  can be located within a first geographic region and can be within one or more other geographic regions (e.g., the geographic regions comprise a common area). Thus, the communications apparatus  can be configured to provide direct support for the first geographic area and indirect support for the second geographic area.","The tracking component  is configured to monitor a first user service activity or a first user session data  for a user device (or user equipment). The tracking component  is also configured to monitor a second user session data . The first user session data  and the second user session data  are associated with a user device. For example, the first user session data  can be related to voice and the second user session data  can be related to data, however, the disclosed aspects are not limited to this example.","The user session data or user service activity can comprise a first activity for the user device and a second activity for the user device. According to some aspects, the first user service activity comprises a plurality of services provided to one user device. In an aspect, the first user service activity comprises different network elements that provide the user service activities.","The cache component  is configured to retain the state of the first user session data  and\/or the state of the second user session data . Retaining the state(s) can allow the state(s) to be dynamically accessible by communications apparatus  or another network element. For example, the state can be retained in an internal storage media and\/or an external storage media (e.g., a data store). The information retained in the data store or other storage media can be accessed by communication apparatus  and\/or another device or network element that needs to utilize the information (e.g., a PAG located in a different geographic area that is to provide service for the user device).","The utilization component  is configured to selectively apply the first user session data  to the second user session, if the data is useful for the second user session. Additionally or alternatively, the utilization component  is configured to apply the first user session data  and\/or the second user session data  to a subsequent user session.","In accordance with some aspects, the utilization component  is configured to receive or obtain user session data from another network entity and apply the user session data to a session executing on a user device that has moved into a geographic region served by communication apparatus . For example, utilization component  can access a data store in which the other network entity stored the user session data when the device was located in a geographic area served by the network entity.","The interface component  is configured to communicate the first state of the first user session data  to a plurality of managed mobile services. In some aspects, the interface component  is configured to push session record information to at least one gateway for authorized access. For example, the session record information can be provided to at least one of a network element, an application, a resource, or another gateway.","In an aspect, the first state of the first user session data  is communicated to one or more PAGs located within various geographic regions of a communications network. Such PAGs can provide secondary support for network elements and devices located within a geographic region of communications apparatus .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","500","502","504","506","502","508","508"]},"Also associated with communications apparatus  is a storage media  that is configured to, at least temporarily, cache the first set of user session data  and\/or the second (or subsequent) set of user session data .

For example, the roaming partner communicates with the communication apparatus  in order to support a roaming mobile device. The communications apparatus  communicates with the various network elements (e.g., PCEF, PCRF, and so forth) on behalf of the roaming partner. Thus, the details of the topology in which communications apparatus  is included is hidden from the roaming partner.","To further describe the various aspects provided herein,  illustrates a conventional network deployment architecture  that does not incorporate the disclosed aspects. This architecture  can produce PCRF scaling problems. Included in the architecture  is a common service zone  that comprises one PCRF instance  in a national data center. The PCRF instance  is configured to support up to four traffic service zones, labeled as First Zone  (Zone ), Second Zone  (Zone ), Third Zone  (Zone ), and Fourth Zone  (Zone ). Thus, there is a one to four (1:4) relationship between the PCRF instance  and its service zones.","Each Zone comprises a PGW -, which comprises a PCEF -, and a Serving Gateway (SGW) -. A policy session bind correlation and load balancing between the PCRF  and PCEF  are achieved though a predefined static configurations on each side. To support additional traffic service zones, additional PCRFs need to be added since the PCRF might have difficulty to support more than four service zones (per the 1:4 ratios) due to increasing traffic for voice services that might use more policy signaling to set up dedicated bearers for voice sessions. This scaling mechanism can present operational challenges as additional data centers are created within the communication network.","To overcome the scaling problem,  illustrates a scalable deployment architecture , according to an aspect. As illustrated, a PAG  (e.g., communication apparatus  of ) is included in the deployment architecture .

Thus, the PAG  can provide intelligent policy routing between PCEFs - and their managing PCRF  instance. Further, the PAG  allows P number of PCEFs to connect to their managing PCRF instance, which can provide large scale deployment flexibility. For example, zones can be added without the need to add additional PCRFs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","802","804","806","808","806","808","806","810","810","812","814","812","814","1","2","1","806","808","812","806","812","808","812","808","814","812","814"]},"Thus, the disclosed aspects can provide PCRF scaling for PCEF, where PCRF is not located in the same NDC with the PCEFs.
