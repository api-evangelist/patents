No. 13\/493,899, filed Jun. 11, 2012, which incorporates by reference and claims the benefit of and priority under 35 USC \u00a7119(e) to U.S. Patent Application Nos. 61\/495,771, filed Jun. 10, 2011; 61\/501,000, filed Jun. 24, 2011; 61\/513,234, filed Jul. 29, 2011; 61\/566,935, filed Dec. 5, 2011; 61\/605,618, filed Mar. 1, 2012; and 61\/618,499, filed Mar. 30, 2012. The contents of each of these applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.","Traditionally, pharmaceuticals have primarily consisted of small molecules that are dispensed orally (as solid pills and liquids) or as injectables. Over the past three decades, formulations (i.e., compositions that control the route and\/or rate of drug delivery and allow delivery of the therapeutic agent at the site where it is needed) have become increasingly common and complex. Nevertheless, many questions and challenges regarding the development of new treatments as well as the mechanisms with which to administer them remain to be addressed. For example, many drugs exhibit limited or otherwise reduced potencies and therapeutic effects because they are either generally subject to partial degradation before they reach a desired target in the body, or accumulate in tissues other than the target, or both.","One objective in the field of drug delivery systems, therefore, is to deliver medications intact to specifically targeted areas of the body through a system that can stabilize the drug and control the in vivo transfer of the therapeutic agent utilizing either physiological or chemical mechanisms, or both.","Antibody-drug conjugates have been developed as target-specific therapeutic agents. Antibodies against various cancer cell-surface antigens have been conjugated with different cytotoxic agents that inhibit various essential cellular targets such as microtubules (maytansinoids, auristatins, taxanes: U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,208,020; 5,416,064; 6,333,410; 6,441,163; 6,340,701; 6,372,738; 6,436,931; 6,596,757; and 7,276,497); DNA (calicheamicin, doxorubicin, CC-1065 analogs; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,475,092; 5,585,499; 5,846,545; 6,534,660; 6,756,397; and 6,630,579). Antibody conjugates with some of these cytotoxic drugs are actively being investigated in the clinic for cancer therapy (Ricart, A. D., and Tolcher, A. W., 20074, 245-255; Krop et al., 201028, 2698-2704). However, existing antibody-drug conjugates have exhibited a few limitations. A major limitation is their inability to deliver a sufficient concentration of drug to the target site because of the limited number of targeted antigens and the relatively moderate cytotoxicity of cancer drugs like methotrexate, daunorubicin, maytansinoids, taxanes, and vincristine. One approach to achieving significant cytotoxicity is by linkage of a large number of drug molecules either directly or indirectly to the antibody. However such heavily modified antibodies often display impaired binding to the target antigen and fast in vivo clearance from the blood stream. Therefore, there is a need to improve the ability to deliver a sufficient concentration of a drug to the target such that maximum cytotoxicity for the drug is achieved.","The present invention relates to a protein-polymer-drug conjugate that is biodegradable, biocompatible and exhibits high drug load as well as strong binding to target antigen. The present invention also relates to a polymeric scaffold useful to conjugate with a protein based recognition-molecule (PBRM) so as to obtain the protein-polymer-drug conjugate.","In one aspect, the invention relates to a polymeric scaffold of Formula (Ia) useful to conjugate with a protein based recognition-molecule (PBRM) that has a molecular weight of less than 80 kDa, wherein the scaffold comprises a polymeric carrier:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"77.89mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08815226-20140826-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"the polymeric carrier is PHF having a molecular weight ranging from 20 kDa to 150 kDa;","each occurrence of D is independently a therapeutic agent having a molecular weight of \u22665 kDa;",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"11.51mm","wi":"30.82mm","file":"US08815226-20140826-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":"D1 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"11.51mm","wi":"11.43mm","file":"US08815226-20140826-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["D1 ","D1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"11.51mm","wi":"33.70mm","file":"US08815226-20140826-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"11.51mm","wi":"31.92mm","file":"US08815226-20140826-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":"P2 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"11.51mm","wi":"11.43mm","file":"US08815226-20140826-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["D1 ","P2 ","P2 ","D1"]},"m is an integer from 1 to 1100,","mis an integer from 1 to 330,","mis an integer from 3 to 150,","mis an integer from 1 to 55, and","the sum of m, m, mand mranges from 150 to about 1100.","The scaffold of (Ia) can include one or more of the following features:","The PHF has a molecular weight ranging from 30 kDa to 100 kDa, mis an integer from 3 to about 100, mis an integer from 1 to 40, and mis an integer from 1 to 220.","The functional group of Lis selected from \u2014SR, \u2014S\u2014S-LG, maleimido, and halo, in which LG is a leaving group and Ris H or a sulfur protecting group.","Lcomprises \u2014X\u2014(CH)\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014 with X directly connected to the carbonyl group of",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00007","num":"00007"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00007","he":"11.60mm","wi":"31.92mm","file":"US08815226-20140826-C00007.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":"2"},"Lcontains a biodegradable bond.","The scaffold further comprises a PBRM connected to the polymeric carrier via L.","The scaffold is of Formula (Ib):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00008","num":"00008"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00008","he":"144.61mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08815226-20140826-C00008.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00009","num":"00009"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00009","he":"11.51mm","wi":"11.43mm","file":"US08815226-20140826-C00009.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["P2 ","P2"]},"m is an integer from 1 to 1100,","mis an integer from 1 to 330,","mis an integer from 3 to 150,","mis an integer from 0 to 55,","mis an integer from 1 to 30;

The protein based recognition molecule, in addition to targeting the modified polymer conjugate to a specific cell, tissue or location, may also have certain therapeutic effect such as antiproliferative (cytostatic and\/or cytotoxic) activity against a target cell or pathway. The protein based recognition molecule comprises or may be engineered to comprise at least one chemically reactive group such as, \u2014COOH, primary amine, secondary amine \u2014NHR, \u2014SH, or a chemically reactive amino acid moiety or side chains such as, for example, tyrosine, histidine, cysteine, or lysine.","\u201cBiocompatible\u201d as used herein is intended to describe compounds that exert minimal destructive or host response effects while in contact with body fluids or living cells or tissues. Thus a biocompatible group, as used herein, refers to an aliphatic, cycloalkyl, heteroaliphatic, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, or heteroaryl moiety, which falls within the definition of the term biocompatible, as defined above and herein. The term \u201cBiocompatibility\u201d as used herein, is also taken to mean that the compounds exhibit minimal interactions with recognition proteins, e.g., naturally occurring antibodies, cell proteins, cells and other components of biological systems, unless such interactions are specifically desirable. Thus, substances and functional groups specifically intended to cause the above minimal interactions, e.g., drugs and prodrugs, are considered to be biocompatible. Preferably (with exception of compounds intended to be cytotoxic, such as, e.g., antineoplastic agents), compounds are \u201cbiocompatible\u201d if their addition to normal cells in vitro, at concentrations similar to the intended systemic in vivo concentrations, results in less than or equal to 1% cell death during the time equivalent to the half-life of the compound in vivo (e.g., the period of time required for 50% of the compound administered in vivo to be eliminated\/cleared), and their administration in vivo induces minimal and medically acceptable inflammation, foreign body reaction, immunotoxicity, chemical toxicity and\/or other such adverse effects. In the above sentence, the term \u201cnormal cells\u201d refers to cells that are not intended to be destroyed or otherwise significantly affected by the compound being tested.","\u201cBiodegradable\u201d: As used herein, \u201cbiodegradable\u201d polymers are polymers that are susceptible to biological processing in vivo. As used herein, \u201cbiodegradable\u201d compounds or moieties are those that, when taken up by cells, can be broken down by the lysosomal or other chemical machinery or by hydrolysis into components that the cells can either reuse or dispose of without significant toxic effect on the cells. The term \u201cbiocleavable\u201d as used herein has the same meaning of \u201cbiodegradable\u201d. The degradation fragments preferably induce little or no organ or cell overload or pathological processes caused by such overload or other adverse effects in vivo. Examples of biodegradation processes include enzymatic and non-enzymatic hydrolysis, oxidation and reduction. Suitable conditions for non-enzymatic hydrolysis of the biodegradable protein-polymer-drug conjugates (or their components, e.g., the biodegradable polymeric carrier and the linkers between the carrier and the antibody or the drug molecule) described herein, for example, include exposure of the biodegradable conjugates to water at a temperature and a pH of lysosomal intracellular compartment. Biodegradation of some protein-polymer-drug conjugates (or their components, e.g., the biodegradable polymeric carrier and the linkers between the carrier and the antibody or the drug molecule), can also be enhanced extracellularly, e.g., in low pH regions of the animal body, e.g., an inflamed area, in the close vicinity of activated macrophages or other cells releasing degradation facilitating factors. In certain preferred embodiments, the effective size of the polymer carrier at pH-7.5 does not detectably change over 1 to 7 days, and remains within 50% of the original polymer size for at least several weeks. At pH-5, on the other hand, the polymer carrier preferably detectably degrades over 1 to 5 days, and is completely transformed into low molecular weight fragments within a two-week to several-month time frame. Polymer integrity in such tests can be measured, for example, by size exclusion HPLC. Although faster degradation may be in some cases preferable, in general it may be more desirable that the polymer degrades in cells with the rate that does not exceed the rate of metabolization or excretion of polymer fragments by the cells. In preferred embodiments, the polymers and polymer biodegradation byproducts are biocompatible.","\u201cBioavailability\u201d: The term \u201cbioavailability\u201d refers to the systemic availability (i.e., blood\/plasma levels) of a given amount of drug or compound administered to a subject. Bioavailability is an absolute term that indicates measurement of both the time (rate) and total amount (extent) of drug or compound that reaches the general circulation from an administered dosage form.","\u201cHydrophilic\u201d: The term \u201chydrophilic\u201d as it relates to substituents on the polymer monomeric units does not essentially differ from the common meaning of this term in the art, and denotes chemical moieties which contain ionizable, polar, or polarizable atoms, or which otherwise may be solvated by water molecules. Thus a hydrophilic group, as used herein, refers to an aliphatic, cycloalkyl, heteroaliphatic, heterocycloalkyl, aryl or heteroaryl moiety, which falls within the definition of the term hydrophilic, as defined above. Examples of particular hydrophilic organic moieties which are suitable include, without limitation, aliphatic or heteroaliphatic groups comprising a chain of atoms in a range of between about one and twelve atoms, hydroxyl, hydroxyalkyl, amine, carboxyl, amide, carboxylic ester, thioester, aldehyde, nitryl, isonitryl, nitroso, hydroxylamine, mercaptoalkyl, heterocycle, carbamates, carboxylic acids and their salts, sulfonic acids and their salts, sulfonic acid esters, phosphoric acids and their salts, phosphate esters, polyglycol ethers, polyamines, polycarboxylates, polyesters and polythioesters. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, at least one of the polymer monomeric units include a carboxyl group (COOH), an aldehyde group (CHO), a methylol (CHOH) or a glycol (for example, CHOH\u2014CHOH or CH\u2014(CHOH)).","The term \u201chydrophilic\u201d as it relates to the polymers of the invention generally does not differ from usage of this term in the art, and denotes polymers comprising hydrophilic functional groups as defined above. In a preferred embodiment, hydrophilic polymer is a water-soluble polymer. Hydrophilicity of the polymer can be directly measured through determination of hydration energy, or determined through investigation between two liquid phases, or by chromatography on solid phases with known hydrophobicity, such as, for example, C4 or C18.","\u201cPolymeric Carrier\u201d: The term polymeric carrier, as used herein, refers to a polymer or a modified polymer, which is suitable for covalently attaching to or can be covalently attached to one or more drug molecules with a designated linker and\/or one or more PBRMs with a designated linker.","\u201cPhysiological conditions\u201d: The phrase \u201cphysiological conditions\u201d, as used herein, relates to the range of chemical (e.g., pH, ionic strength) and biochemical (e.g., enzyme concentrations) conditions likely to be encountered in the extracellular fluids of living tissues. For most normal tissues, the physiological pH ranges from about 7.0 to 7.4. Circulating blood plasma and normal interstitial liquid represent typical examples of normal physiological conditions.","\u201cPolysaccharide\u201d, \u201ccarbohydrate\u201d or \u201coligosaccharide\u201d: The terms \u201cpolysaccharide\u201d, \u201ccarbohydrate\u201d, or \u201coligosaccharide\u201d are known in the art and refer, generally, to substances having chemical formula (CHO), where generally n>2, and their derivatives. Carbohydrates are polyhydroxyaldehydes or polyhydroxyketones, or change to such substances on simple chemical transformations, such as hydrolysis, oxidation or reduction. Typically, carbohydrates are present in the form of cyclic acetals or ketals (such as, glucose or fructose). These cyclic units (monosaccharides) may be connected to each other to form molecules with few (oligosaccharides) or several (polysaccharides) monosaccharide units. Often, carbohydrates with well defined number, types and positioning of monosaccharide units are called oligosaccharides, whereas carbohydrates consisting of mixtures of molecules of variable numbers and\/or positioning of monosaccharide units are called polysaccharides. The terms \u201cpolysaccharide\u201d, \u201ccarbohydrate\u201d, and \u201coligosaccharide\u201d, are used herein interchangeably. A polysaccharide may include natural sugars (e.g., glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, arabinose, ribose, and xylose) and\/or derivatives of naturally occurring sugars (e.g., 2\u2032-fluororibose, 2\u2033-deoxyribose, and hexose).","\u201cSmall molecule\u201d: As used herein, the term \u201csmall molecule\u201d refers to molecules, whether naturally-occurring or artificially created (e.g., via chemical synthesis) that have a relatively low molecular weight. Preferred small molecules are biologically active in that they produce a local or systemic effect in animals, preferably mammals, more preferably humans. In certain preferred embodiments, the small molecule is a drug and the small molecule is referred to as \u201cdrug molecule\u201d or \u201cdrug\u201d or \u201ctherapeutic agent\u201d. In certain embodiments, the drug molecule has MW less than or equal to about 5 kDa. In other embodiments, the drug molecule has MW less than or equal to about 1.5 kDa.

directs the drug-polymer carrier conjugates to specific tissues, cells, or locations in a cell. The protein-based recognition molecule can direct the modified polymer in culture or in a whole organism, or both. In each case, the protein-based recognition molecule has a ligand that is present on the cell surface of the targeted cell(s) to which it binds with an effective specificity, affinity and avidity. In some embodiments, the protein-based recognition molecule targets the modified polymer to tissues other than the liver. In other embodiments the protein-based recognition molecule targets the modified polymer to a specific tissue such as the liver, kidney, lung or pancreas. The protein-based recognition molecule can target the modified polymer to a target cell such as a cancer cell, such as a receptor expressed on a cell such as a cancer cell, a matrix tissue, or a protein associated with cancer such as tumor antigen. Alternatively, cells comprising the tumor vasculature may be targeted. Protein-based recognition molecules can direct the polymer to specific types of cells such as specific targeting to hepatocytes in the liver as opposed to Kupffer cells. In other cases, protein-based recognition molecules can direct the polymer to cells of the reticular endothelial or lymphatic system, or to professional phagocytic cells such as macrophages or eosinophils. (In such cases the polymer itself might also be an effective delivery system, without the need for specific targeting).","In still other embodiments, the protein based recognition molecule can target the modified polymer to a location within the cell, such as the nucleus, the cytoplasm, or the endosome, for example. In specific embodiments, the protein based recognition molecule can enhance cellular binding to receptors, or cytoplasmic transport to the nucleus and nuclear entry or release from endosomes or other intracellular vesicles.","In specific embodiments the protein based recognition molecules include antibodies, proteins and peptides or peptide mimics.","Exemplary antibodies or antibodies derived from

In some embodiments, the linker is biocleavable\/biodegradable under intracellular conditions, such that the cleavage of the linker releases the drug or PBRM from the polymer unit in the intracellular environment.","A linker is any chemical moiety that is capable of linking a drug or a PBRM to a polymer backbone through chemical bonds such that the drug or PBRM and the polymer are chemically coupled (e.g., covalently bonded) to each other. In some embodiments, the linker comprises a biodegradable linker moiety (e.g., a biodegradable bond such as an ester or amide bond).","In other embodiments, the linker Lor Lis biodegradable under mild conditions, i.e., conditions within a cell under which the activity of the drug is not affected. Examples of suitable biodegradable linker moiety include disulfide linkers, acid labile linkers, photolabile linkers, peptidase labile linkers, and esterase labile linkers.","In some embodiments, the linker Lor Lis biocleavable under reducing conditions (e.g., a disulfide linker). In this embodiment the drug or PBRM moiety is linked to the polymer through a disulfide bond. The linker molecule comprises a reactive chemical group that can react with the drug. Preferred reactive chemical groups for reaction with the drug or PBRM moiety are N-succinimidyl esters and N-sulfosuccinimidyl esters. Additionally the linker molecule comprises a reactive chemical group, preferably a dithiopyridyl group that can react with the drug to form a disulfide bond. In some embodiments the linker molecules include, for example, N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP), N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)butanoate (SPDB), N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)pentanoate (SPP), N-succinimidyl-5-acetylthioacetate (SATA) and N-succinimidyl-oxycarbonyl-alpha-methyl-alpha-(2-pyridyl-dithio)toluene or 2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl 4-(1-(pyridin-2-yldisulfanyl)ethyl)benzoate (SMPT).","In other embodiments, the biocleavable linker Lor Lis pH-sensitive, i.e., sensitive to hydrolysis at certain pH values. Typically, the pH-sensitive linker is hydrolysable under acidic conditions. For example, an acid-labile linker that is hydrolysable in the lysosome or endosome (e.g., a hydrazone, semicarbazone, thiosemicarbazone, cis-aconitic amide, orthoester, acetal, ketal, or the like) can be used. Such linkers are relatively stable under neutral pH conditions, such as those in the blood, but are unstable at below pH 5.5 or 5.0, the approximate pH of the lysosome. In certain embodiments, the hydrolysable linker is a thioether linker (such as, e.g., a thioether attached to the therapeutic agent via an acylhydrazone bond.","In other embodiments the linker Lor Lis photo-labile and is useful at the body surface and in many body cavities that are accessible to light. Furthermore, Lor Lis biocleavable by infrared light which can penetrate tissue. Accordingly, Lor Lis useful for both applications on the body surface and in the tissue.","In some embodiments, the linker Lor Lis biocleavable by a cleaving agent that is present in the intracellular environment (e.g., within a lysosome or endosome or caveolea). The linker can be, for example, a peptidyl linker that is cleaved by an intracellular peptidase or protease enzyme, including, but not limited to, a lysosomal or endosomal protease.","In some embodiments the linker Lor Lis cleaved by esterases. Only certain esters can be cleaved by esterases present inside or outside cells. Esters are formed by the condensation of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Simple esters are esters produced with simple alcohols, such as aliphatic alcohols, and small cyclic and small aromatic alcohols.","In yet other embodiments, the linker Lor Lis not biocleavable and the drug is released by antibody degradation. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,498,298, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and for all purposes.","Typically, the linker Lor Lis not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment. As used herein, \u201cnot substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment,\u201d in the context of a linker, means that no more than about 20%, typically no more than about 15%, more typically no more than about 10%, and even more typically no more than about 5%, no more than about 3%, or no more than about 1% of the linkers, in a sample of Polymer Drug Conjugate, are cleaved when the Polymer Drug Conjugate presents in an extracellular environment (e.g., in plasma) for 24 hours. Whether a linker is not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment can be determined, for example, by incubating the Polymer Drug Conjugate with plasma for a predetermined time period (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, or 24 hours) and then quantitating the amount of free drug present in the plasma.","In embodiments, the linker Lhas the structure: \u2014R\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014X-M-Y-M-Z-M-Q-M-,

For example, under physiological conditions, a balance between biodegradability and stability can be reached. For instance, it is known that molecules with molecular weights beyond a certain threshold (generally, above 40-100 kDa, depending on the physical shape of the molecule) are not excreted through kidneys, as small molecules are, and can be cleared from the body only through uptake by cells and degradation in intracellular compartments, most notably lysosomes. This observation exemplifies how functionally stable yet biodegradable materials may be designed by modulating their stability under general physiological conditions (pH=7.5\u00b10.5) and at lysosomal pH (pH near 5). For example, hydrolysis of acetal and ketal groups is known to be catalyzed by acids, therefore polyals will be in general less stable in acidic lysosomal environment than, for example, in blood plasma. One can design a test to compare polymer degradation profile at, for example, pH=5 and pH=7.5 at 37\u00b0 C. in aqueous media, and thus to determine the expected balance of polymer stability in normal physiological environment and in the \u201cdigestive\u201d lysosomal compartment after uptake by cells. Polymer integrity in such tests can be measured, for example, by size exclusion HPLC. One skilled on the art can select other suitable methods for studying various fragments of the degraded conjugates of this invention.","In many cases, it will be preferable that at pH=7.5 the effective size of the polymer will not detectably change over 1 to 7 days, and remain within 50% from the original for at least several weeks. At pH=5, on the other hand, the polymer should preferably detectably degrade over 1 to 5 days, and be completely transformed into low molecular weight fragments within a two-week to several-month time frame. Although faster degradation may be in some cases preferable, in general it may be more desirable that the polymer degrades in cells with the rate that does not exceed the rate of metabolization or excretion of polymer fragments by the cells. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the conjugates of the present invention are expected to be biodegradable, in particular upon uptake by cells, and relatively \u201cinert\u201d in relation to biological systems. The products of carrier degradation are preferably uncharged and do not significantly shift the pH of the environment. It is proposed that the abundance of alcohol groups may provide low rate of polymer recognition by cell receptors, particularly of phagocytes. The polymer backbones of the present invention generally contain few, if any, antigenic determinants (characteristic, for example, for some polysaccharides and polypeptides) and generally do not comprise rigid structures capable of engaging in \u201ckey-and-lock\u201d type interactions in vivo unless the latter are desirable. Thus, the soluble, crosslinked and solid conjugates of this invention are predicted to have low toxicity and bioadhesivity, which makes them suitable for several biomedical applications.","In certain embodiments of the present invention, the biodegradable biocompatible conjugates can form linear or branched structures. For example, the biodegradable biocompatible polyal conjugates of the present invention can be chiral (optically active). Optionally, the biodegradable biocompatible polyal conjugates of the present invention can be scalemic.","In certain embodiments, the conjugates of the invention are water-soluble. In certain embodiments, the conjugates of the invention are water-insoluble. In certain embodiments, the inventive conjugate is in a solid form.

In other embodiments, the polymeric scaffold (e.g., a polyacetal polymer such as PHF) is conjugated with PBRMs by utilizing cysteine-based bioconjugation strategy. See, e.g., WO2010100430 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,595,292, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. In one embodiment, the polymeric scaffold (e.g., a polyacetal polymer such as PHF) conjugates with a PBRM (e.g., an antibody) via cysteines in the antibody hinge region. Without wishing to be bound by the theory, the resulting conjugate is stabilized through the formation of inter-chain bridge structures.","Accordingly, the invention also relates to a polymeric scaffold comprising at least two -Gmoieties connected to the polymeric scaffold, in which each -Gis capable of conjugation to a thiol group from an amino acid (e.g., cysteine) in a PBRM so as to form a protein-polymer conjugate. In embodiments, -Gis a maleimide group, a disulfide group, a thiol group, a triflate group, a tosylate group, an aziridine group, a 5-pydriyl functional group, a vinylsulfone group, a vinyl pyridine group, an alkyl halide group, an acrylate group or a methacrylate group.","In embodiments, one or more free thiol groups of a PBRM are produced by reducing a protein. The one or more free thiol groups of the PBRM then react with the at least two -Gmoieties contained in the polymer scaffold so as to conjugate the PBRM with the polymer scaffold.","In embodiments, the free thiol groups of the PBRM that are used for the conjugation are derived from a disulfide bridge of a native protein or a disulfide bridge of a protein complex consisting of two or more protein chains connected by the disulfide bridge. A disulfide bridge may be intrachain or interchain bridge. Alternatively, the free thiol groups of the PBRM are from cysteines or the unpaired thiol groups of the native protein that are not involved in inter or intra disulfide bridge formation.","Disulfide bonds can be reduced, for example, with dithiothreitol, mercaptoethanol, tris-carboxyethylphosphine, dehydroascorbic acid, copper sulfate, using conventional methods. A protein can contain one or more disulfide bridges. Reduction to give free thiol groups can be controlled to reduce one or more specific disulfide bridges in a protein. Depending on the extent of disulfide reduction and the stoichiometry of the -Gmoieties on the polymeric scaffold polymeric, it is possible to conjugate one or more polymer scaffolds to the protein. Immobilized reducing agents may be used if it is desired to reduce less than the total number of disulfides, as can partial reduction using different reaction conditions or the addition of denaturants.","Advantages of conjugating a polymer to a protein via a thiol include, but are not limited to optimized efficacy, improved dose to dose consistency and homogeneity (as the number of conjugated polymer molecules per protein is the substantially the same for each protein molecule), specific conjugation directed to a specific residue or residues on each protein, and easier purification. Also, the protein-polymer conjugates via the thiol conjugation exhibits substantially improved half-life, mean residence time, and\/or clearance rate in circulation as compared to the unconjugated protein.","In one embodiment, the scaffold for conjugating to thiol groups in a PBRM is of Formula (IIIa):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1066","num":"1065"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00282","num":"00282"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00282","he":"50.29mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08815226-20140826-C00282.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The wavy line in Formula (IIIa) above denotes direct or indirect attachment of -Gto the backbone of PHF. m and mare as defined herein.

available techniques can be used to make the inventive conjugates or compositions including them, and intermediates and components (e.g., carriers and modifiers) useful for making them. For example, semi-synthetic and fully synthetic methods such as those discussed in detail below may be used.","Carriers","Methods for preparing polymer carriers (e.g., biocompatible, biodegradable polymer carriers) suitable for conjugation to modifiers are known in the art. For example, synthetic guidance can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,811,510; 5,863,990; 5,958,398; 7,838,619; and 7,790,150; and U.S. Publication No. 2006\/0058512.

The conjugates can be administered and introduced into a subject by standard means, with or without stabilizers, buffers, and the like, to form a pharmaceutical composition. Administration may be topical (including ophthalmic and to mucous membranes including vaginal and rectal delivery), pulmonary, e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; intratracheal, intranasal, epidermal and transdermal, oral or parenteral administration including intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection or infusion or intracranial, e.g., intrathecal or intraventricular, administration. The conjugates can be formulated and used as sterile solutions and\/or suspensions for injectable administration; lyophilized powders for reconstitution prior to injection\/infusion; topical compositions; as tablets, capsules, or elixirs for oral administration; or suppositories for rectal administration, and the other compositions known in the art.","A pharmacological composition or formulation refers to a composition or formulation in a form suitable for administration, e.g., systemic administration, into a cell or subject, including for example a human. Suitable forms, in part, depend upon the use or the route of entry, for example oral, inhaled, transdermal, or by injection\/infusion. Such forms should not prevent the composition or formulation from reaching a target cell (i.e., a cell to which the drug is desirable for delivery). For example, pharmacological compositions injected into the blood stream should be soluble. Other factors are known in the art, and include considerations such as toxicity and forms that prevent the composition or formulation from exerting its effect.","By \u201csystemic administration\u201d is meant in vivo systemic absorption or accumulation of the modified polymer in the blood stream followed by distribution throughout the entire body. Administration routes that lead to systemic absorption include, without limitation: intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, inhalation, oral, intrapulmonary, and intramuscular. Each of these administration routes exposes the modified polymers to an accessible diseased tissue. The rate of entry of an active agent into the circulation has been shown to be a function of molecular weight or size. The use of a conjugate of this invention can localize the drug delivery in certain cells, such as cancer cells via the specificity of PBRMs.","A \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable formulation\u201d means a composition or formulation that allows for the effective distribution of the conjugates in the physical location most suitable for their desired activity. In one embodiment, effective delivery occurs before clearance by the reticuloendothelial system or the production of off-target binding which can result in reduced efficacy or toxicity. Non-limiting examples of agents suitable for formulation with the conjugates include: P-glycoprotein inhibitors (such as Pluronic P85), which can enhance entry of active agents into the CNS; biodegradable polymers, such as poly (DL-lactide-coglycolide) microspheres for sustained release delivery after intracerebral implantation; and loaded nanoparticles, such as those made of polybutylcyanoacrylate, which can deliver active agents across the blood brain barrier and can alter neuronal uptake mechanisms.","Also included herein are pharmaceutical compositions prepared for storage or administration, which include a pharmaceutically effective amount of the desired conjugates in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Acceptable carriers, diluents, and\/or excipients for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art. For example, buffers, preservatives, bulking agents, dispersants, stabilizers, dyes, can be provided. In addition, antioxidants and suspending agents can be used Examples of suitable carriers, diluents and\/or excipients include, but are not limited to: (1) Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline, pH about 6.5, which would contain about 1 mg\/ml to 25 mg\/ml human serum albumin, (2) 0.9% saline (0.9% w\/v NaCl), and (3) 5% (w\/v) dextrose.","The term \u201cpharmaceutically effective amount\u201d, as used herein, refers to an amount of a pharmaceutical agent to treat, ameliorate, or prevent an identified disease or condition, or to exhibit a detectable therapeutic or inhibitory effect. The effect can be detected by any assay method known in the art. The precise effective amount for a subject will depend upon the subject's body weight, size, and health; the nature and extent of the condition; and the therapeutic or combination of therapeutics selected for administration. Pharmaceutically effective amounts for a given situation can be determined by routine experimentation that is within the skill and judgment of the clinician. In a preferred aspect, the disease or condition to can be treated via gene silencing.","For any conjugate, the pharmaceutically effective amount can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays, e.g., of neoplastic cells, or in animal models, usually rats, mice, rabbits, dogs, or pigs. The animal model may also be used to determine the appropriate concentration range and route of administration. Such information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in humans. Therapeutic\/prophylactic efficacy and toxicity may be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., ED(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population) and LD(the dose lethal to 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, and it can be expressed as the ratio, LD\/ED. Pharmaceutical compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed, sensitivity of the patient, and the route of administration.","For example, a drug or its derivatives, drug-polymer conjugates or PBRM-drug-polymer conjugates can be evaluated for their ability to inhibit tumor growth in several cell lines using Cell titer Glo. Dose response curves can be generated using SoftMax Pro software and ICvalues can be determined from four-parameter curve fitting. Cell lines employed can include those which are the targets of the PBRM and a control cell line that is not the target of the PBRM contained in the test conjugates.","In one embodiment, the conjugates are formulated for parenteral administration by injection including using conventional catheterization techniques or infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The conjugates can be administered parenterally in a sterile medium. The conjugate, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Advantageously, adjuvants such as local anesthetics, preservatives, and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. The term \u201cparenteral\u201d as used herein includes percutaneous, subcutaneous, intravascular (e.g., intravenous), intramuscular, or intrathecal injection or infusion techniques and the like. In addition, there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation comprising conjugates and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. One or more of the conjugates can be present in association with one or more non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and\/or diluents and\/or adjuvants, and if desired other active ingredients.","The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parentally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, a bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.","The conjugates and compositions described herein may be administered in appropriate form, preferably parenterally, more preferably intravenously. For parenteral administration, the conjugates or compositions can be aqueous or nonaqueous sterile solutions, suspensions or emulsions. Propylene glycol, vegetable oils and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate, can be used as the solvent or vehicle. The compositions can also contain adjuvants, emulsifiers or dispersants.","Dosage levels of the order of from between about 0.01 mg and about 140 mg per kilogram of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above-indicated conditions (between about 0.05 mg and about 7 g per subject per day). In some embodiments, the dosage administered to a patient is between about 0.01 mg\/kg to about 100 mg\/kg of the subject's body weight. In some embodiments, the dosage administered to a patient is between about 0.01 mg\/kg to about 15 mg\/kg of the subject's body weight. In some embodiments, the dosage administered to a patient is between about 0.1 mg\/kg and about 15 mg\/kg of the subject's body weight. In some embodiments, the dosage administered to a patient is between about 0.1 mg\/kg and about 20 mg\/kg of the subject's body weight. In some embodiments, the dosage administered is between about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 5 mg\/kg or about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg of the subject's body weight. In some embodiments, the dosage administered is between about 1 mg\/kg to about 15 mg\/kg of the subject's body weight. In some embodiments, the dosage administered is between about 1 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg of the subject's body weight. The amount of conjugate that can be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form varies depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Dosage unit forms can generally contain from between about 0.01 mg and about 100 mg; between about 0.01 mg and about 75 mg; or between about 0.01 mg and about 50 mg; or between about 0.01 mg and about 25 mg; of a conjugate.","For intravenous administration, the dosage levels can comprise from about 0.01 to about 200 mg of a conjugate per kg of the animal's body weight. In one aspect, the composition can include from about 1 to about 100 mg of a conjugate per kg of the animal's body weight. In another aspect, the amount administered will be in the range from about 0.1 to about 25 mg\/kg of body weight of a compound.","In some embodiments, the conjugates can be administered are as follows. The conjugates can be given daily for about 5 days either as an i.v., bolus each day for about 5 days, or as a continuous infusion for about 5 days.","Alternatively, the conjugates can be administered once a week for six weeks or longer. As another alternative, the conjugates can be administered once every two or three weeks. Bolus doses are given in about 50 to about 400 ml of normal saline to which about 5 to about 10 ml of human serum albumin can be added. Continuous infusions are given in about 250 to about 500 ml of normal saline, to which about 25 to about 50 ml of human serum albumin can be added, per 24 hour period.","In some embodiments about one to about four weeks after treatment, the patient can receive a second course of treatment. Specific clinical protocols with regard to route of administration, excipients, diluents, dosages, and times can be determined by the skilled artisan as the clinical situation warrants.","It is understood that the specific dose level for a particular subject depends upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific conjugate, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion, combination with other active agents, and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.","For administration to non-human animals, the conjugates can also be added to the animal feed or drinking water. It can be convenient to formulate the animal feed and drinking water so that the animal takes in a therapeutically appropriate quantity of the conjugates along with its diet. It can also be convenient to present the conjugates as a premix for addition to the feed or drinking water.","The conjugates can also be administered to a subject in combination with other therapeutic compounds to increase the overall therapeutic effect. The use of multiple compounds to treat an indication can increase the beneficial effects while reducing the presence of side effects. In some embodiment the conjugates are used in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,303,749.
