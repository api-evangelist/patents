{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) of the earlier filing date of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/057,446 filed on May 30, 2008, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. DE-FC07-07ID14779 between the U.S. Department of Energy and Westinghouse Electric Company.","The invention relates generally to a flywheel for use in a pump, and in particular to a high inertia flywheel using a number of high density segments for use in a nuclear reactor coolant pump.","Flywheels are used in centrifugal pumps to mechanically store potential energy during operation of the pump, which energy may be utilized to maintain rotation of the pump in the event of loss of motive power. In nuclear reactors, this technology helps to maintain coolant circulation through the reactor core.","Exemplary flywheels for use in reactor coolant pumps are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,886,430 and 5,165,305, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein.","A need, however, exists for an improved reactor coolant pump flywheel.","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the invention provides a flywheel for a pump, and in particular a flywheel having a number of high density segments for use in a nuclear reactor coolant pump.","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the flywheel includes an inner member and an outer member. A number of high density segments are provided between the inner member and the outer member. The high density segments may be formed from a tungsten based alloy. A preselected gap is provided between each of the number of high density segments. The gap accommodates thermal expansion of each of the number of segments and resists any hoop stress effect or keystoning of the segments. A number of upper pins and a number of lower pins are provided at an inner diameter of the segments in order to couple the number of segments to the inner member. An interference fit may be provided between the inner member, the segments and the outer member. A key, spline or interference fit is provided between the inner member and the rotatably operable shaft in order to couple the flywheel to the shaft. In combination with the pins and the coupling of the inner member to the rotatable operable shaft, the gap provides radial loading on the segments and gives the stability desired to resist motion which could show up as a balance change.","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the flywheel includes an upper end cap member, a lower end cap member and a shell member capping the upper and lower surfaces of the high density segments and at least a portion of the outer member. The cap members ensure that the high density segments and at least a portion of the outer member do not get immersed in a solvent. The cap members prevent corrosion of the high density segments and contamination of the coolant by the tungsten material of the high density segments. In addition, the cap members provide positive encapsulation of at least a portion of the outer member for an axial seismic or shock event without resorting to friction.","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a pair of flywheels is provided within the stator and casing of a nuclear reactor coolant pump, with one flywheel at each end of the pump in opposed relation to one another. The pump, according to one example of the invention, is for use in a pressurized water reactor nuclear power plant structured to generate at least 1000 MWe.","It is to be understood that the FIGS. and descriptions of the invention have been simplified to illustrate elements that are relevant for a clear understanding of the invention, while eliminating, for purposes of clarity, other elements that may be well known. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that, such as, for example, all of the components of the reactor coolant pumps other than as shown in the FIGS. have not been described in detail herein for the purpose of simplifying the specification of the patent application.","For purposes of the description hereinafter, the terms \u201cupper\u201d, \u201clower\u201d, \u201cvertical\u201d, \u201chorizontal\u201d, \u201caxial\u201d, \u201ctop\u201d, \u201cbottom\u201d, \u201caft\u201d, \u201cbehind\u201d, and derivatives thereof shall relate to the invention, as it is oriented in the drawing FIGS. However, it is to be understood that the invention may assume various alternative configurations except where expressly specified to the contrary. It is also to be understood that the specific elements illustrated in the FIGS. and described in the following specification are simply exemplary embodiments of the invention. Therefore, specific dimensions, orientations and other physical characteristics related to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered limiting.","As used herein, the term \u201cpin\u201d means any suitable fastening, connecting or tightening mechanism such as dowel pins, fasteners, rivets, other connecting elements and the like. As used herein, the statement that two or more parts are \u201ccoupled\u201d together means that the parts are joined together either directly or joined together indirectly through one or more intermediate parts.","The detailed description will be provided hereinbelow with reference to the attached drawings. In the drawings, like reference characters designate corresponding parts throughout the views.","Referring to , there is illustrated a reactor coolant pump generally designated by reference numeral  having a first or upper flywheel  and a second or lower flywheel  incorporated into a casing  and stator assembly  thereof. Pump  operates to circulate coolant fluid such as water. Pump casing  defines a suction nozzle  and a discharge nozzle . An impeller  is provided for centrifugally pumping the coolant fluid such that fluid is drawn through the suction nozzle , through an eye of the impeller , discharged through a diffuser  and out through the discharge nozzle .","Pump  further includes a motor  having a rotor assembly  mounted on a rotatably operable shaft  and the corresponding stator assembly . Rotor assembly  includes rotor can . Stator assembly  includes stator can , stator coils , stator shell , stator closure ring , stator main flange , stator vents , a stator lower flange , stator end turns  and stator cap . Pump  also includes an external heat exchanger  and stator cooling jacket  for removing heat generated within the pump .","Upper flywheel  is disposed proximate to the impeller end of the pump  coupled to shaft  within the pump casing . Lower flywheel  is disposed on the other end of shaft  in opposed relation to the upper flywheel  coupled to the shaft  within the pump stator assembly . Disposed on an upper side and a lower side of lower flywheel  are an upper thrust bearing  and a lower thrust bearing .","Flywheels  and  are constructed in a similar manner. Lower flywheel , however, has a different profile as can be seen by comparing . The description provided for the upper flywheel  is equally applicable to the lower flywheel  and the details of the lower flywheel  have been omitted for the purpose of simplifying the specification of the patent application since the lower flywheel  is similar in construction to the upper flywheel .","Flywheel  includes an inner member  and outer member  wherein the inner member  may be an inner tubular cylindrical member and the outer member  may be an outer tubular cylindrical member. A number of high density segments  are provided between the inner and outer members , . The high density segments  may be formed from a tungsten based alloy. Other high density materials, however, are suitable. A preselected gap  is provided between each of the number of high density segments . The gap  accommodates thermal expansion and Poisson's effect of each of the number of segments  and resists any hoop stress effect\/keystoning of the segments . The gap  in an embodiment is between about 0.010 to 0.050 inches (0.25 to 1.27 mm). An upper pin  and a lower pin  are provided at an inner diameter of the segments  at each gap  (see ). An interference or shrink fit may be provided between the inner member , segments  and the outer member . In particular, the outer member may be in an interference fit with at least one of the segments. A key  may be provided between the inner member  and the high density segments . In combination with the upper and lower pins , , key  and the coupling to the shaft , the gap  provides for only radial loading on the segments  and gives the stability needed to resist any motion which could show up as a balance change.","As can be seen in , the flywheel includes an upper cap member , a lower cap member , and an outer shell member  that cap the high density segments  and at least a portion of the outer member . Shell member  wraps around the outer member  and is attached to upper cap member  and lower cap member  by welding. The outer diameters of upper cap member  and lower cap member  have lips , , respectively, which curl around the ends of the outer member . The purpose of the lips is to provide support for the shell member  should differential thermal expansion occur between the upper and lower cap members ,  and the outer member . This allows for the difference in displacement to be gradual along the length of the lips ,  so that the outer member  is not forced to span the discontinuity directly. The upper and lower cap members ,  are welded to inner member  with welds at their inner diameters. In the illustrated embodiment, the flywheel also includes a leak test plug  for performing a leak test to make sure the welds  are leak tight.","Nothing in the above description is meant to limit the invention to any specific materials, geometry, or orientation of elements. Many parts\/orientation substitutions are contemplated within the scope of the invention and will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The embodiments described herein were presented by way of example only and should not be used to limit the scope of the invention.","Although the invention has been described in terms of particular embodiments in an application, one of ordinary skill in the art, in light of the teachings herein, can generate additional embodiments and modifications without departing from the spirit of, or exceeding the scope of, the claimed invention. Accordingly, it is understood that the drawings and the descriptions herein are proffered only to facilitate comprehension of the invention and should not be construed to limit the scope thereof."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For the invention to be clearly understood and readily practiced, the invention will be described in conjunction with the following FIGS., wherein like reference characters designate the same or similar elements, which FIGS. are incorporated into and constitute a part of the specification, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
