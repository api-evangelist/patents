No. 61\/525,473, filed Aug. 19, 2011.","This invention relates to chemical compounds that inhibit cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) and are expected to have utility in raising HDL-C, lowering LDL-C, and in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis.","Atherosclerosis and its clinical consequences, including coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and peripheral vascular disease, represent a truly enormous burden to the health care systems of the industrialized world. In the United States alone, approximately 13 million patients have been diagnosed with CHD, and greater than one half million deaths are attributed to CHD each year. Further, this toll is expected to grow over the next quarter century as an epidemic in obesity and diabetes continues to grow.","It has long been recognized that in mammals, variations in circulating lipoprotein profiles correlate with the risk of atherosclerosis and CHD. The clinical success of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, especially the statins, in reducing coronary events is based on the reduction of circulating low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), levels of which correlate directly with an increased risk for atherosclerosis. More recently, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and atherosclerosis, leading to the conclusion that low serum HDL-C levels are associated with an increased risk for CHD.","Metabolic control of lipoprotein levels is a complex and dynamic process involving many factors. One important metabolic control in man is the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), a plasma glycoprotein that catalyzes the movement of cholesteryl esters from HDL to the apoB containing lipoproteins, especially VLDL (see Hesler, C. B., et. al. (1987) 262(5), 2275-2282)). Under physiological conditions, the net reaction is a heteroexchange in which CETP carries triglyceride to HDL from the apoB lipoprotein and transports cholesterol ester from HDL to the apoB lipoprotein.","In humans, CETP plays a role in reverse cholesterol transport, the process whereby cholesterol is returned to the liver from peripheral tissues. Intriguingly, many animals do not possess CETP, including animals that have high HDL levels and are known to be resistant to coronary heart disease, such as rodents (see Guyard-Dangremont, V., et. al., (1998) 14 vertebrate species. Relation to atherogenesis susceptibility, Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 120(3), 517-525). Numerous epidemiologic studies correlating the effects of natural variation in CETP activity with respect to coronary heart disease risk have been performed, including studies on a small number of known human null mutations (see Hirano, K.-I., Yamashita, S. and Matsuzawa, Y. (2000) 11(6), 589-596). These studies have clearly demonstrated an inverse correlation between plasma HDL-C concentration and CETP activity (see Inazu, A., et. al. (2000) 11(4), 389-396), leading to the hypothesis that pharmacologic inhibition of CETP lipid transfer activity may be beneficial to humans by increasing levels of HDL-C while lowering LDL-C.","Despite the significant therapeutic advance that statins such as simvastatin and atorvastatin represent, statins only achieve a risk reduction of approximately one-third in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis and ensuing atherosclerotic disease events. Currently, few pharmacologic therapies are available that favorably raise circulating levels of HDL-C. Certain statins and some fibrates offer modest HDL-C gains. Niacin provides an effective therapy for raising HDL-C but suffers from patient compliance issues, due in part to side effects such as flushing. Drugs that inhibit CETP (CETP inhibitors) have been under development with the expectation that they will effectively raise HDL cholesterol levels and also reduce the incidence of atherosclerosis in patients. Torcetrapib was the first drug that was tested in a long-term outcomes clinical trial. The clinical trial of torcetrapib was terminated early due to a higher incidence of mortality in patients to whom torcetrapib and atorvastatin were administered concomitantly compared with patients who were treated with atorvastatin alone. The cause of the increased mortality is not completely understood, but it is not believed to be associated with the CETP inhibiting effects of the drug.","Two other drug candidates, dalcetrapib and anacetrapib, are currently being tested in Phase III clinical trials, including large scale outcomes trials. Data from the recently completed DEFINE Phase III trial of anacetrapib are promising. Patients who were being treated with anacetrapib along with baseline statin therapy showed an increase of HDL-C of 138% and a decrease of LDL-C of 40% compared with patients who were treated with just a statin. See: 2010: 363: 2406-15. The data in the DEFINE trial were sufficient to indicate that an increase in mortality for patients treated with anacetrapib is unlikely. Additional drug candidates are still being sought that may have properties that are advantageous compared with the CETP inhibitors that have so far been studied or are currently being studied. Such properties may include, for example, higher potency, reduced off-target activity, better pharmacodynamics, higher bioavailability, or a reduced food effect compared with many of the highly lipophilic compounds that have so far been studied. \u201cFood effect\u201d refers to the variability in exposure to the active drug that occurs depending on when the patient had last eaten, whether or not the drug is administered with food, and the fat content of the food.","The compound having Formula Ia, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound, is a potent CETP inhibitor, having the utilities described hereinafter:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"41.15mm","wi":"57.15mm","file":"US09126976-20150908-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In Formula Ia, Ris \u2014C-Calkyl which is optionally substituted with 1-5 F or Cl;","Ris (a) phenyl;

According to one widely used definition, a patient having metabolic syndrome is characterized as having three or more symptoms selected from the following group of five symptoms: (1) abdominal obesity; (2) hypertriglyceridemia; (3) low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL); (4) high blood pressure; and (5) elevated fasting glucose, which may be in the range characteristic of Type 2 diabetes if the patient is also diabetic. Each of these symptoms is defined clinically in the recently released Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III, or ATP III), National Institutes of Health, 2001, NIH Publication No. 01-3670. Patients with metabolic syndrome have an increased risk of developing the macrovascular and microvascular complications that are listed above, including atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. The combinations described above may ameliorate more than one symptom of metabolic syndrome concurrently (e.g. two symptoms, three symptoms, four symptoms, or all five of the symptoms).","Protocol: Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) for CETP Activity","First, low density lipoprotein (LDL) (Meridian) was biotinylated by incubating LDL with biotin for 1 hour on ice, after which it was dialyzed to remove free biotin. Then compounds at varying concentrations were incubated with 15 nM CETP (reagent production group, In Vitro Pharmacology, MRL Rahway) and 50 ug\/ml of the biotinylated LDL in 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. The reaction was started by adding 3H-cholesterol ester high density lipoprotein (HDL) (American Radiochemicals Corp) at a concentration of \u02dc0.6 nM. The reaction proceeded for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C., after which time it was quenched by the addition of 12% acetic acid. PVT streptavadin-coated scintillation proximity beads, which had been brought to room temperature, were then added at a concentration of 4 mg\/ml. The assay was then mixed and counted after one half hour in a Microbeta plate reader.","In Vitro Radioactive Assays of CETP-Catalyzed CE and TG Transfer (RTA Assay)","Reagents and sources are: [3H] cholesteryl oleate (GE #TRK.886), [3H] Triolein (Perkin-Elmer NET-431), Butylated hydroxyl toluene (Aldrich, #D4740-4), DOPC (Sigma, # P6354), Sodium Bromide (Fisher scientific #S255-500), PEG 8000 (Fisher, #BP233-1), and human HDL (Intracel Corp #RP-036).","An in vitro assay for determining IC's to identify compounds that inhibit CETP transfer activity is performed based on a modification of a published method (Morton and Zilversmit, (1981) A plasma inhibitor of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester transfer activities, J. Biol. Chem. 256(23), 11992-11995). The ability of inhibitors to alter CETP activity is performed using two different assays: one using recombinant CETP and one using an endogenous plasma source of CETP. Both assays measure the transfer of [3H] cholesteryl oleate or [3H] triolein from exogenous LDL to HDL.","Radiolabeled donor particles are generated by first combining 100 \u03bcl of 200 \u03bcM butylated hydroxyl toluene in CHCl, 216 \u03bcL of 21.57 mM DOPC in EtOH, and either 500 \u03bcCi [3H]-triolein (Perkin Elmer #NET-431) or 500 \u03bcCi [3H]-cholesteryl oleate (GE #TRK886) in a glass tube. Reagents are mixed, dried under nitrogen, and then resuspended in 2 mL of 50 mM Tris, 27 \u03bcM EDTA at pH 7.4. After a brief vortex, the solution is sonicated until clear and mixed with 20 mL of fresh human serum. The mixture is incubated overnight at 37\u00b0 C. The [3H] labeled LDL substrate is separated at 1.063 g\/ml density by sequential ultracentrifugal flotation in NaBr according to the method by (Havel, Eder et al. 1955; Chapman, Goldstein et al. 1981). Once isolated the particles are dialyzed 3\u00d7 in CETP buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Human HDL is purchased from Intracel and used as the acceptor particles.","Transfer assays are performed in a 96-well v-bottom polypropylene plate. For the RTA using recombinant CETP (2% RTA), an assay cocktail is prepared with the final concentrations 128 \u03bcg\/mL HDL, 20 nM rCETP, 2% human serum, and 1\u00d7CETP buffer. 1 \u03bcL of each test compound diluted in DMSO is added to 47 \u03bcL of assay cocktail per well and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. To initiate the transfer reaction, 2 \u03bcL radiolabeled LDL is added. After an additional 60 min of incubation at 37\u00b0 C., the transfer action is terminated by precipitation of LDL with an equal volume of 20% W\/V PEG 8000. The plates are centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. A 40 \u03bcL aliquot of the HDL-containing supernatant is transferred to a Packard Optiplate\u2122 with 200 \u03bcL of MicroScint\u2122 20. After mixing, plates are counted by liquid scintillation. Counts present in the supernatant for blanks (wells containing only HDL acceptor, CETP buffer and DMSO) are subtracted from those containing test compounds and used to correct for non-specific transfer.","For the transfer assay using endogenous CETP from serum (95% RTA), the same procedure is used except that human serum is added such that a final concentration of serum of 95% of the total assay volume is achieved, yielding a concentration of approximately 15 nM endogenous CETP in the assay. This is then combined with HDL and CETP buffer and the reaction proceeds as above and is terminated as described.","Comparison of the counts of samples with inhibitors to an uninhibited (DMSO only) positive control yield a percent inhibition. A plot of percent inhibition vs. log of inhibitor concentration, fit to a Sigmoidal 4 parameter equation is used to calculate IC50.","The following schemes and examples are provided so that the invention will be more fully appreciated and understood. These examples are illustrative and are not to be construed as limiting the invention in any way. Starting materials are commercially available or are made using known procedures or as shown below. The examples may be synthesized using the general schemes provided below. The compounds listed as examples all have IC50 values that were measured using the RTA (2% human serum) or SPA assay between about 4 nM and 2760 nM. Examples 58-61 were assayed using the RTA in 95% human serum.","In accordance with General Scheme 1, the cross-coupling reaction between a 2-chloroquinoxaline derivative and the corresponding boronic acid agent provides a substituted quinoxaline derivative, which is then reduced to a 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline derivative. Regioselective reductive amination reactions of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines give alkylated 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline derivatives.
