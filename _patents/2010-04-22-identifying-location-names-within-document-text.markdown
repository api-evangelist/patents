title: Identifying location names within document text
abstract: Concepts and technologies are described herein for identifying location names within document text. Through an implementation of the concepts and technologies presented herein, functionality can be provided for identifying location names within articles, websites, travelogues, or other such documents. For instance, documents containing the names of cities, regions, countries, landmarks, or other locations may be associated with those locations. The location names may be unambiguously identified even when the location names may also have common word meanings that are not location associated or when the location name may be associated with more than one location.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Identifying location names within documents can establish an association between the documents and the locations. For example, when information related to the location is sought, the associated document, or information from the document, may be provided. There is a rich body of documents that may provide information associated with a location. For example, travelogues are textual descriptions of a person's experience with a particular location. For instance, a person might travel to New York City and write a travelogue that describes their travel experience.","Travelogues are currently written and shared in a variety of different scenarios on the Internet. For instance, travelogues can be shared by way of World Wide Web (Web) sites, Web forums, Web logs (blogs), social networking sites, and in myriad other ways. A large number of such sites are currently available on the Internet for writing and sharing travelogues. This large number of disparate sites containing travelogues and similar documents often proves troublesome to users or automated search mechanisms attempting to identify locations within the documents in a precise and unambiguous fashion.","It is with respect to these and other considerations that the disclosure made herein is presented.","Concepts and technologies are described herein for identifying location names within document text. Through an implementation of the concepts and technologies presented herein, functionality can be provided for identifying location names within articles, websites, travelogues, or other such documents. For instance, documents containing the names of cities, regions, countries, landmarks, or other locations may be associated with those locations. The location names may be unambiguously identified even when the location names may also have common word meanings that are not location associated or when the location name may be associated with more than one location.","According to one aspect presented herein, a word or phrase may be identified as either a location name or a common word. This differentiation may be referred to here as location detection. Location detection can use prior knowledge of the probability of a word being a location name or else being a common word that is not location associated. These probabilities may be collected from a corpus of many documents or articles.","According to another aspect presented herein, a location name that may be associated with several geographic locations may be disambiguated to only the intended location instance. This disambiguation may be referred to here as location recognition. Location recognition may predict the intended location instance of a location name using hints from other location names occurring within the same document.","According to yet another aspect presented herein, results from location recognition may be used to validate results from location detection. For example, if several location names are found near a word W within a document, it is more likely that the word W is a location name than a common word. The two operations of location detection and location recognition may be coupled with one another to extract or identify location names from textual content.","It should be appreciated that the above-described subject matter might also be implemented as a computer-controlled apparatus, a computer process, a computing system, or as an article of manufacture such as a computer-readable storage medium. These and various other features will be apparent from a reading of the following Detailed Description and a review of the associated drawings.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended that this Summary be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Furthermore, the claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in any part of this disclosure.","The following detailed description is directed to technologies for identifying location names within document text. The technology presented herein can support geographical term search related to location and travel information with improved efficacy in comparison to tradition keyword searches. The focus on location oriented documents can support services while a keyword search on such documents may fail at certain location oriented searches. Traditional keyword searches generally attach no special meaning to location words and therefore may miss cues, clues, and other indicators of implied informational content. For example, when searching for Central Park in New York, one can search for \u201cNew York\u201d and \u201cCentral Park.\u201d However, if a document about Central Park does not mention New York or only does for a small number of terms, then that document may have a low relevance to the query for \u201cNew York\u201d and \u201cCentral Park\u201d while using a traditional keyword based search engine. In contrast, the technology presented herein can identify the term \u201cCentral Park\u201d as being a park in New York thereby increasing the relevance of the document to the search even when the document does not explicitly mention New York.","Another example of a weakness in traditional keyword based searching occurs when a query term has strong ambiguity as both a geographical term and a common term. One such term is \u201cmobile\u201d being a location name for city in Alabama and also related to an ability to move or relating to wireless communications. Due to the additional common word, or non-geographical meanings, a traditional keyword based search engine will generally return extra irrelevant results. These extra results may be associated with the non-location senses of the term.","Yet another example of a weakness in traditional keyword based searching is encountered when integrating travel, or location, related services to keyword based search engines. For example, it may be an added difficulty for a traditional keyword based search engine to recommend popular photos related to a location name supplied by a user. However, the technology presented herein supports attaching a geographical meaning to a location word which can then relate photos, or other resources, to that geographical meaning. For example, if user queries photos for Central Park, photos from the Central Park in New York City may be automatically associated in response.","While the subject matter described herein is presented in the general context of program modules that execute in conjunction with the execution of an operating system and application programs on a computer system, those skilled in the art will recognize that other implementations may be performed in combination with other types of program modules. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, components, data structures, and other types of structures that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the subject matter described herein may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like.","In the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments or examples. Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals represent like elements throughout the several figures, aspects of a computing system, computer-readable storage medium, and computer-implemented methodology for identifying location names within document text will be presented.","Referring now to , aspects of one operating environment for the various embodiments presented herein will be described. A location name identification module  can identify location names within one or more documents . The documents may be located on servers within a network . For example, the documents may be travel web sites, travel blogs, travelogues, or any other documents containing references to geographical locations. The location name identification module  may use a gazetteer  of location names to perform the location name identifications.","The identified location names may be used to construct a location name index . The location name index  may be used to search the documents  for location names. The location name index  may be searched by a location query . The location query  can identify which, if any, of the documents  contain, or relate to, a location name. For example, a subset of the documents  may contain references to Hawaii. This subset may be returned using a location query  for the location word \u201cHawaii\u201d against the location name index . The location query  may originate from a user, a search engine, any other software module, or any information retrieval mechanism.","The gazetteer  used by the location name identification module  may be considered a geographical directory or dictionary. There may be millions, or more, of location names in the gazetteer . Each location name within the gazetteer  may have one or more location senses. A sense for a term may be considered a possible meaning or context for the term. The location senses may be listed in a hierarchical fashion. For example, the location name \u201cStatue of Liberty\u201d may have three location senses in the gazetteer . The first location sense being \u201cStatue of Liberty,\u201d the second location sense being \u201cNew York\/Statue of Liberty,\u201d and the third second location sense being \u201cNew York\/New York\/Statue of Liberty.\u201d Similarly, the location name \u201cFlamingo\u201d may have three location senses in the gazetteer . The first location sense being \u201cFlamingo,\u201d the second location sense being \u201cFlorida\/Monroe\/Flamingo,\u201d and the third second location sense being \u201cFlorida\/Orange\/Flamingo.\u201d","Referring now to , a software architecture diagram showing aspects of software components utilized in various embodiments presented herein will be described. The location name identification module  can operate on one or more input documents , each denoted herein as D, to perform the interrelated tasks of location detection  and location recognition .","The task of location detection  can attempt to resolve the ambiguity between location senses of a term and non-location senses of the term, such as those associated with the term \u201cmobile\u201d as location name for a city in Alabama and a common word relating to being movable. Location detection  can employ the gazetteer  to find all possible location term candidates, as referred to herein as X, within document Dwhere i counts over documents and j counts over location terms within the documents. Where a term may be classified as either a location term, or not, without equivocation, the location detection  may be considered a binary classification problem. Such a problem may be approached using a binary support vector machine (SVM) model. An SVM can perform classification or regression using a set of supervised learning algorithms. For example, an SVM training algorithm may be taught using set of training examples where each example is associated with one of two categories. From this training, the SVM algorithm can build a model that predicts which of the two categories a newly encountered element belongs to.","The task of location recognition  can attempt to resolve the ambiguity between multiple location senses of a term, such as those associated with \u201cFlamingo,\u201d a city name in Orange County, Florida and also a city name in Monroe County, Florida. The location disambiguation performed by location recognition  may be considered a ranking problem and may be approached using a rank SVM model. A score propagation approach may be used to resolve the ambiguities of location names as discussed in further detail with respect to .","Location detection  can disambiguate between geographical and non-geographical ambiguities. Similarly, location recognition  can disambiguate between geographical and geographical ambiguities. It should be appreciated that a location name may simultaneously have geographical\/non-geographical ambiguity and also geographical\/geographical ambiguity. For example \u201cflamingo\u201d has geographical\/non-geographical ambiguity due to its non-location related sense relating to a type of bird. The term \u201cflamingo\u201d also has geographical\/geographical ambiguity due to multiple cities in the state of Florida and numerous location senses related to the city of Las Vegas, Nev.","Location detection  and location recognition  can interrelate in an iterative fashion. While location recognition  may be based on the results from location detection , location detection  can then be improved by results from the location recognition . For example, the presence of the location name \u201cAlabama\u201d or other location names related to Alabama or Mobile, Ala. within a document can increase the likelihood that the word \u201cmobile\u201d within the document is the location name of a city and not a reference to the ability to move. Thus, resolving the location recognition  can assist the disambiguation between location words and common words in location detection .","Applying location detection  and location recognition  to a set of documents, or a corpus, a search index may be generated. Index generation  can provide a unique location sense for each identified location name. A corresponding focus score may also be provided. For example, each location name in a given document may be assigned a focus score as a measure of the location name's relevance to the given document. An inversion table may be generated according to location senses by relevance score. Thus, index generation  can provide a search index to support location sense based search. For example, if the query relates to \u201cNew York\/New York\/Central Park,\u201d a travel note about the Central Park of New York, N.Y. may be returned from searching the index.","The location name identification module  can also leverage conditional term probabilities for location names. For example, the term \u201cmobile\u201d has a higher probability of being a location name when conditioned upon the presence of the term \u201cAlabama.\u201d The location name identification module  can also leverage popularity metrics from other information contexts. For example, location tags on photos within an online photo sharing system are significantly more numerous for \u201cParis, France\u201d than for \u201cParis, Ill.\u201d This statistical information can serve as a proxy for the likelihood that a document containing the term \u201cParis\u201d is related to France instead of being related to Illinois.","Yet another set of cues for location names within a text document includes grammatical unigrams and bigrams. A unigram involves a single word neighboring the term in question. For instance, \u201cleaving\u201d may be used as a prefix unigram to imply an increased likelihood of a location name. For example, in the text \u201c . . . when they were leaving Miami . . . ,\u201d the single term \u201cleaving\u201d is a prefix to the location name \u201cMiami.\u201d Similarly, \u201carea\u201d may be used as a postfix unigram to imply an increased likelihood of a location name. For example, in the text \u201c . . . found in the Seattle area . . . ,\u201d the single term \u201carea\u201d is a postfix to the location name \u201cSeattle.\u201d","A bigram involves a double word neighboring the term in question. For example, \u201carrive in\u201d may be a prefix bigram to a location word, such as in the text, \u201c . . . they will arrive in London this afternoon . . . .\u201d Similarly, \u201cfrom where\u201d may be a postfix bigram to a location word, such as in the text, \u201c . . . a great view of Seattle from where I was . . . .\u201d Lastly, a combined prefix and postfix bigram may split the bigram around the location name. For example, the combined bigram \u201cfrom . . . to\u201d may sandwich around a location name such as with, \u201c . . . flew from New York to the final destination . . . .\u201d","Referring now to , a data relationship diagram illustrates a location sense tree  according to various embodiments presented herein. The location name identification module  can organize observed terms (\u201cHawaii\u201d at tree nodes , , \u201cPuhimau Crater\u201d at tree node , and \u201cPearl Harbor\u201d at tree nodes , , ) along with hidden terms (root node , \u201cAlaska\u201d at tree node , \u201cTennessee\u201d at tree node , \u201cHonolulu\u201d at tree node , \u201cJuneau\u201d at tree node , and \u201cMeigs\u201d at tree node ) into a location sense tree . In this example, there are three location sense candidates for \u201cPearl Harbor\u201d as found within the gazetteer . The three location senses are \u201cHawaii\/Honolulu\/Pearl Harbor,\u201d \u201cAlaska\/Juneau\/Pearl Harbor,\u201d and \u201cTennessee\/Meigs\/Pearl Harbor.\u201d It may be quite difficult to identify the correct location sense referred to by \u201cPearl Habor\u201d using only the single term by itself. However, the additional observation of \u201cPuhimau Crater\u201d within the document relates to a location in Hawaii and thus implies a high likelihood to the \u201cHawaii\/Honolulu\u201d sense of Pearl Harbor.","The determined unique location sense of each observed location name and its relevance score from location detection  and location recognition  can imply the hidden location senses and their corresponding relevance scores. The location name identification module  can implement score propagation based disambiguation of location names. Location disambiguation can determine which location name is the intended context within a given document. Each location name can be assigned a unique location sense in a given document. Intuitively, the location name \u201cNew York\u201d may sound more like a geographic location than the location name \u201cFlamingo.\u201d","In order to measure these ambiguities quantitatively and solve the location disambiguation task, a probability based method may be used. Pmay be used to represent the probability of a location name being an intended location. Suppose a location name X has k location senses given as X, . . . , X. Then P(X) gives the probability of location X having the location sense X. If location X only has one location sense X, then P(X) will be 1.","Once Pis determined for each location name and Pis determined for each location sense, a score propagation algorithm may perform the location disambiguation for a given document. Suppose location names X, . . . , Xhave been extracted from a given document and the duplicate location names have been removed so that the location names are unique from each other in the sequence. Some location names have only one location sense but others may have multiply location senses. These location senses may be used to construct the location sense tree . The location sense tree  has a root node  and each node in the tree is a location sense. Each location sense has a unique location name but each location name may have many location senses. Where a location sense's location name is contained directly in the document, the location sense is said to be an observed location sense. A hidden location sense represents a location name that is not directly contained within the document. For example, given a location name sequence \u201cPearl Harbor, Puhimau Crater, Hawaii,\u201d the generated location sense sequence may be","Hawaii\/Honolulu\/Pearl Harbor;","Alaska\/Juneau\/Pearl Harbor;","Tennessee\/Meigs\/Pearl Harbor;","Hawaii\/Hawaii\/Puhimau Crater;","Hawaii, and","Hawaii\/Hawaii.","These location senses may be used to construct the location sense tree .","The observed location senses are illustrated in solid lines while the hidden location senses are illustrated in dotted lines. For example, the location sense Hawaii\/Honolulu\/Pearl Harbor is an observed location sense while the location sense Hawaii\/Honolulu is a hidden location sense.","Each observed location sense has an initial score and can propagate its initial score to other location senses. Its initial score is proportional to its P, its P, and the number of times it appears in the given document according to the following expression:\n\n()=()()()\n\nwhere P(X) is the probability of Xbeing a location according to the corpus, P(X) is the probability of Xhaving location sense Xaccording to the corpus, and n(X|D) is the number of times that Xappears within the document D.\n","After such initialization, the scores may be propagated through the location sense tree  such that the propagated score will decay as it travels along the branches of the tree. When a location sense propagates its score, closer location senses can receive more of the propagated score than further location senses. After the propagation process, the unique location sense of a location name in the given document can be the location sense of the location name that gets the highest score. In the illustrated example, the score propagation process can result in the location name Pearl Harbor having the unique location sense Hawaii\/Hawaii\/Pearl Harbor. The score propagation algorithm can be described formally using the following expressions:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mi":"S","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["X","t","k"]},"mo":"|","msub":{"mi":["D","i"]}}}},{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["P","sense"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msubsup":{"mi":["X","t","k"]}}},{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"s","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["X","p","q"]},"mo":"|","msub":{"mi":["D","i"]}}}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"msup":[{"mi":"p","mrow":{"mi":"d","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msubsup":[{"mi":["X","t","k"]},{"mi":["x","p","q"]}],"mo":","}}}},{"mover":{"mi":"X","mo":"^"},"mi":"k"}],"mstyle":{"mtext":{}}}}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"mrow":{"munder":{"mrow":{"mi":["arg","max"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mi":"i"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mrow":{"mi":"S","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["X","i","k"]},"mo":"|","msub":{"mi":["D","i"]}}}},"mstyle":{"mtext":{}},"msubsup":{"mi":["X","t","k"]}},"mo":"\u2208","msub":{"mi":["A","i"]}}],"mo":"="}],"mo":"="},{"msubsup":{"mi":["X","p","q"]},"mo":"\u2208","msub":{"mi":["A","i"]}}],"mo":","}}},"br":{},"sub":["i ","i"]},"This score propagation algorithm can be implemented efficiently. Heuristic rules can be easily integrated into the propagation algorithm. The rules can be used to adjust Pand Pin a given document. Since Pand Pare computed from the corpus, they can represent the historical knowledge about the location names and location senses. Within a given document, some heuristic rules can be used to adjust Pand P. For example, if the pattern \u201cthe city of X\u201d appears in the document, then P(X) can be set to one with respect to the given document. If the pattern \u201cCentral Park, New York, N.Y.\u201d appears in the document whereby the sense of Central Park is clear, then P(New York\/New York\/Central Park) can be set to one and other location senses of Central Park may be removed from the location sense tree .","An iterative approach may be applied for computing P. The conditional notation c(X|D) may be used to represent the confidence of location name X to be a real geographic location if it has location sense Xin document D.

The nearby location senses may be ancestral location senses or offspring location senses depending upon their relative positioning within the location sense tree . The value \u03c9 may be used to present a decay factor between generations within the tree.

The implementation is a matter of choice dependent on the performance and other requirements of the computing system. Accordingly, the logical operations described herein are referred to variously as states operations, structural devices, acts, or modules. These operations, structural devices, acts and modules may be implemented in software, in firmware, in special purpose digital logic, and any combination thereof. It should also be appreciated that more or fewer operations may be performed than shown in the figures and described herein. These operations may also be performed in a different order than those described herein.","The routine  begins at operation , where the location name identification module  can receive a location gazetteer . The gazetteer  may be considered a geographical directory or dictionary. Each location name within the gazetteer  may have one or more location senses. A sense for a term may be considered a possible meaning or context for the term. The location senses may be listed in a hierarchical fashion.","At operation , the location name identification module  can receive a corpus of documents. The corpus, or body, of documents can define a search space for establishing a search index over. Statistics may be computed from the corpus. These statistics can include location names and location senses within the documents of the corpus. The location names and location senses may be determined from the location gazetteer  received at operation .","At operation , the location name identification module  can receive a set of annotated documents. The annotated documents may be used for training the detection classifier and\/or the recognition model. The annotations may have been manually applied as labels of the location sense for each possible location word in each of the annotated documents.","At operation , the location name identification module  can extract features. Feature extraction may be performed using a variety of techniques discussed herein. For example, feature extraction may leverage bigram statistics computed from the annotated documents, location prior statistics and location sense prior statistics computed from documents.","Feature extraction may also leverage popularity metrics from other information contexts. For example, location tags on photos within an online photo sharing system are significantly more numerous for \u201cParis, France\u201d than for \u201cParis, Ill.\u201d This statistical information can serve as a proxy for the likelihood that a document containing the term \u201cParis\u201d is related to France instead of being related to Illinois. Thus, the number of photo entries for a location sense is in direct proportion to the location sense prior statistic.","Feature extraction may also leverage relevance scores propagated among location senses within a document. These relevance scores can establish how relevant the location sense or location name is to each document. The relevance score may be used to establish search indices for the document","Feature extraction may also leverage location sense hierarchies for the documents. Candidate locations names within a document may be related according to the possible location senses for each location name.

Using unigrams, bigrams, outside indicators, and various other heuristic clues, the accuracy of location detection  and location recognition  may be improved.","At operation , the location name identification module  can train a classifier for location name detection. Training of the location name detection classifier may be based on the annotated documents and the various extracted information. Training of the location name detection classifier may use a SVM learning algorithm.","At operation , the location name identification module  can train a model for location sense recognition.

Location detection  may be viewed as a binary detection problem wherein every term in the document is detected to be either a location name or a common word.","At operation , the location name identification module  can recognize location senses of the identified location names. Location recognition  can attempt to disambiguate multiple location sense from a location name. For example, the term \u201cVenice\u201d may be disambiguated between a city in Italy, California, or Florida. Location recognition  may be viewed as a ranking problem wherein each possible location sense for a given location word is ranked according to its likelihood for being the actual intended location sense of the document's author.","At operation , the location name identification module  can perform iterative detection and recognition. Because of the interdependence of location detection  and location recognition , the outcomes for each may be initialized to a specified value and then an iterative approach may be applied to achieve location detection  and location recognition  together with assistance from one another.","At operation , the location name identification module  can propagate relevance scores to generate a search index . Once the location name and location sense disambiguation is completed, relevance scores may be propagated among the remaining location senses within a document. These relevance scores can establish how relevant the location sense or location name is to the document. The relevance score may be used to establish search indices for the document.","At operation , the location name identification module  can support queries  to the search index . A location query  can identify which, if any, of the documents  contain, or relate to, a location name according to the search index .
