title: 3D social platform for sharing videos and webpages
abstract: A 3D social media platform is provided that allows users to share and experience a realistic social viewing experience with members of their social network. More specifically, a user shares a virtual 3D social venue with one or more members within their social network (e.g., Facebook friends) for the purpose of experiencing the content (e.g., movie, television, video game) as if each of the members were physically together in the venue. The user selects 2D media content, such as a web page, from an external and independent source (such as a web browser) to instantiate onto a virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface inside the virtual 3D social venue. The instantiated media content is displayed to the user and any invited friends within the context of the virtual three-dimensional space.

However, most computer experiences are not shared by multiple users, because they are isolated from each other in terms of geography, chronology, or with respect to the content that they accessed. Whatever activity that a computer user experiences is typically either asynchronous to other users (such as email, viewing and posting within a social network service, etc.), or synchronous within a closed environment (such as online gaming). Alternatively, the activity is entirely personal, such as viewing a movie, watching a sporting event via a web feed, or laughing at the latest YouTube\u2122 post.","The last few years have witnessed the rise of online social networks to connect people with friends, acquaintances, and enable them to share interests, pictures, videos, emails, and the like. A typical online social network provides a representation of each user (often a profile), his\/her social links, and a variety of services, including means for users to interact over the internet, such as e-mail and instant messaging. Social networking sites allow users to share ideas, activities, events, and interests within their individual networks.","However, such social networking sites are typically asynchronous. That is, users access network services on their schedule, and review activities, events and interests that have been previously posted by other users within their network. And, if they add content or dialogue to their network, other users will see such posting at a later time, when they access the network.","By contrast, online gaming services connect people in a synchronous fashion. That is, gamers go online and share a gaming experience with each other at the same time. However, the form of the shared content is predefined: the game that the users are playing. The online games are closed systems, where the content that is experienced by the users is predefined within the gaming environment. Moreover, the persons with whom the content is shared is also closed and restricted to members involved in the game.","In one aspect, the invention is characterized as a method for instantiating two-dimensional media content, such as web-browser media or streaming video, into a three-dimensional social media platform, and sharing it with others within the platform. The method provides a user with an interface comprising a virtual three-dimensional space. The virtual three-dimensional space includes a virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface. The user is able to select two-dimensional media content, such as a web page, from an external and independent source (such as a web browser) to instantiate onto the virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface. The web page is displayed to the user and any invited friends within the context of the virtual three-dimensional space.","To share the selected content, the method connects to one or more social networks, extrinsic to and independent of the social media platform, to which the user belongs. Each social network provides a social graph with a list of that user's friends. The method leverages the social graph to enable the user to invite friends from one or more social networks to share the two-dimensional media.","The method may be further characterized in that the user is provided with a position and orientation within the virtual three-dimensional space. The web page is displayed to the user with a scale, yaw and pitch consistent with relative differences between the user's position and orientation and the position and orientation of the viewing surface.","The user may also zoom, rotate, and navigate to a selected position and orientation within the virtual three-dimensional space. As the navigation occurs, the display of the virtual three-dimensional space is continually updated to provide the user with a field of view consistent with the existing position and orientation of the user within the virtual three-dimensional space. At any time, if any portion of the virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface is still within the field of view of the user, then that portion of the instantiated web page continues to be displayed to the user.","Although the two-dimensional content is instantiated into the three-dimensional platform, and transformed consistent with that three-dimensional context, the ability to interact with that two-dimensional content from within the three-dimensional space is maintained, provided that screen, window, or other viewing surface is still within the field of view of the user. If the instantiated two-dimensional content is a web page with a text field or link, the user can type into the text field or select the link from within the virtual three-dimensional space.","The method may be further characterized in that each user is given a three-dimensional avatar to represent the user in and navigate about the virtual three-dimensional space, and the three-dimensional avatar is displayed to others within the context of the virtual-three dimensional space. The user's social graph may also be accessed to import the user's profile picture, and superimpose it on the user's avatar. Each avatar is also operable to be animated with arm and leg movements and emotional expressions. The method can access the user's social graph from a social network to which the user belongs, import the user's profile picture from the social network, and superimpose the profile picture on the avatar.","The method contemplates that admitted users will be able to communicate with each other. The method may be further characterized in that user communications are initiated through the extrinsic social networks and detected by the social media platform, and visual overlays (e.g., streams of light) are provided within the virtual three-dimensional space to represent the detected communications between users.","The method may be further characterized in that the virtual three-dimensional space is a virtual three-dimensional representation of a stadium, coliseum, arena, stage, theater, or other large physical structure providing a seating area for clustering an audience of hundreds of people in proximity to each other. Preferably, multiple additional two-dimensional viewing surfaces are provided within the virtual three-dimensional space to display clickable advertisements. If one of the clickable advertisements is selected, a web browser window is launched with a point-of-sale web page outside the user interface, without pausing the experience within the user interface.","In another aspect, the invention is characterized as a method for sharing two-dimensional media content with users from one or more social networks. The method provides a virtual social venue comprising a virtual three-dimensional space. A user is able to invite contacts imported via the user's social graph from one or more social networks to participate in the virtual social venue. The method admits willing contacts into the virtual social venue, and provides a virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface within the context of the virtual three-dimensional space. The user (typically the host) selects two-dimensional media content to share with the contacts, and the content is instantiated onto the virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface so that it can be displayed to each of the admitted contacts within the context of the virtual three-dimensional space.","The method may be further characterized in that each admitted user has a client processing device. Admitted users\/contacts are provided with client applications to experience the media content on their client processing devices in the context of the virtual social venue. The two-dimensional media content is then streamed directly from a third-party media content provider to the admitted users' client processing devices.","Users may also be provided with one or more tools to express animated emotional responses to the media content. When emotional responses are expressed, they are stored in time-association with the media content so that they can be replayed again later. When the media content is replayed, the virtual three-dimensional space is populated with the ghost avatars of users who previously viewed and emotionally reacted to the two-dimensional media content. Moreover, the ghost avatars' emotional responses are replayed in time-association with the two-dimensional media content.","The method may be further characterized as providing a browser plug-in operable to instantiate encapsulated streaming media content from an existing web portal of a third party streaming media content provider into the virtual social venue. When such a browser plug-in is selected, the encapsulated media content is streamed directly to each of the users participating in the virtual social venue. The method may also be characterized as enabling an HTML widget previously operating within an internet browser to be instantiated into the virtual social venue and displayed on the virtual representation of a screen, window, or other viewing surface.","The method may also be characterized as providing admitted users with a selection tool, such as a virtual laser pointer that provides a stream of light, to enable them to call attention of other users within the social venue to a particular portion of the social venue.","In a further aspect, the invention is characterized as a method for sharing a web page with users from one or more social networks. The method provides a virtual social venue comprising a virtual three-dimensional space, including a virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface. The method enables the invitation and admission of users from an extrinsic and independent social network to participate in the virtual social venue. After the host user selects a web page to share with the users, the method instantiates the selected web page onto the virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface, so that the instantiated web page is displayed to each of the admitted users within the context of the virtual three-dimensional space.","The method may be further characterized in that each admitted user is provided with a unique position and orientation within the virtual three-dimensional space. The web page is displayed to each admitted user with a scale, yaw and pitch consistent with differences between the user's unique position and orientation and a position and orientation of the virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface.","The method may be further characterized in that any one of the admitted users may be designated as a virtual disc jockey. The virtual disc jockey can interact with the instantiated web page from within the virtual three-dimensional space provided that screen, window, or other viewing surface is still within the field of view of the virtual disc jockey. If the instantiated web page has a text field or link, the virtual disc jockey can type into the text field or select the link from within the virtual three-dimensional space.","The method may be further characterized as enabling admitted users to zoom, rotate, and navigate to new positions and orientations within the virtual three-dimensional space. Meanwhile, the display of the virtual three-dimensional space is updated to each navigating user to provide the navigating user with a field of view consistent with the new position and orientation of the navigating user within the virtual three-dimensional space. If any portion of the virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface is still within the field of view of the navigating user, then the corresponding portion of the instantiated web page continues to be displayed to the navigating user.","In yet another aspect, the invention is characterized as a social media platform. The social media platform provides a virtual social venue comprising a three-dimensional graphics engine providing a virtual three-dimensional space. The social media platform also provides a virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface within the context of the virtual three-dimensional space. The social media platform has a data interface with a social network that enables invitation of users from the social network to participate in the virtual social venue. The social media platform also has a plug-in interface that enables a web page from a web browser to be instantiated onto the virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface, and preferably enables at least one of the users to interact with the instantiated web page from within the virtual three-dimensional space. Finally, the social media platform has a user interface that displays the web page to each admitted user within the context of the virtual three-dimensional space.","The social media platform of claim  may be further characterized in that the virtual three-dimensional space comprises a virtual three-dimensional representation of a stadium, coliseum, arena, stage, theater, or other large physical structure providing an area for an audience of people to sit or stand in proximity to each other. The three-dimensional graphics engine enables admitted users to navigate to user-selected positions and orientations within the virtual three-dimensional space, and updates the display of the virtual three-dimensional space to each admitted user to provide the user with a field of view consistent with the user's selected position and orientation within the virtual three-dimensional space. If any portion of the virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface is still within the field of view of the user, then that portion of the instantiated web page continues to be displayed to the user.","The present invention is directed at taking all of the experiences that are possible for a user on his\/her computer, whether browsing content, enjoying video, gaming, or obtaining information, and placing such experiences on a platform that integrates the experiences within the context of a social network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","100","101","102","101","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","100"]},"The virtual social venue  enables users to express emotional and\/or social responses to the media content they are experiencing, as well as to the activities going on in their virtual environment.

Further zooming would transform the video screen  into a non-rotated (fully orthogonal) full-screen view of the media content. Also, once the participant zooms into the screen, additional content may be displayed, such as content . Each participant can also zoom back out from a full-screen view, enabling the participant to select the relative amount of attention to distribute between the media content and the social environment.","Each participant can also enlarge their default field of view by zooming out far enough to see their own avatar and the surrounding environment. By zooming out this way, the participant can gain a bird's-eye view of the virtual social venue, and identify (and migrate to) areas that appear to be more lively and active than others.","To enhance the social experience, audio content streamed into the virtual social venue is mixed with ambient audio expressions (such as shouting, booing, clapping, or real voice expressions) from the participants. The audio content streamed into the virtual world may also be mixed with attenuated sounds from other media content being instantiated on nearby viewing surfaces. The audio is also preferably streamed to each participant in a 3-D, surround-sound format, with ambient sounds from surrounding sources being attenuated and delayed as a function of the distance between the user's avatar and the source of the sound. In one embodiment, zooming into a full-screen version of the video screen  has the concomitant effect of attenuating ambient sounds (until the ambient sounds are turned off) and making the media content relatively louder. Zooming out has the opposite effect, increasing the relative loudness of the ambient sounds. In other embodiments, the ambient sounds one hears are limited to certain channels or groups of friends.","Many different forms of media content may be instantiated into the virtual social venue . In one embodiment, a fully-interactive web page is instantiated on a viewing surface within the virtual social venue. Interactivity with the webpage, however, is preferably limited to a host who instantiates the web page or to a virtual disc jockey who is given control over the media content.

Once the video content  is instantiated into the virtual social venue , the media that is being played is not just viewed by the user that caused the instantiation. Rather, every participant that is within the virtual social venue , whether from the user's social network, or otherwise within the venue, has the instantiated video content  presented to them within the context of the venue, provided that the viewing screen is within that participant's field of view. Thus, the experience of observing the video content  is enjoyed by all members of the venue.","In addition, the selection of the monitor  onto which to instantiate a given media stream is customizable. That is, the video content  could have been displayed on the monitor , or even one of the remote monitors . The choice of location for displaying externally instantiated video content  is definable by either the user who selected the content, or by individual users within the virtual social venue .","Additionally, each user within the venue  may select one or more viewing spaces for the instantiated video content. For example, a first user may wish to view the video content  on the jumbotron . A second user may wish to view the content on the monitor . Mechanisms are provided to allow users to move content between display areas, as well as to queue instantiated content for later viewing. Additionally, different users in a venue may be given different rolls: owner, administrator, moderator, spectators and guests. Each of these user types have different privileges and controls available to them for instantiating or moving content from external sources.","In another embodiment, the browser plugin icon  may be used by an owner, administrator or moderator, to queue up content for display in a later venue.

Also, the audio expressions of surrounding participating users are reproduced for each user in a surround-sound scheme correlated and consistent with the relative spatial arrangement of the participating user with surrounding participating users. When a user's avatar turns around within the virtual social venue, the surround-sound is rotated to that user in a manner correlated and consistent with the relative rotation of the participating user's avatar within the virtual social venue. Also, consistent with the three-dimensional environment, the audio expressions received by any given recipient is attenuated and delayed as a function of the virtual distance between the recipient's avatar and the producer's avatar.","In yet another embodiment, detected motion gestures \u2014such as clapping and arm-waving\u2014are imported from participating users' motion detecting apparatuses (e.g., Microsoft's Kinect\u2122 device or another third party gross motion, gesture, and\/or emotion detecting device) and imitated through animations of their avatars. In this embodiment, each user who enters the virtual social venue  is provided with a three-dimensional animated avatar that can render any of a plurality of emotional expressions with corresponding virtual physical gestures (e.g., jumping, arm-waving, cheering, booing, clapping).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":["1910","1910","1910","1800","1800","1965","1962","1962","1962","1910","1962","1967","1962"]},"The social media platform  also populates a guest toolbar  with thumbnails  of the profile pictures of users who accept the invitation and are admitted into the virtual social venue .

At operation , the participant is prompted to invite one or more contacts from the participant's social graph to join in the combined social media platform. If any contacts accept the invitation, they become additional participants (operation ) and the process repeats. Social media events associated with the participants who joined in the MMOG can also be streamed into the social venue from their respective originating online social networks (operation ). These social media event streams may be displayed in real-time while the participants are interacting with the combined social media platform (operation ). In addition, the type and quantity of social media event streams received by an individual participant are user-configurable. The social media event streams may also be turned off at any time by each participant. Additionally, the social media events may be displayed on any display area within the combined social media platform. For example, the social media events may be displayed on a display screen or monitor, wall, billboard, blimp, rocket, airplane, or fireworks display within the combined social media platform, to name a few.

They can clap, cheer, stand up, yell, boo, rate the video, etc. The social media platform  records emotive activity of users over time during presentation of content played within a social venue and stores their emotive activity in an emot database . The emotive activity correlates in time with the video content that is presented within the social venue. Since the emotive activity is recorded in sync with the content that is experienced, it is possible to reconstruct emotive activity of a user.","With this in mind, ghost avatars may exist within social venues . More specifically, if content has been presented in a social venue , and users have had emotive activity during presentation of the content, then the emotive activity is stored in the emot database . If at a later time, the content is presented to other users, then ghost avatars from the previous viewing can appear within the social venue , and their emotive activity can be presented alongside activity expressed by live users. Thus, the experience of viewing content can be cumulatively enhanced as more and more users view the content and their emotive activity is recorded. For example, a user might be viewing content with only a few other live users. However, the social venue  may have been previously viewed by thousands of others. In one embodiment, the cumulative emotive activity of all users that have viewed the content may be replayed along with the content, thus enhancing the overall viewing experience of the live users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0104"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":["2300","2300","2310","2300","2330","2300","2340"]},"The social media platform  leverages the social relational data and communications facilities of extrinsic social networks to populate the virtual social venue and\u2014in effect\u2014to bring it to life. The social media platform  includes one or more data interfaces  to extrinsic social networks that use application programming interfaces associated with those social networks to authenticate users and pass and retrieve information (such as text communications and friend lists) to and from those social networks. Communications between admitted users, such as user texts or chats , is preferably handled by the one or more extrinsic social networks and then represented in the virtual social venue in some form (such as text bubbles or streams of light).","The social media platform  populates the virtual social venue with users invited and admitted from one or more social networks . The social media platform  includes a user list  to track all of the users admitted to the social venue. The social media platform  also continually tracks user spatial data , such as the position and orientation of each user's avatar, as various users navigate and migrate about the venue social venue.","The social media platform  also leverages media content sourced from extrinsic media providers. The social media platform  includes a browser plug-in interface  enabling an interactive browser web page  to be instantiated (with its interactive features maintained) onto a viewing surface within the three-dimensional environment provided by the virtual social venue. The social media platform  also includes a streaming media interface  enabling streaming media content  from a third party streaming media provider to be instantiated within the three-dimensional environment. The social media platform  also includes a widget interface  enabling a widget  to execute within the three-dimensional environment.","The social media platform  also includes a client user interface  for presenting the virtual social venue to a client and receiving and responding to user navigation and control . User navigation and controls  include commands related to the navigation of a user's avatar, selection of friends to invite to the virtual social venue, and emotional responses to the third party media content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0109"},"figref":"FIG. 24","b":["2400","2300","2300","2410","2300","2420","2300","2430"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0110"},"figref":"FIG. 25","b":["2500","2510","2520","2530","2532","2534","2536"]},"Functional block  provides the user with a representation, position and orientation within the virtual three-dimensional space. The representation of the user is typically in the form of an avatar. The avatar's position (e.g., a seat or standing location) may be automatically determined, selected and assigned by the host, or the user may be given the ability and privilege to navigate his\/her avatar to a user-selected position within the virtual three-dimensional space. The user is also provided with the ability to rotate the avatar or the avatar's head to a selected orientation within the virtual three-dimensional space. The user is provided with a field of view consistent with the selected position and orientation of the user's avatar (or other representation) within the virtual three-dimensional space.","Function block  drives the externally-sourced two-dimensional content directly from the third party provider to each user. The two-dimensional content is spatially transformed (preferably using rendering software installed on each user's machine) to fit the context of the virtual three-dimensional space. This includes transforming the two-dimensional content to a yaw and pitch consistent with the relative orientations and positions of each user and viewing surface. If any portion of the virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface is within a user's field of view, that portion of the instantiated two-dimensional media content will be displayed to that user.","Function block  maintains any ability to interact with the instantiated content within the three-dimensional environment. For example, if a web page with text fields and links is instantiated on the virtual screen, window, or other viewing surface, then the user is able to interact with the instantiated web page from within the virtual three-dimensional space.

This ability may be limited to a single host user or extended to multiple hosts or even to all users, until the social venue reaches its admittance capacity. Functional block  provides three-dimensional animated avatars to admitted users and populates the seating or standing area with the avatars.","Functional block  provides one or more screens, billboards, windows, or other viewing surfaces in the three-dimensional space on which to instantiate the extrinsically-sourced two-dimensional media. Functional block  bequeaths a user with disc-jockey privileges over typically just one of the screens, billboards, windows, or viewing surfaces. A user with disc-jockey privileges controls and selects the extrinsically-sourced two-dimensional media content to share with the audience on the viewing surface the disc jockey controls. The disc jockey can also interact with the instantiated media content from within the virtual three-dimensional space. Typically, other viewing surfaces will be occupied by advertisements related either to the content to be shown or to one or more users' consumer interests.","Functional block  spatially transforms the extrinsically-sourced media to fit the perspective of each user's avatar. As noted before, each avatar has a unique position and corresponding field of view from within the virtual social venue. Functional block  displays the extrinsically-sourced media while simultaneously displaying the avatars of neighboring participating users to each of the participating users. In other words, the virtual social venue and any instantiated media content is displayed to each avatar from that avatar's unique perspective and field of view. This includes transforming the instantiated media content to a yaw and pitch consistent with the relative orientations and positions of each user's avatar to the viewing surface.","Functional block  enables users to navigate about the three-dimensional space, and to zoom the viewing surface into full view, while adjusting the spatial display and three-dimensional transformations accordingly. Simply by turning the scroll wheel of a mouse, a user can zoom in from the default perspective that his\/her avatar would have in the virtual social venue to a view in which the instantiated media content is full-screen and orthogonal (no longer three-dimensionally transformed). By turning the scroll wheel of the mouse in the opposite direction, the user can zoom back out, all the way from a full-screen view back to the default perspective. In a preferred embodiment, the user can continue to zoom out from the default position, giving the user a view of not only the objects in front of the user's avatar, but also the user's avatar itself and the surrounding context. These tools enhance the user's control over and potential appreciation of the social experience in sharing the instantiated media content.","It will be understood by those skilled in the art that various embodiments are implemented on computer hardware, software, firmware, and combinations thereof.
