title: Systems and methods for managing insurance account documents
abstract: A Personal Health Application (PHA) management system stores templates that are used to generate customized PHA documents. The PHA management system receives a request for a PHA document, where the request includes information that describes a new insurance policy or modification of a policy that an insurance consumer is requesting, that indicates the state or other area in which the insurance consumer lives, that indicates the reason that the consumer is requesting the new policy or modification, and/or other information. The PHA management system generates a PHA document based on a stored template and the information included in the request, and the generated PHA document may be provided to the insurance consumer.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["An insurance consumer may obtain a number of different types of insurance from an insurance company, such as but not limited to life insurance, disability insurance, and critical illness insurance. When an insurance consumer attempts to obtain a policy from an insurance company, the insurance company may request information about the consumer, to determine whether the company should accept the risk involved in issuing the policy to the consumer. Depending upon the kind of policy and other factors, the insurance company may need medical information and\/or other information for the insurance consumer. To obtain this information, the insurance company may provide the consumer with a personal health application (PHA). A PHA is a form that includes a number of questions that direct the consumer to provide the relevant information (referred to as \u201cevidence of insurability (EOI)\u201d information) to the insurance company.","For an insurance company with operations in many different geographic regions, determining the format and contents of PHA documents can be very complex. In the United States, the activities of insurance companies are heavily regulated by the states, and many states have regulations that define the kinds of information that insurance companies are permitted to ask for in PHA documents. Further, these regulations are often different from state to state. Accordingly, an insurance company cannot simply use one PHA across many different states, but must maintain many different versions of PHA documents. This makes updating PHA documents and ensuring accuracy among many different documents difficult and time-consuming. Further, the use of group insurance plans (whereby insurance consumers obtain policies by way of a group plan via their employer or a membership organization) adds additional complexity to determining the contents of PHA documents. For example, the relationships between employers and insurance consumers, attributes of the group plans, and other factors may all affect how PHA documents should be formatted and the types of information an insurance company may ask for in PHA documents. Thus, technologies that simplify the management of PHA documents and improve the communication of EOI information between consumers and insurance companies would be advantageous.","A system for generating a PHA document may include a communication interface and at least one processor. The communication interface may be configured to receive a message from a computing device that indicates a request for a PHA document, wherein the request for the PHA document relates to a request by an insurance consumer for an insurance policy within a group insurance plan offered by an employer of the insurance consumer. The at least one processor may be configured to obtain such as: consumer data that indicates one or more attributes of the insurance consumer; employer data that that indicates one or more attributes of the employer of the insurance consumer; and jurisdiction data that identifies a jurisdiction whose legal requirements apply to the PHA document. The at least one processor may also be configured to obtain template data for generating the PHA document, wherein the template data includes: information that indicates a plurality of questions that solicit EOI information; a first conditional expression that indicates whether a first question from the plurality of questions should be included in the PHA document based on at least one of the consumer data, the employer data, and the jurisdiction data; and a second conditional expression that indicates that contents of a section of the PHA document should be determined based on at least one of the consumer data, the employer data, and the jurisdiction data. The at least one processor may also be configured to generate the PHA document based on the template data, the insurance consumer data, the employer data, and the jurisdiction data. The communication interface may further be configured to transmit the PHA document to the computing device.","A computer-implemented method for generating a PHA document may include receiving, via a communication interface, a message from a computing device that indicates a request for a PHA document related to an insurance policy. The method may further include at least one processor obtaining template data for generating the PHA document, wherein the template data includes: information that indicates a plurality of questions that solicit EOI information; a first conditional expression that indicates whether a first question from the plurality of questions should be included in the PHA document based on one or more of: consumer data that indicates one or more attributes of the insurance consumer; and jurisdiction data that identifies a jurisdiction whose legal requirements apply to the PHA document. The method may further include the at least one processor generating the PHA document based on the template data, wherein the generating the PHA document includes evaluating the first conditional expression. The method may further include transmitting, via the communication interface, the PHA document to the computing device.","A computer-readable medium having processor-executable instructions stored thereon which, when executed by at least one processor, will cause the at least one processor to perform a method for generating a PHA document. The method may include receiving, via a communication interface, a message from a computing device that indicates a request for a PHA document related to an insurance policy. The method may also include obtaining template data for generating the PHA document, wherein the template data includes: information that indicates a plurality of questions that solicit evidence of insurability (EOI) information; and one or more conditional expressions for determining content to include in the PHA document. The method may also include the at least one processor generating the PHA document based on the template data, wherein the generating the PHA document includes evaluating the one or more conditional expressions. The method may also include transmitting, via the communication interface, the PHA document to the computing device.","Disclosed herein are processor-executable methods, computing systems, and related technologies for the management and communication of PHA documents and related information. A central PHA management system may manage and store templates that define the contents of PHA documents, as well as define the contents of a web interface that may be used by consumers to obtain and\/or modify insurance policies. The PHA management system may receive a request for a PHA document for obtaining EOI information from an insurance consumer, and generate a customized PHA document based on a template managed by the PHA management system. The contents of the PHA document may be customized according to the consumer's group insurance plan, the state whose law applies to the PHA document, attributes of the consumer, and\/or other factors. Additionally, an insurance consumer may request a new insurance policy or modification of an existing policy via the web interface. If EOI information is required from the consumer, the web interface will present questions to obtain the EOI information. The content and formatting of the questions presented to the consumer may also be based on the templates managed by the central PHA management system. Because PHA documents and the questions presented by the web interface are generated dynamically in response to specific requests based on the templates, insurance consumers receive PHA documents and EOI questions that are customized for their particular circumstances. Further, when an update to a PHA template is required, an administrative user may update the template in the central PHA management system, thereby ensuring that consumers receive the most up-to-date PHA documents and EOI questions, and also ensuring consistency across the PHA documents and web interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","140","150","100","120","160","170","130"]},"In the example architecture  of , the administrative client device , the PHA client device , the PHA management system , the medical underwriting system , the policy management system , and the web site system  are under the control of an insurance company, and the consumer client device  is operated by an insurance consumer. As will be described in further detail below, the PHA management system  generates customized PHA documents that may be provided to insurance consumers. According to this approach, an employee of the insurance company that operates the PHA client device  may receive a request from an insurance consumer to purchase an insurance policy or to modify an existing policy. The employee of the insurance company may then request an appropriate PHA from the PHA management system , and then provide the PHA to the insurance consumer. Also as will be described in further detail below, the web site system  provides a web site that may be accessed by an insurance consumer operating the consumer client device . Using this web site, the insurance consumer may provide EOI information to the insurance company, and the insurance company can indicate to the consumer whether a request for a new policy or modification has been approved.","The PHA management system  includes a PHA generation module , a PHA management database , and an interface module . The PHA generation module  receives input data and, using one or more PHA templates, generates customized PHA documents based on the input data. The PHA generation module  may also generate information that may be used by the web site system  for obtaining EOI data. The PHA management database  stores information such as the information that describes the PHA templates used by the PHA generation module , information that describes attributes of insurance consumers that have policies with the insurance company, and\/or other information. The PHA management database  may be spread across one or more computer-readable media, and may be or include one or more relational databases, hierarchical databases, object-oriented databases, one or more flat files, one or more spreadsheets, and\/or one or more structured files. The PHA management database  may be managed by one or more database management systems (not depicted), which may be based on a technology such as Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), a NoSQL database technology, and\/or any other appropriate technology. Communication between the PHA management system  and the other elements , , ,  in the example architecture  of  may be performed via the interface module  in the PHA management system . Communication between the interface module  and the other elements , , ,  in the example architecture  may be performed using technologies such as Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Representational State Transfer (REST), other appropriate Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) technology or web services technology, and\/or other appropriate technology.","The medical underwriting system  performs functionality such as determining, based on one or more input parameters, whether the insurance company should issue a policy to an insurance consumer. As will be described in further detail below, the medical underwriting system  may communicate with the web site system , and may make determinations regarding whether the insurance company should issue policies in the context of the web site provided by the web site system .","The policy management system  performs functionality such as storing and processing information that describes group insurance policies and the business entities that are parties to the policies. The policy management system  stores this information in a policy management database . The policy management database  may be spread across one or more computer-readable media, and may be or include one or more relational databases, hierarchical databases, object-oriented databases, one or more flat files, one or more spreadsheets, and\/or one or more structured files. As will be described in further detail below, the PHA management system  may use information from the policy management database  to generate PHA documents.","The administrative client device  is a computer or other type of data processing device or computing device, and may be operated by an employee of the insurance company to perform administrative functions for the PHA management system . The employee that operates the administrative client device  may be an employee in the legal or compliance department of the insurance company. The administrative client device  includes an administrative client module , which may be or include a web browser application, a specific-purpose client application, and\/or any other appropriate type of application. The administrative client device  may receive input from input devices (not depicted) that are included in or connected to the administrative client device . These input devices may include, for example, a keyboard, a mouse, or a touch screen, and provide data that indicates the input to the administrative client module . The administrative client module  in the administrative client device  may communicate with the interface module  in the PHA management system . As one example, an operator of the administrative client device  may provide input data to the administrative client module  that indicates that one of the PHA templates stored in the PHA management database  should be updated, or that a new PHA template should be added to the PHA management database . The administrative client module  may communicate this data to the interface module  in the PHA management system , which may then update the PHA management database  accordingly.","The PHA client device  is a computer or other type of data processing device or computing device, and may be operated by an employee of the insurance company to obtain PHA documents from the PHA management system  to provide to insurance consumers. The operator of the PHA client device  may be an employee in, for example, a field services or consumer operations department in the insurance company. The PHA client device  includes a PHA client module , which may be or include a web browser application, a specific-purpose client application, and\/or any other appropriate type of application. The PHA client device  may receive user input from input devices (not depicted) that are included in or connected to the PHA client device . These input devices may include, for example, a keyboard, a mouse, or a touch screen, which provide data that indicates the input to the PHA client module . The PHA client device  may also be connected to one or more printers, which may be used to print PHA documents obtained by the PHA client device. Further, the PHA client module  may communicate with the PHA generation module  in the PHA management system . As one example, an operator of the PHA client device  may receive a request from an insurance consumer for an insurance policy or a modification to an existing insurance policy. The operator of the PHA client device  may provide input data to the PHA client module  related to the request, such as an identifier of the insurance consumer, information describing the requested policy or modification, and\/or other information. The PHA client module  may then communicate this information to the PHA generation module  via the interface module  in the in the PHA management system . The PHA generation module  may generate a PHA document that corresponds to the request, and communicate the PHA document back to the PHA client module  via the interface module . The operator of the PHA client device  may then provide the generated PHA document to the insurance consumer. To provide the PHA document to the insurance consumer, the PHA client device  may print the PHA document via a printer connected to the PHA device, and then the operator of the PHA client device may mail or fax the PHA document to the insurance consumer. Alternatively, the operator of the PHA client device may email the PHA document to the insurance consumer.","As mentioned above, the web site system  provides a web site that may be accessed by an insurance consumer operating the consumer client device . The web site system  includes a HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server module  and a PHA web application module . The HTTP server module  may implement the HTTP protocol, and may communicate HyperText Markup Language (HTML) pages and related data from the web site to\/from the consumer client device  using HTTP. The web site system  may be connected to one or more private or public networks (such as the Internet), via which the web site system  communicates with devices such as the consumer client device . The web site system  may generate one or more web pages that request EOI information, may communicate the web pages to the consumer client device , and may receive responsive information from the consumer client device . The responsive information may include information that identifies the insurance consumer, information that describes the policy or modification that the consumer is requesting, EOI information, and\/or other information. The web site system  may then communicate this information to the medical underwriting system , which may determine whether the insurance company should issue the policy. In some instances, the medical underwriting system  may determine that more information is required, in order to make a final decision regarding whether the insurance company should issue the policy. The web site system  may then communicate one or more web pages to the consumer client device  that indicate that the insurance company has agreed to issue the policy or that additional information is needed.","The HTTP server module  in the web site system  may be, for example, an Apache HTTP server, a Sun-ONE Web Server, a Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) server, and\/or may be based on any other appropriate HTTP server technology. The web site system  may also include one or more additional components or modules (not depicted), such as one or more load balancers, firewall devices, routers, switches, and devices that handle power backup and data redundancy. The PHA web application module  may generate the web pages that make up the web site and that are communicated by the HTTP server module . The PHA web application module  may be implemented in and\/or based on a technology such as Active Server Pages (ASP), PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP), Python\/Zope, Ruby, Ruby on Rails (RoR), any server-side scripting language, and\/or any other appropriate technology.","The consumer client device  is, for example, a cellular phone, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, or any other appropriate computing device. The consumer client device  includes a web browser module , which may communicate data related to the web site to\/from the HTTP server module  and the PHA web application module  in the web site system . The web browser module  may include and\/or communicate with one or more sub-modules that perform functionality such as rendering HTML (including but not limited to HTML5), rendering raster and\/or vector graphics, executing JavaScript, and\/or rendering multimedia content. Alternatively or additionally, the web browser module  may implement Rich Internet Application (RIA) and\/or multimedia technologies such as Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight, and\/or other technologies. The web browser module  may implement RIA and\/or multimedia technologies using one or web browser plug-in modules (such as, for example, an Adobe Flash or Microsoft Silverlight plugin), and\/or using one or more sub-modules within the web browser module  itself. The web browser module  may display data on one or more display devices (not depicted) that are included in or connected to the consumer client device , such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) display or monitor. The consumer client device  may receive input from the user of the consumer client device  from input devices (not depicted) that are included in or connected to the consumer client device , such as a keyboard, a mouse, or a touch screen, and provide data that indicates the input to the web browser module .","The example architecture  of  may also include one or more wired and\/or wireless networks (not depicted), via which communications between the elements , , , , , ,  in the example architecture  may take place. The networks may be private or public networks, and\/or may include the Internet. In one example deployment scenario, the PHA management system , web site system , medical underwriting system , policy management system , administrative client device , and PHA client device  may communicate via one or more private networks that are under the control of the insurance company, while the consumer client device  may communicate with the web site system  via the Internet.","Each or any combination of the modules , , , , , ,  shown in  may be implemented as one or more software modules, one or more specific-purpose processor elements, or as combinations thereof. Suitable software modules include, by way of example, an executable program, a function, a method call, a procedure, a routine or sub-routine, one or more processor-executable instructions, an object, or a data structure. In addition or as an alternative to the features of these modules described above with reference to , these modules , , , , , ,  may perform functionality described herein with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","100","200","202","150","152","150","152"]},"After receiving this information, the PHA client module  determines whether, in order to decide whether to issue the policy or modification, the insurance company will require EOI information (step ). This determination may be based on attributes of the insurance consumer, attributes of a group plan offered by the consumer's employer or a membership organization of which the insurance consumer is a member, and\/or other information. For example, according to a group plan by which the insurance consumer has life insurance, a coverage amount threshold may exist, above which EOI is needed and below which EOI is not needed. In an instance where the insurance consumer requests an amount above this threshold, the PHA client module  would make a determination that EOI is needed.","The PHA client module  then transmits data to the PHA management system  that indicates a request for a PHA document (step ). This may include the PHA client module  transmitting one or more messages and\/or other information to the PHA generation module  in the PHA management system via the interface module . The request may include an identifier of the insurance consumer, information that indicates the reason that the consumer is requesting the new policy or modification (e.g., a status change or they are newly hired), and\/or other information.","After receiving the request for the PHA document, the PHA generation module  obtains input data that may be used for generating a PHA document (step ). The input data may include data that describes attributes of the consumer, data related to a group plan offered by the consumer's employer or membership organization and\/or data related to the consumer's employer or membership organization, and\/or other information. To data related to the consumer, the PHA generation module  may read in data from and\/or perform one or more searches in or queries to the PHA management database . The searches or queries may be based on the identifier of the insurance consumer, and\/or other information related to the insurance consumer. The consumer data may include one or more of: address information for the consumer (including the state in which the consumer resides); the consumer's name; a phone number for the consumer; gender of the consumer; information that indicates whether the consumer has a spouse; information related to a spouse of the consumer, such as name, address, and gender; information that indicates whether the consumer has children; information related to children of the consumer, such as their name(s); current insurance policy information for the consumer, the consumer's spouse, and\/or the consumer's children. The PHA generation module  may also obtain plan-related data from the policy management database  in the policy management system . The plan-related data may include data that describes the insurance consumer's employer or membership organization, a group insurance plan available through the employer or membership organization, and\/or other information specific to the employer or membership organization that indicates how PHA documents for the group plan should be generated. Alternatively or additionally, the input data may include an identifier of one or more legal jurisdictions (e.g., states, territories, municipalities, and\/or other governmental entities) whose legal requirements are relevant to determining the contents of the PHA.","The PHA generation module  then obtains data that describes a template that may be used in conjunction with the input data to generate the PHA document (step ). This may include reading data from the PHA management database  that describes a template. Alternatively or additionally, this may include performing a lookup and\/or issuing one or more queries to the PHA management database  to obtain template data. As one example, the PHA generation module  may perform a lookup in the PHA management database  based on the state in which the insurance consumer resides, to obtain a template that corresponds to the insurance consumer's state. Alternatively, the PHA generation module  may perform a lookup in the PHA management database  based on the employer or membership organization of the insurance consumer, to obtain a template that corresponds to a group plan associated with the employer or membership organization.","A template document used by the PHA generation module  may include, among other information, a list of questions that might be included in a finalized PHA document that is generated based on the template. The list may be exhaustive (i.e., may include the universe of all possible questions that may be included in the finalized PHA document), and the template document may include information that describes whether particular questions or groups of questions should be included in the finalized PHA document. This information may include one or more conditional expressions that indicate whether particular questions or groups of questions should be included in the finalized PHA document based on parameters such as attributes of the insurance consumer, attributes related to a group insurance plan to which the PHA document is related, attributes of the policy or modification that the insurance consumer has requested, the state or other jurisdiction whose legal requirements are applicable to the PHA document, and\/or other factors. For example, a conditional expression may indicate that questions related to children of the insurance consumer should be included only if the insurance consumer has children, and\/or if the policy requested by the insurance consumer relates to children of the insurance consumer. Similarly, a conditional expression may indicate that questions related to a spouse of the insurance consumer should be included only if the insurance consumer has a spouse, and\/or if the policy requested by the insurance consumer related to the spouse of the insurance consumer. As a further example, a template may include a first group of questions that apply to circumstances only where an insurance consumer is interested in obtaining disability insurance, and a second group of questions that apply only to circumstances where an insurance consumer is requesting a critical illness policy; in such an instance, the template may also include a conditional expression that indicates that the first group of questions should be included when the insurance consumer is interested in obtaining disability insurance, and a conditional expression that indicates that the second group of questions should be included when the insurance consumer is interested in obtaining disability insurance. As an another example, a template document may include a question related to an insurance consumer's Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) status; however, according to the law of some states, a PHA document may not include questions related to a consumer's HIV status, and so the template document may also include a conditional expression that indicates that, where the law of one of these states is applicable, the finalized PHA document should not include this question.","Further, a template document used by the PHA generation module  may include one or more conditional expressions that indicate that concepts identified in the template document should be described using particular words or phrases in the finalized PHD document. These variable language conditional expressions may be based on parameters such as attributes of the insurance consumer, attributes related to a group insurance plan to which the PHA document is related, attributes of the policy or modification that the insurance consumer has requested, the state or other jurisdiction whose legal requirements are applicable to the PHA document, and\/or other factors. As an example, a template document may include a variable language conditional expression that indicates that, for every occurrence of the concept of \u201cEmployee,\u201d a word such as \u201cAssociate,\u201d \u201cCast Member,\u201d or \u201cWorker\u201d should be used, and that the word that should be used is specific to an employer that has a group plan to which the PHA document is related. According to this example, a first employer may prefer \u201cWorker,\u201d while a second employer may prefer \u201cAssociate.\u201d Accordingly, a PHA document generated for a policy according to the first employer's plan may include text such as \u201cWorker Name\u201d and \u201cWorker Address,\u201d while the corresponding text in a PHA document generated for a policy according to the second employer's plan may be \u201cAssociate Name\u201d and \u201cAssociate Address.\u201d As an additional example, a template document may include a variable language conditional expression that indicates that jurisdiction-specific fraud warning language should be used, based on the jurisdiction where the insurance consumer resides. This variable language conditional expression may indicate that, for residents of the state of Florida, the following text should be used: \u201cAny person who knowingly and with intent to injure, defraud, or deceive any insurer files a statement of claim or an application containing any false, incomplete, or misleading information is guilty of a felony of the third degree.\u201d The variable language conditional expression may also indicate that different text should be used for residents of California (e.g., \u201cFor your protection, California law requires the following to appear on this form: Any person who knowingly presents false or fraudulent claim for the payment of a loss is guilty of a crime and may be subject to fines and confinement in state prison.\u201d), as well as for other states.","Templates used by the PHA generation module  to generate PHA documents may be defined according to a number of different formats. For example, a template may be defined according to an Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) format, a format defined according to a template technology such as MVFLEX Expression Language (MVEL), StringTemplate, Freemarker, Velocity, or other template technology, a specific-purpose template format, and\/or any other appropriate format.","After obtaining data that describes a template that may be used to generate the PHA document, the PHA generation module  generates a PHA document (step ). Generating the PHA document may include evaluating conditional expressions such as those described above based on the template data, the obtained consumer data, the obtained policy\/plan data, and\/or the information included in the request, and determining the text to include (or not include) in the PHA document based on the results of the conditional expressions. Further, generating the PHA document may include pre-filling portions of the PHA document with information related to the insurance consumer on whose behalf the PHA was requested and\/or related to the employer or membership organization of the insurance consumer. The generated PHA document may be formatted according to a format such as a Microsoft Word format, Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), Open Document Format for Office Applications (ODF) format, and\/or any other appropriate format.","After generating the PHA document, the PHA generation module  transmits the generated PHA document to the PHA client module  via the interface module  (step ). Then, the generated PHA document is provided to the insurance consumer on whose behalf the PHA document was requested (step ). Providing the PHA document to the consumer may include, for example, the PHA client module  directly transmitting the PHA document to the consumer as an electronic message, such as an email message that includes the PHA document as an attachment. Alternatively, the user of the PHA client device  may provide the PHA document to the insurance consumer by emailing the PHA document to the insurance consumer. As another alternative, the user of the PHA client device  may print the PHA document using a printer that is connected to the PHA client device , and then mail or fax the PHA document to the insurance consumer.","Although not shown in , after the insurance consumer receives the PHA document, the insurance consumer may write the required EOI information onto the PHA document, and then mail, fax, or email the completed PHA document back to the insurance company. Alternatively, in an instance where the insurance consumer receives the PHA document in an electronic format, the insurance consumer may fill in the electronic document using a computing device, add an electronic signature to the document, and then transmit the e-signed PHA document back to the insurance company. The insurance company may then determine, using the medical underwriting system , whether to issue the insurance policy or modification to the insurance consumer. The insurance company may then notify the consumer of the insurance company's decision via mail, fax, email, or any other appropriate mechanism.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","114","200","300","302","302","1","2","1","2","300","302","7","7","304","302","1","1","1","306"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-4F","FIG. 2","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4C","FIG. 4D","FIG. 4E","FIG. 4F"],"b":["400","114","200","400","410","420","430","440","450","460","400"]},"As shown in , page one  of the example PHA document  includes an Employer Information section , an Employee Information section , and a Coverage Information section .

In an instance where EOI is required, the PHA web application module  then communicates with the PHA management system  to obtain information that describes web pages that may be used to obtain EOI information (step ). This may include the PHA web application module  sending one or more messages to the PHA generation module  that indicate that information is required by the PHA web application  to solicit EOI information from the insurance consumer. The messages may include, for example, information that describes the policy and\/or the modification that the user is requesting, information that indicates the reason for the request, and\/or other information. The PHA generation module  may then generate the information required by the PHA web application , and transmit the information back to the PHA web application . As one example of an approach that the PHA generation module  may employ to generate the information required by the PHA web application , the PHA generation module  may perform processing that is similar or analogous to the processing described above with reference to  in step , step , and step . However, instead of generating a PHA document, the PHA generation module  may generate information that describes web pages that the PHA web application  may use to solicit the same information requested in a PHA document, such as the example PHA document  of . This information may be defined according to a format such as Web Interface Definition Language (WIDL), Extensible Forms Description Language (XFDL), XForms, a specific-purpose data format, and\/or any other appropriate format.","As a variation on step , the PHA web application module  may not interact with the PHA management system  to obtain information that describes the web pages required to obtain EOI information, but may have this information already available. According to this approach, the PHA web application module  may determine the contents of web pages that it transmits to the insurance consumer to obtain EOI information by performing, mutatis mutandis, similar processing as that described above as performed by the PHA generation module  in step , step , and\/or step  in .","The PHA web application module  then communicates with the insurance consumer (via the web browser module ) to obtain the EOI information (step ). This may include the PHA web application module  transmitting one or more web pages to the web browser module . The web pages may be generated based on information received by the PHA web application module in step , and\/or generated using the variation on step  described above. The web pages may include forms and\/or data entry fields that solicit EOI information from the insurance consumer. The solicited information may include any combination of the information solicited in the example PHA document  of , and\/or any other appropriate EOI information. The insurance consumer may enter the EOI information into the forms and\/or data entry fields, and the web browser module  transmitting the EOI information to the PHA web application module .","Upon receiving the EOI information, the PHA web application module  communicates with the medical underwriting system  to obtain a determination as to whether the insurance company will issue the requested policy or modification (step ). This may include the PHA web application module  transmitting the EOI information received in step  and\/or the information received in the request in step  to the medical underwriting system . Based on the EOI information transmitted to the medical underwriting system , the medical underwriting system  may determine that the insurance company approves the policy or modification, denies the policy or modification, or whether their result is still pending (i.e., requires more information in order to determine whether to approve or deny the policy or modification).","The PHA web application module  then transmits one or more web pages to the web browser module  that indicate the determination made by the medical underwriting system  (step ). The web browser module  may then display the one or more web pages to the user of the consumer client device . In an instance where the insurance company requires more information in order to determine whether to approve or deny the policy, the web pages may also indicate what additional information is required by the insurance company, and how the insurance consumer may go about providing the additional information to the insurance company.","In an instance where the medical underwriting system  has determined that the insurance company will issue the policy or modification, one or more actions are then performed related to the establishment of the policy (step ). This may include the insurance company issuing the policy, and communicating a certificate of insurance to the insurance consumer that indicates that the new policy or modification has been issued by the insurance company. The insurance company may mail a paper certificate of insurance to the consumer, and\/or may transmit an electronic copy of the certificate of insurance to the insurance consumer via the web site system , which would be received by the consumer via the web browser module . Alternatively or additionally, in an instance where the insurance consumer has obtained a new policy or modification via a group plan via their employer, the one or more actions may include the insurance company notifying the insurance consumer's employer of the new policy or modification. This notification may be performed via paper letter (via mail), or via an electronic communication mechanism such as email. In response to the notification, the employer may begin a payroll deduction from the insurance consumer's wages for paying the premium for the new policy or modification. Also in response to the notification, the employer may establish a period Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)-based transfer or other type of electronic funds transfer, to periodically transfer the necessary premium amount from a bank account belonging to the employer to a bank account belonging to the insurance company.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 1-5","FIG. 6"],"b":["610","610","618","620","622","612","614","616","624","610"]},"The memory device  may be or include a device such as a Dynamic Random Access Memory (D-RAM), Static RAM (S-RAM), or other RAM or a flash memory.
