No. 61\/131,207, filed Jun. 6, 2008.","This invention has been funded in part by the United States Department of Agriculture via Grant No. 68-3A75-6-504. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","Polylactic acid or polylactide (a.k.a. PLA) is a biorenewable, biocompatible and biodegradable thermoplastic polyester derived from the cyclic ester lactide. Polylactide is well-known to be useful in a variety of applications in a wide variety of fields and technologies. Examples of useful poly-D-lactide (PDLA) and poly-L-lactide (PLLA) products include, but are not limited to, upholstery, microwavable trays, clothing materials and fabrics, engineering plastics, medical devices (e.g., sutures, stents) and drug delivery formulations. Polylactide biodegradability properties make it useful for disposable packaging materials and disposable items, such as garments and feminine hygiene products.","Polylactide can be derived from renewable resources, such as corn starch or sugarcane. Typically, bacterial fermentation can be used to produce lactic acid from corn starch or cane sugar. Because of the difficulties associated with achieving high molecular weight, the direct polymerization of lactic acid is not ideal for producing useful products. Lactic acid is, therefore, used to prepare oligomers which are then dimerized using a catalyst to prepare a cyclic lactide monomer. Ring-opening of lactide leads to higher molecular weight polylactide using stannous octoate catalyst or tin (II) chloride, for example.","There has been interest in the polymer field of preparing polylactide derivatives that exhibit enhanced properties as compared to unmodified polylactide, such as higher glass transition temperature, improved thermal stability, controlled crystallinity, reduced water absorption, increased toughness, and the like. Efforts to derivatize polylactide have often been associated with the objective of producing a polylactide that mimics the benefits associated with petroleum-based polymers while still possessing \u201cbiofriendliness.\u201d Alkly-, alkenyl-, and aryl-substituted glycolides and glycolides with protected pendant carboxyl, hydroxyl, and amino groups have been prepared from corresponding alpha-hydroxyacids of variable origin and polymerized. Generally, polylactide-containing materials continue to be of significant interest in the field of consumer materials such as containers and packaging, due to their biorenewability, biocompatibility and biodegradability properties. Difficulty has been encountered, however, in balancing the biodegradability of materials with durability and toughness.","Poly-L-lactide (PLLA) can have a glass transition temperature (T) from about 50\u00b0 C. to about 70\u00b0 C. and a melting temperature between about 173\u00b0 C. and about 178\u00b0 C. One disadvantage with existing polylactide derivatives is that the resultant polylactide exhibits relatively low glass transition temperatures and is, therefore, not suitable as a containment or packaging material that experience elevated temperature environmental conditions and\/or contents. Another disadvantage associated with polylactide-based materials is their long-term durability, brittleness, and cracking over time.","There exists a need in the polymer field for improved lactide monomer derivatives and polymerization processes that could utilize such monomers in the preparation of polylactide-derived materials. There further exists a need in the field of polymer products for thermoformable materials that are capable of withstanding elevated temperature conditions while still exhibiting biorenewability, biocompatibility and biodegradability. Still further, there is a need to develop materials that balance the biodegradability of the polylactide material with the toughness, durability and water transport control properties desired for its use for containment and packaging.","The invention provides a novel lactide monomer derivative and process for preparing the lactide monomer derivative. It has been discovered that a unique monomer could be developed which is bifunctional in nature, and which in turn can be employed a variety of efficient synthesis processes to prepare various polymers. Furthermore, various polymers that can be prepared using the lactide monomer derivative as part of the process exhibit enhanced and improved properties and chemical behaviors as compared to conventionally used monomers and known polymers in similar and different applications. The invention and its various aspects of usage can be used in a wide variety of industrial contexts, including thermoformed medical plastic products and consumer packaging. Particularly advantageous and beneficial is that, because the monomer, polymers and polymeric composites prepared therewith, are lactide-based, the products are associated with biodegradability, biorenewability and biocompatibility attributes. Thus the invention can be associated with environmentally-friendly manufacturing processes and products, while at the same time can exhibit durability and toughness properties desirable for consumer and containment materials. Yet another advantage associated with the invention is that the bifunctional monomer derivative can be used to prepare various intermediate-stage compounds and polymers, which in turn can be used to synthesize other compounds, polymers, copolymers and composites.","The invention provides a lactide monomer derivative having a bifunctional norbornene spiro lactide structure, spiro[6-methyl-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione-3,2\u2032-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept[5]ene], and as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"27.01mm","wi":"53.85mm","file":"US08203007-20120619-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"The invention also provides a process for preparing spiro[6-methyl-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione-3,2\u2032-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept[5]ene] (Formula (I)) comprising: a) reacting L-lactide with N-bromosuccimide to prepare a brominated intermediate compound 3-bromo-3,6-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione; b) reacting 3-bromo-3,6-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione with a tertiary amine, preferably triethylamine, to prepare 3-methyl-6-methylene-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione; and c) reacting 3-methyl-6-methylene-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione with cyclopentadiene, to prepare spiro[6-methyl-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione-3,2\u2032-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept[5]ene].",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0012"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"51.82mm","wi":"75.78mm","file":"US08203007-20120619-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The invention also provides a lactide ring-opened homopolymer composed of repeating units of norbornene ring-substituted polylactide and having the following structural formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0014"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"25.23mm","wi":"56.90mm","file":"US08203007-20120619-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"The invention further provides a process for preparing the lactide-opened homopolymer comprising: reacting spiro[6-methyl-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione-3,2\u2032-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept[5]ene] with a catalyst and initiator using ring-opening polymerization (ROP).

For this process, a bromine addition and elimination reaction on the lactide compound can be employed as illustrated in .","3-Bromo-3,6-dimethyl-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione was prepared by adding L-lactide (200.0 g, 1.388 mol), benzene (1 L) and N-bromosuccimide (272.0 g, 1.528 mol) to a 2 L three-neck flask. The mixture was brought to a reflux under mechanical stirring. Benzoyl peroxide (6.72 g, 27.7 mmol) in benzene (100 mL) was then added dropwise through a dropping funnel over 20 minutes. After the monomer was consumed, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the solid filtered off. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness forming a pale yellow solid. The solid was dissolved in dichloromethane (1.5 L) and the solution was washed with saturated sodium bisulfite solution three times and saturated NaCl once. The organic layer was dried over MgSO, and the solution was evaporated to dryness. The orange solid was recrystallized from ethyl acetate and hexanes to give 137.9 g of white crystal. The mother liquor from the filtration was evaporated to dryness, and the solid was recrystallized from ethyl acetate and hexanes to give 54.3 g white crystal. In total, the yield was 192.2 g (62%).","The brominated intermediate (31.2 g, 0.140 mol) was added into a 500 mL three-neck flask along with 200 mL dichloromethane. The flask was protected under nitrogen and cooled in an ice bath. Triethylamine (21.5 mL, 0.154 mol) was added dropwise.","Tertiary amines having substantially similar basicities to triethylamine can be used in this process step. Preferred for use in this process step, however, is triethylamine (shown in the figures as EtN).","After one hour in the ice bath, the reaction was brought to room temperature and stirred for an additional one hour, transferred to a separatory funnel, and washed with 1 M HCl three times and saturated NaCl once. The organic layer was dried over MgSOand the solvent was evaporated. The pale yellow solid was then purified by silica gel column chromatography (dichloromethane, r=0.41) to yield a white solid. The solid was further purified by sublimation at 45\u00b0 C. under vacuum yielding 11.88 g (60%) of white crystal.","To then prepare the norbornene spiro lactide monomer compound, 3-methyl-6-methylene-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione can be used as a dioenophile (as a captodative alkene, i.e., an alkene substituted with both electron withdrawing and electron donating groups) by Diels-Alder reaction to prepare spiro[6-methyl-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione-3,2\u2032-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept[5]ene]. In this stage and as depicted in , using the 3-methyl-6-methylene-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione as the dieneophile and reacting with cyclopentadiene.","To a 250 mL flask, 3-methyl-6-methylene-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione (15.0 g, 0.106 mol) was added, along with distilled cyclopentadiene (14.0 g, 0.212 mol) and benzene (100 mL). The reaction mixture was refluxed overnight under Argon. After cooling the mixture to room temperature, benzene and extra cyclopentadiene were removed by rotary evaporation. The crude product was then purified by silica gel column chromatography, first by hexanes to remove dicyclopentadiene, followed by dichloromethane (r=0.31). The solid was then further purified by sublimation at 50\u00b0 C. under vacuum to give 20.74 g (94%) white crystal. H NMR spectra data of the product is shown in .","This reaction produces four pairs of enantiomers due to the endo and exo forms of the tricycle. From these, a preferred cycloadduct was selected, which exhibited high diastereofacial selectivity as expected from the methyl group being on opposite side from the cyclopentadiene to minimize steric repulsion. High exo selectivity was observed as well consistent with the preference for anti-Alder addition observed for other captodative dieneophiles.","An important aspect of the invention is that the bifunctionality of the monomer unit of the invention can be selectively reacted in its structural portions. Put another way, either the norbornene ring portion, lactide ring portion, or both, can be utilized in compound and polymer synthesis. For instance, the norbornene ring can be selectively cleaved without opening the lactide ring structure. Likewise, the lactide ring structure can be cleaved without opening the norbornene ring portion. At this modified monomer stage alone, the monomer derivative of the invention permits two synthesis pathways as illustrated in the second reaction shown in FIG. \u2014each of which can produce chemically distinct entities associated with various chemical properties.","Lactide Ring-Opened Homopolymer","In another aspect of the invention, the spiro[6-methyl-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione-3,2\u2032-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept[5]ene] monomer derivative can be used to synthesize a lactide ring-opened homopolymer, which itself can be used to further synthesize other polymers.","A lactide-opened homopolymer poly(oxy-1-oxoethylene-2-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene) can be prepared by ring opening polymerization (ROP) of the highly sterically hindered spiro[6-methyl-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione-3,2\u2032-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept[5]ene]. In a dry box, a catalyst\/initiator solution was prepared by adding 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD) (6.7 mg, 48 \u03bcmol), benzyl alcohol (10.0 \u03bcL, 96 \u03bcmol) and anhydrous CHCl(9.6 mL) to a 20 mL vial. To a 20 mL pressure vessel was added spiro[6-methyl-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione-3,2\u2032-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept[5]ene] (0.20 g, 0.96 mmol) and the catalyst\/initiator solution (0.96 mL).","Variations of catalyst and initiator combinations are possible for this reaction step. For example, other strong bases that could possibly be used as the catalyst in place of TBD include 1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene (a.k.a. DBU) and N-methyl TBD. Primary alcohols can be used as the initiator in this process step as well, in place of or in addition to, benzyl alcohol. Primary alcohols are preferred in light of the spiro monomer structure.","After a period of 24 hours, the reaction was quenched by addition of excess (>10 equivalents) of benzoic acid, and the solution evacuated to dryness and analyzed by H NMR and GPC. The remaining polymer solution was precipitated into methanol three times.

The relative molecular mass M(SEC, polystyrene standards) of an opened polylactide chain having norbornene side groups at 24 hours was 4.9 kg moland PDI was 1.85.","The reaction can be optimized when performed at \u221220\u00b0 C. as opposed to ambient temperature, wherein 94% conversion was achieved after 24 hours with relative molecular mass M=12.2 kg moland PDI=1.27. H NMR spectra data for the prepared homopolymer can be seen in . This phenomenon is consistent with the bulky nature of the norbornene side group limiting the exothermicity of the polymerization reaction.","In this process stage, molecular weights of the resultant polymer could be controlled by increasing amount of the norbornene spiro lactide monomer relative to the catalyst and initiator amounts. Using less relative amounts of the initiator and catalyst (spiro[6-methyl-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione-3,2\u2032-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept[5]ene] 0.20 g, 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD) 0.22 mg, benzyl alcohol 0.33 \u03bcL and anhydrous CHCl0.96 mL) could achieve as high as relative molecular mass M=33.6 kg mol, PDI=1.63. The resulting homopolymer had a high molecular weight homopolymer (Mof 33.6 kg molas compared to 12.2. kg mol) and exhibited a glass transition temp (T) 113\u00b0 C. as measure by DSC. The glass transition temperature associated with this polymer is significantly greater than known polylactide derivatives.","Because of the relatively higher Tg values compared to existing polylactides, this homopolymer can have applications in areas such as packaging materials, engineering plastics, materials for tissue engineering, and the like. Furthermore, this monomer can be used in copolymerizations with other cyclic esters such as lactide, glycolide, caprolactone, and the like, to prepare new materials with increased glass transition temperatures.","Norbornene Ring-Opened Homopolymer","Alternative to the lactide ring-opened homopolymer, spiro[6-methyl-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione-3,2\u2032-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept[5]ene] monomer derivative can be used to synthesize a norbornene ring-opened homopolymer (also shown in ).

Using this approach, spiro[6-methyl-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione-3,2\u2032-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept[5]ene] monomer (0.20 g, 0.96 mmol) and 3generation Grubbs' catalyst (8.5 mg, 9.6 \u03bcmol) (prepared using a process similar to that described in Grubbs, 41, p. 4035-37 (2002)) were added to a 20 mL vial. The vial was fitted with a septum and purged under nitrogen for a period of 10 minutes. Dichloromethane (4.8 mL) was then added via syringe through the septum to the vial under quick stirring. After 30 minutes, the reaction was then quenched by addition of excess (>20 equivalents) of ethyl vinyl ether. The polymer solution was precipitated from methanol to remove catalyst and ethyl vinyl ether. The formed solid polymer sample was vacuum dried overnight and analyzed using NMR, GPC and DSC.","The resultant norbornene ring-opened polymers having lactide ring side groups (poly(8-methyl-6,9-dioxa-spiro[4.5]decane-7,10-dione-1,3-diylvinylene)) had high molecular weights and narrow polydispersity indices.
