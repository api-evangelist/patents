{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE RELATED ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention relates in general to document generation and management. More particularly, the present invention is related to the solicitation, storage, manipulation, and retrieval of data over a wide area network in the form of documentation in a format that can be submitted for compliance with federal, state and local equal employment opportunity and fair employment practices laws.","Federal and state laws require that public and private employees have an opportunity to complain of discrimination and harassment. With the passage of the first civil rights and employment laws in the mid 1960's and until the mid 1990's, such equal employment opportunity (\u201cEEO\u201d) complaints were generally in the form of Charges of Discrimination filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) or a Fair Employment Practices Agency (\u201cFEPA\u201d or \u201cFEP Agency\u201d) or Formal Agency Charges filed with the employee's public sector employer agency. In the late 1990's, the United States Supreme Court mandated that public and private employers provide a mechanism for employees to file informal or internal complaints of discrimination. Most of the employers that implemented a complaint mechanism did not provide a formalized process or means to intake, track or store the complaints.","Currently, an employer has a legal obligation under various state and federal laws and regulations, including EEOC Guidelines and Management Directive No. 110, to investigate and respond to formal charges of discrimination. An employer also has a legal obligation to investigate and respond to internal complaints of fair employment practice issues. Public and private employers must also be able to track complaints, the responses and their respective outcomes. Employers have been encouraged by the courts to provide independent investigations and tracking of such complaints.","In the past, these EEO complaints were received in a typewritten or handwritten form, and all complaints were processed manually. The manual processing of the application is a tedious, labor-intensive and time-consuming operation. Moreover, the requiring of filing either by hand or in typewritten form is cumbersome for the employees. Manual processing of paper documents is prone to loss through mis-filing or other misadventure. In addition to the potential loss of the documents was the potential dissemination of personal information and possible violation of privacy laws.","The advent of the Internet has enabled many users to have access to remote servers and databases via the World Wide Web (\u201cWWW\u201d) using standard web browsers on client machines that interact with web servers and other processing capabilities at the remote site. To date, however, no EEO compliance system has utilized the capabilities of the Internet. There is, therefore, a need in the art for an EEO compliance mechanism that is capable of utilizing a wide area network such as the Internet to enhance privacy, to automate routine tasks and to enable the handling of EEO that is applicable to private and public sector employers and governmental compliance entities.","In accordance with the present invention, the disadvantages and problems associated with the prior art are solved by providing, in a computer system, a group of modules, each containing a set of objects that interact together to form a flexible and scalable framework for obtaining, storing, sorting, retrieving and implementing, in an automated fashion, information regarding equal employment opportunity claims. The present invention enables various users, such as complainants, employers, and consultants to upload, download, or modify information that is kept at a centralized location in order to facilitate the processing of claims.","The present invention includes a computer system having at least one server that is connected to one or more networks, such as a virtual private network, or a wide area network such as the Internet. Users can use a wide variety of client devices, such as personal digital assistants, telephones, facsimile machines, and personal computers to interact with the present invention over standard network protocols. Voice or facsimile information is preferably digitized to facilitate storage and manipulation of the data. For instance, voice transmissions (such as over a telephone connection) can be digitized with Voice over IP (\u201cVoIP\u201d) technologies and the voice signals translated into text files by voice recognition software that is executing on the server. Similarly, optical character recognition (\u201cOCR\u201d) software can be used by the servers of the present invention to recognize the words in the facsimile and translate them into text information that can facilitate searching and retrieving. Other information, such as web forms and other files, can be stored in the normal fashion. In the preferred embodiment, all of this information can be stored, searched, and retrieved by authorized personnel in a secure manner. Other aspects of the present invention enable the information contained within the system to be reported, either in paper form, or preferably, in electronic form in order to facilitate automatic filing and reporting to governmental agencies.","Other features of the present invention will become apparent upon inspection of the following specification and the drawings.","The present invention overcomes the problems inherent in the prior art by providing a comprehensive and integrated method, apparatus and system for handling complaints under the various EEO regulations. Specifically, the present invention enables employees of companies to file discrimination complaints, have those complaints investigated, and have the required documents generated in a format required for filing with local authorities. The present invention is useful for complying with various local, state, and national (federal) laws as well as the formal and informal requirements thereof. This enables the present invention to handle internal complaints as well as formal charges by various jurisdictions under, for example, EEOC or FEP agency regulations.","The present invention also provides the capability of compiling data into a database from many organizations regarding their respective EEO compliance instances and performance. This information can be queried to generate comparisons of, for example, a particular company, vis-\u00e0-vis, companies of comparable (or dissimilar) size and\/or industry. Other comparisons can be made within the same or multiple organizations regarding compliance within specific jurisdictions or geographic areas, and the like, or for specific demographic groups and\/or chronological time periods.","As the present invention is best utilized via a web-based paradigm, the present invention is also useful for storing frequently asked questions, and for providing interactive consulting via email; Internet Relay Chat (\u201cIRC\u201d), a system for chatting online; channels, I Seek You (\u201cICQ\u201d), a program that lets a user know when friends and contacts are online.) messaging, streaming video and streaming audio, VoIP, interactive video, static web pages, and other means of communicating over a wide area network such as the Internet. The present invention can also be equipped with a rules module that can accommodate difference in local, state, and federal laws so that answers to standard questions can be readily tailored to the specific jurisdiction of the user. Similarly, the present invention can have flags and switches that are responsive to language settings of the user's interactive software (such as a browser) so that the user automatically views the resultant documents from the present invention in a language familiar to the user. In addition, the present invention can also be utilized for creating and maintaining a list group or news group of information useful to users of the present invention. The email list groups, web logs, and\/or news groups of the present invention may be moderated, although this is an optional feature.","The present invention contains a number of technical terms, an understanding of which is useful to the practitioner and is made possible with the following glossary.","Actor: Anyone or anything with behavior.

Other wide area networks, virtual private networks and other interconnection mechanisms can be utilized with the present invention without departing from the scope and spirit of the appended claims.","In general, the present invention facilitates the gathering, storing, dissemination, and analysis of information. Specifically, information that is gathered from voice via the network communication (e.g., the WWW, email, IRC, etc.), facsimile, telephone, and\/or paper is preferably digitized and combined with other digitally-received information. Once received, the information can be tagged, categorized, and stored within a database for analysis, processing, and retrieval. Digitization of analog or paper information can be through standard techniques, including, but not limited to, analog-to-digital (\u201cA\/D\u201d) conversion, voice recognition, or OCR technologies.","The present invention is intended to be implemented on a wide area network such as the Internet. Various security mechanisms can be implemented in conjunction with the present invention, such as separate (or combined) authentication and authorization procedures. Alternatively, the present invention may be implemented on a local area network that can be separated from unsecured networks by one or more firewalls.","The system of the present invention is illustrated in . Specifically, the server portion of the application is built around local area network  through the network connection  which may include, but is not limited to, an Ethernet connection, a star configuration, a hub and spoke configuration, a token ring configuration or any other useful network interface connection. The system  preferably operates upon an agreed-upon communication protocol, such as, for example, Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (\u201cTCP\/IP\u201d).","One or more servers  and  are connected to the local area network  by the network connection . Similarly, one or more disk arrays  and  are used to store application specific information for the databases  and , respectively, as shown in . A network control station, such as workstation , can control the local area network . The router  can optionally be used for optimizing conductivity between the servers ( and ), and database servers ( and ), as well as the workstation . One or more firewalls  and  may optionally be placed onto the network for protection against viruses, worms, trojans, and other malicious activities. Optionally, other networks, such as the Virtual Private Network (\u201cVPN\u201d)  may be connected to the local area network  through network connection  via the optional firewall . Similarly, other networks, such as Automotive Network eXchange (\u201cANX\u201d)  may be connected to the local area network  at the network connection .","The local area network  can be connected through, for example, router  and firewall  to the network . The network  is typically a wide area network such as the Internet. However, alternate embodiments of the present invention can utilize a VPN , an ANX , a frame relay network (not shown), or other combinations of local area and wide area networks  to which other client computers may become connected to the local area network . The network  can provide interconnectivity to the local area network  to, for example, personal digital assistants  via communication channel , as illustrated in . The communication channel  can encompass a wide variety of mechanisms including infrared, telecommunications, cable, fiber optic, Ethernet, optic, Bluetooth, wireless access protocol (\u201cWAP\u201d), 802.11, frame relay, fiber channel, and any other mechanism capable of transmitting analog and\/or digital signals along a network. Other client devices, such as network terminals , workstations , personal computers , facsimile machines , laptop computers  and telephones , are similarly connected to the network . Telecommunications connectivity can be, for example, with VoIP in order to handle, for example, facsimile and telephone transmissions. All that the network  needs to facilitate is the communications between the client device and the network .","It is envisioned that all communication to the local area network  will be in digital form using a common protocol, such as, for example, TCP\/IP. This includes, but is not limited to, the client devices connected to the wide area network , or through other networks such as VPN  and ANX . For instance, request by clients through telephones (one of the many client devices) would be translated into, for example, VoIP and transmitted to one of the servers  or  for processing by the present invention. Similarly, hypertext transfer protocol (\u201cHTTP\u201d) requests from a client's web browser are handled in the normal fashion. Facsimile messages from, for example, facsimile machines  can also be digitized and processed by the servers  and . The servers may employ, for example, character recognition software and\/or hardware to extract the information from the facsimile, or simply to store the image or information in the storage arrays  and\/or  through the database engines  and\/or .","The storage devices  and  can be of any applicable kind, such as a disk drive, optical storage, tape, or other device. While only one storage device is necessary, it is preferable to have multiple storage devices, or an array of storage devices, in order to ensure high availability of the information stored therein.","The databases  and  can be relational, object, object-relational database, or other type. The specific type of database used is not important as long as the information contained therein can be mapped to the objects used to manage the information (as described below). While a single database engine\/application can be used, it is preferable to utilize multiple database engines in order to balance the loading, provide higher availability, and enable the efficient scaling of the present invention so that large numbers of people can utilize its services.","The servers  and  can be of any suitable variety that can handle the expected user load. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, there are multiple servers  and . The servers are constructed and arranged to service a wide variety of requests, such as web browsing and form filing, email, voice, facsimile, and other tasks associated with communication of information from users on disparate (and\/or remote) client devices. Specifically, the servers are expected to have information uploaded to them from users via client devices, or to provide information in the form of a download to the users, or to facilitate the searching and manipulation of the information associated with the various cases.","Multiple databases may be subsumed into servers. For example, it is contemplated that an accounting function may include a relational database within a larger software process to store data related to accounting. Accounting software programs, such as TIMESLIPS, manufactured by Sage U.S. Holdings, Inc. of Dallas, Tex., employ application programming interfaces (\u201cAPI\u201d) that can be used by the present invention to store and to retrieve accounting data. The accounting data so obtained (or provided) is mapped to\/from one of the objects of the present invention, typically from one of the objects in the payment module (see the module and object descriptions provided below and in ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Attention is directed to , wherein several of the processes are illustrated. The processes are connected to one or more data busses  and  that enable information to be shared between processes. The various information bridges  and  can be connected directly, or they may be interconnected through, for example, bridge  as illustrated in . The bridge  may facilitate, for example, the communications between disparate CPU's and\/or disparate computer servers and thus allow for the scalability of the present invention to meet user demands.","In this example, the information bus  is operatively connected to one or more communication processes, namely, communication interface , web server , and email server . Additional processes, such as IRC chat, etc., may also be operatively connected to the information bus  to enable the present invention to accept or transmit information from\/to particular client devices. The communication processes are themselves operatively connected to a pre-existing communications infrastructure. For example, the communication interface  is operatively connected to the telecommunications network  so that client devices, such as facsimile machine  and telephone  may communicate with the present invention. Similarly, the web server  and the email server  are operatively connected to the network , which, in turn, is connected to the client devices and their attendant client applications , such as a web browser or email client. It is contemplated that some or all of the users of the present invention, such as Complainants, Consultants, clients, private sector and public sector clients, insurance carriers and all other clients, government contacts, and others will access information or be provided with reports and other information in the fashion outlined above. In short, the users of the present invention can include the Complainant, members of the operating organization, employees and\/or officers of the client, and individuals associated with one or more government agencies.","The present invention utilizes a set of one or more processes for handling the input, pre-processing, processing, post-processing, storing, and\/or dissemination of information. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a database server  is operatively connected to the information bus . Similarly, a data storage device\/process  is also operatively connected to the information bus , as illustrated in . A timer process  is provided for issuing time-based signals to the various devices\/processes illustrated in  so that certain events, such as time-of-input from a client device, or the issuance of a database trigger or batch job, may be initiated automatically.","The present invention may also implement specific interfaces for customers and\/or government agencies. Specifically, the customer interface  and the government interface  are processes that are tailored for the exchange of information with the specific organization and the present invention. For example, the customer interface  can provide a first set of functionality, such as access to the complaint, and documents related to the customer's side of the case. Similarly, an interface can be provided for the Complainant, which would limit access to only that information provided by the Complainant. A government interface  can be provided with yet another set of capabilities that allows access to some (or all) of the documents from both the customer and the Complainant, as well as documents held or utilized only by the government agency. Moreover, for each organization (e.g., customer or government), different levels of access to information can be provided that are tailored to specific individuals within that organization. This is accomplished by recording the role that the individual has within the organization, and thus his or her level of access to information stored\/received\/generated by the present invention.","A document generator process  is used for creating new documents, or otherwise governing the storing, searching, indexing and\/or retrieval of existing documents. The documents so generated, stored, or retrieved can be transmitted on the information busses  and  to the other processes or to client devices and client applications through the interfaces, as illustrated in . For example, a document may be requested via a web request from a client application  that is received over the network  to the web server , which then transmits the request to the document generator . The request may be to transmit a document to a government agency. Consequently, the document generator  retrieves the document and forwards the document to the government interface  via information bus . The government interface process  would then determine which government agency should receive the document and how best to transmit it (e.g., email, telephone, facsimile, etc.). The government interface process  could, for example, transmit the document to the communication interface  for transmission to a facsimile machine  via telecommunications network .","The present invention may also be equipped with access to an accounting application  that is operatively connected to one of the information busses, such as information bus . The accounting application  provides a handy mechanism for performing common functions (such as accounting) that are not unique to the present invention. Other third-party software modules (or processes), such as timekeeping, inventory control, and the like, may be similarly connected to the present invention.","A detailed discussion of the data model, as well as the operation of the present invention, is provided below.","The Data Model","The data model of the present invention is used to implement the method of the present invention (discussed below). Specifically, the present invention is a computer network that is composed of one or more client devices that are operative with the computer network, and one or more servers that service the requests sent by the clients. Depending upon the request by the client, the server will receive information, store information, and\/or transmit information to the requesting or other client devices, or to other elements within the computer network. It will be appreciated that having a specific object in a specific module may be a matter of convenience or convention. However, it is possible to rearrange objects within the data model as described and achieve the functionality desired. Consequently, the arrangement of objects described herein is for the preferred embodiment. Other embodiments of the present invention can have different arrangements of objects and modules yet provide the same or substantially the same functionality. Yet other embodiments of the present invention may remove objects, albeit with a corresponding loss of functionality. Still other embodiments may exchange properties and methods from one object to another object within the present invention with a corresponding effect on association and performance.","The servers contain hardware and\/or software that enable the functionality desired. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the server has one or more processes executing on a central processing unit. One or more of these processes are constructed and arranged to instantiate objects in a preferably persistent, or at least temporary, manner. In the preferred embodiment, the objects are stored persistently on, for example, an object database. In addition, or in lieu of an object database, a relational database can be used. However, if a relational database is used, there will be some object-to-relational mapping issues that must be addressed. This is particularly true for those objects that are based on records in tables that are associated with other records in the same table through a common object that is, for example, stored as a record in a second table. Alternatively, an object-relational database, such as PostrgreSQL (see http:\/\/www.postresq1.org) or Oracle , the latter manufactured by the Oracle Corporation of Redwood Shores, Calif., can be utilized to handle the object-to-relational mapping in an automated fashion.","The data structure within the server or servers is designed and arranged in such a fashion so as to facilitate the functionality required for servicing the requests issued by the client devices. The objects of the present invention can be conveniently grouped into modules and interconnected as illustrated in . The modules illustrated in  capture and store information within the present invention that describe the set-up and particulars of internal complaints and charges. All of the information related to the charge itself, such as final disposition, are stored in one or more instantiations of objects in one or more of the modules illustrated in . One or more instantiations are used because the case may be comprised of more than one charge, and each charge can have separate agency affiliations and agency contacts.","The various modules  are described in general below. For example, a case status module  encompasses all case specific information such as the Complainant identity, type of case, date of receipt, assigned consultant, insurance information if the client is insured, settlement information, final disposition, and all activities associated with the case including calendar events, documents posted and correspondence sent. The case status and activity tracking module  comprises the bulk of the information, but it relies heavily on the devices and techniques mentioned above to import and export information.","An intake module  has an operative relationship  with the case status module . The intake module  is used to retain and reference various charges, government agencies, and related contact information.","A role module  has an operative relationship  with the case status module  as well as an operative relationship  with the alert distribution module . The role module is used to retain report information and descriptions of the tasks (roles) of the various people associated with one or more cases. The role module  captures the user's role and specifications that are utilized by the present invention to tailor the application to the user's general and\/or unique requirements.","An accounting module  has an operative relationship with the case status module  as illustrated in . The payment module  is used to track billing invoices and their payment status. Time and Expense (\u201cTE\u201d) information can be input and stored through the payment module . In addition, invoices can be generated via a third party accounting package that is integrated with the present invention. These invoices can be viewed by users of the present invention and payments may be made online.","An alert distribution module  is in an operative relationship  with the case status module . The alert distribution module  is used for issuing alerts, such as docketing items indicating that some activity is due to be completed on a certain date. Alerts to the operator of the present invention, their users, and clients are preferably pre-set based on client preferences and user set-up. Typically, alerts are generated and disseminated based upon a number of parameters and events that occur during the life-cycle of a case.","The system of the present invention also includes a correspondence distribution module  that has an operative relationship  with the case status module . The correspondence distribution handles correspondence that is sent to the present invention, including receipts, responses and approvals. Correspondence are also tracked through this correspondence module  which allows the Consultant to generate pre-set or other correspondence and attach uploaded documents to the correspondence for client review. The correspondence module  may also retain information regarding the correspondence between individuals, employers, insurers, courts, and\/or government agencies that are associated with the case.","A document distribution module  has an operative relationship  with the client information module , and an operative relationship  with the correspondence distribution module . The document distribution module  ensures that documents associated with the various cases remain stored, searchable, and retrievable by the various people associated with the case. Documents are uploaded from other sources (e.g., word processing documents on the storage device or forms documents that are received through, for example, a facsimile server) and posted to the present invention. Documents may also be modified, replaced, and\/or deleted from the storage device within the present invention. Documents may be distributed as an attachment to correspondence and\/or email or other electronic means. Information about various documents may be compiled by electronic processes and a compiled or synthesized version can be electronically uploaded or otherwise sent to remote servers, such as those owned by customers, employers, courts, or government agencies.","Finally, a client information module  is included with the preferred embodiment of the present invention. The client information module  has a series of operative relationships. First, there is the operative relationship  with the case status module , the operative relationship  with the correspondence module , the operative relationship  with the document distribution module, and the operative relationship  with the agency module . Generally, the client information module  contains all information about the client, its business, its primary contacts, organizational structure, divisions, locations, unions, and one or more specifications affecting the performance of the intended operator of the present invention.","All of the modules and associated relationships there between enable the present invention to service one or more requests from the client device. It will be understood that modules can be removed from the present invention in order to consume fewer resources, albeit with reduced functionality and capability for the system as a whole. Conversely, modules can be added to the present invention in order to increase functionality, or to incorporate new client devices some time in the future.

The objects preferably have data composed of properties that may be stored\/retrieved in an object or relational database or in another manner. The properties of the objects of the present invention are of standard types that enable the property to retain the kind and amount of information necessary to fulfill the requirements of the object and the overall system of the present invention. For example, the properties may be a standard integer, or a string variable of finite length. Other properties are specific for datetime and real (non-integer) numbers. Still other properties are of type \u201cbit\u201d for use as boolean variables or simple flags, as well as tinyint, varchar(x), char(x), smallint, numeric(a, b), or other type allowable under the language, database and\/or platform upon which the application of the present invention operates.","The case object  has, for example: a caseid property; a clientlocationid property; an empstatusid property; a casetypeid property; a complaintid property; a casemanager-userid property; a case-statusid property; a dismissaltypeid property; a casesubstatusid property; a settlementid property; a tscliinforecordid property; a consultantuserid property; a casenumber property; a tecode property; a rate property; a ratetype property; datereactivated property; a dateclosed property; a reportduedate property; an insuranceclaimno property; a courtfilingdate property; a courtstate property; a court-circuit property; a dateadded property; a datemodified property; an addedby property; a modifiedby property; a firstname property; a last name property; a jobtitle property; a title property; a complaint property; and a datareceived property.","The case object  contains pertinent information about the case being processed within the present invention. The courtstate property contains the two-letter abbreviation for the state in which the court is located where the case litigation is filed, e.g., \u201cME\u201d for Maine. A value placed in this property does not imply, nor is it to be inferred, that this is a state circuit court. Rather, the courtcircuit property indicates the federal circuit in which the case is filed, whereas the courtstate only indicates the geographical location of the court of the initial filing. Within the courtcircuit property, a non-null value indicates that this is a Federal court case, while a null value indicates a State court case. The courtfilingdate property contains the date the case was filed with a court. The date-added property indicates the date that the case is added to the table. The dateclosed property indicates the date that the case is closed, i.e., the date that the main status is set to \u201cClosed\u201d. The insuranceclaimno property contains the identification number of the claim, as reported by the client (insurance company), e.g., \u201c23654-002.\u201d The reportduedate property indicates the date that the Report is due for this case. The datereactivated property contains the date that the case was \u201cre-activated.\u201d Possible reasons for case reactivation may include the RFI requiring considerable time to reach a compliance. The title property is the title, or citation, of the case, e.g., \u201cSmith v. ACME, Inc.\u201d The job-title property contains the job property of the Complainant. The complaint property can be either internal or external. Typically, for \u201cinternals,\u201d this property contains the online submission of the Complainant or the operating organization's employees' notes if the complaint was received by telephone, facsimile or mail, whereas for \u201cexternals\u201d it includes a copy of the original charge. The datemodified property contains the date of the last modification to the case in question. The addedby and modifiedby properties contain the user identifier of the person adding and modifying, respectively, this particular row. The lastname and firstname properties contain the last name, e.g., \u201cBurns\u201d, and the first name, e.g., \u201cGeorge\u201d, respectively, of the Complainant in the case. The datereceived property contains the date that the complaint or charge, i.e., primary charge only, was received by the operating organization. However, this date is not always the same as the date-added property. A example of this may be a case that was received on a Friday, but not entered into the system until the following Monday. The complaintid property contains the database identification for the complaint. The casetypeid property contains the database-unique identifier which uniquely identifies the object in the database. The casemanageruserid property contains the user identifier of the case manager who set up the case. The casestatusid property contains the current status of the case, e.g., \u201cClosed\u201d, \u201cActive\u201d, \u201cMonitoring\u201d, \u201cReactivated.\u201d The caseid property contains the database unique identifier which uniquely identifies the case within the database of the present invention. The empstatus-id property contains a database unique identifier to an employeestatus object. The clientlocationid property contains a database-unique identifier for the clientlocation object within the database. The ratetype property determines the nature of the rate in the rate column, i.e., either \u201cF\u201d for a flat rate, or \u201cH\u201d for an hourly rate. The tecode property uniquely identifies the TE charge account for this case, and that number is the present invention's \u201cforeign key\u201d into the accounting program database, created independently at the case set-up in both the present invention and the accounting program. The casenumber property contains the case number that is assigned to the case by the operating organization in order to identify the case uniquely. Typically, the case number corresponds to the alphanumeric code placed on case folders and is used in the accounting program, i.e., \u201cName.Nickname1\u201d. This casenumber is read from the accounting program after the TE code (te-code) is created in both the present invention and the accounting program. The rate property contains the rate charged by the operating organization for time spent on the case in question. A default value is extracted from the Client table and is a flat rate \u201cF\u201d and\/or an hourly rate \u201cH\u201d, as determined by the ratetype property. The casesubstatusid property contains the current sub-status of the case. An example is \u201cDismissed, No Cause\u201d, which is a sub-status of the status \u201cClosed.\u201d The dismissaltypeid property contains the identification representing the type of dismissal for this case, if applicable. An example of a dismissaltypeid property is \u201cSuccessful Conciliation.\u201d The settlementid property contains a database-unique identifier that uniquely identifies the settlement object in the database. The tscliinforecordid property is a \u201cforeign key\u201d into the accounting program Cliinfo table (RecordID) and identifies the case, allowing the present invention to access case-specific accounting program data. The tscliinforecordid property is read by the accounting program after the tecode is created in both the present invention and the accounting program.","The settlement object  has, for example: a settlementid property; a rangelower property; a range-upper property; a rangedesc property; a settlementdate property; a demandedamount property; a demanddesc property; an actualamount property; and an actualdesc property.","The settlement object  contains the details of a settlement. The settlement-id property contains a database-unique identifier which uniquely identifies the settlement object in the database of the present invention. The range-lower property contains the lower boundary or minimum amount, in U.S. dollars, e.g., , or $1,500.00, for the settlement. Similarly, the rangeupper property contains the upper boundary or maximum amount, in U.S. dollars, e.g., 5000, or $5,000.00, for the settlement. The rangedesc property contains any textual description which needs to accompany the settlement. The settlementdate property contains the date the settlement was reached. The demandedamount property contains the amount of money demanded by the Complainant\/charging party, in U.S. dollars, i.e., 5000, or $5,000.00. The demand-desc property contains a description of the non-monetary demands, or an elaboration upon the monetary demands, e.g., \u201creinstatement and a 10% pay increase.\u201d The actualamount property contains the amount finally settled upon by the Complainant charging party, in U.S. dollars, i.e., 3000, or $3,000.00. The actualdesc property contains a description of the non-monetary final settlement, or an elaboration upon the monetary settlement, e.g., \u201creinstatement and a 5% pay increase.\u201d","The relatedcase object  has, for example, a caseid2 property, a caseid1 property, as well as a relationshipdesc property.","The relatedcase object  relates two cases to one another, such as when an internal case is later filed by the complainant as a charge or when an internal or external case later results in litigation. Other case relationships could be related here by utilizing the relationshipdesc property column to describe the relationship. Each relationship is represented once, so queries need to inspect both columns when searching for a relationship, i.e., \u201cwhere caseid1=2039 OR caseid2=2039.\u201d The caseid1 and the caseid2 properties each contain a database-unique identifier which uniquely identifies the relatedcase object within the database of the present invention. The relationshipdesc property contains a textual description of the nature of the relationship represented here, e.g., \u201cCSC-EEO from the same claim.\u201d","The employmentstatus object  has, for example: an empstatus-id property; and a statusname property.","The employmentstatus object  represents the valid statuses applicable to a Complainant regarding his or her employment status with the client. Valid values include, for example, Hourly, Salary, Contract, Applicant, etc. The empstatus-id property contains a database-unique identifier which uniquely identifies the employment status identifier within the database. The statusname identifier property contains the name of the employment status, i.e., Hourly, Salary, Contract, Applicant, etc.","The dismissaltype object  has, for example, a dismissaltype-id property, as well as a type-name property and an activeind property.","The dismissaltype object  represents the possible types of dismissals which can be associated with a case. The dismissal-type-id property contains a database unique identifier which uniquely identifies the dismissaltype object within the database. The typename property contains the name of the dismissaltype, e.g., \u201cSuccessful Conciliation.\u201d The term \u201cDismissed\u201d is contained in the casestatus property column and hence, is not stored in the dismissaltype object . Finally, the activeind property, if set to, for example, the value 1, indicates a valid dismissaltype. Otherwise, this type is no longer considered a valid option.","The casestatus object  has, for example: a casestatusid property; a complainantcontentid property; a statusname property; a sort-sequence property; a closureind property; a parent-statusid property; an active-ind property; a tempactiveind property; a statusdesc property; an abbreviation property; and a clientstatus property.","The casestatus object  defines the various states that EEO cases can have, such as, \u201cOpen\u201d, \u201cAssigned\u201d, \u201cClosed\u201d, or \u201cSettled\u201d. The casestatusid property contains a database-unique identifier which uniquely identifies the casestatus object in the database. The complainantcontentid property contains an identifier tag which links to, for example, a Content table and identifies the status message to be displayed for a case with such a status. The statusname property contains the name of the status as it appears in the user interface (\u201cUT\u201d), e.g., \u201cOpen\u201d or \u201cClosed\u201d. The sortsequence property contains the numerical indicator of the order in which the status values are listed. The closureind property contains information on how a case was closed, as a case can reach \u201cclosed\u201d status in several different ways. The parentstatusid property identifies the status of the \u201cparent\u201d case in the casestatus table and is used to denote that a status is a sub-status. \u201cSettled\u201d is one example of a sub-status of \u201cClosed,\u201d because any case which is \u201cSettled\u201d is \u201cClosed\u201d as well. The active-ind property, if set to, for example, the value 1, indicates a valid status; otherwise, this status is no longer considered a valid option. The tempactiveind property, if set to, for example, the value 1, indicates that a case status is \u201ctemporarily inactive,\u201d such as when the case is in the \u201cmonitoring\u201d state. The statusdesc property contains a brief description, available to the user, to assist the user in the status assignment or transition of the case. The abbreviation property contains an abbreviated representation of the status which is used where physical space is limited, such as in a report, on a display grid, etc. The clientstatus property is the status as it is represented to the client. Typically, client statuses are more generalized than consultant statuses.","The casenote object  has, for example: a casenoteid property; a caseid property; a note property; a userid property; and a notedate property.","The casenote object  enables multiple notes to be stored for a single case. The note property contains the actual text of the note. The userid property contains the name of the author of the note. The notedate property contains the date the note was written (or edited). The caseid property contains a database-unique identifier which uniquely identifies the casenote object within the database to which the note pertains. The casenoteid property contains a database unique identifier that uniquely identifies the note in the database.","The casetype object  has, for example: a casetypeid property; a casetypename property; and an abbreviation property.","The casetype object  contains the various claim types under which a case can fall. Some examples of claim types include \u201ccharge\u201d, \u201cinternal\u201d, and \u201cattorney demand\u201d. The casetypeid property contains a databaseunique identifier which uniquely identifies the case-type object in the database. The casetypename property contains the name of the claim type as it appears in documents, checkbox labels, etc., e.g., \u201cInternal Complaint.\u201d Finally, the abbreviation property contains the abbreviated representation of the case type for use in places where physical space is limited such as in a report or on a display grid.","The content object  has, for example, an identifier property, as well as a set of properties including, for example: a description property; a language property; and a body property.","The content object  maintains \u201ccopy\u201d used with the present invention and is where some of the textual content originates. The id property contains a database identifier which is a text identifier to enable the content object (and its message) to be identified meaningfully within the code referencing it, e.g., complainant:statuspage:opencase. The description property contains a description of the use of this content. The language property contains the language in which the content is supplied. If this is \u201cnull,\u201d then the language is English. Finally, the body property contains the actual \u201ccontent\u201d displayed on the site.","The user object  has, for example: an id property; a clienthqid property; a lastname property; a first-name property; a middlename property; a prefix property; a suffix property; a username property; a password property; an employee-ind property; an email property; a lastvisited property; a visitcount property; a clientind property; a locked-ind property; and a statuscode property.","The user object  contains the user profiles. The users of the present invention are many individuals including the operating organization's employees, client contacts and agency contacts. It may be useful to create a table or other objects to store contacts that are not standard users but who need to be represented in the database, such as agency investigators. The id property contains a database-unique value that uniquely identifies the particular user object (or database table row) within the database. The clienthqid property, if set to, for example, the value 1, identifies a user who is associated with a client, i.e., not an employee. The lastname property contains the user's last name, e.g., \u201cHowser.\u201d Similarly, the firstname and middlename properties contain the user's first, e.g., \u201cDoogie,\u201d and middle names, e.g., \u201cBartholomew,\u201d respectively. Likewise, the prefix and suffix properties contain the user's prefix, e.g., \u201cDr.\u201d, \u201cMs.\u201d, \u201cMr.\u201d and user's suffix, e.g., \u201cM.D.\u201d, \u201cEsq.\u201d, \u201cJr.\u201d, respectively. The username property contains the user's username, e.g., \u201cdbhowser.\u201d The password property contains the user's password. The employee ind property, if set to, for example, the value 1, indicates that the user is an employee of the operating organization and thus, alleviates the present invention from having to issue, for example, a SQL JOIN statement to an Employee table to determine this fact. Similarly, the clientind property, if set to, for example, the value 1, identifies the user as a client. The email property contains the email address of the user. The lastvisited property contains the date and time of the user's last visit to the present invention, whereas the visitcount property contains the number of sessions on the present invention for this particular user. The locked-ind property, if set to, for example, the value 1, indicates that the user's account has been locked. The statuscode property indicates the status of the particular user with respect to notes and authorization to use various aspects of the present invention.","The activitylog object  has, for example: an activitylogid property; an actoruserid property; an activitydate property; an activityid property; a case-id property; an invoiceid property; an activitydescription property; a timespent property; a billableind property; a tsdescription property; a tstaskcode property; a tsslipid property; an exportedind property; and an exportdate property.","The activitylog object  is a log of all activities which occur in relation to a specified case . Billable entries in this table (where the billableind property is equal to the value 1) are exported to the accounting program for processing. The tsdescription property contains the accounting program description. The tstaskcode property contains the accounting program task code, when the default is equal to, for example, the value 1. The billableind property, when set to, for example, the value 1, indicates that this entry represents billable activity that should be exported to the accounting program. The export date property records the date and time at which the activity log entry was exported to Accounting program. The tsslipid property is uniquely identified in the accounting program via a value of SLPTRANS.RecordID.

The offlineind property, when set to, for example, the value 1, indicates that the \u201cattached\u201d document exists in hardcopy or electronic form for outside the present invention only. The approvalstatusid property contains the code indicating the status of approval. The caseid property contains a database-unique identifier which uniquely identifies the case within the Database of the present invention. The documentid property uniquely identifies the instance of the casedocument object  in the database of the present invention. The lockedind property indicates that the case can no longer be modified. Finally, the dateapproved property contains the date the document received approval by the client. This date-approved property indicates complete approval, i.e., all client representatives who are designated to approve a particular document have done so.","Operation of the Present Invention","In operation, the present invention can be accessed by a user on a client device such as a telephone, facsimile machine, email, company intranet, or via a wide area network such as the WWW of the Internet. While the present invention is accessible from the client devices mentioned above, the below explanation assumes that the user (Complainant) is accessing the present invention through the WWW. It should be noted that any other device that is capable of communicating with the server via a standardized protocol, such as TCP\/IP, WAP, Bluetooth, or other protocol can be used as a client device and enable interaction with the present invention.","In the examples that follow, the user is accessing the present invention through a web browser on a personal computer that is connected to the Internet. The user designates the URL of the company intranet or web site that acts as a portal or interface for the user and the present invention. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the user is challenged to authenticate himself or herself. The authentication is accomplished by having the user enter a username and password. Once the user is authenticated to the present invention, the user is free to use the services of the present invention. It is contemplated with the present invention that access to the server may be accomplished by a proxy, such as an employee of the employer's human resources department. In such a scenario, the present invention may be enabled to restrict some, none, or all of the user's information stored on the present invention from the proxy, depending upon the requirements of the situation. While web-based examples are illustrated, other types of client devices, such as telephone and facsimile machines, are equally useful with the present invention.","In the preferred embodiment, the user is first presented with a welcome page that contains announcements, information regarding the user's case status, and one or more navigation aids. At this point, the user has several options, all accessible via navigation hyperlinks. The following example is illustrative of various tasks that may be accomplished by the present invention.","Adding a Calendar Event","The present invention is equipped with a calendar option that utilizes one or more of the objects in the alert distribution module  (see ). To enter a calendar event, the user first gains access to the present invention through the authentication\/authorization procedures, typically through a device such as personal computer . On the web page retrieved by server , a hyperlink to the calendar feature can be selected by the user. A Hyper Text Markup Language (\u201cHTML\u201d) form is then presented to the user, who then inputs the appropriate data and submits the form for processing by the server, e.g., server  of .","Generally, data between the objects of the present invention and the data stored on the various database, either the databases of the present invention, or other database, are synchronized on a periodic, or on an as-needed basis. Other tasks or activities that can be accomplished by the present invention include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n","Workflow","The following description and accompanying drawings illustrate the preferred methods of the present invention. While an order of steps is described herein, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that many of the steps described herein may be reordered without effect to the useful result of the present invention. Consequently, the order to the steps described herein are intended as a guide and not as a specific requirement of the order of steps.","The lifecycle of a typical case is illustrated in . The method starts generally at step . It should be noted that at any step within the method illustrated in , the case may settle, be reassigned, be closed by the client or be queried for a status check. In any one of those four instances mentioned previously, the method illustrated in  would immediately halt and execution would resume within the sub-methods for settling, reassigning, closing, or checking status. In the case of checking status, however, execution could resume at the point where the status check was called.","In the method according to , the case is received in step . Next, case-related objects, such as the case object , the user object , etc., are instantiated and appropriate records committed to the database  and\/or , in step .","The purpose of the method illustrated in  is to depict the flow of business activity required to process complaints and agency charges with the operating organization. The business activity being accomplished via the present invention enables the receipt of a complaint or charge through any of the communications mechanisms supported by the present invention, including, but not limited to: telephone, facsimile and\/or email.","Once the claim is submitted, a case object  (see ) is created in the database of the present invention and displayed for review, typically by the management of the operating organization. Eventually, the case is assigned to a Consultant who is generally (although is not required to be) employed by the operating organization. The Consultant subsequently performs a review, investigation, and prepares one or more reports for the client of the operating organization (typically, the employer of the Complainant). The various reports can then be reviewed and\/or approved by the client or local\/state\/federal agencies. The objects within the database of the present invention facilitate the storage, categorization, searching, and retrieval of the various documents used in the investigation and reporting. The objects and methods of the present invention also enable automatic docketing of various events and can generate, automatically, many of the reports as well as file (electronically) certain formal documents or reports to governmental agencies so that those government agencies will render their opinions and\/or rulings. The Consultant then monitors and coordinates the complaint or charge case activities until the case is closed, i.e., the casestatusid property of the particular instance of the case object  is set to \u201cClosed.\u201d","In step , a new case object  is instantiated. This new object represents a submitted claim that is ready to be assigned and investigated within the present invention. In this step, case object  is the primary object; however, one or more related objects are also instantiated in order to capture and process related case information.  contains examples of objects that are set up for case status and tracking tasks. For example, in addition to the case object , a user , an employee object , an activityjog object , an activity object , a casecalendar object , a casestatus object , a content object , a casenote object , a settlement object , a relatedcase object , an employeestatus object , a casetype object , and a tecounter object  are also instantiated.","The intake module  (see ) may have other critical objects that are also generally instantiated upon the creation of a new case, such as: a complaint object , a submissiontype object , a charge object , a casebasis object , a basis object , an agency object , an agencycontact object , an address object , a caseissue object , and an issue object . Other objects in other modules, such as the client information module  (see ), and the Accounting module  (see ) are other modules (among others) that have new objects instantiated upon the creation of a new case.","Thereafter, in step , a management review is conducted and one or more personnel are assigned to the case. Once the personnel are designated, appropriate objects, such as employee object  (see ) are instantiated and appropriate records committed to the database  and\/or . Next, in step , an initial case review is conducted by a consultant. Then, in step , a detailed case review is performed. Next, in step , the case is investigated. In some cases, one or more reports can be prepared, using, for instance, report object . Thereafter, in step , post-response activities (\u201cPRA\u201d) are performed. The case is then closed in step  and the method ends generally at step .","The purpose of the close case flow diagram of  is to depict the flow of activities required by a Consultant to close a case in the present invention. The method of the present invention for closing an internal case requires that the Consultant conduct an exit interview if that particular client's protocol so mandates. The case closure of external cases may be through a settlement or dismissal with the Complainant in order to inform the Complainant of the final decision by the Client, Commission or Court. The case closure may be through a settlement or dismissal. Once a settlement decision has been determined, the closing of a case in the present invention requires several steps that involve the use of several objects within the database of the present invention.","In order to prohibit modification of documents in or for closed cases, the casestatusid property of the case object  may to be set to the \u201cCLOSE\u201d value. Once locked, any attempts to update or add new attachments to the case will be rejected. A user attempting to modify the case after closure will be notified that the case has been closed and locked from further changes. The present invention notifies all interested client personnel, the Consultant of the operating organization, and optionally, a Director of the operating organization that the case is closed.","Closing of a case will often affect those objects associated with the instance of the case object  that represents the case in question. For example, the status or disposition of instances of the casestatus object , the user object , the usertype object , a status-history object , and a settlement object  may also be affected. Similarly, other objects in other modules may also be affected by the change of status of the case object .","The method illustrated in  starts generally at step . A check is made at step  to determine whether an exit interview is required. If so, an exit interview is conducted in step  and the case is then closed in step . If no exit interview is required because the case is external or the client does not require one, execution continues to step . If so, then step  is executed where a status property of, for example, the case object  that creates the association with the casestatus object  (see ), is set to indicate that the case was settled. Otherwise, execution continues to step , where a check is made to determine whether the case was dismissed. If so, then step  is executed where a property of, for example, the casestatus object , is set to indicate that the case was dismissed. Steps  and  can encompass a variety of scenarios. The closure substatus of a case can differ depending upon the reasons for the closing of the case. For example, the case may be settled, in which case the substatus can be set to \u201cSETTLED.\u201d Similarly, the substatus may be set to \u201cCLOSED BY CLIENT\u201d or \u201cDISMISSED.\u201d Even a \u201cDISMISSED\u201d setting can have additional explanation, such as \u201cno cause,\u201d \u201cright to sue upon request,\u201d \u201cadministrative closure,\u201d or \u201cfailure of conciliation,\u201d depending upon the circumstances. The present invention has the flexibility and capacity to record this type of information, which is useful for compiling statistical information regarding a company's compliance or effectiveness of given laws and\/or regulations.","If step  is negative, step  is executed where a property of, for example, the casestatus object , is set to indicate that the case was simply closed and the method ends generally for all scenarios at step .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0263","num":"0293"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},"The method illustrated in  begins generally at step . When the user first sends an access request signal through a client device to the network  of the present invention (see ), the user is challenged to provide (login) with, for example, a username and password to verify his\/her identity (authentication), step . A check is made to determine whether or not the response from the user to the challenge was successful, step . If the response did not match an authenticated user, then an error message is displayed to the user in step  and execution resumes back at step , providing the user with another opportunity to login. If the response from the user matches, for example, the username\/password of an authenticated user, then that user is granted access to the network  of the present invention and provided with an entry screen depending upon the level of authorization as described below.","In step , a check is made to determine if the user to the system is an employee of the organization that operates the present invention (the \u201coperating organization\u201d, e.g., an organization that conducts the investigations). If so, then step  is executed, where the user is presented with the home page of the organization that owns the site. Otherwise, a check is made in step  to determine if the user is a Complainant. If so, step  is executed, where the user is presented with a home page relevant to Complainants in general, and optionally includes information that pertains to his\/her case in particular. Otherwise, step  is executed, where a check is made to determine if the user is a representative of the owning organization's client (i.e., client representative). If not, an error message is displayed to the user, step , and the user is given an opportunity to re-authenticate, step . Otherwise, i.e., the answer to step  was positive, then the server will return a page designed for the client, step . Once the pages have been returned (rendered) by the server, the method ends generally at step .","A detailed explanation of step  is provided to illustrate one of many features of the present invention. Step  represents the present invention's method of displaying relevant information that is necessary for the Complainant, for example, to electronically submit a new complaint, to view their employer's relevant policies, and\/or to view the status of a previous complaint that is stored within the database of the present invention. In the process of viewing documents, it is typical for the particular case object  to be referenced. The case object  will have links and associations with other instantiations of objects, such as casedocument , that contains information about the document desired to be viewed by the user. Similarly, the casestatus object  that is associated with the particular case object  (of the user's case) will also contain information that the user may wish to view. Other objects within one or more modules  (see ) of the present invention, may be similarly accessed. Still other objects may affect control over one or more relevant object instances in order to govern the amount or type of information accessible by the user based on role information stored by, for example, the userrole object  and the role object .","Once the claim is submitted by the Complainant, the case manager will then proceed with case setup for further review and assignment to a Consultant for investigation. Once the case is under investigation the Complainant may return to his\/her home page within the present invention in order to check the status of that case.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0268","num":"0298"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},"The method of  starts generally at step . First, the case object  is placed into \u201cmonitor\u201d mode in step , preferably by setting a property, such as the casesubstatusid property to indicate monitor mode.","In step , the case is placed in monitor mode for base-lining case progress and setting follow up reminders on the case calendar automatically by the present invention. Upon choosing the monitor case option, all of the case documentation or other artifacts will be locked in order to prohibit modification. Then the casestatusid property of the particular case object  will be set (updated) to \u201cMONITOR.\u201d The present invention also notifies all interested client personnel, SJBC Consultant and SJBC Director that the case is being monitored. The names and addresses of those individuals involved are stored within specific object instances that are related to the specific case object  (see ) within the database of the present invention. For example, a user object  that is associated with the case object  may have a clientind property value set to indicate that the user represented by the user object  is a member of the client's organization for which a specific clientcontact object  (see ) will have been instantiated. Information about clientcontact's organization is stored in a clienthq object  (see ) associated with both the user object  and the clientcontact object . Similarly, address information for the client contact (and\/or his\/her organization) is stored in an address object  (see ).","The Consultant may, using the objects in the alert module  of the present invention, proceed to schedule follow up reminders on the calendar of the present invention based on the client-required frequency. When calendaring an event, the Consultant will create and update a follow up event to include date, time, type, title and description that are modeled with objects within the present invention. The Consultant is also able to correspond with the client and other appropriate users via the present invention by, for example, email, telephone (VoIP), etc. As a starting point, correspondence is performed through pre-defined templates, such as those defined in an instance of the correspondencetemplate  (see ) that is associated with, for example, the a casetype object  that is itself associated with the case object  (see ) that are stored within the present invention. Typically, the Consultant modifies the template content as necessary and the present invention sends notification via email to selected recipients. Actual content is never sent over the Internet; instead, the notification will contain a secure URL to the correspondence that is stored within the database of the present invention. The notification recipient may then gain access to the present invention and view the correspondence in question.","Next, in step , the activities of various agencies (designated in the objects of the agency module  of ) are coordinated. In step , a check is made to determine if an RFI has been submitted by an agency. If so, then a reply to the RFI is prepared in step  and execution is looped back to step . Otherwise (i.e., the result of step  is negative), execution moves forward to step , where a check is made to determine whether an agency has made a cause finding or issued a dismissal. If the result of step  is negative, then the dismissal is processed in step . However, if there is a cause finding by the agency (i.e., the result of step  is positive), then execution continues to step , wherein a determination about the case is received from, for example, an external organization such as a government agency or outside investigator. Next, step  is performed, where a reconsideration may optionally be requested by filing a motion to reconsider. In step , a check is made to determine whether the motion for reconsideration was accepted. If so, then the case is dismissed and the dismissal is processed in step  as illustrated in . If the motion to reconsider was not granted, then there is an opportunity to settle the case. Thus, in step , a check is made to determine if the case was settled. If not, the case is either dismissed or there was a failure to conciliate so the case is processed as a dismissal in step . Otherwise, the case is settled in step .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0273","num":"0303"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},"The method for settling a case is illustrated in . The method starts generally at step .

Next, the settlement is negotiated in step . Thereafter, settlement documents are drafted and\/or edited in step .","Step  is an iterative method to draft separate document settlements for approval of all parties in the settlement process. One or more Consultants draft and\/or edit settlement documents for review by the client and attach these documents to the particular case within the present invention.

The accounting department will be provided with the necessary case information (stored in, for example, the case object ) to enable them to set up a new case in the accounting program (such as TIMESLIPS) for case tracking, client invoicing and payment history. The automatic notification of the accounting personnel is facilitated by objects within the present invention, such as user object , employee object  and address object  that are associated with the particular case object  and store personnel-specific information. The particular alerting event is controlled by, for example, an alert object  that is associated with a rolealert object  (and a role object  and userrole object  that is associated with the particular user object  mentioned above). The alert object then issues the email message that is sent, via the e-mail server  (see ) to a client device  such as PDA  via the network  (see ).","The notification  itself indicates that a new client\/case has been set-up in the present invention and indicates that a similar set-up should be accomplished within the external accounting program.

The notification itself alerts an accounting assistant , which may be a human being or may instead be an automated process with limited intelligence. As with the main process of the present invention, the external accounting system determines whether or not the client identified in the message  is a new client. If so, a client record is created in the external accounting program . Next, in step , the case identified in the message  is set-up in the external accounting program.
