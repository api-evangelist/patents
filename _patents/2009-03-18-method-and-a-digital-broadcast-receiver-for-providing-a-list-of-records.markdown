{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2008-0025339, filed on Mar. 19, 2008, which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a method for providing a list of records in a digital broadcast receiver and a digital broadcast receiver for providing a list of records, and more particularly, to a digital broadcast receiver for providing a list of specific records among records stored in a storage medium to an application and a method thereof.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","A broadcast wave transmitted from a broadcasting station includes various contents such as video, audio and application programs. The data broadcast standard for receiving such a broadcast wave and executing the application programs synchronized with video and audio has been developed and managed. Such a data broadcast standard can implement a variety of supplementary functions as well as a function for providing video and audio, when transmitted application programs are received and are loaded to a terminal and the loaded application programs are executed.","For example, a set-top-box is a terminal for supporting such a data broadcast standard. In the set-top-box, Java-based data broadcast middleware for porting a Java virtual machine on a device driver and supporting an application programming interface (API) using the Java virtual machine is implemented. Multiple system operators (MSOs) can easily manufacture application programs for servicing digital video recorders (DVRs), electronic program guides (EPGs) or the like using the Java API provided by the data broadcast middleware implemented in the set-top-box. When the application programs manufactured by the MSOs are transmitted via broadcast streams, the application programs are executed on the data broadcast middleware of the set-top-box.","Among the data broadcast standards, a \u201cGlobally Executable Multimedia Home Platform (GEM)\u201d includes only most common contents, and an \u201cOpenCable Application Platform (OCAP)\u201d is the standard obtained by extending the GEM to a cable broadcast environment and is mainly used in North America. These two standards have extended standards for respectively supporting DVRs, such as \u201cDVB Digital Recording Extension to GEM\u201d and \u201cOCAP Extension: OCAP Digital Video Recorder\u201d.","The DVR is a function to record current broadcast contents and allowing the broadcast contents to be watched later or a function to perform functions such as rewind, pause and so on with respect to a real-time broadcast. In order to use the DVR function, the middleware of the set-top-box should support a DVR-extended API of each standard. The MSOs should provide an application using the DVR API.","Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a method for providing a list of records in a digital broadcast receiver, and a digital broadcast receiver for providing a list of records that substantially obviate one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.","An object of the present invention is to provide a method for providing a list of records in a digital broadcast receiver, and a digital broadcast receiver for providing a list of records, which are capable of supporting the easy manufacture of an application for providing a list of records satisfying a specific condition among stored records.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for providing a list of records in a digital broadcast receiver, and a digital broadcast receiver for providing a list of records, which are capable of supporting the easy manufacture of an application for providing a list of record series among stored records.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for providing a list of records in a digital broadcast receiver, and a digital broadcast receiver for providing a list of records, which are capable of rapidly and easily detecting a list of records satisfying a specific condition among stored records according to the OCAP standard.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for providing a list of records in a digital broadcast receiver, and a digital broadcast receiver for providing a list of records, which are capable of rapidly and easily detecting a list of record series among stored records according to the OCAP standard.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a computer-readable recording medium having recorded thereon a program for executing a method for providing a list of records on a computer.","Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.","To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a method for providing a list of records in a digital broadcast receiver, the method includes receiving a list request for requesting a list of record series belonging to a series from a data broadcast-associated application, generating a list for including the record series, selecting a record from records included in a list of stored records based on a link between the series and the record and including the selected record in the generated list, and transmitting the generated list to the data broadcast-associated application.","In addition, the link may be a link between an object for managing the series and an object for managing the record. Herein, the object for managing the series may be a ParentRecordingRequest object. Also, the object for managing the record may be a RecordingRequest object. Also, the link may be an inheritance relationship between the object for managing the series and the object for managing the record.","In addition, the link may be a link between an attribute value of the series and an attribute value of the record. Herein, the attribute value may include at least one of information for identifying a record and guide information of a record. Also the attribute value may include at least one of title information, kind information, genre information, producer information, actor information, and reproduction time information of a record.","In addition, the list of stored records may be a RecordingList including a RecordingRequest object.","In addition, the list of stored records may be a list of programs which are stored by the digital broadcast receiver.","In addition, the series may be a set of programs which are broadcasted in series.","In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a digital broadcast receiver for providing a list of records, the digital broadcast receiver includes a reception unit configured to receive a broadcast signal including a data broadcast-associated application, a storage medium configured to store records, and a controller configured to manage the application, receive a list request for requesting a list of record series belonging to a series from the application, generate a list, select a record from a list of the stored records based on a link between the series and the record, include the selected record in the generated list, and transmit the generated list to the application.","In addition, the link may be a link between an object for managing the series and an object for managing the record. Herein the object for managing the series may be a ParentRecordingRequest object. Also, the object for managing the record may be a RecordingRequest object. Also, the link may be an inheritance relationship between the object for managing the series and the object for managing the record.","In addition, the link may be a link between an attribute value of the series and an attribute value of the record.

Also, the attribute value may include at least one of title information, kind information, genre information, producer information, actor information, and reproduction time information of a record.","In addition, the list of the stored records may be a RecordingList including a RecordingRequest object.","According to a method for providing a list of records in a digital broadcast receiver, and a digital broadcast receiver for providing a list of records according to the present invention, since the list of records satisfying a specific condition among the list of stored records is provided via the interface module, multiple system operators (MSOs) can easily and simply manufacture an application capable of displaying the list of records satisfying the specific condition, such as a record series, among the list of records stored in a broadcast receiver, and a user can easily search and classify the records stored in the broadcast receiver via the application and conveniently search for a desired record. In particular, even when the user does not know the individual names of the records which are recorded as the record series, the user can rapidly and easily search for the list of records which are recorded as the series, by one command.","In addition, since a SeriesRecordingFilter class which inherits a RecordingListFilter class is added according to the OCAP standard without correcting the existing OCAP standard such that the provision of the list of records belonging to a specific record series among the list of stored records, it is possible to easily increase the completion degree of the OCAP standard.","In addition, since the records are filtered based on the link between the objects of the list of stored records or the link between the attributes of the stored records, a separate storage space does not need to be allocated and filtering can be performed by a simple comparison operation. Thus, it is possible to rapidly detect and provide the list of records satisfying the specific condition among the stored records.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description of the present invention are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.","Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.","Hereinafter, the exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. The configuration and action of the present invention shown in the drawings and described with reference to the drawings will be described as at least one embodiment; however, the technical idea and the core configuration and action of the present invention are not limited thereto.","Although the terms used in the present invention are selected from generally known and used terms, terms used herein may be variable depending on operator's intention or customs in the art, appearance of a new technology, or the like. In addition, some of the terms mentioned in the description of the present invention have been selected by the applicant at his or her discretion, the detailed meanings of which are described in relevant parts of the description herein. Furthermore, it is required that the present invention is understood, not simply by the actual terms used but by the meanings of each term lying within.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Referring to , the broadcast receiver  includes applications  and , a middleware , an operating system  and a hardware .","The middleware  plays a role for mediating data between the applications  and  and the operating system . In addition, the middleware  performs a function for receiving requests of the applications  and , executing the received requests, calculating results for the received requests, and transmitting the calculated results to the applications  and . The middleware  includes a connection unit  and an engine .","The connection unit  performs an interface function for transmitting or receiving data, information and a command between the engine  and the application . That is, the application  may use a service provided by the middleware  via the connection unit . A request mode for requesting a specific service provided by the middleware  is defined in each broadcast standard such that a manufacturer of the application  can use the middleware . If the application  requests the middleware  to perform a specific service according to a request mode defined in each broadcast standard, the connection unit  receives the request for performing of the specific service and delivers the request for the performing of the specific service to the engine  such that the engine  performs the requested specific service.","An example of the request mode for requesting a specific service provided by the middleware  defined in the broadcast standard may include an application programming interface (API) defined by JAVA, and the kinds of the API include a AWT API, a HAVi API, a JavaTV API, a DVR API, and a DVR API. An application manufacturer may develop the application  based on the API defined in the broadcast standard.","If the request mode for requesting the specific service is defined by the API, the connection unit  mediates the application  and the engine  such that, when the application  calls a specific API, the engine  performs the specific service for the specific API. In such a case, the connection unit  can provide or support various APIs such as a AWT connection unit , a HAVi API , a JavaTV API  and a DVR API .","The engine  performs a service according to the request transmitted from the connection unit  and provides the result to the connection unit . The engine  includes an AWT , a HAVi , a Java TV  and a DVR . The AWT , the HAVi , the Java TV  and the DVR  are specific service modules, which are respectively executed when the AWT connection unit , the HAVi API , the JavaTV API  and the DVR API  are called, and transmit or receive data to or from another service module or controls and operates the hardware to perform a specific service.","The middleware  may be, for example, an OpenCable Application Platform (OCAP), and the application  may be, for example, an OCAP application.","The OCAP is a data broadcast-associated application platform employed in an open cable scheme, and provides a high-level service to the applications  and  using a hardware resource and an operating system.","In addition, the engine  may include an execution engine and a presentation engine. The execution engine analyzes and executes an application prepared by Java, and the representation engine analyzes and executes an application prepared by a hyper text markup language (HTML). For example, an OCAP-J (Java) application is performed by the execution engine.","In the below-described other embodiments as well as the first embodiment, for ease of description and convenience of understanding, it is assumed that the application associated with the data broadcast is the OCAP application. Accordingly, the range of the present invention is not limited to the OCAP data broadcast standard and is applicable to the other data broadcast standards, which will become apparent from claims of the present specification.","For example, the present invention is applicable to a data broadcast using terrestrial waves or satellites as well as cables. That is, the broadcast receiver  according to the present invention allows a user to operate a \u201cTV\/Video\u201d button of a local key or a remote controller such that a terrestrial broadcast mode (antenna), a satellite broadcast mode, a cable broadcast mode (cable), a video 1, a video 2 or the like is input.","The application is classified into a data broadcast-associated application  and a native application .","The data broadcast-associated application  uses the connection unit  in order to utilize hardware resources. That is, by allowing the data broadcast-associated application  to utilize the hardware resources via the connection unit  without directly treating the hardware resources, compatibility between the application  and the hardware  is maintained. For compatibility of the data broadcast-associated application , the middleware  separates the data broadcast-associated application  from the hardware .","The data broadcast-associated application  refers to software which operates based on an execution environment defined in the engine  and the connection unit  and, due to this reason, may be also called an OCAP application.","The data broadcast-associated application  includes a bound application , an unbound application , and a monitor application .","The bound application  is an application associated with a currently tuned channel or bound to a tuned channel, and includes, for example, games, information services and so on. At this time, if channel switching occurs and the application is not associated with a newly tuned channel, the bound application  is finished. That is, the bound application  is started in a specific channel and, if the channel is switched to another channel, the bound application  is finished.","The unbound application  is an application which is not bound to a specific channel, and includes, for example, an Electronic Program Guide (EPG) , a Video On Demand (VOD) , a Watch TV (), an E-mail chatting, a game, a web browser, a Personal Video Recorder (PVR) and so on. The unbound application  is downloaded and stored or updated when the broadcast receiver  is booted, and is started and finished regardless of a viewed channel.","The EPG  may include a Watch TV program property for performing most basic functions of the broadcast receiver, such as channel up\/down and so on, as well as a general TV guide function. Furthermore, a service such as pay-per-view may be performed using the EPG.","The VOD  performs a general VOD function. For example, the VOD performs a function such as a Real VOD (RVOD), a Near VOD (NVOD), or the like. If a hard disc is present, the VOD may be implemented using the hard disc.","The Watch TV  is a program to perform a basic operation for watching TV. The Watch TV performs an operation similar to a function performed by the existing native application.","The monitor application  is service operation software using the API defined in the OCAP standard and can adjust the start and the end of the other applications. That is, the monitor application  is a special unbound application which is manufactured according to the purpose of a multiple system operator (MSO), and an API (for example, the rebooting of the broadcast receiver , the report of an error, or the like) which can be used by only the monitor application  is provided to the monitor application . In addition, the monitor application  can adjust the resources of the broadcast receiver , such as a memory and so on, when a collision between various applications occurs, and exercise a preferential control right with respect to substantially all functions of the broadcast receiver .","The monitor application  may control channel management and a cablecard function. That is, the basic channel switching and operation of a host into which a cablecard is inserted are basically controlled by the monitor application . In addition, the monitor application  may download and execute applications for the driving of the broadcast receiver  or the supplementary services (EPG, VOD or the like).","For example, in a data broadcast mode, when the operating system  sends a channel switching key input from an input device such as a remote controller to the middleware , the monitor application  executes the change of the states of various other applications associated with the channel switching, and executes the pause and end of the bound application  dedicated to the channel, according to the channel switching key received from the middleware .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"110"},"Referring to , the data broadcast-associated application  may be implemented by a Java application. If the data broadcast-associated application  is implemented by the Java application, the broadcast receiver  according to the present invention may download and install the implemented Java application (Xlet) from a broadcasting station. The downloaded Java application (Xlet) has a life cycle.","The downloaded Java application (Xlet) is initialized after being loaded () in a memory. After the downloaded Java application is initialized, the application becomes a paused state . Thereafter, the downloaded Java application (Xlet) is started by itself or by another Xlet and becomes an active state (). The downloaded Java application (Xlet) may become the paused state () or a destroyed state () by itself or by another Xlet even in the active state.","At this time, in order to allow another Xlet to set this specific Xlet to the paused state () or the destroyed state (), a pause or a stop function should be called via an org.dvb.application.AppProxy object.","The org.dvb.application.AppProxy object determines whether or not the called application has a right for the pause, destroy or stop of the application, and, if the called application does not have the right, an error occurs. The org.dvb.application.AppProxy object is not software which is transmitted and downloaded by an MSO or the like, but is software which is installed by a TV manufacturer before shipment of a TV receiver.","The native application  performs a general function for receiving a digital broadcast signal, demultiplexing video and audio information and the other broadcast program information (EPG) from the received digital broadcast signal, and implementing the information on a device. That is, the native application  is an application associated with the basic function, and is installed before shipment of the broadcast receiver .","The native application  may communicate with the middleware  and the application , and an example of a communication method may include, for example, a Java Native Interface (JNI). The JNI is an interface which is necessary when a program prepared by Java uses software prepared by C or C++ language or a program prepared by C or C++ language uses software prepared by Java, and is supported by a Java virtual machine .","The hardware  is also called a host device hardware, includes a set-top-box and a cablecard, and is generally set by a TV manufacturer upon initial production. In addition, the hardware  may further include a hard disc . The hard disc may be an internal hard disc or an external hard disc connected by a parallel port or a USB port.","The cablecard is a security function and a conditional access function separated from the set-top-box and is also called a Point of Deployment (POD) module. For example, a PCMCIA card is used as the cablecard. The set-top-box into which the cablecard is inserted is also called a host. For example, a digital built-in TV or a digital ready TV corresponds to the host. The set-top-box includes a tuner , a video decoder , an audio decoder  and graphics (OSD) .","The operating system  manages or controls the hardware , the middleware  and the applications  and , and performs an interface function between the hardware  and the middleware . In the operating system , a device driver  for driving the hardware such as the tuner , the video decoder , the audio decoder  and so on may be installed, a Java virtual machine  for executing a Java program may be installed, and the other software  may be installed. As the operating system , a general-purpose operating system such as Windows, Windows NT, Linux, Unix, OS\/2, MAC OS or the like may be used, and an operating system which is obtained by correcting the general-purpose operating system or is newly developed as a dedicated operating system of the broadcast receiver  according to the present invention may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"Referring to , the broadcast receiver  according to the present invention includes a tuner , a demodulating unit , a demultiplexer , an audio decoder , a video decoder , a native TV application manager , a channel manager , a channel map , a first memory , an SI and\/or data decoder , a second memory , a system manager , a data broadcasting application manager , a storage controller , and a third memory . The first memory  is a non-volatile memory (NVRAM) (or a flash memory), and the third memory  is a mass storage device such as a hard disc drive (HDD) or a memory chip. The native TV application manager  is a component corresponding to the native application , the system manager  and the data broadcasting application manager  are components corresponding to the monitor application , and the channel manager  and the storage controller  are components corresponding to the middleware . The third memory  is a component corresponding to the hard disc .","The tuner  tunes into the frequency of a specific channel via any one of an antenna, a cable and a satellite, down-converts a signal into an intermediate frequency (IF) signal, and outputs the IF signal to the demodulating unit . At this time, the tuner  is controlled by the channel manager  and reports the result and the strength of the broadcast signal of the tuned channel to the channel manager .","Data received with the frequency of the specific channel may include audio data and video data. Such audio data and video data are compressed by various types of encoders and are transmitted from a broadcasting station. In this case, a receiver includes the audio decoder  and the video decoder  in correspondence with the encoder used for compression, and the audio data and the video data are respectively decoded by the decoders  and  and video and audio are provided to a user. An encoding\/decoding scheme for the audio data includes, for example, AC 3, MPEG 2 AUDIO, MPEG 4 AUDIO, AAC, AAC+, HE AAC, AAC SBR, MPEG-Surround, and BSAC, and an encoding\/decoding scheme for the video data includes, for example, MPEG 2 VIDEO, MPEG 4 VIDEO, H.264, SVC, and VC-1.","According to the embodiments, data for a data service, for example, data for a Java application, data for a HTML application and data for an XML may be received. Such data for the data service may be Java class files for the Java application or a URL file indicating the locations of such files. In addition, the data for the data service may be audio files or video files used in respective applications. According to the embodiments, the received data may be metadata. Such metadata may be, for example, described by an XML and be transmitted via a DSM-CC protocol.","A broadcast service which can be provided using the received data includes, but not limited to, a weather service, a traffic service, a stock service, a viewer participation quiz program, a real-time public-opinion poll, an interactive type education broadcast, a game service, an information provision service for a drama synopsis, characters, background music and a photo place, an information provision service for a score of a sports event and a profile and a record of a player, a service for production information and the order thereof, an information provision service for a program according to media, times, or theme.","The demodulating unit  performs demodulation and channel equalization with respect to the signal output from the tuner  and outputs the demodulated signal to the demultiplexer  in the unit of TS packets.","The storage controller  is interfaced with the demultiplexer  and controls instant recording, reserve recording, time shift of broadcasting contents, or the like. For example, when any one of the instant recording, the reserve recording and the time shift is set in the broadcast receiver  according to the present invention, the broadcasting contents input to the demultiplexer  are stored in the third memory  under the control of the storage controller . The third memory  may be divided into a temporary memory region for a time shift function and\/or a permanent memory region for permanently storing data according to the selection of the user.","If the reproduction of the data stored in the third memory  is necessary, the storage controller  reads the data stored in the third memory  and outputs the data to the demultiplexer .","At this time, since the storage capacity of the third memory  is restricted, for efficiency of the storage capacity, the storage controller  stores the data, which is input in a state of being compressed and encoded, in the third memory , without conversion, in one embodiment of the present invention. In this case, the data read from the third memory  according to a reproduction command is input to the decoder via the demultiplexer  and is restored to an original state.","In addition, the storage controller  may control play, fast forward, rewind, slow motion, instant replay or the like of the data which is stored in the third memory  or is currently being buffered. The instant replay is a function for repeatedly viewing a scene which is desired to be viewed again and the instant replay may be performed with respect to data which is received in real time as well as the stored data, in association with the time shift function.","The storage controller  may compress and encode input data and store the data in the third memory  if the input data is analog type data, for example, if a transmission scheme is NTSC, PAL or the like. The storage controller  may include an encoder, and the encoder may be implemented by at least one of software and hardware. The encoder may be implemented by an MPEG encoder as one embodiment of the present invention. The encoder may be included on the outside of the storage controller .","Meanwhile, the storage controller  may scramble (or encrypt) the input data and store the scrambled data in the third memory , in order to prevent the data from being illegally copied when the input data is stored in the third memory . In this case, the storage controller  may include a scrambling algorithm for scrambling the data stored in the third memory  and a descrambling algorithm for descrambling (or decrypting) the data read from the third memory . As the scrambling method, data to be scrambled may be modified using any key (e.g., a control word) or a method of mixing signals may be used.","The demultiplexer  receives real-time contents output from the demodulating unit  or data read from the third memory  and performs demultiplexing.","The demultiplexer  demultiplexes data and a system information (SI) table for a data service from input data packets under the control of the SI and\/or data decoder . The demultiplexed data and SI table are output to the SI and\/or data decoder  in the form of a section.","In order to retrieve and decode data for the data service from a channel, SI is necessary. Such SI is also called service information, if necessary. The SI may include channel information, event information, and so on.","Although program specific information\/program and system information protocol (PSI\/PSIP) is used as the SI in the embodiment of the present invention, the present invention is not limited to this. That is, a protocol which transmits the SI in a table format is applicable to the present invention regardless of the name thereof.","The PSI is an MPEG-2 system standard defined for classifying channels and programs, and the PSIP is the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) standard which can classify channels and programs. As one embodiment of the present invention, the PSI may include a Program Association Table (PAT), a Conditional Access Table (CAT), a Program Map Table (PMT) and a Network Information Table (NIT).","The PAT corresponds to special information that is transmitted by a data packet having a PID of \u201c0\u201d. The PAT transmits PID information of the PMT and PID information of the NIT corresponding to each program. The CAT transmits information on a pay broadcast system used by a transmitter. The PMT transmits PID information of a transport stream (TS) packet, in which program identification numbers and individual bit sequences of video and audio data configuring a program are transmitted, and the PID information, in which PCR is transmitted. The NIT transmits information of the actual transmission network.","The PSIP may include, for example, a Virtual Channel Table (VCT), a System Time Table (STT), a Rating Region Table (RRT), an Extended Text Table (ETT), a Direct Channel Change Table (DCCT), a Direct Channel Change Selection Code Table (DCCSCT), an Event Information Table (EIT), and a Master Guide Table (MGT).","The VCT transmits information about a virtual channel, for example, channel information for selecting a channel and information about a packet identifier (PID) for receiving audio and\/or video data. That is, when the VCT is parsed, a channel name, a channel number, and the PID of the audio and the video data of a broadcasting program carried in the channel can be known.","The data for the data service detected by the demultiplexer  based on the SI, for example, the data for the application may be stored in the second memory  by the SI and\/or data decoder .","The SI and\/or data decoder  collects sections having the same table identifier (table_id) and configures and parses a table, and stores SI, which is the parsed result, in the second memory .","At this time, the SI and\/or data decoder  reads and stores all actual section data portions, which are not section-filtered by the demultiplexer  upon parsing, in the second memory . The second memory  is a table and data\/object carousel database for storing service data parsed from a DSM-CC section and SI parsed from the table.","It is determined whether one table includes one section or a plurality sections, from a table_id field, a section_number field, and a last_section_number field of the table. For example, when only TS packets having the PID of the VCT are collected, a section is configured and, when sections having table identifiers allocated to the VCT are collected, the VCT is configured.","When the VCT is parsed, information about a virtual channel in which data is transmitted can be obtained.","According to the present invention, the SI and\/or data decoder  parses an SLD of the VCT and transmits stream type information of corresponding elementary streams to the audio decoder  or the video decoder . In this case, the audio decoder  or the video decoder  performs an audio or video decoding operation using the transmitted stream type information.","According to the present invention, the SI and\/or data decoder  parses an AC-3 audio descriptor, an MPEG 2 audio descriptor, an MPEG 4 audio descriptor, an AAC descriptor, an AAC+ descriptor, a HE AAC descriptor, an AAC SBR descriptor, an MPEG surround descriptor, a BSAC descriptor, an MPEG 2 video descriptor, an MPEG 4 video descriptor, a H.264 descriptor, a SVC descriptor, and a VC-1 descriptor of an event information table (EIT), and transmits audio or video codec information of a corresponding event to the audio decoder  or the video decoder . In this case, the audio decoder  or the video decoder  performs an audio or video decoding operation using the transmitted audio or video codec information.","Application identification information, service component identification information and service information of the data service acquired by the SI and\/or data decoder  may be stored in the second memory  or may be output to the data broadcasting application manager .","The application identification information, the service component identification information and the service information may be referred to for decoding the data for the data service or may be used for preparing the driving of the application program for the data service in advance.","The SI and\/or data decoder  may control the demultiplexing of an SI table which is information associated with a channel and an event and transmit an A\/V PID list to the channel manager .","The channel manager  may request the SI and\/or data decoder  to receive a system-associated information table by referring to the channel map , and receive the result.

That is, the descramblers  and  may be included in the module or the broadcast receiver in the form of hardware, middleware or software, and may be included in both or any one of the module and the broadcast receiver.","If the descramblers  and  are included in the broadcast receiver, it is advantageous that the transmitter (including at least one of a service provider and a broadcasting station) scrambles data by the same scrambling method and transmits the scrambled data.","If the descramblers  and  are included in the external module, it is advantageous that the data is scrambled by different scrambling methods according to the transmitters and the scrambled data is transmitted. In this case, since the broadcast receiver may not include the descrambling algorithms of the transmitters, it is possible to simplify and downsize the broadcast receiver. Accordingly, in this case, the external module may become a main body for providing functions for various services to be provided to the user and a CA function exclusively provided by each of the transmitters.","The CI performs communication between various types of external modules and the system manager  in the broadcast receiver by a single mode. In addition, since the broadcast receiver  are simultaneously connected to one or more modules for providing different services and are operated, the broadcast receiver has a structure in which a plurality of modules and the system manager  are connected to each other.","A CI protocol between the broadcast receiver  and the external module includes a function for periodically checking the state of a counterpart in order to maintain normal communication. The broadcast receiver  and the module include a function for managing the state of the counterpart using such a function, reporting malfunction to the user or the transmitter when the malfunction occurs in any one of the broadcast receiver and the module, and recovering the malfunction.","As another embodiment, the authentication process may be performed in software, instead of in hardware.","That is, when a memory card in which CAS software is previously stored by downloading is inserted, the broadcast receiver  receives and loads the CAS software from the memory card, and performs the authentication process. In one embodiment of the present invention, the CAS software read from the memory card is installed in the first memory  of the broadcast receiver  and is driven as one application. In particular, in one embodiment of the present invention, the CAS software is installed based on the middleware and is executed. In addition, a Java middleware is used as the middleware.","The broadcast receiver  may include the CI, for connection to the memory card. The first memory  may include a volatile memory, a non-volatile memory and a flash memory (or a flash ROM). At this time, the memory card mainly uses a flash memory or a small-sized hard disc. The memory card may be used by at least one broadcast receiver  according to the contents, authentication, scrambling, and charging method of the stored CAS software.","However, the CAS software should include at least information necessary for authentication and information necessary for descrambling.","Accordingly, the authentication unit  performs the authentication process between the transmitter and the broadcast receiver  and between the broadcast receiver  and the memory card. At this time, similar to the above description, the memory card is entitled to reception, and may include information about the authenticable normal broadcast receiver . For example, the information about the broadcast receiver  may include identification information such as a serial number standardized with respect to the broadcast receiver. Accordingly, the authentication unit  may perform the authentication process between the memory card and the broadcast receiver  by comparing the identification information such as the standardized serial number included in the memory card with the identification information of the broadcast receiver.","When the CAS software is operated based on the Java middleware, first, the authentication process between the broadcast receiver  and the memory card is performed. For example, it is checked whether or not the identifier of the broadcast receiver  included in the CAS software and the identifier of the broadcast receiver  read from the system manager  of the broadcast receiver  are identical and, if the identifiers are identical, it is checked that the memory card is the normal memory card which is available in the broadcast receiver . At this time, the CAS software may be installed in the first memory  before shipment of the broadcast receiver  or may be downloaded from the transmitter, the module or the memory card to the first memory . Then, the descrambling function may be operated as one application by the data broadcasting application manager .","Thereafter, the CAS software parses EMM\/ECM packets output from the demultiplexer , checks whether or not the receiver is entitled to reception, and obtains and provides information (that is, the CW) necessary for descrambling to the descramblers  and . That is, the CAS software operated based on the Java middleware reads the identifier of the broadcast receiver from the broadcast receiver , compares the read identifier with the identifier of the broadcast receiver  transmitted by the EMM, and checks whether or not the broadcast receiver  is entitled to reception.","If it is checked that the broadcast receiver  is entitled to reception, then it is checked whether or not the broadcast receiver  is entitled to reception of the broadcasting service, using the broadcasting service information transmitted by the ECM and the entitlement of the broadcasting service. If it is checked that the broadcast receiver is entitled to the reception of the broadcasting service, the encrypted CW transmitted by the ECM is decrypted using the authentication key transmitted by the EMM and the decrypted CW is output to the descramblers  and . The descramblers  and  descramble the broadcasting service using the CW.","The CAS software stored in the memory card is extensible according to a pay service provided by the broadcasting station. The CAS software may include other supplementary information as well as information associated with the authentication and descrambling.","The broadcast receiver  may download the CAS software from the transmitter and upgrade the CAS software stored in the memory card.","In the present invention, if only the external memory interface is provided regardless of the type of the broadcast receiver, the CAS system is implemented in a manner of satisfying all memory cards which are detachably provided to the broadcast receiver , such that a maximum function is implemented in the broadcast receiver  capable of receiving the pay broadcasting contents such as broadcasts with minimum cost, and various types of broadcast receivers  may be used.","In an implementation mode, since only a minimum API is implemented, a burden of a manufacturer of the broadcast receiver  is minimized and a portion depending on the CAS manufacturer can be eliminated. Accordingly, cost consumed for establishing the CAS device of the transmitter and the operating system can be minimized.","The descramblers  and  may be included in the module in the form of in software or hardware. In this case, the received scrambled data may be descrambled and decoded by the module.","If the received scrambled data is stored in the third memory , the scrambled data may be descrambled and stored or the scrambled data may be stored without conversion and be descrambled upon reproduction. If the scrambling\/descrambling algorithm is included in the storage controller , the storage controller  may scramble the received scrambled data again and may store the scrambled data in the third memory .","As another embodiment, the descrambled (conditional access) broadcasting contents are transmitted over a broadcasting network, and information associated with the authentication and descrambling, for removing the conditional access, is transmitted or received via the communication module  such that bidirectional communication is possible in the broadcast receiver .","The broadcast receiver  delivers or receives the ID such as the MAC address or the serial number of the broadcast receiver to or from the communication module of the transmitter such that the transmitter recognizes the broadcasting contents which are transmitted to or received from the remote transmitter or the broadcast receiver  for transmitting the broadcasting contents.","The communication module  of the broadcast receiver  provides a protocol necessary for performing the bidirectional communication with the communication module of the transmitter in the broadcast receiver  which does not support the bidirectional communication function.","The broadcast receiver  configures a protocol data unit (PDU) using a tag-length-value (TLV) coding method including data to be transmitted and an ID. A tag field includes indexing of the PDU, a length field includes the length of a value field, and the value field includes actual data to be transmitted and the ID of the broadcast receiver .","If the broadcast receiver  installs a Java platform and operates the platform after downloading a Java application of the transmitter to the broadcast receiver  over a network, a structure for downloading the PDU including a tag field, which is arbitrarily defined by the transmitter, to the storage medium of the broadcast receiver  and transmitting the PDU to the communication module  is also possible.","In this case, the PDU may be configured in the Java application of the broadcast receiver  and be output to the communication module . Alternatively, the Java application may transmit a tag value, actual data to be transmitted and the ID of the broadcast receiver, and the PDU may be configured in the broadcast receiver  by the TLV coding method.","Such a structure has an advantage that, although data (or an application) desired by the transmitter is added, the firmware of the broadcast receiver  does not need to be changed.","At this time, the communication module of the transmitter transmits the PDU received from the broadcast receiver  over a wireless data network or configures data received over the network to a PDU and transmits the PDU to the broadcast receiver . At this time, the communication module of the transmitter may include the ID (e.g., an IP address or the like) of the remote transmitter when the PDU to be transmitted to the broadcast receiver  is configured.","At this time, the broadcast receiver  may include the CI and include a wireless local area network (LAN), a portable Internet, Wibro, WiMAX or the like which can be connected via a WAP, a CDMA 1\u00d7EV-DO, and an access point accessed by a mobile communication base station such as CDMA, GSM or the like, in the transmission or reception using the wireless data network. The above-described broadcast receiver  does not have a communication function. In the broadcast receiver  having the communication function, the communication function  is unnecessary.","The broadcasting contents transmitted or received over the wireless data network may include data necessary for performing the CA function.","The demultiplexer  receives real-time contents output from the demodulating unit  or reproduction contents read from the third memory  and performs demultiplexing.","The first descrambler  receives the demultiplexed signal from the demultiplexer  and descrambles the demultiplexed signal. At this time, the first descrambler  may receive data necessary for descrambling and the authenticated result from the authentication unit  and use them for descrambling.","The audio decoder  and the video decoder  receive the descrambled signal from the first descrambler , decode the descrambled signal and output the decoded signal, or decode a signal, which is output without being descrambled by the first descrambler , and output the decoded signal. In this case, the second descrambler  descrambles the decoded signal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0245","num":"0244"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},"Referring to , a cable broadcast receiver  includes a host  and a cablecard . The cablecard  may be attached to or detached from the host  and is one of a single (S) card which can process a single stream or a multi (M) card which can process multi streams.","The host  may receive only a cable broadcast or receive at least one of a cable broadcast, a terrestrial broadcast or a satellite broadcast. The host  includes a first tuner , a second tuner , a first demodulating unit , a multiplexer , a demultiplexer , a decoder , a second demodulating unit (data-over-cable service interface specifications (DOCSIS)) , a third tuner , a switching unit , a modulating unit , a controller , an OCAP memory controller , and a memory .","A bidirectional communication mode between a cable broadcast receiver  and a headend includes two modes: an out of band (OOB) mode and a DOCSIS settop gateway (DSG) mode. Accordingly, a viewer may select and view a desired program via the host  using any one of the two modes. Alternatively, the viewer may directly participate in a broadcasting program and select and view necessary information. A data broadcasting service may be provided via the OOB mode and\/or the DSG mode.","The first tuner tunes into only a specific channel frequency of a cable audio\/video (A\/V) broadcast signal transmitted in-band via a cable or a terrestrial A\/V broadcast signal transmitted via an antenna, and outputs the tuned signal to the first modulating unit .","The terrestrial broadcast and the cable broadcast signal are different from each other in a transport mode. The first demodulating unit  can perform different demodulating methods with respect to the signals which are different in the transport mode. For example, the terrestrial A\/V broadcast which is transmitted in a state of being modulated by a Vestigial Sideband Modulation (VSB) scheme is demodulated in a manner inverse to the VSB method. The cable A\/V broadcast which is transmitted in a state of being modulated by a Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) scheme is demodulated in a manner inverse to the QAM scheme.","The signal demodulated by the first demodulating unit  is output and is multiplexed by the multiplexer  such that streams are output. At this time, if a plurality of in-band tuners for receiving the cable A\/V broadcast is included and different channels are simultaneously tuned by the in-band tuners and are demodulated by respective demodulating units such that multi streams are output, the multi streams are multiplexed by the multiplexer  to output the multiplexed signal.","If the signal demodulated by the first demodulating unit  is the streams of the terrestrial broadcast, the demodulated streams are output to the demultiplexer  via the multiplexer . In contrast, if the signal demodulated by the first demodulating unit  is the streams of the cable broadcast, the demodulated streams are output to the demultiplexer  via the multiplexer  and the cablecard  mounted in a slot. The cablecard  includes a conditional access (CA) system for preventing illegal copy of higher value-added broadcasting contents and restricting access to the contents, which is also called a Point Of Deployment (POD).","If the single stream or the multi streams of the cable broadcast output from the multiplexer  is scrambled, the cablecard  descrambles the single stream or the multi streams and outputs the descrambled streams to the demultiplexer . If the cablecard  is not mounted, the signal streams or the multi streams of the cable broadcast demodulated by the first demodulating unit  is directly output to the demultiplexer . In this case, since the scrambled cable signal is not descrambled, the signal is not normally displayed on the screen.","The demultiplexer  demultiplexes the received broadcasting streams into audio, video, and data streams, and outputs the streams to the demodulator . The decoder  may include an audio decoder, a video decoder, and a data decoder. That is, the audio streams demultiplexed by the demultiplexer  are decoded by the audio decoder, the video streams are decoded by the video decoder, and the data streams are decoded by the data decoder.","The second tuner tunes into a specific channel frequency of the data broadcast transmitted via the cable in the DSG mode, and outputs the tuned signal to the second demodulating unit . The second demodulating unit  demodulates the data broadcast of the DSG mode and outputs the demodulated broadcast signal to the controller .","The third tuner  tunes into a specific channel frequency of a downlink data broadcast transmitted via the cable in the OOB mode, and outputs the tuned signal to the cablecard .","If bidirectional communication between the headend and the broadcast receiver  is possible, uplink information (e.g. pay program application, diagnostic information of the host, or the like) transmitted from the broadcast receiver  to the headend may be transmitted in the OOB mode or the DSG mode. Accordingly, the embodiment of the broadcast receiver according to the present invention may include the switching unit  so as to select any one of the OOB mode and the DSG mode and transmit the information.","In the OOB mode, user information or system diagnostic information is output to the modulating unit  via the cablecard  and the switching unit , and the modulating unit  modulates the signal output from the switching unit  using a Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation scheme and transmits the modulated signal to the headend via the cable. If the broadcasting information of the user is transmitted in the DSG mode, the broadcasting information of the user is output to the modulating unit  via the controller  and the switching unit , and is transmitted to the headend via the cable after being modulated by the modulating unit  using a QAM-16 modulation scheme.","The controller  may perform a DVR function using the storage medium  as a storage unit. That is, the controller  may perform a personal video recorder (PVR) based on the storage medium  and store records in the storage medium . The controller  may set a \u201ctime-shift buffer\u201d in the storage medium  in order to perform a time shift function.
